dubai every year a growing number of people leave their homes and families behind in pursuit of the proverbial greener pastures as of the latest count approximately 258 million individuals are living outside their country of birth and an estimated 2 7 million have found their second home in the uae people move overseas for many reasons and chief among them is the desire to get out of poverty and provide financial support to their families by sending money home but not everyone who lands a job overseas ends up in the six figure salary range hundreds of thousands of them are stuck in menial jobs that pay only dh500 to dh 5 000 per month these are the expatriates working as labourers janitors secretaries receptionists waiters and waitresses blue collar workers in al barsha remittance to developing countries mark nearly 90 percent of total outflow globally image credit anjana kumar gulf news yet somehow despite how little cash many of them may get every payday some are still able to turn their lives around for the better migration for money every year a growing number of people leave their homes and families behind in pursuit of the proverbial greener pastures abroad 258 million individuals are living outside their country of birth 2 7 million of them have found their second home in the uae part of the reason is that the uae dirham is pegged to the us dollar and the income earned by expatriates gets a purchasing power boost once they re sent to destinations with weaker domestic currencies pakistani blue collar worker bhakth ali says his lifestyle has improved thanks to increased savings in dubai anjana kumar gulf news and with the american greenback appreciating against both developed market and emerging market currencies a huge number of migrant workers in the uae get to enjoy more remittance strength 2 7 million numbers of expatriates living in the uae the higher the us dollar gets the higher value in their local currency foreign workers transfer back home a money exchange centre in abu dhabi remittance flows are expected to continue to increase in most recipient countries in india remittances are larger than the earnings from it exports image credit ahmed kutty gulf news archives here s how expats in the uae were able to build their dream homes from office boy to landlord ajit a bangladeshi national started working as an office boy in dubai in 2005 he brought home dh1 500 paycheque each month today about 14 years into his migrant life in the uae the father of two is a proud owner of a parcel of land in his hometown and he is close to finishing his four storey building once completed he intends to rent out some commercial spaces to tenants in his hometown part of the money used in the ambitious project was raised through a loan he took out from a local bank in dubai but he would not have been able to progress the project sooner if not for the favourable exchange rates with his home currency trading poorly against the us dollar ajit is able to send nearly 23 000 bangladeshi takas per dh1 000 dirham before when i was just starting out in dubai one dirham was only equivalent to 17 or 16 takas now it has tremendously gone up in value and my capacity to send money home has likewise strengthened the expat said a domestic help with 10 times more her peer s salary back home nepali domestic worker in dubai naanu thapar is taking care of her parents and paying for her daughters education with her salary image credit supplied nanu thapa 46 from nepal has been living in dubai for the last 11 years she earns a salary of dh2 000 and in nepalese rupee npr this translates to npr 60 700 she works as a domestic help for a european household back in nepal a domestic worker barely earns npr5 000 to npr6 000 so you can imagine how lucky she feels to be earning a package ten times more than her counterpart in nepal dh2 000 monthly salary of nepalese domestic helper nanu thapa equivalent to npr60 700 about 10x the salary of her local counterparts sure there is hard work here but take this everything she earns goes into her pocket besides her personal expenses like toiletries and clothes shopping the rest is taken care of by her employer whether it is her travel expenses or medical she pays nothing else for herself so what has she done with all this money i send home everything my father takes care of my finances and he is allocating them to meet some major expenses for example my older daughter who is 23 years of age is studying nursing nursing is a very expensive course in nepal i pay npr 30 000 a month for her fees my younger daughter is in high school and i am taking care of her education as well besides i send my parents money so they can lead a good life naanu thapar s elder daughter left is able to do a nursing course in nepal all thanks to her mother s income image credit supplied impact on nepalese rupee according to abdel kareem alkayed country head of uae exchange the ongoing indian elections is likely to impact the nepali rupee are said to have an impact on the nepali rupee the decline of the nepalese rupee npr can be attributed to the fact that the currency is pegged against the indian rupee inr which has had a very turbulent 2018 due to the rising crude oil prices nepal s widening trade deficit has also weighed in heavy on its depreciating currency noted alkayed on the upside the recent decline of the currency can help boost the local economy as tourism from western countries is expected to rise along with an increase in remittances sent by nepali diaspora around the world the upcoming indian general elections and its impact on the inr could also impact the kingdom s currency over the years a number of currencies in asia have plummeted against the american greenback the rupee alone suffered a massive erosion in value in the last two decades particularly last year when it plunged to fresh record lows and breached the 20 barrier versus the uae dirham owing in part to the downward spiral of indian equity markets from an economic perspective the gyrations can impact the import industry in these countries a struggling domestic currency means it will be more expensive for the local residents to buy imported goods but for the expatriates it means they get to send more money out of the same amount of salary the lower exchange rate will also boost tourism as for expats they stand to gain on the amount they are remitting back home due to favourable exchange rates sudhesh giriyan coo of xpress money said earlier a man counts indian rupees at a money exchange in dubai image credit gulf news archives remittance outflows as home currencies fall remittance outflows conversely rise 529 b about dh1 9 trillion is the value of cash remitted by migrants from around

income countries jumped by nine per cent to 529 billion dh1 9 trillion in 2018 and nearly half of that landed in five countries india philippines egypt china and mexico expatriates in the uae transfer billions of dirhams to their home countries each year image credit file photo within south asia including ajit s home country local currencies have been depreciating three to six per cent every year among the worst hit is the indian rupee which nosedived by 50 to 60 per cent in the last 20 years according to retiring president of uae exchange sudhir shetty in 1991 for example when i came to the uae a dirham fetched five indian rupees rs5 today it is hovering around 20 the currency has dipped four folds shetty said over a period of time these currencies have depreciated as they needed to adjust to the inflation prevailing in these countries the biggest beneficiaries of course have been the non resident indians besides taking advantage of any personal salary gains they have tremendously benefited from their currency devaluation he added y sudhir kumar shetty former president of the uae exchange who is going back to settle in india after living here in uae around 35 years image credit ahmed kutty gulf news lives improved and as the currencies continued to fall against the dirham and us dollar people s lives have improved in the past years expats living in the uae for example their saving potential increased compared to what is back home if this was not the case they would not be living here said shetty their increased purchasing power has also helped them lead a better life and offer better opportunities for loved ones education for example is something that blue collar workers overseas have focused on giving their loved ones their first priority is educating children and helping them build a better life for themselves doubling the salary aniya barcelona left a government office job in the philippines that paid approximately dh900 in 2013 when she landed in dubai she managed to secure a rank and file role that offered dh2 500 per month more than double her previous income back home her salary as a social media executive gradually increased over the next few years until it hit dh5 000 at current exchange rates that would make her earn about 70 000 pesos back home a pay that s not even enjoyed by an entry level chief financial officer cfo in the philippines dh5 000 monthly salary earned in the uae by filipina aniya barcelona a social media executive equivalent to about php70 000 and since she makes it a point not to touch more than half of her income every month she s managed to build up a saving of 100 000 pesos in the last three months alone all the hard work buoyed by a depreciating peso paid off recently she completed the renovation of her house in the philippines where her mother currently lives in the better exchange rates actually help back when i was just starting a career in the uae in 2013 or 2015 the peso would fetch only 11 or 12 per dirham now it has climbed to 14 and at times it goes up to nearly 15 she said this has really helped me improve our living conditions and at the same time support my parents financially strictly sticking to a saving habit also helped a lot added the 27 year old filipina who confessed to have developed a habit of meticulously writing down every single expense on a monthly basis i make it a point to save 60 to 65 per cent of my salary and this goes into my personal savings back home i also manage to set aside money here for emergency just about dh200 to dh300 per month it can grow in value over time she added however as to whether barcelona and her compatriots in the uae will continue to enjoy higher remittance power over the next few months it remains to be seen some experts can t seem to agree at this point whether the short term outlook holds much optimism for the currency which is pegged to the indian rupee more currency declines more savings another filipina expat raquel contrella 22 who came to work in the uae seven months ago said she is saving far more in the uae than she did back home she has been employed in the administration section of a fitness club the past four months contrella cannot thank her stars enough for her job and the opportunities she has been given the 22 year old who earns dh2 000 a month said she has managed to save dh5 000 in the last four months she has been employed in the uae in philippine peso this amounts to 70 000 i could not have imagined making this kind of money back home said contrella who hails from the province of

school my older siblings work in dubai and together we contribute to the running of the household our income and savings go towards paying the university and school bills as well as towards taking care of our parents outlook expatriates from other countries have also vouched for the positive impact of the stronger us dollar on their purchasing power here s a closer look at how they are taking advantage of the favourable exchange rates in the meantime it s best for expats to take advantage of the favourable exchange rates today rather than wait for further declines vijay valecha chief market analyst at century financial said the currency could be range bound in the near term and it is likely to fluctuate in the 27 90 to 31 90 range for the remainder of the year expatriates can send their money home as the currency is not expected to depreciate further against the uae dirham said valecha future businesswoman tabitha wanjiru 30 a kenyan expatriate is considering starting a business back home she would have never imagined this six years ago when she contemplated leaving her hometown which is close to the capital nairobi this kenyan blue collar is dreaming of starting her

indonesia s new president has spent recent months dancing with k pop bands appearing in motorbike stunts and appointing himself to the avengers to fight trade wars now it s back to the job indonesia s election focused more on personalities and political intrigue than the economy this is a problem risks are rising and indonesia s new financial crisis management framework has serious flaws if jokowi s next term as president is to be successful he d best fix the deficiencies sooner rather than later indonesia has managed a challenging global environment pretty well capital outflows have been relatively low indonesia s stock market has outperformed its peers growth forecasts are stable inflation is low unemployment is below its five year average and the government budget has improved through a smaller deficit and cheaper borrowing costs but despite solid fundamentals our recent survey shows that there are serious risks for indonesia on the horizon the us china trade war is doing some squeezing of its own it is uncertain how the trade war will end but the long term damage it will do to asian trade and supply chains is crystal clear the global policy environment is highly uncertain the 2016 brexit referendum caused volatility in asian financial markets and the probability of a no deal brexit still looms the trump administration continues to weaken the global rules and institutions which have underpinned much of asia s prosperity particularly the world trade organization the imf downgraded its global growth forecasts in january particularly for emerging economies and the advanced economies could soon follow the united states will likely enter recession in 2020 and limited monetary policy space may see the federal reserve return to unconventional monetary policy sending a fresh wave of volatility towards asia while growth has been steady and supported by infrastructure investments and with inflation also under control indonesia nevertheless has challenges at home too sixty per cent of jokowi s infrastructure promises were to be funded by state owned enterprises and the private sector but to date state owned enterprises have funded almost 100 per cent and have become substantially more indebted as a result there are concerns in what has been a relatively stable banking system in the past decade high demand for loans in 2018 and portfolio capital outflow have drained liquidity from indonesia s banks particularly smaller banks increased short term borrowing by non financial corporations and the large stock of government debt held by foreigners similarly creates vulnerabilities the indonesian parliament passed the prevention and resolution of financial system crisis law in 2016 to ensure better cooperation collaboration and preparation between indonesia s regulators and institutions the objective of the new law is commendable but it has serious weaknesses as indonesian policymakers know from experience when a financial crisis hits speed is everything if authorities are slow to act liquidity shortages can become solvency crises banking crises can become currency crises currency crises can become sovereign debt crises and what started as a financial crisis quickly becomes an economic and political crisis staying ahead of the curve is critical indonesia s new law needs improvement a bank suffering a liquidity shortage would ordinarily receive assistance from bank indonesia the central bank under the new law the remedy is not so simple particularly given bank bailouts have now been outlawed the law creates a crisis committee consisting of bank indonesia the financial services authority the deposit insurance agency and the ministry of finance if a troubled bank needs emergency assistance there must be agreement between all four the bank must request assistance the financial services authority must prepare advice for the committee on whether support is necessary all four agencies must agree that liquidity support is appropriate bank indonesia must confirm to the committee that the bank has adequate collateral although not prescribed in law our survey of officials suggests two other steps are likely first the crisis committee would request that other banks in indonesia or foreign parent banks or shareholders provide the assistance rather than bank indonesia historically this has been unsuccessful second there is a high probability that the committee will seek political cover and brief the president directly on the situation seeking presidential approval before any decision is made this process is slow and bureaucratic to say the least why would such a law be created the law s motivation dates back to the government s us 700 million bailout of bank century in 2008 indonesia s then 13th largest bank unexpected losses over the bailout of bank century led to riots outside parliament and numerous investigations against senior policymakers and officials these are real concerns for indonesian policymakers they do not have the legal protections enjoyed by those elsewhere revision of the law is needed to protect officials who are acting in good faith to help officials do their

the divergence thesis that drives our constructive outlook for the dollar received more support last week than we expected a few hours after investors learned that japan s flash pmi remained below the 50 boom bust level europe reported disappointing pmi data as well and a few hours after that the us reported that retail sales surged in march by the most in a year and a half 1 6 this coupled with the new cyclical low in weekly jobless claims boosted gdp forecasts quieted the recession talk with some markets closed on monday the week not only will have a slow start but the potential to change the investment climate is low the us earnings season continues with some favorites like amazon facebook twitter and microsoft on tap boeing also reports and some economists see the grounding of the 737 max and production cuts shaving us q2 gdp by a 0 2 0 3 through slower equipment spending and exports at the end of the week s p reviews greece and italian debt italy s rating will likely be kept at bbb where both moody s and fitch also are there is a reasonable chance that greece s rating is revised up from the current b s p has a positive outlook for greece it would be a catch up move as fitch already put greece at bb last august with a stable outlook we provide a thumbnail sketch of the six events that will command attention two major central banks meet bank of japan and the bank of canada there are two big data points us q1 gdp and australia q1 gdp there are two official events as the uk parliament returns from the vacation and brexit remains the focus though may 2 local elections will steal some attention and us china trade talks resume 1 bank of japan governor kuroda indicated recently that the boj could provide additional easing if the price gains lost momentum this seems to be a bluff for more than a year now kuroda has slowed the pace of bond purchases in fact catching the market by surprise it the boj announced before the weekend that it would reduce the amount of long term bonds it will purchase for the first time in a few months there seems to be little appetite for a deeper cut in the minus 10 bp deposit rate or the zero target of the 10 year benchmark yield capped at 20 bp the japanese economy stagnated in h2 18 and the economy may have contracted in q1 19 the all industries index is a proxy for gdp and after falling by 0 2 in january it is expected to have fallen by 0 1 in february and will be reported before the boj meets exports fell for four consecutive months through march core inflation which the boj targets excludes fresh food stood at 0 8 it peaked at 1 0 last september and october operationally the closure of the local markets and settlement for ten days later this month for the ascension of the new emperor will likely require massive injections of liquidity which could weigh on the yen kuroda wants to project a central bank with tools and will at its disposal but it seems increasingly exhausted the boj may reduce outlook for exports and production trade talks with the us pick up with prime minister abe in washington at the end of next week with finance minister aso north korea s test of a new tactical weapon will likely also be on the agenda 2 bank of canada the neutral stance will be maintained the economic data is sufficiently mixed to allow the officials to be patient and monitor developments extrapolating the overnight swaps index the market is pricing less than a one in five chance of a rate cut in the next six months canada faces two immediate economic challenges first which is well known is the housing market in the toronto and vancouver regions the second is that its non oil exports have fallen to their lowest level in a year with a 4 decline in february overall exports are off 6 from the record highs set last july the new provincial government in alberta will reverse the current policies and boost the output employment growth remains robust averaging 30k over the past six months which is comparable to the us adding 300k a month and nearly twice the 12 month average consumption has softened but gain in february retail sales 0 8 which was twice the median forecast in the bloomberg survey snapped a three month drop 3 us q1 gdp the government shutdown the unusually cold weather and what seems to be a typical pattern for weakness in q1 coupled with the dramatic decline in equity prices in q4 18 and the knock on impact from the wealth effect depressed expectations for growth at the start of the year it looked like the economy was stagnating or worse the inversion of parts of the yield curve was seized upon as further evidence that the end of the expansion was at hand the atlanta fed s gdpnow tracker began the quarter with a 0 3 projection and after the retail sales report stands at 2 8 the median economist forecast according to bloomberg is 2 2 which would match the q4 18 pace some economists have a more dour estimate of 1 5 we are neither as optimistic as the atlanta fed nor as pessimistic as the naysayers our expectation is for around 2 growth the report is released at the end of the week and a few days before the may 1 fomc meeting there is little chance of a change in policy but it would appear that some of the cross currents that had concerned powell co have abated 4 australia q1 cpi the market continues to favor a rate cut by the reserve bank of australia later this year the forward rate implies about a 31 bp easing in rates by year end while the overnight index swaps are consistent with around a 75 chance of a cut yet recent data have been robust with the composite pmi moving back above 50 and full time jobs growth averaging 37k a month in q1 the most since july 2017 chinese officials appear committed to strengthening the economy and australia is often seen as a proxy of sorts for china the quarterly cpi matched the four year peak of 2 1 in q2 18 and has eased since headline cpi is expected to have slowed for its third consecutive quarter in q1 19 prices are expected to have risen by 0 2 in the first three months of the year for a 1 5 year over year pace down from 1 8 in q4 the underlying rates trimmed mean and the weighted median are also expected to have slowed the easing of price pressures gives the rba scope to cut when the economic outlook justifies it based on the current information set we pencil in a cut

the tories have made a mess of brexit from the get go labour s agenda and rhetoric estrange voters and prevents it from truly capitalizing on the situation though some polls have just begun showing labour edging ahead if the uk is to leave the eu their other commitments see good friday agreement circumscribes their degrees of freedom and some form of a customs union arrangement continues to be the most likely meanwhile the uk economy appears to be relatively well employment growth is strong and retail sales jumped 1 1 in march retail sales rose by an average of 0 8 a month in q1 19 after a flat average in q4 18 and a 0 3 average gain in q3 18 the manufacturing sector that is contracting in the eurozone pmi is surging in the uk the 0 9 rise in february manufacturing output followed a 1 1

world s two largest economies us trade representative lighthizer is headed to beijing later this month while vice premier liu will return to the us in early may late may has long been identified as a possible timeframe for the two leaders to meet china has already reportedly stepped up its purchases of soy and swine from the us much of us demands appear to have been agreed upon by china but rather than this being a result of the savvy american negotiators it seems that china was moving in this direction with the help of past american and european pressure as well as most importantly its internal dynamics the dollar depreciated by about 10 against the yuan in 2017 when it fell against most currencies it recouped these losses last year largely in line with its broader performance and returned toward cny7 00 area the yuan has strengthened against the dollar this year its 2 4 appreciation makes it among the strongest currencies in the world behind the russian rouble s 8 8 gain and three latam currencies chilean peso up 4 7 the mexican peso up 4 6 and the colombian peso which has risen 2 8 it is not clear what commitments the us is making treasury secretary mnuchin seemed to accede to the chinese demand that the enforcement mechanism is two way fair equal acknowledging that china may be in its rights to act if the us fails to live up to its commitments that said it might be more convincing for many if lighthizer were to make a similar commitment

last monday was the deadline for filing tax returns in the united states or for procrastinators last monday was the last day to file for an extension the process can be painful both administratively and financially especially when you are called upon not only to assist your adult children with their 1040s but to help them locate the basic documents needed for the task good thing we love them i finished my april labors last weekend and i certainly hope my time and my remittance will prove well spent but the more i think about our government s revenue collection system and the u s federal budget the more i worry here are some cold hard facts about our nation s fiscal process and prospects americans spend an estimated 6 billion hours and 12 billion annually to complete their returns about half of filers use a preparation service even though many have relatively simple tax situations by contrast many other developed countries do the annual tax computations centrally based on income data collected by the government treasury departments in countries including japan and the netherlands send completed returns to taxpayers for a final check which usually takes minutes additional investment in technology by the internal revenue service irs could allow the u s to follow suit a recent report highlighted the antiquated nature of its core systems but irs funding is not

service irs could allow the u s to follow suit a recent report highlighted the antiquated nature of its core systems but irs funding is not a popular item in congress in addition there is an entire industry based on tax compliance that is quite happy with the current system the irs has approximated that about 16 of income taxes owed go uncollected every year this deprives the treasury of 400

outflows from the social security trust fund exceeded inflows for the first time since 1982 current projections show that the fund will be depleted in just 15 years at that point payments will have to be scaled back to equal the money being taken in this will result in about a 20 reduction of benefits for everyone in the program this is a scary prospect given that social security provides 90 of retirement income for about a third of the elderly population bringing things back into balance will require some combination of higher payroll taxes and reduced benefits the latter could be achieved in part by lifting retirement ages but given that there will be a projected 75 million people drawing social security fifteen years from now the politics of cutting benefits will be difficult further complicating the picture is that people are living longer into their retirements drawing annuities for an average of 20 years bringing things back into balance will require some combination of higher payroll taxes and reduced benefits the latter could be achieved in part by lifting retirement ages but given that there will be a projected 75 million people drawing social security fifteen years from

still are prospective costs for government provided health care more than 120 million americans are currently covered by medicare medicaid and other programs and this number is projected to grow rapidly in the coming decades beyond the aging of the population the cost of treatments per patient is also escalating rapidly health care costs in the united states are on an unsustainable trajectory in both the public and private sectors another statistic in this space offers some hope 5 of patients account for 50 of government medical costs a focus on case management for these individuals could yield better outcomes at reduced expense another statistic in this space offers some hope 5 of patients account for 50 of government medical costs a focus on case management for these individuals could yield better outcomes at reduced expense the congressional budget office estimates the u s national debt will grow from its current level of 78 of gross domestic product gdp to 93 of gdp in ten years that would represent a doubling of federal indebtedness in less than twenty years thirty years from now the treasury is projected to owe 150 of american gdp federal indebtedness has only exceeded 100 of gdp once in the nation s history just after world war ii for reference italy s national debt is 130 of gdp greece is at 175 thirty years from now the treasury is projected to owe 150 of american gdp federal indebtedness has only exceeded 100 of gdp once in the nation s history just after world war ii for reference italy s national debt is 130 of gdp greece is at 175 with the rising debt interest on what we owe is projected to triple over the next decade in five years the u s government will be spending more on interest than it does on defense in ten years interest expense will exceed spending on medicaid and that is with fairly settled interest rates interest is an expense category that cannot be cut and its growth has the potential to crowd out investment in things like infrastructure and education more could be said about the alarming state of federal finances but we ll stop there interestingly however the national mood surrounding the subject seems to be relaxed we hear renewed talk about how deficits and debt don t matter and even calls to borrow more aggressively under modern monetary theory to be sure we have yet to feel the consequences of living beyond our means the u s dollar is strong and u s interest rates remain low but there are no assurances these blessings will last forever the federal budget will soon become a battleground the debt ceiling will become binding in mid summer and work on the 2020 budget will reflect the politics of competing priorities short election cycles in this country are ill matched with the long term issues that force tough choices tax filing is a labor that absorbs a short period of time every spring but all of us and our children could be laboring for a long time to dig out from under the debt we are accumulating currency considerations since the second half of 2018 weakening data has led investors across countries and asset classes to fret about the possibility of a global economic slowdown as a result the u s dollar generally considered the global reserve currency has recovered substantial value over the past year the trade weighted broad dollar index has risen 7 9 since april 2018 deteriorating economic conditions in the eurozone uncertainties surrounding brexit and the unresolved trade u s china trade war have all contributed to the shift towards the dollar as a safe haven currency recognizing the deteriorating economic conditions the federal reserve among other major central banks has chosen to delay the monetary policy normalization process we would expect stagnating interest rates to lower the value of the dollar but the currency has defied expectations remaining broadly flat 0 9 on a year to date basis the slight decline can be explained by investors appetite for riskier emerging market assets amid signs of economic stabilization in china the relatively healthy state of the u s economy and higher interest rates vis à vis the other advanced economies have made the dollar more attractive a number of g10 currencies like the euro and yen are carrying negative interest rates the yield on the u s 2 year treasury note is hovering close to 2 4 by comparison germany s and japan s 2 year sovereign yields are in negative territory 0 57 and 0 15 respectively therefore from a cost of funding angle the dollar looks more profitable than some of the other major currencies u s consumers cherish a stronger dollar as it enables them to buy goods from other countries at lower prices on the other hand there are risks associated for the u s corporations particularly those with substantial overseas business a stronger dollar makes american products more expensive for overseas buyers last year several consumer and industrial firms including hasbro harley davidson and procter gamble warned about the impact of a stronger dollar on their performance in this way a stronger greenback leads to wider trade deficits this has worked against president trump s agenda of boosting u s exports and he has voiced his displeasure on march 2 in a reference to the dollar s run he stated i want a strong dollar but i want a dollar that does great for our country not a dollar that s so strong that it makes it prohibitive for us to do business with other nations that is a hard balance to strike a stronger dollar and rising interest rates are a cause of concern particularly for emerging markets that have issued large amounts of foreign debt the increasing cost of servicing dollar denominated debt makes indebted nations with large deficits and low foreign exchange reserves vulnerable to credit rating downgrades and defaults chile and turkey chief among them generally a stronger dollar and rising interest rates lead to an outflow of funds from emerging markets into the u s as investors strive to earn higher yields this situation put several emerging market currencies under stress for most of 2018 as the global economy moves into lower gear central banks including the federal reserve are unlikely to adjust interest rates anytime soon with this pause emerging markets can breathe a sigh of relief and use this window as an opportunity to reduce their imbalances a correction they should have made long ago despite a deteriorating fiscal position see above the u s dollar is likely to remain strong u s growth and u s markets are likely to sustain good performance especially relative to other developed countries this will be a headwind for u s exporters and an ongoing concern for emerging markets who are struggling to get their fiscal houses in order throwing the book as we contemplate the costs of government one growing item should distress everyone incarceration the united states leads the world in its rate of imprisonment and it s an expensive habit at any given time 2 3 million americans are in custody at an average cost of 36 000 per year per prisoner the prison population has grown due to measures popular among voters habitual offender statutes like the 1994 three strikes law requires a life sentence for anyone convicted of three federal crimes if at least one was violent the war on drugs set high minimum sentences for narcotics convictions politicians find ready support for tough on crime platforms but the costs are massive and the benefits hard to measure those who serve their time face an impaired future most will endure long bouts of unemployment or underemployment hiring managers are suspicious of hiring ex cons and entire employment sectors like education law enforcement and pharmaceuticals are entirely off limits to ex felons in most states former inmates are often left with few above board options and an increasing temptation to return to criminal activity leading back to prison the damage to a person s net worth from time in prison is permanent and can span generations the road to reform will be long but the journey has started the 2018 first step act eased minimum sentences and amended the federal three strikes law to a mandatory sentence of 25 years instead of life harsh sentences for crack cocaine possession have been retroactively reduced and inmates have been given more rights to job training and family visitation first step is indeed a good first step but it is limited to federal jails the majority of convicts are in state and local custody and each jurisdiction must consider its own path to reform inmates cannot vote which will slow efforts for reform but the high rate of imprisonment is a deadweight loss to convicts and society that continues even after terms are served

the global economic slowdown and slow growth in key export markets such as the usa and europe will have a negative impact on sri lanka s export growth this year a top economist told business observer last week he said the slowdown in economic growth in major markets will have adverse repercussions for trade with emerging markets which depend heavily on developed economies for exports the international monetary fund imf in its world economic outlook released recently cut global growth forecast for 2019 to 3 3 percent from 3 5 percent economists say slower global growth will have macro economic implications for developing economies national economic council of sri lanka secretary general and chief economist prof lalith samarakoon said the slowdown in export growth in sri lanka would mean lower foreign exchange earnings which will exert pressure on the balance of payment bop and the exchange rate of the country the tough times for sri lanka in the months ahead due to slower global economic growth is very clear investments in export oriented investments will slowdown creating pressure on employment slowdown in exports could ultimately dampen the income growth of the people and the aggregate demand in consumption it is a clear sequence of events that we need to take a close look at and act before things get out of control prof samarakoon said he said the slowdown in global economic growth could be predicated on global events such as trade protectionism where the us and china are embroiled in a trade war and the us is considering imposing tariffs amounting to us 11 billion on imports from europe which is grappling with the brexit issue a key factor impacting growth in trade in the eu the us and chinese economies are expected to slowdown this year growth in the us is expected to be around two percent though the federal reserve has forecast 2 1 percent and the imf 1 9 percent inflation in the us is running below its target of two percent given the expected economic slowdown and continued low inflation the fed has put a halt on rate hikes growth in europe a vital part of the global economy as forecast by the imf is expected to be around 1 6 percent this year primarily due to the persistent deterioration in external demand caused by the us china trade dispute and emerging markets slowdown inflation in europe is running at 1 4 percent which is expected to be around 1 6 percent in 2021 the european central banks will maintain an accommodative monetary policy due to lower growth and lower inflation sri lanka must be mindful that it has foreign currency debt servicing payments amounting to us 5 9 billion this year which will have to be serviced through international capital markets of the total repayment us 2 4 billion was raised in march this year through international sovereign bonds isbs prof samarakoon said adding that however we still have a large amount of foreign currency denominated refinancing to be done while lower global interest rates and increased appetite for emerging market debt will help sri lanka to access international markets at reasonable rates this favourable situation may not last beyond the first half of the year because any resolution of the trade dispute between the us and china and an orderly brexit will increase the growth expectations in major economies resulting in higher interest rates added to this will be the policy and political uncertainties sri lanka will inevitably face in the latter part of the year due to the election cycle which will increase the risk premium demanded by foreign investors in sri lankan bonds it is likely that as forecast global oil prices which are around us 72 a barrel will reach around 80 a barrel by mid this year exerting further pressure on the exchange rate and the bop therefore sri lanka is likely to face a challenging macroeconomic scenario in the latter half of the year fuelled by global and domestic political and economic uncertainties thus it is better to tap international markets now to service foreign debt than wait till the latter half of the year when global interest rates and sri lanka s risk premium might go up due to the local political and economic uncertainties prof samarakoon said

foreign currency and fuel coupled with a spike in prices of everything including staple food the rise in prices of basic commodities and services first became evident in september 2018 when government

reality where the premium between the usd and local currency widens daily what has made the problem more complex and volatile is the fact that while prices continue to skyrocket salaries have remained stagnant or moved insignificantly in the case of the public service this has eroded the people s buying power along with the standard of living by widening levels government s recent attempts at

prices of everything including staple food the rise in prices of basic commodities and services first became evident in september 2018 when government put in place a raft of monetary measures that included the separation of accounts and the introduction of a punitive 2 tax regime in february government removed the long rejected 1 1 fictitious rate between the usd and rtgs currency and put in place a formal albeit still unrealistic interbank market where the usd can trade with the rtgs but still failed to fend off the parallel market s brutal reality where the premium between the usd and local currency widens daily what has made the problem more complex and volatile is the fact that while prices continue to skyrocket salaries have remained stagnant or moved insignificantly in the case of the public service this has eroded the people s buying power along with the standard of living by widening levels government s recent attempts at pleasing the workers by increasing salaries by just over rtgs 100 were trashed by the ever rising prices including the massive hike in the bread price last week products were last week being priced according to the parallel market exchange of rtgs 5 us 1 seen as the true rate while salaries based off government s official annual inflation rate of 66 8 bread which rose from rtgs 0 90 at the time president emmerson mnangagwa seized power end of 2017 to rtgs 3 50 last week seems to be inching closer to its us 0 90 value which at today s parallel market rate would be nearly rtgs 5 inevitably other commodity prices have taken the same trajectory leaving the consumers facing an unaffordable shopping basket for instance sugar has gone up sharply to rtgs 5 20 from 1 80 for a 2kg pocket while a 2kg pocket of flour now sells for rtgs 7 from about 3 a 10kg packet of mealie meal 1 litre of fresh milk 2kg flour 2kg packed chicken have also shot up to rtgs 13 rtgs 3 40 rtgs 7 and rtgs 17 respectively zimbabwe congress of trade unions president peter mutasa said the working population both formal and informal was the hardest hit while farmers and even students had borne the brunt of the spiralling economy the impact of the economic crisis has hit hard on these groups there is no one listening to our alternative voice we need to address the toxic political environment we must deal with corruption cronyism nepotism and the capture of the state which is the biggest issue we are not poor in terms of resources but we are poor in terms of stewardship said mutasa we need to deal with cartels that have captured the state we need genuine dialogue we need to adhere to the kadoma declaration that deals with the rule of law and independence of institutions there is no country that will prosper through brutalising its citizens like what we witnessed in january this year without addressing the economic challenges the country is experiencing those in power need to address problems citizens won t continue to be cowed into submission national consumer rights association advocacy and campaign advisor effie ncube said prices hikes over the past several months had effectively wiped out savings of senior citizens and the salaries of employed consumers we are deeply disturbed and angered by the recent wave of devastating price hikes of basic commodities like bread we therefore call upon government and business to bear in mind that over 90 of consumers are unemployed and less than 10 who are employed have had no salary raises in years in fact the unrestrained hikes in prices over the past several months have effectively wiped out savings of senior citizens and the salaries of employed consumers he said there is an urgent and pressing need to arrest the situation before it triggers social and political instability as ultimately the buck stops with government the state of the economy is terrible and it is government that is responsible for managing the affairs of the country and shaping underlying economic fundamentals that inform productivity and pricing both mutasa and ncube may be on to something as explained by american and british headquartered financial services firm fitch solutions in their april 2019 southern african report at fitch solutions we expect political risk to remain elevated with the possibility of further substantial protests the fitch report on zimbabwe reads mnangagwa faces growing threats to his authority with little room for manoeuvre in the current environment of rising social unrest and narrowing macroeconomic buffers the government s hard line response to protests and strikes risks entrenching opposition but any move to reverse fuel price hikes or acquiesce to demands for substantial pay increases or increased use of us dollars would likely be perceived as weakness by protesters and potentially the president s military backers fitch solution continued to state that while mnangagwa would remain in office the risk of some form of regime change had increased substantially in recent weeks using the old method of calculating annual inflation the current 66 8 translated to 166 putting zimbabwe in hyperinflationary mode this has been driven by price hikes as business endeavoured to benchmark their prices to the usd parallel market rate after government introduced the rtgs dollar in february through statutory instrument 33 of 2019 telecommunication companies have also hiked their tariffs and schools have communicated that they would be increasing school fees next term worsening matters for the public exacerbating matters further government removed grain subsidies on april 9 which although meant to save money saw increased prices for major food and cash crops in that regard a tonne of maize is now pegged at rtgs 726 and wheat rtgs 1 089 69 from 390 and 500 respectively the livestock industry says under the circumstances of unaffordable stock feed shortages of pork chicken and beef were imminent at a recent meeting held by the confederation of zimbabwe industries the livestock and meat advisory council lmac cautioned that the viability of the industry was under threat because the cost of livestock feed had become unsustainable confederation of zimbabwe industries president sifelani jabangwe said prices were following policy pronouncements by government unfortunately the prices are going up due to the cost pressures that are affecting producers for example when new producer prices of wheat were announced prices of wheat immediately went up for bread makers prices have been responding to government policy announcements for instance the increase of fuel and the 2 tax another dynamic is the exchange rate which has been going up we are not sure why it s trekking upwards yet normally we get stability in foreign exchange during the tobacco selling season jabangwe said economist john robertson blamed government s unbridled expenditure which has seen the accumulation of virtual money against real money we see this as inevitable as we have seen a collapse of discipline in government through printing money and the issuance of treasury bills we now have billions of rtgs balances not backed by real money or production we have virtual money and it s the cause of inflation he said we need investors to come and increase production efficiency but they don t have confidence in government due to the high cost of doing business through licences fees and kickbacks ncube said as an organisation they condemned the culture of rampant profiteering and speculative pricing that some businesses were engaged in this behaviour is one of the causes of the hikes ncube said the hikes will deeply undermine the food and nutritional security of households most likely leading to a rise in food deficiency diseases especially and particularly affected will be child headed families orphans and vulnerable children senior citizens and those who require adequate and balanced nutrition in order to take medicines for chronic illnesses like tb and hiv aids whether government likes to admit it or not poverty levels are now on the rise the united nations last month estimated that a total of 5 3 million zimbabweans would need food aid with over 1 5 million of them being in the urban areas driving the hunger further is the 2018 19 drought that government was grossly unprepared for which has severely affected all of zimbabwe s cash and food crops
the pound to euro exchange rate is 0 05 higher 1 15606 today the pound to us dollar exchange rate is 0 02 higher 1 29958 today it s easter monday today in much of the world markets will be closed in australia new zealand germany and britain among other countries analyst marshall gittler chief strategist head of education at acls global brings you the weekly outlook for april 22 27 weekly outlook you know how sometimes you have a constant pain somewhere for so long that you almost forget about it and all of a sudden it s gone and you realize once again what a pain it was or a steady ringing in your ears stops how about the dog next door barking constantly and suddenly it stops and you realize how quiet the neighborhood is that s how i felt during the week just ending the first week in months with no brexit noise unfortunately this isn t going to last of course the first hurdle is whether britain will field candidates for the european election that s going to start from march 23rd there are more hurdles after that i m sure we ll hear more and more and more and while it s starting to seem less likely that britain crashes out without any agreement the alternative seems to be a general election at which the labour party under the appalling jeremy corbyn has a good chance of getting in brexit corbyn gbp parity party i was in new york this week talking with reporters who asked thought provoking questions what are the big themes in the market nowadays week gone by china s global influence grows volatility falls this got me thinking a bit further beyond just what happened this week or is going to happen next week i settled on three points the growing influence of china on the global economy in general and fx market specifically we could observe that wednesday of course when the q1 gdp and march industrial production beat expectations aud went soaring as a direct result and was the best performing g10 currency that day but we can see it also in the overall movement of the market think of how many central banks have mentioned china either indirectly e g the fomc referred to readings on financial and international developments and the ecb mentioned vulnerabilities in emerging markets or directly e g the rba explicitly discussed the china economy while much of the turnaround in the treasury market in january and the change in attitude towards risk assets was no doubt due to the change in the fomc s tone to one of patience there was also a simultaneous turnaround in china that improved the global outlook analysts certainly have to pay as much attention nowadays to chinese economic indicators as to those of other major countries advertisement above us treasury vs china 10 year yields monetary policy convergence immediately following the 2008 global financial crisis all central banks cut their policy rates sharply then starting in 2015 the us began tightening alone and for several years the key phrase in the market has been monetary policy divergence the question has been how soon other central banks would follow and at what pace now most of the major central banks are either on hold or have an easing bias including some that had already started on tightening cycles such as the bank of england and bank of canada only norway and sweden seem to be still aiming to tighten above g10 policy rates low volatility the monetary policy convergence has led to extremely low volatility in the fx market there s just not that much to go for since policy is largely on hold everywhere the ecb and bank of japan for example have pretty much hit the end of the road as far as easing measures are concerned and they re not likely to hike any time soon so we can t expect any policy changes to affect fx rates above historical volatility above historical volatility eur usd and usd jpy this low volatility environment which is not only in fx but in other asset classes as well may not last forever speculators have almost a record short position in the vix futures 164 4k contracts vs the record of 174 7k extreme positioning in the futures is often but not always associated with turning points in the underlying as there s no one left to buy or sell and we can see that volatility did indeed go shooting up not long after the record short position was reached in october 2017 above speculators positions in vix finally although i think monetary policy may be on hold in most countries politics certainly isn t with the publication of the mueller report trump s legal worries are just beginning i think us political uncertainty could take the place of british political uncertainty as a market factor in the coming months the coming week bank of canada bank of japan us q1 gdp there are two central bank meetings this coming week but only one of them is really worth watching just six months ago the market was totally convinced that the bank of canada was going to hike rates this year it was seen as a 98 probability red line with a 90 probability of two hikes now there s almost zero probability of even one hike and around an 84 probability of no change in rates at all this year purple line above market probability of boc rates end 2019 but while no one expects any change in rates at wednesday s meeting or any time this year for that matter there could be a change in nuance or bias at their last meeting the boc turned decidedly dovish they said that the slowdown in the global economy has been more pronounced and widespread than they had forecast and that the slowdown in the fourth quarter was sharper and more broadly based than expected it now appears that the economy will be weaker in the first half of 2019 than the bank projected in january they said while also dropping any reference to a recovery to above potential growth in 2020 governing council judges that the outlook continues to warrant a policy interest rate that is below its neutral range they said adding that with increased uncertainty about the timing of future rate increases governing council will be watching closely developments in household spending oil markets and global trade policy now things look a bit different with the bounce in china the slowdown in the global economy may not be as pronounced and widespread as they had feared although the disappointing preliminary pmis out thursday show that the bounce isn t as pronounced and widespread as i had hoped either retail sales have started to turn up canadian oil prices are up 19 and an end to the us china trade bickering seems in store although us japan and us eu bickering continues so the picture may be a bit brighter than when they last met they could come out with a somewhat less pessimistic outlook in which case we could see cad gaining after the meeting above canada retail sales as for thursday s bank of japan boj meeting it s pretty hopeless boj gov kuroda came into office in april 2013 vowing to get inflation back above 2 according to reuters the boj meeting s forecast update will show inflation remaining below its 2 target through the fiscal year ending in march 2022 in fact they ve apparently given up just last week a former bank of japan official in charge of monetary policy admitted that the country s 2 inflation goal is more of a symbolic target than anything else according to bloomberg news he said that provided the economy continues growing hitting the inflation target no longer matters to the government instead the measure of success will be an improved economy wage and employment growth nonetheless the boj can t abandon the target because giving up on its easing commitment could trigger a sharp rise in the yen and a fall in stocks so with no hope of hitting the target and no chance of abandoning it the meeting is likely to be yet another pro forma affair that results in no market affecting change in the stance as you can see the trading range on boj days is generally lower than on other days probably because people hold off trading in anticipation of some change in policy but then find no incentive to get back in after yet another anodyne comment above daily range usd jpy the other big event of the week will be friday s release of q1 us gdp the market is expecting a fairly solid 2 2 qoq saar rate the same as in q4 of last year it s a little bit below the recent trend but still healthy the fomc members in their quarterly economic projections estimate the longer run growth rate of the us economy to be 1 7 to 2 2 so this would be at the upper range of their guess for the sustainable non inflationary pace of growth their median estimate for 2019 is 2 1 and the central tendency the range of the majority of members is 1 9 2 2 so again this would be at the upper end of estimates however there s a lot of uncertainty surrounding the figure the new york fed s nowcast gdp model says a much lower 1 4 as of april 12 while the atlanta fed s gdpnow model says a much higher 2 8 it will be revised later today the st louis fed s nowcast however is exactly the same as the market consensus the range of estimates on bloomberg is from 1 0 to 2 9 i believe a result even along the lines of the market consensus would show that in fact the us economy is not slowing contrary to popular belief that would probably be good for the dollar above us gdp other major us indicators include existing home sales on monday new home sales on tuesday and durable goods orders on thursday in europe the ifo indices next wednesday could provide some relief after the disappointing german manufacturing pmi yesterday thursday that might help boost the euro above ifo above g10 vs usd performance chart
advertisement italy has entered a perma recession and there is no obvious way out analysts told business insider european union rules prevent the kind of government deficit spending that might grow the economy at the same time italy s debt to gdp load has reached heights not seen since world war ii there is now a growing risk of a systemic financial crisis these analysts told business insider the scale of such a collapse would be magnitudes greater than the greek debt crisis of 2015 and thus harder to contain the problem illustrates the contradictory rules of the eu and the european central bank which prevent countries from investing in growth and make it impossible to leave the eurozone without triggering the crisis they re seeking to avoid economists in milan and london are debating whether italy is carrying so much debt that it might collapse into a greek style financial crisis their fear is that because italy is so much bigger than greece and because italy is one of the big three economies underpinning the eurozone that the scale of such a crisis might be more difficult to contain this time around it also underscores the un resolvable contradiction at the heart of the european central bank which governs the 19 countries that use the euro as a currency once a country gets into too much debt european union austerity rules that limit government spending militate to reduce that country s economic growth at the same time the ecb s rules make it impossible for a country to exit the euro without plunging itself into the financial crisis it is seeking to avoid advertisement italy s economy is essentially going to flatline in the medium term italy has gone into recession and it does not look like it will rebound anytime soon gdp shrank in q1 2019 by 0 1 it declined by the same amount in q4 2018 the european union s fiscal responsibility rules prevent italy from expanding its government spending deficit beyond 2 04 of gdp even though extra government spending right now might boost the economy the italian economy is also burdened by a number of cultural and historic factors corruption and inflexible labour market rules to name just two that hold back its productivity growth these analysts say thus italy looks like it may become stuck in a state of perma recession according to jack allen an analyst at capital economics advertisement italy s economy is essentially going to flatline in the medium term he told business insider at the same time italy s debt load is rising it currently stands at about 2 trillion 2 25 trillion debt to gdp has reached 130 a level not seen since world war ii the public debt ratio will probably continue rising and eventually prove unsustainable allen said this would be a bigger problem than the previous euro zone crisis and could once again endanger the single currency itself he told clients recently advertisement italy s debt poses a much bigger systemic risk for the euro zone as a whole john higgins and adam hoyes two economist colleagues of allen s at capital economics agree the imf voiced concerns about the country s high level of debt and the risk of that triggering another euro zone sovereign debt crisis admittedly greece s government debt as a percentage of gdp is even higher than that of italy but unlike italy s greece s debt to gdp ratio is on a downward trajectory and its debt has been restructured under far more favorable terms than italy s what s more italy s debt is much larger in absolute terms and poses a much bigger systemic risk for the euro zone as a whole they said in a research note recently italy is stuck inside a downward debt growth cycle according to milan based nicola nobile an analyst at oxford economics the government is very likely to miss the fiscal targets agreed with the european commission at the end of last year 2 of gdp for 2019 and 1 8 for 2020 he told clients recently advertisement italy s banks hold a high ratio of domestic government debt if investors believe either the banks or the government cannot sustain that debt a national default becomes a real risk this bad equilibrium is very fragile this bad equilibrium is very fragile the main wildcard remains the political environment as we do not see the government surviving its five year term the other wildcard is a financial crisis if markets confidence in italy deteriorates quickly a financial crisis that brings down the current government could lead to a new unity government which implements fiscal tightening further depressing growth nobile says this situation cannot last capital s allen lays out this analysis of italy s problems advertisement extremely low productivity growth in part because italy has not invested in technology the way the us or the uk has in 2017 only 61 of italians were on the internet compared to 95 in uk according to the world bank the italian labour force is shrinking and immigration won t make up the difference italy is a haven for lousy management and corporate governance according to the wef global competitiveness report there is more government corruption in italy than other european economies and the italian legal system is slow to enforce or defend the rights of litigants italian companies still have weak access to credit and capital rigid labour market rules make companies afraid to hire people they can t get rid of later the quantity and quality of education is too low italian 15 year olds perform below the average tracked by the oecd poorly educated workers tend to be less productive in addition nobile says the limited deficit spending headroom that italy is allowed has been spent on the wrong projects for instance the eu allowed the government a little extra spending room last year and the government put 10 billion into early retirement benefits and a basic income scheme those might be good for unemployed people and pensioners but they aren t the kind of capital or educational investments that italy needs to restructure its economy for growth he says italians were richer than americans until they switched to the euro italy was not always this way in the 1980s and 1990s italians were richer on a purchasing power parity basis than americans they managed that because italy used the lira and the currency was competitively devalued it made italian goods and services cheap and spurred growth advertisement now italy uses the euro and it cannot devalue its currency the country could only do that if it left the eurozone and reinstated the lira unfortunately italy s obligations inside the ecb s euro transaction clearing system are approaching 500 billion according to the ecb technically that is debt italy must pay immediately if it defaults out of the euro it is the equivalent of about a third of italian gdp so that situation is extremely unlikely advertisement italy s problems are so intractable and so big that analysts are theorizing about what it would take to break up the eurozone it s an outside chance the possibility of italy leaving the eurozone is 5 or less nobile told business insider but he estimates the chance of a greek style financial crisis at 25 to 30 italy is several orders of magnitude bigger than greece i think it would be more difficult to contain the contagion the crisis has been a long time coming of course so haven t banks made sure to reduce their exposure to italian debt one of the reasons the greek crisis was largely confined to greece was because the private finance sphere successfully insulated itself from exposure to greek debt italy is several orders of magnitude bigger than greece allen told business insider i think it would be more difficult to contain the contagion read more about the italian debt crisis
it s not just the latest imf forecast causing concern many straws in the wind point to tougher times ahead the international monetary fund imf has once again cut its global growth forecast for 2019 in its new semi annual world economic report the organization now projects a 3 3 growth rate down from the 3 5 it predicted in january 3 7 in october and 4 a year ago key reasons for the downward revisions the us china trade war and the potential for a disorderly brexit added to those concerns is a general tightening of monetary policy globally particularly the spate of interest rate increases in the us imf chief economist gita gopinath wrote that with 70 of the global economy seeing a slowdown in growth it is a delicate moment right now what might strike some as the relatively small size of the recent decreases in the imf s forecast belies the large impact such cuts in growth can bring on the ground to people and businesses particularly in countries already struggling that could easily be tipped into a recession at the same time it s worth noting that each of the imf concerns has been partly ameliorated more recently the immediate brexit risk has been pushed back by a deadline extension to october the outlook for the us china trade war at this moment at least looks more sanguine and the us federal reserve has clearly become more dovish making further rate increases this year unlikely and raising the possibility of a rate cut plenty of concerns about the world economy nevertheless remain a recent collapse in global trade is the worst since the financial crisis and as steep as during the recession of the early 2000s notes this report from the telegraph citing figures from the cpb netherlands bureau for economic policy analysis the report pointed out that global trade has fallen 1 8 in the three months to january compared to the preceding three months the article added however that markets seemed to be recovering in early 2019 thanks to reports that the us and china appear closer to a trade accord long term concerns meanwhile there are many reasons for concern over the longer term prospects for global growth and even the newly revised imf forecast is too optimistic said ashoka mody former deputy director of the imf s research and european departments and joao gomes a wharton finance professor in the short term both expect slower growth than the imf projects though neither sees a us recession as likely up until 2020 at least but they noted that beyond the immediate trouble that lower global economic growth would bring is a more pervasive long term drift towards slower growth driven by mega trends such as china s reaching economic maturity and settling into a much slower growth rate and aging populations in many of the world s richest economies especially china and europe the two experts made their comments on the knowledge wharton radio show on siriusxm according to mody who is a visiting professor of international economic policy at princeton university the world has been on a secular declining growth rate path that matters because there have been brief periods when we lift off from that downward trend and those brief periods are essentially driven by china the overarching problem now however is that china itself is trending towards slower growth rich countries do not grow perpetually at 7 to 8 therefore the chinese growth rate has to come down for mody the question is not whether china s economic growth will slow but how fast it will happen and whether it can manage that without a crisis china occasionally pumps up its economy but the resources to do so are thinning out i expect that in the second half of 2019 and certainly the early part of 2020 the chinese economy will continue to slow world trade will continue to slow he said gomes agreed that china is an economic fulcrum for much of the world along with the us when china s economy slows it s a real problem for virtually most of latin america and africa mostly because of lower commodity exports and investments the strong downward effects on many countries such as australia have long been noted and then there s the auto manufacturers in europe that really depend on china and china s market a lot of the slowdown in europe has been tied to the trade wars and the prospects of the slowdown in china and what exactly the chinese consumers have access to now gomes said added to the risks in europe are the new threats by the trump administration to slap 11 billion in tariffs on various european union imports because of subsidies to the european aerospace behemoth airbus just hours later the eu was preparing retaliatory tariffs on some 12 billion worth of us products based on similar claims of subsidies to boeing both sides have been arguing over subsidies for nearly 15 years and now the world trade organization has ruled that cases on both sides have at least some merit the us and the eu have asked wto arbitrators meantime to approve appropriate countermeasures europe bears the brunt according to mody the biggest impact from china s slowdown will be in europe because trade is so important to the region it s being felt in germany which looks to be nearing a recession he added italy already is in recession with china slowing the sugar high of tax breaks already wearing off in the us and europe completely dependent on world trade i m not able to see what the major sources of growth are mody suggested that the imf forecast is too high and we may end this year closer to just 3 and therefore be in a somewhat dire situation particularly in countries like italy which are very precariously balanced right now longer term should growth in china slow to 3 to 3 5 a year then world trade will drop to 2 5 to 3 annually that is catastrophically low for eu countries italy will be in almost permanent recession with its huge financial burdens we have the making of a crisis now i m not quite clear how we can avoid that mody noted that in his book euro tragedy a drama in nine acts i call italy the fault line in europe that fault line has been steadily deepening italy is now in recession my view is that it is now on the threshold of a financial crisis and could get tipped over at any time if you drew a checklist of factors that cause a financial crisis italy has all of them what s more various european safety nets designed to save ireland and greece are not adequate to help italy whose sovereign debt is similar in size to the debts of germany and france gomes added we live in a world where we re getting older and productivity is slowing down if you take a 10 to 20 year outlook we are going to slow down that s just a fact i think everything you see on the horizon is negative gomes like mody does not see any obvious sources of strong growth in the near term certainly none with the strength to reverse the trend the ecb has no room for monetary policy anymore mody pointed out i think that is very important to understand in terms of the big possibility of monetary stimulus it has nothing left to give anymore the same is true for fiscal policy he adds gomes agreed that europe is the most vulnerable part of the world to recession right now the question is how do you solve this and really none of us knows that s the honest truth the views expressed in this article are

here s our summary of key events over the weekend that affect new zealand with news markets are happy on holiday even if the latest data isn t that positive equity markets ended last week in generally positive territory although the asx ended flat on the fay and the nzx was down 0 2 but with a longer perspective for all of 2019 so far the s p500 is up nearly 16 the german dax is up a similar amount the british ftse has gained a bit more than 10 in asia tokyo is up more than 13 hong kong is up 19 and shanghai takes the cake up 33 locally the asx is up 13 and the nzx50 is up 14 risk taking is up since central banks started suggesting rate hikes are off the policy table especially the us fed but the data doesn t really support expanded risk appetites so at some point something will have to give retail sales in the us were up much more than analysts were expecting posting a 1 6 month on month annualised gain in march when half that was expected that is most of the 3 6 gain from the same month a year ago however given that us inflation is 1 9 this is a modest real rise in retail sales and their inventory to sales ratio surprised by not getting worse but us housing start data wasn t so good for march down a concerning 15 from the same month a year ago and the early look at april business activity in the us shows it s growth is slowing sharply in fact that is now at a 31 month low driven by their giant services sector output new orders and hiring all show sharp pullbacks this downtrend is supported by the philadelphia feds regional index which also came in way below expectations it declined to a reading of 8 5 in april from 13 7 in march this index was at 32 3 in may 2018 so it has come a long way off over the border to the north canadian retail sales data also brought a stronger that expected rise in february data released overnight but to be fair most of this rise is accounted for by inflation trade over that border is supposed to be subject to the new updated nafta but a new official review casts doubt on the likely benefit for the us and that may reinforce the trouble the administration has getting congressional consent apparently its not a great deal at all for the americans even if it is for mexico and canada both the imf and oecd have warned china that excessive stimulus could undermine the country s attempts to deal with financial risks but after better than expected growth in q1 expectations are raised that beijing will now go ahead with important structural reforms and it is resilient enough to put up with the short term adjustment costs however china has lost a key wto ruling in a dispute with the us over tariff levels for wheat rice and corn which it continues to protect and the only indication coming out of beijing is that stimulus support will remain and for the record we are approaching the 30th anniversary of the june 4 incident known in the west as the tiananmen square massacre where 100s of student protesters for democracy were killed although most were killed outside the square in the subsequent crackdown this is the icon image of the protest the event ushered in the current heavy orwellian censorship and even today beijing is nervous of fallout it has extended public holidays and banned certain songs as the anniversary approaches in australia a ray of hope for their manufacturing sector after declining for a many months the latest pmi data shows it expanding again but overall business activity indicators have deteriorated more seriously than indicators on employment according to the latest quarterly nab business survey the ust 10yr yield has drifted off from its recent rise and now down 4 bps at 2 56 but that is exactly where it was a week ago their 2 10 curve is little changed at 16 bps but their negative 1 5 curve is wider at 8 bps the aussie govt 10yr is at 1 92 and down 3 bps the china govt 10yr is unchanged at 3 39 while the nz govt 10 yr is at 2 00 gold is unchanged at us 1 276 us oil prices are a little firmer now just on us 64 bbl while the brent benchmark is at us 72 bbl the kiwi dollar is weaker at 66 9 usc on the cross rates we are at 93 4 auc against the euro we are at 59 5 euro cents that puts the twi 5 at 71 5 bitcoin is at us 5 224 this rate is charted in the exchange rate set below the easiest place to stay up with event risk today is by following our economic calendar here

image when i was growing up my parents told me finish your dinner people in china and india are starving i tell my daughters finish your homework people in india and china are starving for your job thomas friedman the story is told of a woman who came to her younger sister s house to commiserate with her over the untimely demise of her little son at the age of 6 as other sympathizers wore a mournful look and were discussing in low tunes this woman started shouting to the consternation of everyone in the room i knew it i knew it i knew it another woman rushed to her feeling she was almost losing it out of the shock of the loss and asked aunty what is it what do you know she went on i warned my sister about marrying this her chinese husband but she wouldn t listen the inquisitive lady then retorts what has your sister s husband got to do with her son s death her response shocked everyone in the room chinese products don t last many of the people had to temporarily suspend their grief to manage a laugh the preceding thomas friedman quote and the morbid humour that followed it should not be seen as sinophobic slurs but instead a compliment to the amazing transformation that has become the chinese story poor quality products imitation of original products fake products cheap and inferior products were until very recently associated with china the truth however is that china has made a lot of progress from the above characterisation before we dwell further on china it is apposite to briefly look at the experience of japan those who are old enough would remember that this was exactly how japanese products including cars were derided in those days when europe and america dominated the manufacturing sector of the global economy at the end of the 2nd world war following the crushing defeat of japan the hitherto warmongering nation was banned from keeping any significant army not to talk of waging wars japan was forced to become a pacifist nation and its hitherto world dominance waned japan was forced into industrialisation as a way of lifting its economy and reasserting her pride in the world diverting her warring skills into manufacturing it began making a range of items largely for domestic and personal use the first wave of such products were met with derision worldwide as the sobriquet fabrique au japon became synonymous with imitation and inferior products this did not deter the resilient japanese and with people like akio morita of sony honda toyota and suzuki leading the charge it did not take long before the hitherto substandard japanese products became the dominant brands in the world the hondas the toyotas the nissans and the mitsubishis took over the market they went further into the luxury premium brands like the lexus infiniti and acura to give mercedes and bavaria motor works a run for their money as if that was not enough other counties like south korea started making their own vehicles until very recently the market did not place a lot of premium on korean cars their brands like the hyundai daewoo kia and ssangyong have become popular not just because they come in cheaper than the more popular brands but because they are also efficient in terms of fuel consumption and maintenance back to china a country which has become one of the fastest growing economies in the world with a dizzying annual growth rate of close to 7 according to the world bank china s gdp grew from 150 billion in 1978 to 12 24 trillion by 2017 analysts had predicted that 2018 gdp growth figures would be lackluster this is because of the us trade war china however defied the projections of analysts throughout 2018 with average quarterly growth of 6 6 even though this was the worst performance in about 30 years it was still better than analysts expectation note that the us grew at an average of 2 9 in the same period so how come china s economy defied the prediction of experts by recording such spectacular growth even in the face of sustained aggressive us tariff warfare one needs to look more than four decades back to know why during the mao era china embarked on a cultural and economic revolution that was fundamental and comprehensive it gradually turned the socialist supertanker into a nimble capitalist freighter while the world overlooked the changes china dug deep into her capitalist past and prepared her society and people for global competition by the time carter was making approaches to open up the chinese economy to the west it was ready the latter day leaders like deng simply keyed into the reform blueprint that had been laid out years earlier to create an economy that the west could not overrun even in the area of free competition the first thing that the managers of the economy in china did was to roll out a stimulus package that focused on infrastructure projects they prepared their workforce for manufacturing and globalization they also invested in 5g telecommunications and encouraged investment in real estate all the investments yielded fruits as more money found their way into the hands of the people which in turn energized consumption the result is a consistent gdp growth even in the first quarter of 2019 china has been the world s second largest economy by nominal gdp since 2010 as it has remained the largest economy in the world by purchasing power parity ppp since 2014 china is also the world s largest exporter and second largest importer of goods in the area of armaments china is already a nuclear power maintaining the world s largest standing army and second largest defense budget it is a permanent member of the united nations security council it is also the most populous country in the word with over 1 4 billion people occupying a land space of about 9 3m square km second to russia with a land size of 16 3m square km china is obviously a behemoth of a country and you ignore it only at your own peril china s position has been consolidated in the international financial market as at the end of february 2019 the united states owes china a whopping 1 13 trillion this figure is 28 of the 4 02 trillion us treasury bills and bonds held by foreign countries china is closely followed by japan which holds 1 07 trillion the rest of the 22 trillion us national debt is held locally it is clear that this kind of country is a big challenge to the hegemony of the united states again cheap labour and efficiency have made the us and some parts of europe outsource a large chunk of its manufacturing to china between 2001 when it joined the world trade organisation and 2013 china sucked up about 3 2 million jobs from the us 75 of those jobs were in manufacturing trump had accused china of unfair market distorting trade practices manipulation of its currency to make exports cheaper suppression of labour rights and state enforcement of lower wages we shall leave the argument of whether trump is right or wrong for another day but one must point out that those are some of the challenges of the market economy which china had adopted let us examine the state of nigeria china relations formal diplomatic relationship started in 1971 during the military era the nigerian regime found common interest in the chinese regime which at that time was also unpopular with the international community strategic partnership did not start fully until 2005 trade between nigeria and china had steadily been on the increase from 7 8 billion in 2010 it rose to 12 5 billion in 2017 and further rose to 15 3b in 2018 at the moment nigeria is the biggest chinese investment destination in africa the second largest export market and the third largest trading partner of china in the whole of africa chinese banks and contractors have helped to fund and construct the 186 km abuja kaduna rail line which was delivered in 2016 less than a year ago we signed a contract of 6 68b with the china civil engineering construction corporation ccecc for the construction of the ibadan kaduna segment of the lagos kano rail line meanwhile a 1 685 billion contract was signed in 2016 to link kaduna with kano on the standard gauge rail system the 156km lagos ibadan segment started in march 2017 would be delivered this year at the cost 1 5 billion the total cost of the entire 2 733km project is 11 12 billion again chinese companies are working on the international terminals of four of our airports additionally they are handling roads bridges power and agriculture projects with funding of 4 4b the chinese are involved in the zungeru hydro electric power project fiber cables for internet infrastructure and lekki deep water port project there is no doubt that china has a lot to offer an infrastructure deficit nation like nigeria it has technology and skilled manpower in addition to excess industrial and manufacturing capacity most importantly china has funds which it is willing to release to needy economies at a reasonable cost however there have been concerns over increasing loans from china one major area of concern is what happens in case of default people always point to zambia as a case in point where default has led to asset swap also known as takeovers and seizures the fear is that most of the infrastructure built by chinese are at the risk of being taken over if there is default in meeting the terms of the loans zambian authorities have continued to deny these allegations for what it is worth we should not ignore this concern as it is always a possibility with loans again it is important that we use our clout to ensure we negotiate favorable conditions given how important we are to our partners in the global arena the second fear is that of dumping and crowding out of domestic manufacturers by cheap and sometimes poor quality goods this fear is not unfounded as it is on record that the entry of china led to the closure of about 65 textile mills in nigeria over a period of 10 years and the loss of over 150 000 jobs there is also the security concern it is alleged that the african union headquarters in addis ababa built by the chinese was bugged as construction was going on there is no confirmation of this allegation and china has come out to vehemently deny it furthermore the chinese are known to export their goods and technology with their people partnership to them requires that virtually everything including manual labour and basic raw materials which can be sourced locally are hardly allowed from the host country closely related to this is that there is hardly any room for technology transfer and the partner country would depend on china even for routine maintenance as we were completing this piece news came in that at the just concluded spring meetings of the world bank imf tobias andrian a director of the imf warned nigeria and other emerging markets taking loans from china to consider the terms of such facilities especially their compliance with the paris club of creditors conditions even though he did not condemn borrowing from china he was emphatic that the terms of loans from china are always questionable his worry was that if there is any debt restructuring in future the chinese may just take a pound of flesh according to andrian nigeria had been borrowing from international markets which gives the imf some worries at the moment funding conditions in economies such as nigeria and other sub saharan african countries are very favourable but that might change at some point and there is risk of rollovers and whether the need for refinancing can be met in future we consider the advice a good one even though one can argue that it is laced with some subtle political considerations in the first place following the trade war between the us and china the latter has to look for alternatives to compensate for the 500b trade with the us which had been placed at risk africa provides that alternative as total trade between africa and china is already heading towards the 200b mark with the right incentives and planning africa can replace us in china s trade equation soon africa also holds additional promise of being in a position to sell agricultural products to china replacing its reliance on the us and its partners so there is a perfect match recall that china has over 1trillion low yielding investment in us treasury bills and bonds it can comfortably reduce that and swap same for investments in africa this cause of action gives it two advantages the first is that china has been enduring low us interest rates for a long time now obviously because of the trade opportunities with the us africa has the appetite for funds at higher rates and can comfortably absolve the 1 trillion investment secondly if it is true that china deliberately reduces prices of its goods to dominate the the us market a reason the us imposed the 25 tariff on chinese goods then it can comfortably channel the same goods to africa with a population four times as large as that of the us and still come out much better africa particularly nigeria has a lot of natural resources waiting to be tapped and exploited and china has both the skills and technology to take full advantage of that given all these my take is that while we appreciate the brotherly advice of the imf and should do everything to ensure that we are not left with the short end of the stick in our relationship with china there are mutual economic interests in dealing with china china provides us with opportunities to trade provides us with funding and is also in a position to provide us with technology manpower and infrastructure to support our own growth as a former lender i can understand how it feels when disruptive competition is contemplated on the part of china their president xi jinping had pleaded their innocence thus some foreigners with full read pot bellies and nothing better to do engage in finger pointing at us first china does not export revolution second it does not export famine and poverty and third it does not mess around with you so what else is there to say email
the country s largest gold producer is on the brink of collapse because of government s warped foreign currency retention policy the cost of bread has gone up more than three times in hardly a month while the livestock industry is warning of imminent meat shortages because of the skyrocketing costs of stock feed by kuda chideme the country s largest gold producer is on the brink of collapse because of government s warped foreign currency retention policy the cost of bread has gone up more than three times in hardly a month while the livestock industry is warning of imminent meat shortages because of the skyrocketing costs of stock feed all this has happened within just the first three months of the year within these few months the international monetary fund imf has also gone to scrap its initial growth forecast for zimbabwe warning that the country s economy would contract by as much as 5 2 by year end for the tenth consecutive month year on year inflation is on the rise reaching a staggering 66 8 as at march 2019 by their own admission if the statistics agency had not changed the matrix used to calculate the consumer price index cpi the year on year inflation for march would have been a confounding 166 this wouldn t be too far off professor s steve hanke s projections which have put the country s inflation in the region of 200 second only to venezuela which is chasing after the records we set a decade ago meanwhile foreign currency just like confidence is in short supply two of the country s top foreign currency earners tobacco and gold are performing way below expectation as a result of the government s blundering the tobacco season has started on a very poor note as sales continue to be dogged by disputes between merchants and farmers over payment terms the farmers want to be paid in united states dollars for their produce but the central bank refuses to oblige the merchants also want the loans they extended to farmers repaid in us dollars but the central bank has directed otherwise according to statistics from the tobacco industry marketing board timb tobacco deliveries dipped by some 52 to 17 5 million kilograms in the first 20 days of trade while the value of tobacco sold at 30 3 million is down 70 compared to the same period last year the implications of this to a sickly economy which is desperate for foreign currency could never be overstated considering that last year the tobacco industry alone generated close to a billion dollars in foreign earnings on the other hand gold deliveries to fidelity printers and refiners in the first quarter have fallen some 10 on last year s output with the country s largest producer of gold metallon corporation facing viability challenges we might as well write off all hopes of attaining the targeted gold output of 40 tonnes in fact we might not even reach last year s 33 tonnes in fact the company which had long term plans of expanding and ramping up production to 500 000 ounces of gold per year by 2021 from the 120 000 ounces it used to produce from all its mines might just fold with mounting debts the company has filed for judicial management to protect its assets from being seized by creditors investor sentiment is weak and the droves in foreign capital that had been anticipated are nowhere to be seen instead the country is witnessing massive capital flight as companies find the going difficult and fold the decision to float the rtgs has not brought about much relief to industry which had sought a liberalized market for foreign currency on friday the rtgs dollar was trading at 3 19 to the dollar on the interbank market while it sank to as low as 1 5 on the parallel market the premium between the us dollar and the rtgs dollar continues to widen on the parallel market hence remaining as an albatross around the economy s neck as cost pressures continue to build our view is that the interbank market remains incapacitated to decisively deal with massive demand of foreign currency as the supply side remains under pressure as long as exports and investment inflows remain weak the supply side will remain under pressure threating the anticipated convergence between the interbank rate and the parallel market rate reads a recent report by mmc capital our view is that there will be very minimal growth this year owing chiefly to the foreign currency shortages clipping the efforts of the local industry to retool the below par agricultural season will also impact growth negatively as output is relatively low we also fear that the retention ratios in the mining sector will not adequately attract output from the small scale miners not to gloat but we saw this coming now that we find ourselves here we ask just how much worse will things get if history has taught us anything it is that things can always get worse even when that seems impossible with all indicators pointing southwards it would seem that it is only just a matter of time before we better our own record for the worst performing economy in the world
boulder is facing a potential crisis that is threatening the growth of cities across the country a talent shortage a lack of affordable housing and ever growing traffic snarls that exacerbate problems for workers and customers are impacting the economic development and vitality of the boulder region and metropolitan areas everywhere from july 1 through march 31 there were a little more than 6 000 applicants for more than 38 000 county job openings according to data from workforce boulder county the majority of those jobs were in the information technology sector 14 982 followed by the professional scientific and technical sector 7 982 the manufacturing sector 4 039 the health care and social assistance sector 3 771 and the retail trade 3 029 fewer applicants for available jobs reflects the relatively small pool of workers within the county according to erin jones executive director of workforce boulder county the county s labor shortages also are linked to a paucity of affordable homes and a lack of public transportation options she said adding that addressing the challenges will take a communitywide effort the boulder chamber is aiming to spark just such an effort with its boulder together initiative the four year project launched last year is a package of proactive strategies for increasing the supply of local and regional housing improving regional mobility and deploying workforce development programs that better align workforce talent and industry needs said john tayer chamber president and ceo the problems are intertwined and require a regional solution he said we need to collaborate with others including chambers of commerce and civic institutions startups and businesses of all sizes are finding it difficult to attract and retain talent despite boulder s dynamic entrepreneurial environment tayer said we need to address this before it undermines the qualities that make boulder a special place for entrepreneurship innovation and business success boulder together is an effort to sustain our economic vitality for the long term tayer said as part of the initiative the chamber s focus is to identify areas that offer redevelopment opportunities for housing and review processes that are barriers for development tayer said impacts of housing traffic a 2011 report by the center for housing policy suggests affordable housing promotes economic development and an absence of affordable homes drives away workers making it hard for businesses to recruit and retain employees congested roads can reduce the profitability of local businesses by increasing operating costs and by shrinking the area from which businesses can expect to draw both customers and workers the report states an estimated 46 000 vehicles come into boulder daily because about 56 of jobs in the city are filled by people living outside of the city housing and transportation are challenges with different flavors in different communities faced in urban clusters across the country and in many places businesses are working with government leadership and other stakeholders to address them said robert radcliff founder and managing principal of ohio based resource development group which works with economic development organizations across the united states affordable housing is a new space where business leaders are stepping in he said the polarized political climate in boulder which reflects a highly informed electorate offers a pragmatic opportunity for business and community leaders to get civic leaders on the same page to influence public policy radcliff said if you want to move mountains you ve got to be on the same page housing challenges nationwide ideally people want to live closer to where they work said carrie makarewicz assistant professor in the college of architecture and planning at the university of colorado denver but in reality people commute to work in urban areas to balance their housing needs and jobs she said as housing becomes more expensive in core areas workers find it cheaper to move to suburban regions adding more time to their daily commutes to work in a two person household the decision to live in a place might be governed by a desire to be located at a mid point between one another s workplace if they work in different locations she said the lack of middle income home ownership as well as affordable housing in nashville tenn atlanta salt lake city phoenix and several other cities is a problem as is the lack of good regional public transit systems throughout the united states and their situations mirror the realities in boulder and boulder county a post and courier story from january reports how high housing prices in charleston s c are forcing teachers police officers and hospitality workers to move to the edges of town adding more to commuter congestion on the roads greg reibman president of the newton needham mass regional chamber in a december newsletter wrote that in greater boston s inner western suburbs the hunt for talent is exacerbated by traffic inadequate public transportation insufficient parking and housing shortage employers are having trouble filling everything from high salary tech and life sciences jobs to hourly workers for hotels and restaurants brett theodos senior fellow at the urban institute in washington d c calls the housing situation a supply issue in hot markets often community members resist growth driving up the prices of available housing stock which forces those unable to own or rent homes to move away from those communities he said the denver boulder metro area continues to attract people but it s a challenge for them to find housing they can afford near where they work the situation is improvable with the growth of housing ease of permitting densification and housing subsidies theodos said washington d c has committed to investing 100 million annually in a housing trust fund he said in minneapolis local government has decided to eliminate single family zoning allowing up to three family homes in the city s residential neighborhoods he said some cities allow accessory dwellings to improve housing availability and others have removed parking requirements to ease housing pressures in their communities it s been possible because of the lead taken by local business civic and neighborhood groups with the support of philanthropic and financial institutions he said businesses are increasingly becoming aware of the impact of affordable housing on their bottom lines theodos said also they are becoming inclusive thinking about people who provide essential services he said growth is going to happen people are going to stretch themselves business initiatives to deal with urban challenges in boulder can help improve the situation he said makarewicz of uc denver thinks planners and policymakers need to identify more funding for public transit and identify well located land for affordable housing in boulder county she said state policymakers need to consider expanding inclusionary housing requirements to include rentals land costs a challenge the challenge is getting land at an affordable cost for housing development said susan lythgoe executive director of flatirons habitat for humanity the nonprofit that builds rehabilitates or repairs homes for affordable ownership flatirons habitat for humanity got land at no cost to build nine townhomes at 4525 palo parkway because boulder purchased the land in 2006 with affordable housing funds the land on which the townhomes are being built was leased to flatirons habitat through boulder housing partners via a long term renewable land lease with an initial lease term of 99 years boulder housing partners which is the housing authority for the city built 35 affordable rental units on adjacent land at 22nd street and violet avenue lythgoe s organization paid 1 25 million for 1 4 acres she said and site preparation often adds to project costs she said the best neighborhoods are designed for the youngest and the oldest lythgoe said people should be able to live and work in the same place to be able to participate in community activities or the school activities of their kids she said it naturally leads to a reduction in traffic as well there has been an increased emphasis on cooperation among communities since the flood of 2013 lythgoe said trinity lutheran church in downtown boulder at the end of 2018 finished construction of 16 affordable rentals units for seniors while expanding its church space and providing 56 underground parking spots to the city said melanie nehls burow coordinator of congregational life the land belonged to the church which it donated to the project in which city was a partner the city in turn provided a grant of more than 1 million to construct affordable housing she said we see it as a mission for us to provide housing in downtown boulder we have done it as a church in other parts of the world we wanted to be good stewards of the land in downtown nehls burow said the church will construct another eight housing units in the complex when funds become available said jim topping a longtime church member who was involved with the project the church s vision to promote affordable housing and help take care of the less privileged holds the fabric to bind the community said topping who formerly served on the boulder city council and planning board there needs to be intelligent growth he said i don t want to fight growth you need growth to vitalize the community densification transportation options and easing the permitting norms for affordable housing would go a long way to ease the problem he said high housing costs in boulder have now priced out the middle class topping said possibilities in boulder boulder city council hasn t protected land for the middle class said david adamson executive director of goose creek commmunity land trust of the city s residentially zoned land 83 5 percent of it is for single family homes he said about 100 to 119 affordable units are built annually but the rate at which previously affordable units are shed is 900 a year adamson said they are lost to price inflation on resale or remodeling he said it s because of land use and zoning no fireman or police officer can afford to live in boulder he said a lot of city officials don t live in boulder can t we share this beautiful town with people who work here adamson s recipe build permanently affordable homes with no provision for cars it s about taking away cars he said people ought to share a car or ride a bike he said accommodating more people in the city through zoning changes would help reduce traffic on the road particularly on highways businesses also will be able to recruit and retain talent he said george karakehian former boulder city council member and owner of art source international on the pearl street mall supports the chamber s boulder together initiative it s time city council pushed the dialogue beyond some neighborhoods concerns of increased traffic congestions and noise he said the no growth mindset is not helping karakehian said the university should be allowed to build housing for its employees at its south campus site he said the former boulder community health site on broadway can help take care of some of our own housing needs karakehian said the site known as alpine balsam was purchased by the city for 40 million in 2015 the plan for it outlines a multi generational hub for community life and local government services and a new model for equitable affordable and sustainable living but at their meeting on april 9 many council members expressed growing concern about the 15 2 million needed for deconstruction on the site with some suggesting the city sell the parcel and get out of the project as a business owner he often hears about the traffic and parking woes of his employees karakehian said almost all of them live out of town they enjoy working here but don t want to pay the high rents building more units of smaller size would be cheaper than a house in boulder said the chamber s tayer it will potentially help the senior population that wants to downsize in boulder regulatory and public reviews can often take many years increasing the project costs he said cost is as variable as the business and residential developments they impact the chamber is looking at all types of solutions including design elements with a focus on affordable housing in areas that could be redeveloped across boulder county tayer said that means many workers might still need to commute to their jobs in boulder he said the chamber is looking at it from both a long term and a short term perspective the former entails making infrastructure improvements for greater transit along the major commuter corridors u s 119 colo 7 and u s 36 tayer said the chamber s voice and advocacy might help push for quick decision making particularly related to design and investments in the short term it s about finding efficient ways to improve the first and the final mile connection for public transit and encouraging group travel and carpools using technology he said this also ties in with efforts to improve boulder s quality of life we are building initial coalitions to develop transportation solutions he said boulder together is looking at identifying grant funding and investments from business partners to further those goals tayer said building bridges the third component of boulder together is to develop workforce talent keeping in mind the future needs of industry and businesses in boulder county tayer said it s about developing internships apprenticeship and training programs focused on the needs of industries that experience talent shortages he said skillful and workforce boulder county are helping business owners learn how to widen their employee search and prevent employee turnover in a tight labor market as employers learn to look beyond educational qualifications and are able to assess knowledge skills and abilities they will be able to train employees according to business needs cu boulder is an important partner in providing potential workers who are looking for a career locally to boulder businesses tayer said jones of workforce boulder county appreciates the chamber s move to develop connections with local educational and public institutions encouraging high schools and community colleges to offer short term certificate courses in health care manufacturing and software development etc so students are able to join the job market and carve out a career for themselves will help employers looking for workers jones said there is a need to develop training programs for existing workers to offer them career advancement opportunities and also to make sure they have a roof over their heads and can commute to work with relative ease flexible scheduling and telecommuting will help jones said are we building a pipeline of educated workforce for the future asked jones for that the community needs to come together take care of the existing digital divide in society and create an inclusive environment helping the technologically challenged overcome any barriers she said it s about helping build career pathways providing a diverse workforce and communicating with local employers about their talent needs she said corporations supporting communities here and elsewhere corporations have stepped into address urban issues including housing transportation and economic development said radcliff of ohio s resource development group pointing to a 500 million initiative launched by jp morgan chase last year to drive inclusive growth and create greater economic opportunity in cities across the world early this year microsoft pledged 500 million for affordable housing in the seattle area according to a new york times story microsoft plans to lend 225 million

italy has entered a perma recession and there is no obvious way out analysts told business insider european union rules prevent the kind of government deficit spending that might grow the economy at the same time italy s debt to gdp load has reached heights not seen since world war ii there is now a growing risk of a systemic financial crisis these analysts told business insider the scale of such a collapse would be magnitudes greater than the greek debt crisis of 2015 and thus harder to contain the problem illustrates the contradictory rules of the eu and the european central bank which prevent countries from investing in growth and make it impossible to leave the eurozone without triggering the crisis they re seeking to avoid new look sign up to get the inside scoop on today s biggest stories in markets tech and business delivered daily read preview thanks for signing up access your favorite topics in a personalized feed while you re on the go download the app email address sign up by clicking sign up you accept our terms of service and privacy policy you can opt out at any time advertisement economists in milan and london are debating whether italy is carrying so much debt that it might collapse into a greek style financial crisis their fear is that because italy is so much bigger than greece and because italy is one of the big three economies underpinning the eurozone that the scale of such a crisis might be more difficult to contain this time around it also underscores the un resolvable contradiction at the heart of the european central bank which governs the 19 countries that use the euro as a currency once a country gets into too much debt european union austerity rules that limit government spending militate to reduce that country s economic growth at the same time the ecb s rules make it impossible for a country to exit the euro without plunging itself into the financial crisis it is seeking to avoid advertisement italy s economy is essentially going to flatline in the medium term italy has gone into recession and it does not look like it will rebound anytime soon gdp shrank in q1 2019 by 0 1 it declined by the same amount in q4 2018 the european union s fiscal responsibility rules prevent italy from expanding its government spending deficit beyond 2 04 of gdp even though extra government spending right now might boost the economy the italian economy is also burdened by a number of cultural and historic factors corruption and inflexible labour market rules to name just two that hold back its productivity growth these analysts say italy s debt to gdp is approaching a level not seen since world war 2 capital economics thus italy looks like it may become stuck in a state of perma recession according to jack allen an analyst at capital economics advertisement italy s economy is essentially going to flatline in the medium term he told business insider at the same time italy s debt load is rising it currently stands at about 2 trillion 2 25 trillion debt to gdp has reached 130 a level not seen since world war ii the public debt ratio will probably continue rising and eventually prove unsustainable allen said this would be a bigger problem than the previous euro zone crisis and could once again endanger the single currency itself he told clients recently advertisement italian government debt has reached nearly 2 trillion after a sudden ramp up starting in 2016 ecb italy s debt poses a much bigger systemic risk for the euro zone as a whole john higgins and adam hoyes two economist colleagues of allen s at capital economics agree the imf voiced concerns about the country s high level of debt and the risk of that triggering another euro zone sovereign debt crisis admittedly greece s government debt as a percentage of gdp is even higher than that of italy but unlike italy s greece s debt to gdp ratio is on a downward trajectory and its debt has been restructured under far more favorable terms than italy s related stories what s more italy s debt is much larger in absolute terms and poses a much bigger systemic risk for the euro zone as a whole they said in a research note recently advertisement italy is stuck inside a downward debt growth cycle according to milan based nicola nobile an analyst at oxford economics the government is very likely to miss the fiscal targets agreed with the european commission at the end of last year 2 of gdp for 2019 and 1 8 for 2020 he told clients recently italian banks hold a greater proportion of domestic debt than other countries banks imf global financial stability report april 2019 italy s banks hold a high ratio of domestic government debt if investors believe either the banks or the government cannot sustain that debt a national default becomes a real risk this bad equilibrium is very fragile this bad equilibrium is very fragile the main wildcard remains the political environment as we do not see the government surviving its five year term the other wildcard is a financial crisis if markets confidence in italy deteriorates quickly a financial crisis that brings down the current government could lead to a new unity government which implements fiscal tightening further depressing growth nobile says this situation cannot last advertisement capital s allen lays out this analysis of italy s problems extremely low productivity growth in part because italy has not invested in technology the way the us or the uk has in 2017 only 61 of italians were on the internet compared to 95 in uk according to the world bank the italian labour force is shrinking and immigration won t make up the difference italy is a haven for lousy management and corporate governance according to the wef global competitiveness report there is more government corruption in italy than other european economies and the italian legal system is slow to enforce or defend the rights of litigants italian companies still have weak access to credit and capital rigid labour market rules make companies afraid to hire people they can t get rid of later the quantity and quality of education is too low italian 15 year olds perform below the average tracked by the oecd poorly educated workers tend to be less productive the percentage of italians who are connected to the internet is lower than in most other western countries capital economics in addition nobile says the limited deficit spending headroom that italy is allowed has been spent on the wrong projects for instance the eu allowed the government a little extra spending room last year and the government put 10 billion into early retirement benefits and a basic income scheme those might be good for unemployed people and pensioners but they aren t the kind of capital or educational investments that italy needs to restructure its economy for growth he says advertisement italians were richer than americans until they switched to the euro italy was not always this way in the 1980s and 1990s italians were richer on a purchasing power parity basis than americans they managed that because italy used the lira and the currency was competitively devalued it made italian goods and services cheap and spurred growth italy grew so wealthy on a per head basis that in the 1980s and 1990s it surpassed the us but then the country switched its currency to the euro and it lost its competitive edge capital economics now italy uses the euro and it cannot devalue its currency the country could only do that if it left the eurozone and reinstated the lira unfortunately italy s obligations inside the ecb s euro transaction clearing system are approaching 500 billion according to the ecb technically that is debt italy must pay immediately if it defaults out of the euro it is the equivalent of about a third of italian gdp advertisement so that situation is extremely unlikely italy owes 483 billion in obligations inside the ecb s euro transaction clearing system a debt that in theory must be paid immediately if italy ever left the euro ecb italy s problems are so intractable and so big that analysts are theorizing about what it would take to break up the eurozone it s an outside chance the possibility of italy leaving the eurozone is 5 or less nobile told business insider but he estimates the chance of a greek style financial crisis at 25 to 30 italy is several orders of magnitude bigger than greece i think it would be more difficult to contain the contagion the crisis has been a long time coming of course so haven t banks made sure to reduce their exposure to italian debt one of the reasons the greek crisis was largely confined to greece was because the private finance sphere successfully insulated itself from exposure to greek debt advertisement italy is several orders of magnitude bigger than greece allen told business insider i think it would be more difficult to contain the contagion read more about the italian debt crisis

slowed the pace of bond purchases in fact catching the market by surprise it the boj announced before the weekend that it would reduce the amount of long term bonds it will purchase for the first time

with the dramatic decline in the equity prices in q4 18 and the knock on impact from the wealth effect depressed expectations for growth at the start of the year it looked like the economy was stagnating or worse the inversion of parts of the yield curve was seized upon as further evidence that the end of the expansion was at hand the atlanta fed s gdpnow tracker began the quarter with a 0 3 projection and after the retail sales report stands at 2 8 the median economist forecast according to bloomberg is 2 2 which would match the q4 18 pace some economists have a more dour estimate of 1

lahore businessmen are puzzled but dare not to show their shock in public on the recent federal cabinet s shuffling they do not know if policies agreements reached with ex finance minister asad umar would be implemented in the coming budget businessmen know that any dissent on policies is not taken well by the ruling party the former finance minister visited all the major chambers the capital market and important export associations to take their inputs on various economic policies he publically promised to incorporate most of the suggestions in the next budget the businessmen are worried that they do not have the time to engage in similar exercise with the new finance manager as the budget is around the corner the newly appointed adviser to the prime minister on finance hafeez sheikh is more of an academic person and in his past recent stints as privatisation and finance ministers could not mingle with the industrialists and businessmen it is also not known whether sheikh would apply his own economic program or continue with the present one that has not delivered as yet the one mistake that previous financial team did make was to slow down the development program that also caused economic slowdown another was the farce implementation of austerity measures that in fact resulted in substantial increase in non development expenditures apart from security expenses the new finance ministry s head would have to tackle the issue of huge debt particularly the foreign debt and liabilities that ballooned to near 100 billion till december end last year controlling the debt monster would be an uphill task for the new team the country is expected to add substantial foreign and domestic debts next fiscal year due to widening twin deficits the tax collection during the last nine months fell short of the target by more than rs450 billion increased expenses have taken the budget deficit to a historic high foreign exchange reserves are depleting interest rates are very high under these circumstances the government is not in a position to provide any relief either to the businesses or the masses be that as it may sheikh showed extreme courage to accept the position when relatively more competent shaukat tareen excused omer ayub also expressed his inability to become federal finance minister sheikh in his stint as finance minister during the previous pakistan peoples party s regime had to leave the post in disgust as he was forced to compromise on several economic issues due to political compulsions this time around the economic conditions are rather more precarious he will have to take some difficult decisions that might be politically damaging for the government will pm imran khan go with the tough decisions or resist asad umar was too awed by the personality of his party leader that he couldn t deviate from the limits defined for him sheikh is an experienced guy and more independent which could make things going uneasy for him as well as the government some more touchy questions are popping up what will happen to the much touted tax amnesty scheme will the government announce it with certain modifications or shelve it the economy as it is now will take at least two years to come back on track and that would be a herculean task requiring both commitment and prudent decisions on the part of the emergency installation undoubtedly the new economic head is capable of formulating prudent policies but a question is would the present regime show patience for two years or go for another option in the midway if the setup is again disturbed it would prove very unfortunate for the economy because sheikh as a veteran economist would hopefully plan a strategy that would have to be followed without any political compromises in the present cabinet shuffling only the ministers belonging to pakistan tehreek e insaf were changed or removed no changes were made in the ministries where the coalition partners were involved that either means such untouched ministers delivered according to the regime s program or were spared as it did not want to confront the opposition the new finance adviser is too well versed with the working of multilateral donor agencies in fact he has in the past been closely associated with the international monetary fund imf one can expect that he would negotiate a better deal with the imf and ensure compliance with the washington based lender s conditions

million of first quarter investment underlining their growing confidence in dubai s economy under the leadership of his highness sheikh mohammed bin rashid al maktoum vice president prime minister and ruler of dubai and follow up by h h sheikh hamdan bin mohammed bin rashid al maktoum crown prince of dubai and chairman of dubai executive council the government of dubai took decisive actions to accelerate the rate of economic growth in the emirate which reached 1 7 percent in the first half of 2018 major policy initiatives were introduced and contributed to reducing the cost of doing business boosting sme liquidity and supporting the tourism and the real estate sectors inflows of foreign direct investment fdi into dubai also accelerated and reached aed 38 5 billion in 2018 an increase of 41 percent over its 2017 level these and other initiatives contributed to accelerating growth during the second half of 2018 to 2 2 percent resulting in an overall real gdp growth rate in 2018 of 1 9 percent these achievements were realized despite the considerable headwinds that the world economy was facing in 2018 rising trade tensions declining growth in countries like china with commensurate relatively low oil prices and regional and global geopolitical risks including uncertainty about brexit had adverse effects on confidence and investment plans and reduced global growth and its prospects increased regional tensions further moderated global growth and prompted stock market sell offs amid increased risk aversion among investors unsurprisingly most international economic organisations including the world bank and the international monetary fund imf continued revising downward their global growth outlooks for 2018 and beyond in january 2019 his highness sheikh mohammed bin rashid announced his 50 year charter as has always been the norm his highness charter anticipated the challenges ahead and articulated a set of balanced integrated and flexible policy

exporters find new export markets for their products and services identify partners and estimate export costs
the sino congolaise des mines sicomines was the most significant chinese investment project in africa when it was agreed in 2007 it was confidently billed as the deal of the century the infrastructure agreement gave chinese partners mining rights to cobalt and copper in the democratic republic of congo drc these minerals are used in electric vehicle batteries and electronics including smartphones and laptops in exchange china agreed to build much needed infrastructure projects such as urban roads highways and hospitals in addition to new infrastructure the sicomines deal was expected to provide a significant boost to the drc s economic growth the view was that the agreed volumes of mineral production would contribute to higher levels of exports tax revenue and an inflow of us dollars mixed outcomes more than a decade on the sicomines deal has not lived up to expectations there have been infrastructure project delays as well as unexpected costs there have also been problems associated with poor quality roads and infrastructure and inadequate environment and social impact studies on the economic front mineral exports from the drc have indeed risen steeply but sharp cyclical fluctuations show that the country is heavily reliant on both the chinese market and the price of a few minerals in addition the sicomines deal won exemption from taxes until infrastructure and mining loans were fully repaid this means that the drc will not receive any substantial income from the agreement in the foreseeable future the sicomines agreement demonstrates one of the main problems with deals of this nature it never included any guarantee of the actual value that the congolese population would get in exchange for the country s main source of wealth the democratic republic of congo image istock as we argue in a recent international affairs article the sicomines deal provides lessons for other african countries future deals like this present an opportunity to change the model followed in sicomines and by most sino african trade relations this has to date essentially involved china supplying value added manufactured goods and high skilled workers in exchange african countries have agreed to export mainly primary based resource products and african workers are hired for unskilled low cost tasks it needn t be this way local communities neglected the first decade of the deal shows that chinese companies have focused their efforts on benefiting from access to valuable natural resources but the interests of local communities have been neglected in addition several of the problems affecting the building of infrastructure have arisen because quality control responsibility was assigned to the same two chinese companies responsible for execution these were china railway engineering company and sinohydro a large state owned hydropower and engineering company this highlights the potential trap of these deals the level of contribution to development depends to a great extent on the ability of inexpert local institutions to manage complex multilateral projects christine lagard head of the international monetary fund left greets the president of the democratic republic of congo felix tshisekedi at the imf headquarters in washington dc on april 5 the imf has raised concerns about the sicomines deal hurting the drc s ability to sustain its debt photo afp stephen jaffe imf there is a solution to this host countries should create committees of experts if necessary with regional and international support alternatively they could contract independent specialized consultants to guarantee that national interests are satisfied instead of negotiating with a unique consortium of companies these teams would participate in the development of a public procurement process to award the project to the most competitive bidder additionally the committees would be in charge of monitoring implementation of the contract this could include extraction works quality of infrastructure compliance with environmental and social standards learning through small pioneer initiatives china has shown that it is ready to take risks and engage in enormous african infrastructure development projects and that it s prepared to do this even when western donors are not willing to allocate funds to some extent china s favorable attitude towards deals such as the sicomines agreement is based on the same logic as the infrastructure loans received from japan in the 1980s these were mutually beneficial they fostered japan s development and they were very lucrative for japanese firms but there are many potential complications with the multi billion dollar resource backed credits offered by china to african countries recovering from conflict with this in mind african countries could take a more incremental approach they could foster development through a process of gradual reforms implemented through several pioneering small deals changes that are needed any new agreements should include precise objectives and financial resources to guarantee training and upskilling for workers in parallel the terms of the agreement should create the conditions for the transfer of know how in a way that helps local companies to move to higher value added activities african governments could take into account china s experience the chinese government decided that in some strategic sectors such as the automotive sector foreign investors had to create a joint venture with a chinese partner to enter the market this strategy has contributed to the emergence of several competitive domestic firms and national champions finally as economic diversification prompts an increase in gdp per capita additional taxes collected from extracting industries could be invested in other economic activities to promote development the model has the potential to enable projects that would otherwise be impossible in fragile and conflict affected african economies but the sicomines deal shows that it s necessary to address particular challenges if china s new financing schemes are to accelerate development in africa this story

debt level is higher than many of its peers which along with inconsistent cash flow can put more strain on its balance sheet in the long run the recovery in the crude oil price an appreciation in the canadian dollar and lower differential in the wcs wti spread can partially offset some of the weaknesses in the short term the companyâ s other international operations are expected to remain steady this year canada held its ground in q4 2018 calfrac has been strategically shifting its revenue base from canada to the u s in the past couple of years while revenues from canada accounted for 41 of its revenues in q1 2017 now accounts only for 29 of its revenues by the end of fy2018 calfracâ s total pumping horsepower decreased by 37 compared to fy2017 the western canada select or wcs to the west texas intermediate or wti crude oil price differential which significantly influences the canadian energy activity adversely affected fracking and pressure pumping activity which in turn reduced demand for pressure pumping services in fy2018 i will elaborate more on this and the other key industry drivers later in the article interestingly the situation did improve for the companyâ s operations in canada in q4 2018 a higher fracturing job count led to more active asset utilization horsepower deployment and coiled tubing units increased by 4 and 22 respectively in q4 2018 compared to a year ago however i cannot say that recovery has been underway because lower revenue per fracturing job in canada led to a 21 fall in revenues in that region from q3 to q4 while operating income from the canada operations dipped by 40 during the same period compared to a year ago the region did exhibit improvement in the performance due to lower proppant costs as the supply of sand improved although the trend started in q3 the benefits began trickling down during the end of q4 2018 in q1 calfracâ s performance typically stays subdued due to energy production slowdown in winter this year its management seems to be even more uncertain given the low visibility and therefore plans to adjust the fleet disposition based on the weather condition at the beginning of this year it suspended operations for one fleet in canada due to weaker demand for fracturing services although fleet utilization would remain unchanged pricing is likely to come down compared to q4 2018 in the long run canada will continue to be an essential part of energy production given the countryâ s supply of natural gas which is considered to be a clean energy option however in the near to medium term calfracâ s canada operations are likely to remain depressed due to the lack of takeaway capacity and regulatory burden some uncertainties remain over the resolution of federally approved projects while some progress has been made in projects like kinder morganâ s trans mountain expansion pipeline and enbridgeâ s line 3 the transcanada keystone xl remains in limbo there can be either a decline or limited increase in demand for fracturing services in canada as a result of the project delays in this context i will discuss three critical industry indicators the wcs wti crude price differential rig count in canada and the u s dollar canadian dollar foreign exchange movement these indicators signal the effects on calfracâ s revenues and earnings wcs wti price differential investors may note that western canada select or wcs which tracks heavy oil from canada typically trades at a discount relative to wti the lower price reflects quality issues as well as the cost of transport from alberta to refineries in the u s the wcs wti spread came down significantly during the end of q4 and has continued to stay a much lower level in q1 2019 the canadian governmentâ s initiative led to a production curtailment of 325 000 b d in january after a provincial government mandate capped production although energy production has increased since then the differential has lowered considerably since late 2018 wcs is currently trading at 9 5 barrel lower than the wti crude oil price while it was trading at a spread of more than a 12 barrel at the beginning of 2019 the spread is unlikely to return to the 2018 high anytime soon the lower differential in q1 2019 is expected to benefit calfracâ s financial performance in q1 canadian rig count weakens again according to baker hughesâ s rig count data the canadian rig count has declined by 29 in the past year until april 19 in contrast the u s rig count has remained nearly unchanged in the past year the drop in the canadian rig count could turn out to be a severe concern for the producers to maintain their operating cash flow as well as for the servicing companies although the rig count in canada was relatively resilient in q1 the decline if sustained will ultimately lead to lower production and lower capex spend by the producers which will affect the ofs companiesâ revenues and margin usd cad movement affects calfracâ s margin cfwff is exposed to foreign exchange risk associated with currencies including the u s dollar russian rouble mexican peso and argentinean peso the most significant among these is the usd cad relationship because on average the u s accounted for 57 of calfracâ s total revenues in fy2018 crude oil has a negative correlation with usd cad when oil goes up usd cad goes down since the beginning of 2019 the wti crude oil price has increased by 42 while the usd has depreciated by 2 3 during this period higher crude oil price is favorable for the canadian oil producers and hence is also beneficial for the ofs companies like cfwff investors may note that for each percentage change in the value of u s dollar calfracâ s net income is affected by cad 562 000 according to its 2018 annual report outlook in the u s in the u s calfrac operated 17 active fleets in 2018 while it exited 2018 with the same number of active fleets as in q3 2018 revenues in the u s declined by 22 from q3 to q4 due primarily to low asset utilization in q1 and q2 of 2019 the fleet count can reduce to a range between 13 and 17 as the upstream operators typically pause operations in north dakota and pennsylvania lower demand can lead to low asset utilization for up to five fleets in february estimates the company while utilization may increase in march the companyâ s management remains cautiously optimistic on its u s operations redeploying assets from canada where the upstream activity is likely to take a severe hit in q1 can still keep its fleets utilized but lower pricing can keep margin under pressure notwithstanding the real upside in the u s could be the revival of completions activity following the crude oil price recovery and the alleviation of the permian capacity bottleneck issue since the beginning of 2019 although drilled but uncompleted wells or duc have continued to grow 4 up until february it was more than matched by the growth in completed wells 11 up according to eiaâ s estimates the figures indicate a recovery in well completions activity which was fueled by a 42 rise in the west texas intermediate or wti crude oil price in 2019 so far outlook in argentina argentina has been calfracâ s strong performer revenues from argentina increased by 35 fy2018 compared to a year ago although sequentially quarter over quarter in q4 it did deteriorate the companyâ s management expects better results to come from this region in 2019 contracted work volumes can increase from argentina in 2019 the company also plans to transfer idled cementing assets from the u s to argentina debt level and cash flows in fy2018 calfracâ s cash flow from operations or cfo was cad 185 million which was a sharp improvement compared to a negative cfo in fy2017 on top of a 48 increase in revenues the companyâ s working capital improved in fy2018 due to lower accounts receivable and inventory balance partially offset by lower accounts payable calfracâ s cash and cash equivalents were cad 51 9 million on december 31 2018 it had cad 254 million available from its revolving credit facility as of december 31 recently the company increased its fy2019 capital budget to cad 149 million which means capex would remain unchanged in fy019 on december 31 2018 its net debt to adjusted ebitda was 2 9x while its debt to equity or leverage was 1 9x the companyâ s balance sheet is more leveraged than some of its peers in the industry trican well services otcpk tolwf tse tcw has a leverage of 0 09x while nabors industriesâ nbr leverage stands at 1 36x calfrac plans to reduce debt by using its free cash flows or fcf while its fcf improved in q4 2018 based on past several quarters the companyâ s fcf generation has been choppy the fcf volatility raises concern over its ability to meet the objective of debt reduction through fcf calfrac has cad 200 million of debt repayment obligation in 2020 while the majority of the repayment burden lies in 2026 cad 887 million with the available liquidity cash balance and undrawn revolving credit facility calfrac does not require additional external financing to meet its near term financial obligations however without further re financing it needs to improve cash flows significantly to meet its long term financial obligations what does the relative valuation say calfrac well services is currently trading at an ev to adjusted ebitda multiple of 4 7x according to sell side analystsâ estimates calfracâ s forward ev ebitda multiple is 5 8x from fy2013 to fy2018 the average ev ebitda multiple was 8 4x so it is currently trading at a discount to its past six year average calfracâ s forward ev to ebitda multiple expansion versus its adjusted trailing 12 month ev ebitda is steeper compared to the industry peersâ average multiple expansion which indicates the sell side analysts expect its ebitda is expected to decrease more steeply compared to the peersâ average in the next four quarters this would typically reflect in a lower current ev ebitda multiple compared to the peersâ average its ev ebitda multiple is lower than its peersâ nbr tcw and hp average of 7 9x whatâ s the take on calfrac canada continues to account for a significant part of calfracâ s business portfolio true the recovery in the crude oil price an appreciation in the canadian dollar and lower differential in the wcs wti spread can partially offset some of the weaknesses in the short term however the canadian crude oil market poses a more strategic challenge for calfrac delays and uncertainty over the construction of some of the large pipelines weaken canadaâ s outlook which has led to lower pressure pumping utilization and a decline in the related ofs services the companyâ s business in the u s was growing until q4 when the completions activity headwind and the crude oil price weakness leveled off but i expect the fall to be temporary as the top line and margin can pick up in the latter part of 2019 the companyâ s other international operations should also remain steady this year calfracâ s high leverage along with inconsistent cash flow can put a strain on its balance sheet in the long run overall the companyâ s management requires more stable revenue bases to maintain steady cash flow investing in the stock can be risky until the fundamental drivers alter significantly editor s note this article discusses

by ccn com a war torn country left to dust and drabbles is attempting to rise back with dignity and it plans to use bitcoin as its stick afghanistan asserted at a recent spring meetings summit that it was looking to issue sovereign bonds to raise 5 8 billion for its infrastructure projects khalil sediq the governor of the central bank of afghanistan told asia times that it would attempt to couple bitcoin with its mostly untapped 3 million worth lithium market the outcome would be a digitally signed government bond that could be issued to investors over the blockchain bitcoin against three decades of turmoil the announcement followed afghanistan s economic turmoil for the last three decades it started with a political coup in the 1970s that led to the assassination of then president mohammed dauod khan the tensions made way for the soviet union to invade afghanistan by the late 1980s the country had become victim to the power struggles between the soviets and the us when the soviets lost in 1989 the us left afghanistan in the hands of its then allies the taliban the wahabbi islamist group left no stone unturned to push the nation to the stone age they later became the mastermind behind the shocking september 11 attacks in the us that prompted washington to launch one of its longest wars against the taliban in an already shredded afghanistan the conflict is now in its eighteenth year such constant turmoils robbed the country of its potential economic opportunities afghanistan s gdp fell substantially during the 1980s owing to the loss of capital labor infrastructure trade and transport the nation s 25 percent population is now unemployed and lives under poverty the international monetary fund imf wrote in an analysis published november 21 2017 that afghanistan s external debt was at high risks the report revealed that the country s debt sustainability largely hinged on donor grants inflows which was 39 percent of the total gdp against substantial fiscal and external deficits it read even a gradual replacement of donor grants with loan financing a customized illustrative scenario would quickly lead to an unsustainable debt burden as a result the world bank imposed severe restrictions on afghanistan s non concessionary borrowing loans offered below a typical interest rate the move left the nation highly insufficient to begin or to sustain its mining and agricultural projects hopes sediq believed that bitcoin an innovative financial instrument could offer his country a way to access international markets the economist reasserted that there was a massive demand for lithium in the global market because of companies like tesla and others with bitcoin said sediq afganistan could allow the global investors to tap the potential of its abundant mineral reserves christine lagarde the managing director at the imf supported afghanistan on their move but suggested that bond issuance over blockchain should first go through a sandbox testing environment
the energy company pseg had a simple message for the new jersey legislature as it weighed the fate of three nuclear plants in the state what s good for new jersey is what s good for pseg ralph izzo the company s chairman president and ceo told the legislature at a december 2017 hearing in trenton what s bad for new jersey is bad for pseg and with rock bottom natural gas prices costly safety upgrades looming and energy usage flat the outlook for the plants was bleak he said within two years the salem 1 salem 2 and hope creek nuclear plants in south jersey would be cash negative and the company would have to close them izzo said hundreds of people would lose their jobs and the state would lose a source of cleaner energy generation forcing it to rely more heavily on natural gas but the legislature could avert that izzo said to keep the plants open pseg would need about 300 million in subsidies over the next three years it would be a safety net for the company s nuclear operations in new jersey izzo said it would not he emphasized be a bailout on thursday regulators in new jersey are scheduled to decide whether pseg has shown that it needs the subsidies which would be paid for through a surcharge on all customer bills in the state if the board of public utilities approves the requests new jersey would join two other states illinois and new york in giving nuclear power plants hundreds of millions of dollars in order to stay competitive in the wholesale energy market the campaign for the subsidies took to the pages of the state s largest newspaper the star ledger this week a full page ad on monday signed by the employees of the salem and hope creek plants and another on tuesday signed by eight former new jersey governors praised the subsidy plan and warned of the consequences of not acting we have seen the devastating impacts to families communities and the environment as nuclear plants in other states have closed the employee ad said at the end of the day we believe that the contributions made by salem and hope creek are much too important to live without the payments are designed to compensate nuclear plants for the clean energy they supply to the state new jersey has been given an opportunity to preserve its safe productive nuclear plants the former governors wrote we would be wise to take it a spokeswoman for pseg marijke shugrue said the company had paid for the ads but that the idea to show support for nuclear energy came from the employees and the former governors nuclear power comes of age the nuclear power industry is grappling with a new reality brought on by the natural gas boom of the early 2000s the country began commercially generating electricity from nuclear power in the late 1950s production ramped up in the 60s which means many of the nation s plants are nearing the end of their 40 year licenses or operating under 20 year extensions today there are 98 nuclear reactors at 60 plants in the united states according to the federal energy information administration seven plants have been retired since 2013 including the oyster creek plant in new jersey more plants have announced plans to close in the coming years given how rapidly things have changed even for the nuclear industry that s been pretty stable and just operating in the united states for the last 40 years or so they re caught off guard by these changing market conditions said kristy hartman of the national conference of state legislatures and co author of a report on state efforts to keep nuclear plants open natural gas use has grown in part because of the shale revolution where technology allowed developers to use fracking to extract previously untappable deposits of the fossil fuel flooding the market and driving down prices natural gas has been so cheap it s driven down the cost of wholesale power overall said mark szybist senior attorney at the natural resources defense council that makes it difficult for nuclear power to be profitable there is a trend that s real in 2018 the united states generated about 4 18 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity from all sources of energy some 64 of that came from fossil fuels including 35 from natural gas collectively renewables such as solar power provide about 17 of the nation s energy roughly 19 came from nuclear energy according to the eia the industry has maintained its foothold in large part by finding more efficient ways to operate and shortening the amount of time required for maintenance and refueling but it has had to adapt on other fronts as well in recent years the nuclear power industry has ramped up efforts to cultivate influence with legislators and alliances with environmentalists the industry s gains thus far haven t been easy or cheap in new jersey pseg spent nearly 4 million over the course of 2017 and 2018 lobbying the legislature on the nuclear subsidies by comparison groups lobbying on marijuana legalization the other big issue of the last two legislative sessions spent 1 7 million according to the state election law enforcement commission new york and illinois put in place subsidies in 2017 and new jersey established a nuclear subsidy last year as part of a package of legislation aimed at meeting the state s goal of 100 clean energy by 2050 legislators in pennsylvania and ohio are considering similar measures and this month maryland authorized a study to consider if nuclear energy should be eligible for clean energy credits in each state the push for subsidies has come after warnings that the plants would have to close but critics of the programs say that in many instances the plants are profitable and the companies are using scare tactics to bully legislators into subsidizing shareholder profits they rattled their saber many times said abe scarr state director of illinois public interest research group a consumer organization that opposed the subsidies regardless of whether it was a bluff or not certainly their threats were a ploy to build pressure on illinois decision makers threatening to close plants in the name of shareholder profits is a tactic stefanie brand director of the new jersey division of rate counsel a state appointed advocate for utility customers said she hadn t seen before it s a level of coercion that is really unprecedented brand said in an emailed response pseg spokeswoman shugrue said the company believes the applications demonstrated unequivocally that all three of our plants meet the requirements to receive the zero emissions credit or zec and as we have previously announced if we don t get the for all three plants we will shut them down shugrue wrote in the email on monday pseg said it would not participate in the upcoming auction to provide power to the wholesale market without assurances it would receive the subsidies the company said its plants would close before the end of the three year period for which it would be bidding at the auction shugrue said she said pseg had to decide by tuesday whether to participate in the auction and that the timing of the company s announcement three days before the bpu decides on the subsidies was merely coincidental a market trend if new jersey becomes the model for a nuclear industry perfecting its survival strategy the plans in new york and illinois were prototypes those states took different paths to bolstering the nuclear power industry one by gubernatorial fiat the other through legislative battle yet both secured massive payouts for nuclear companies new york went first in november 2015 new orleans based power company entergy announced plans to close the james a fitzpatrick nuclear power plant an 838 megawatt facility in oswego with more than 600 employees the move came after negotiations with state officials came up empty within weeks gov andrew m cuomo directed the state department of public service to create a clean energy standard to ensure that by 2030 half of the power in new york would come from renewable sources he also directed the agency to prevent nuclear plants upstate from retiring early the agency implemented the zero emissions credit program which would impose a monthly surcharge on customer bills to pay nuclear utilities subsidies totaling 7 6 billion over a 12 year period entergy ultimately sold the fitzpatrick plant to exelon one of the largest power companies in the country utilities used to be monopolies producing the power and selling it to customers but in the 1990s several states decided to restructure their markets requiring companies to sell the power they generate on a wholesale market where utility companies shop for the best deal pseg for example generates electricity through its psg power subsidiary and sells it to consumers through its utility arm pse g the market is run by power grid operators which ensure the grid has power available when utilities need it new york operates its own market while new jersey is in pjm interconnection along with several other mid atlantic states and parts of illinois in illinois exelon executives had watched its plants profits decline for years in 2013 it said two facilities quad cities a 1 900 megawatt plant along the mississippi river and clinton a 1 069 megawatt plant in dewitt county were in financial trouble and might need contracts or other support to ensure the plants remained opened a chicago tribune analysis months later showed that none of the six plants the company owned in illinois had turned a profit since 2008 it s not that nuclear power is very expensive to operate it s just natural gas is much cheaper said doug vine senior fellow at c2es a climate change think tank the market has done a good job for consumers delivering low cost electricity but it s missing out on the environmental part of the equation the market doesn t reward any particular generator for having the attributes we desire exelon pushed for a subsidy for its illinois nuclear plants backing a bill that would have created a zero emission standard to keep the plants online then attorney general lisa madigan denounced the legislation as outrageous harmful to consumers and a bailout for the nuclear provider and its subsidiary utility company comed the legislature has more important matters to address than padding comed and exelon s profits she said at the time the day after that bill failed exelon announced plans to retire the clinton and quad cities plants but before that could happen the company took one last shot at securing a subsidy some environmental and consumer activists worried that they might miss an opportunity to influence the legislation were willing to enter negotiations with the utility and other groups to try to make the subsidy idea viable from a political point of view they couldn t pass what they wanted without our coalition which included a whole bunch of environmental groups consumer groups and labor groups as well said david kolata executive director of the citizens utility board of illinois a consumer advocate organization the board was opposed to the plan initially but over the course of negotiations it came on board as protections for consumers and plans to bolster energy efficiency were added he said it s not like we liked every element of it but at the end we felt it was something worthy of our support kolata said in december 2016 the assembly passed the future energy jobs bill which in addition to other energy reforms offers 235 million in annual subsidies to nuclear power plants the plans in new york and illinois both have been challenged by opponents who say the programs interfere with the wholesale energy markets but courts have allowed the plans to proceed and on monday the supreme court declined to hear the challenges new jersey enters the fray in new jersey brand s office saw the fighting coming its way we knew that the company was going to be seeking subsidies but we didn t know exactly what it was going to look like said brand who has led the office since 2007 pseg was watching closely too it had seen what states had done for other nuclear companies a few things were already in the company s favor the state had a long history with nuclear power as home to oyster creek in lacey township on the jersey shore which for 49 years was the oldest operating nuclear plant in the country before it closed in 2018 the exelon owned facility which began operating in 1969 was so integral to the area that the township has an atom on its coat of arms on the other side of the state pseg s hope creek and salem plants sit along the delaware river in salem county they make up the second largest nuclear facility in the country generating around 3 500 megawatts of electricity enough to power 3 million homes pseg owns hope creek outright and it shares ownership of salem with exelon those plants employ more than 1 500 people and are economic anchors in the county which is represented in the state legislature by the senate president stephen sweeney since 2015 however natural gas has accounted for the majority of the state s electricity generation according to the eia nuclear companies feeling the squeeze from natural gas are looking to state and federal regulators for potential solutions the trump administration has tried unsuccessfully to secure bailouts for coal and nuclear plants citing national security concerns on the state front pseg exelon and firstenergy which owns two nuclear plants in ohio spent around 5 2 million in 2017 and 2018 lobbying in new jersey over the nuclear plant legislation according to the state election commission opponents including aarp the nj petroleum council and the nj coalition for fair energy spent about 4 7 million lobbying against the subsidy aarp state advocacy director evelyn liebman said the group lobbied against the subsidy because it prioritized nuclear energy over lower energy prices from natural gas for customers the surcharge would add an additional 35 to 45 a year to typical residential bills according to brand s office the state s largest commercial customers who pay millions of dollars in a year in energy costs would see their annual costs go up on average by 570 000 according to comments from the new jersey large energy users coalition what we re seeing in these other states and now in new jersey was the industry coming to the state and asking for a handout not because they were losing money on these plants but because their profits weren t as high as they wanted them to be liebman said corporate political contributions aren t allowed in new jersey but pseg employees have established psexec pac a state political action committee that supports state and local candidates senate president sweeney and assemblyman john mckeon were among the main sponsors of legislation aimed at subsidizing the state s nuclear plants during the 2017 election cycle psexec pac contributed 15 000 to sweeney who was running for reelection against fran grenier an employee at pseg s salem plant the 20 million legislative race was the most expensive in state history experts said the pac contributed 900 to mckeon during that period pseg ratcheted up the pressure announcing that it would cancel any investments in salem that weren t required by law or necessary for safe operation in calls to investors izzo said that pseg welcomed a test to prove they needed a subsidy but that if states wouldn t sufficiently value the benefits of nuclear energy pseg would close the facilities we re not trying to pull a wool over anybody s eyes izzo said in a call on march 6 2017 i m just telling you that it s not a difficult decision for us as a company to retire the assets if they re not achieving their cost of capital brand who routinely does battle with utility companies seeking higher rates said in an interview this month that the tactics used in the subsidies fight felt different they always argue give us what we want and we ll create jobs she said but it s give us what we want or i m going to close these plants though the subsidy would go to pseg s nuclear power arm the surcharge would be collected from all new jersey electricity customers no matter who provides their power brand said a bill in late 2017 had proposed collecting 0 004 per kilowatt hour from customers to compensate nuclear plants for being a cleaner energy source outgoing gov chris christie a republican said he would sign the bill as long as it wasn t larded up with any environmental initiatives brand s warning language became more urgent with each successive version of the legislation she called the plan a flagrant transfer of wealth and lambasted lawmakers for the rushed process and sloppy legislative language that would come back to haunt us she invoked images of residential customers constituents squeezed by high utility bills who can t afford to cool their homes in the summer or businesses priced out by the cost of electricity bills i wish cared more about their customers but i understand that they consider their shareholders their first priority she told legislators but you were elected by your constituents your job is to put them first new jersey decides the bill that ultimately became law reflected the changing political climate in new jersey the stand alone plan to benefit nuclear power never made it to christie s desk instead newly elected gov phil murphy a liberal democrat whose campaign championed restoring environmental protections signed a pair of bills in may 2018 aimed at bolstering the state s efforts to rely wholly on clean energy by 2050 one bill sought to expand the state s renewable energy programs by among other things setting goals for offshore wind energy storage and energy efficiency and creating a community solar program the other required the state board of public utilities to create a zero emissions certificate program to provide a subsidy for nuclear plants that are at risk of closing within three years the strategy that worked in illinois and new york had worked in new jersey signing these measures represents a down payment to the people of new jersey on the clean energy agenda i set forth at the beginning of my administration murphy said signing the bills in may the law laid out a tight timetable less than a year to hold public hearings set up the program accept applications and identify eligible plants brand s office was not given automatic access to the documents pseg was submitting to prove it deserved the subsidies instead she had to petition the attorney general to see the documents ultimately brand and a consultant were given access if approved the payments would begin this month and run at least until 2022 with a potential three year extension already the industry is taking its lessons to other states in pennsylvania lawmakers introduced legislation proposing a 500 million subsidy that could benefit the state s five nuclear plants including three mile island the site of a 1979 partial meltdown exelon said it plans to close that plant in september unless it receives support
advertisement the philippines is set to become an upper middle income economy this year thanks to the assistance of multilateral lenders such as the world bank finance secretary carlos dominguez iii said dominguez said the world bank s generous support for the philippines sustainable development programs was a key factor in helping it secure an upper middle income economy status in 2019 three years ahead of its targeted schedule for many decades the world bank helped many emerging economies achieve sustainable development this year as the bank celebrates its 75th year we are proud to announce that the philippines will achieve the status of an upper middle income nation ahead of schedule the bank shares much credit for this achievement dominguez said during the philippine day forum held last week at the grand hyatt hotel in washington d c finance secretary carlos dominguez iii the event was organized by the world bank with support from citi standard chartered bank and ubs to share with leaders of the american business community the philippines growth story and the progress that the country achieved over the recent years of implementing reforms to power its economy under the duterte administration the government had targeted to achieve the upper middle income status by 2022 and become a high income economy by 2040 it also aimed to bring down poverty incidence from 21 6 percent in 2015 to just 14 percent by the end of president rodrigo duterte s term three years from now advertisement based on the world bank s criteria for the fiscal year 2019 an upper middle income country should have a gross national income per capita of 3 896 to 12 055 the philippines is currently classified as a lower middle income country with gni per capita of 996 to 3 895 high income economies are those with a gni per capita of 12 056 or more dominguez said with the resilience it had displayed under an inclusive economy which posted a gdp growth rate of 6 2 percent last year despite uncertainties of a looming trade war a sharp spike in oil prices and an elevated domestic inflation rate the philippines was poised to reach upper middle income status ahead of target this year today the philippines is one of the fastest growing economies in the world reaching this milestone in our development story is attributable to many years of hard work especially in building a strong fiscal position and a bureaucracy honed to the task of catalyzing growth he said he said that over the last three years president duterte had delivered resoundingly on his socioeconomic reform agenda that emphasized continuation of pro market macroeconomic policies a progressive tax reform program improvement in the ease of doing business a more transparent and responsive government increased investments in our human capital and enhancement of peace and order dominguez said the decreased crime volumes across the board the establishment of the bangsamoro autonomous region for muslim mindanao a comprehensive tax reform program now reaping benefits for both the people and the government and a massive build build build infrastructure modernization program demonstrated how the duterte administration had delivered on its program of government
a generation ago the national debt stood at just a smidgen over usd 4 trillion and a young presidential candidate named bill clinton was discussing a great plan he had to have it entirely paid off by now oops the national debt is now 5 5 times bigger more than anything this astoundingly bad public policy is the fault of barack obama undoubtedly the most irresponsible president in our history who added on more to the national debt than all other presidents combined in an orgy of washington dc debauchery that saw the size of the federal government mushroom while hundreds of thousands of new bureaucrats were added to federal payrolls and washington dc housing prices skyrocketed as federal government employees and private industry sub contractors paid for by the government reveled in their six figure paychecks and outrageously lavish healthcare and pension plans all paid for by us the taxpayers unwarranted trust obama s stewardship of our national finances was truly obscene but george w bush was nearly as bad he has even less of an excuse in fact because he had a republican congress to work with for most of his eight years during that time bush took us from usd 5 8 trillion to usd 10 trillion something that seemed reckless at the time of course in light of the obama usd 10 trillion spending extravaganza bush looks prudent by comparison how is it that we supposedly elect the best and the brightest to represent us in washington dc why do americans fail to understand how ruinous our national debt truly is and what an astounding percent of our budget we spend on interest people with law and medical degrees and mbas from ivy league universities people that come from the finest law practices and accounting firms and consultancies and banks and financial institutions in the country and our end result is the debt avalanche we now have before us why do we believe politicians of either party when they tell us that they will make our national debt a top priority why is it that the american people seem to fail to understand how ruinous our national debt truly is and what an astounding percent of our national budget we are now spending on servicing that debt interest is adding up former pennsylvania governor ed rendell has penned an op ed which presents some eye opening statistics as to just how bad our national debt really is by next year the cost of servicing the national debt paying interest on it will exceed the cost of medicare by 2025 it will exceed the cost of our military spending making it the most expensive item in our entire national budget yikes today s high school and college students are well versed in a whole host of social justice topics courtesy of their marxist professors how much would you venture to bet that they hear little to nothing about the national debt and what it means for american workers and families and even more importantly do they understand why and how we have gotten here today s campus culture social justice themes include the right to free healthcare and education transgender bathrooms the need for safe spaces the enforcement of campus speech codes designed to make sure that no one ever gets their feelings hurt a robust and comprehensive policy on identifying and denouncing inappropriate halloween costumes and a stale and tired marxist discourse on the exploitative nature of american capitalism but when was the last time college students ever got together to protest a usd 22 trillion and rising national debt do they understand the threat even and even more importantly do they understand why and how we have gotten here corrupt politics quite simply we have arrived at this point by spending infinitely more than we collect in tax revenue mainly on things that have no mention in the constitution as being a function of the federal government public sector unions and the millions of workers and hundreds of millions of dollars that they spend every year to support the democratic party play a fundamental role in not only our ruinous levels of federal debt but the debt crisis facing our state and local governments as well nothing is more ruinous to our future than the ever increasing demands of government employees specifically public sector union employees such as those at afscme and the seiu they live like kings and queens on the backs of actual working class people all the while donating hundreds of millions of dollars to the democratic party to ensure that their six and seven figure paychecks never run dry it is not merely their salaries but it s also the highly lucrative nature of their healthcare and pension plans they couldn t care less about government budgets or the national debt or actual working class people they couldn t care less about public service there are only two things that public sector unions care about soaking the rest of us for the biggest paychecks possible and shoveling money to socialist politicians like bernie sanders and elizabeth warren but it is not merely their salaries and the fact that government employees rarely if ever get fired it s the highly lucrative nature of their healthcare and pension plans plans to which they contribute far less than their private sector counterparts for states these plans have proved a bitter pill to swallow and have led to the greatest fiscal crisis in the united states that you have most likely never heard about unfunded pension liabilities when you drill down into the details it is almost impossible to believe that the situation is true essentially states promise outrageously generous pensions to state employees who of course rally to support whichever candidate promises them the most money and then fail to fund those very plans kicking the can down the road to future administrations and generations the snowball keeps getting bigger now it amounts to a usd 6 trillion crisis for the libertarian and conservative movements it s time to stand for fiscal responsibility and common sense it s time to stand against government employees and their demands and explain to the american people that the government is spending their money on entirely unconstitutional read illegal things it s time to take a strong stand against the public sector unions like afscme and the seiu that are leading this country to fiscal ruin and more than anything it s time to force trump to actually live up to his promise of draining the swamp reigning in the excess and beginning to drastically reduce the size of our bureaucratic state firing large numbers of government employees these government employees are driven by self interest it is hard to envision government employees stepping back from the situation and saying well i have a pretty generous salary healthcare and pension it s far more generous than the private sector enjoys and we are 22 trillion in debt and the government is spending too much money so as much as it pains me to say me and some other government employees should lose our jobs the government is spending too much money deficits and debt are growing and i should go look for a job in the private sector that is never going to happen public sector unions are a millstone around our neck and as many commentators have noted they have no natural enemies except of course for citizen watchdog groups and independent media outlets who are not afraid to denounce them and point out their ruinous nature i for one will not rest until we return our government to the vision of the founding fathers who would not have approved of any of this let s start by ending the department of education the department of housing and urban development the department of energy and the department of agriculture that would be a good start we could use the money we saved to begin paying off our national debt and government employees would have to do something that the vast majority of real working class people have to do every day compete in a highly competitive free market economy to earn our daily bread this article is reprinted with permission from panam post

saudi arabia and the united arab emirates said on sunday they had agreed to send sudan us 3 billion worth of aid throwing a lifeline to the country s new military leaders after protests led to the ousting of president omar al bashir the two gulf arab countries will deposit us 500 million with the sudanese central bank and send the rest in the form of food medicine and petroleum products their state news agencies said in parallel statements the aid comes amid wrangling between the transitional military council tmc and protesters and opposition groups who are demanding that civilians lead a two year transitional period the protesters who have kept up a sit in outside the defence ministry since bashir was removed on april 11 they have demonstrated in large numbers over the past three days pressing for a rapid handover to civilian rule tmc head abdel fattah al burhan told state tv that the formation of a joint military civilian council one of the activists demands was being considered the issue has been put forward for discussion and a vision has yet to be reached he said the role of the military council complements the uprising and the blessed revolution said mr burhan adding that the tmc was committed to handing power over to the people but a coalition of protesters and opposition groups said the tmc was not serious about handing over power to civilians describing the council as an extension of the old regime we have decided to opt for escalation with the military council not to recognise its legitimacy and to continue the sit in and escalate the protests on the streets mohamed al amin abdel aziz of the sudanese professional association told one of the largest crowds outside the defence ministry kobar prison burhan also confirmed for the first time that bashir and a number of former officials including presidential aide nafie ali nafie acting party head ahmed haroun and former first vice president ali osman taha are being held at a high security prison in khartoum north all of them are at kobar prison he said adding that a large number of symbols of the former regime suspected of corruption will stand trial burhan said authorities had found 7 million euros us 7 8 million in bashir s home along with us 350 000 slightly more than previously reported the aid from saudi arabia and the united arab emirates is the first major publicly announced assistance to sudan from gulf states in several years this is to strengthen its financial position ease the pressure on the sudanese pound and increase stability in the exchange rate the saudi press agency said sudan s state news agency said the central bank strengthened the sudanese pound to 45 pounds to the dollar from 47 5 in a measure that coincided with the sharp rise in the price of the pound against the dollar on the parallel market the two gulf states have ties with burhan and his deputy mohamed hamdan dagalo through their participation in the saudi led coalition fighting in yemen sudan has been suffering from a deepening economic crisis that has caused cash shortages and long queues at bakeries and petrol stations analysts have blamed the crisis on economic mismanagement corruption and the impact of us sanctions as well as the loss of oil revenue when south sudan seceded in 2011 in october 2017 the united states lifted some trade and economic sanctions on sudan but sudan remained on the list of countries that the united states considers to be sponsors of terrorism burhan said a committee could travel to the united states for discussions about lifting sudan from the list by next week washington has said sudan will not be removed from the list as long as the military is in power the designation makes sudan ineligible for desperately needed debt relief and financing from international lenders the united states agreed in november to talks with bashir s government on how to get sudan removed from the list but no resolution was reached before his overthrow over the last few years sudan s cash short government expanded money supply to cover the cost of expensive subsidies on fuel wheat and pharmaceuticals causing annual inflation of 73 per cent and the sudanese pound to plunge against the dollar us 1 0 8891 euros reuters
a perfect california day the sun was shining a gentle breeze was blowing and at a silicon valley coffee shop rep ro khanna was sitting across from one of his many billionaire constituents discussing an uncomfortable subject the growing unpopularity of billionaires and their giant tech companies there s some more humility out here khanna d calif said the billionaire on the other side of the table let out a nervous laugh chris larsen was on his third start up and well on his way to being one of the wealthiest people in the valley if not the world realizing people hate your guts has some value he joked for decades democrats and republicans have hailed america s business elite especially in silicon valley as the country s salvation the government might be gridlocked the electorate angry and divided but america s innovators seemed to promise a relatively pain free way out of the mess their companies produced an endless series of products that kept the u s economy churning and its gross domestic product climbing their philanthropic efforts were aimed at fixing some of the country s most vexing problems government s role was to stay out of the way now that consensus is shattering for the first time in decades capitalism s future is a subject of debate among presidential hopefuls and a source of growing angst for america s business elite in places such as silicon valley the slopes of davos switzerland and the halls of harvard business school there is a sense that the kind of capitalism that once made america an economic envy is responsible for the growing inequality and anger that is tearing the country apart on a quiet weekday at a strip mall coffee shop the conversation between khanna and larsen turned to what went so wrong americans still loved technology khanna said but too many of them felt locked out of the country s economic future and were looking for someone to blame what happened to us he imagined people in these left behind places asking part of khanna s solution was to sign on as co chairman of the presidential campaign of sen bernie sanders i vt the democratic socialist who rose to the national stage by railing against the handful of billionaires who control the economic and political life of this nation and who disproportionately live in khanna s district the other part of khanna s solution was to do what he was doing now talking to billionaire tech executives like larsen who worried that the current path for both capitalism and silicon valley was unsustainable boosted by a cryptocurrency spike last year larsen s net worth had briefly hit 59 billion making him the fifth richest person in the world before the currency s value fell without an intervention he worried that wealth would continue to pile up in silicon valley and anger in the country would continue to grow it seems like every company in the world has to be here larsen said it s just painfully obvious that the blob is getting bigger at some point larsen and khanna worried something was going to break the 2008 financial crisis may have revealed the weaknesses of american capitalism but it was donald trump s election and the pent up anger it exposed that left america s billionaire class fearful for capitalism s future rep ro khanna d calif talks to bernie sanders before the senator from vermont takes the stage in sanders khanna whose district includes silicon valley found a candidate who shared his diagnosis of the country s most vexing problems inequality and the failures of unrestrained capitalism middle of a revolution khanna was elected in 2016 just as the anxiety started to spread in europe far right nationalist parties were gaining ground closer to home socialists and trump inspired nationalists were winning state and congressional elections conversations of the sort that khanna was having with larsen were now taking place in some of capitalism s most rarefied circles including harvard business school where last fall seth klarman a highly influential billionaire investor delivered what he described as a plaintive wail to the business community to fix capitalism before it was too late the setting was the opening of klarman hall a new 120 million conference center built with his family s donation it s a choice to pay people as little as you can or work them as hard as you can he told the audience gathered in the 1 000 seat auditorium it s a choice to maintain pleasant working conditions or harsh ones to offer good benefits or paltry ones if business leaders didn t ask hard questions about capitalism he warned that they would be asked by ideologues seeking to point fingers assign blame and make reckless changes to the system six months after that speech klarman was struck by how quickly his dire prediction was coming to pass leading politicians such as trump sanders and sen elizabeth warren d mass were advocating positions on tariffs wealth taxes and changes in corporate governance that would have been unthinkable a few years ago klarman wasn t opposed to more progressive taxation or regulation but he worried that these new proposals went much too far i think we re in the middle of a revolution not a guns revolution but a revolution where people on both extremes want to blow it up and good things don t happen to the vast majority of the population in a revolution he said he wasn t the only one who felt a sense of alarm one of the most popular classes at harvard business school home to the next generation of fortune 500 executives was a class on reimagining capitalism seven years ago the elective started with 28 students now there were nearly 300 taking it during that period the students had grown increasingly cynical about corporations and the government said rebecca henderson the harvard economist who teaches the course what the trust surveys say is what i see she said they are really worried about the direction in which the u s and the world is heading a few dozen of those students spent their winter break reading winners take all a book by anand giridharadas a journalist and former mckinsey consultant that had hit the bestseller list and was provoking heated arguments in places like silicon valley davos and harvard business school giridharadas book was a withering attack on america s billionaire class and the notion that america s iconic capitalists could use their wealth and creativity to solve big social and economic problems that have eluded a plodding and divided government this spring giridharadas took his argument to klarman hall he slammed mark zuckerberg taking aim at the facebook founder s 100 million effort to fix newark s faltering schools and his 3 billion push to end disease in a generation i m glad he s trying to get rid of all the diseases i wish facebook wasn t a plague giridharadas said he trashed starbucks ceo howard schultz s independent presidential run as an effort to protect the interests of the uber wealthy and he lambasted the notion frequently championed by the likes of bill gates and barack obama that silicon valley s innovations would disrupt old hierarchies and spread capitalism s rewards really giridharadas asked now five companies control america instead of 100 and a lot of those companies are whiter and more male than the ones they disrupted for many of the students schooled in the notion that business could make a profit while making the world a better place giridharadas ideas were both energizing and disorienting erika uyterhoeven a second year student recalled one of her fellow classmates turning to her when giridharadas was finished so what should we do her colleague asked is he saying we shouldn t go into banking or consulting added another student there was a palpable sense of personal desperation runaway capitalism khanna experienced a version of this desperation almost every day in his district he grew up in an overwhelmingly white middle class suburb of philadelphia after college and yale law school he moved to silicon valley in 2003 hoping to use his training as a lawyer to help set the rules for a lawless online world in 2014 backed by the tech community and a long roster of billionaire donors khanna challenged an eight term incumbent in a democratic primary and lost the defeat caused him to reflect on what he had missed in particular the problems that runaway capitalism were causing in his district where the median home value in formerly blue collar cities surged past 2 million the best thing that happened to me was that i lost my 2014 election he said had i won maybe i would ve been a traditional neoliberal it really forced my self reflection and it pointed out every weakness i ever had in california khanna s home is a small apartment around the corner from a dollar tree one of only two in his district his wife and two children live most of the year in washington where home values are cheaper his days are split between meetings with billionaires and his many constituents who are struggling to stay afloat amid silicon valley s success i am an 11 year renter with a master s degree a teacher told him at a meeting with school employees her question wasn t about whether she would ever be able to afford a home but about a fellow teacher who couldn t afford health insurance a few days earlier he had met with two activists who wanted his help pressuring big tech companies to pay contract janitorial and cafeteria workers a living wage khanna agreed to host a press event on their behalf the billionaires in khanna s district meanwhile were consumed by a different worry mixed in with the valley s usual frothy optimism about disruption and inventing the future was a growing sense that the tech economy had somehow broken capitalism the digital revolution had allowed tech entrepreneurs to build massive global companies without the big job producing factories or large workforces of the industrial era the result was more and more wealth concentrated in fewer hands as technology advanced some feared things were only going to get worse robots were eliminating much factory work online commerce was decimating retail and self driving cars were on the verge of phasing out truck drivers the next step was computers that could learn and think what happens if you can actually automate all human intellectual labor said greg brockman chairman of openai a company backed by several silicon valley billionaires such thinking computers might be able to diagnose diseases better than doctors by drawing on superhuman amounts of clinical research said brockman 30 they could displace a large number of office jobs eventually he said the job shortages would force the government to pay people to pursue their passions or simply live only andrew yang a long shot presidential candidate and tech entrepreneur supported the idea of government paying citizens a regular income but the idea of a universal basic income was discussed regularly in the valley the prospect was both energizing and terrifying openai had recently added an ethicist brockman sometimes referred to her as a philosopher to its staff of about 100 employees to help sort through the implications of its innovations to brockman a future without work seemed just as likely as one without meat a possibility that many in the valley viewed as a near certainty once we have meat substitutes as good as the real thing my expectation is that we re going to look back at eating meat as this terrible immoral thing he said the same could be true of work in a future in an era of advanced artificial intelligence we ll look back and say wow that was so crazy and almost immoral that people were forced to go and labor in order to be able to survive he said a blueprint for opportunity khanna heard such prophecies all the time but mostly discounted them as sci fi fantasy his focus was on fixing the version of capitalism that existed today he often pleaded with big tech executives to spend just 10 percent of their time thinking about what they could do for their country and 90 percent to their companies the tougher question was exactly what he wanted them to do with that 10 percent on a warm spring evening khanna was trying to answer that question for about two dozen silicon valley tech executives software engineers and venture capitalists the group gathered at a 5 million mediterranean style villa perched atop a hill overlooking cupertino which glittered in the valley below khanna described a december trip he organized to tiny jefferson iowa for a group of tech executives that included microsoft s chief technology officer and a linkedin co founder the executives donated to the community college s scholarship fund and paid to equip its computer lab with the goal of training 25 to 35 students for software developer jobs starting at 65 000 a year khanna had made similar trips to west virginia ohio and kentucky the total number of jobs these trips produced was small and the pay wasn t great still khanna believed they served a larger purpose they proved that people in silicon valley cared about places like jefferson a rural town of only 4 200 they gave people hope that even the remotest parts of america could take part in the country s tech revolution the next step khanna told the executives at the mansion in cupertino california was a 100 million effort to build 50 technology institutes similar to land grant colleges to train workers in left behind parts of america khanna had already introduced a bill that he admitted was unlikely to pass but that wasn t really the point it sets a blueprint he said khanna s blueprint reflected his broader view of how to unite an increasingly polarized country many democrats blamed trump s victory and the country s divisions on racial tensions as the nation grew more diverse and whites lost their favored positions khanna had a different view he saw the country s problems primarily as the product of growing income inequality and a lack of opportunity sometimes khanna imagined what people in these left behind parts of the country were thinking their grandparents had fought in world war ii and helped build the country s industrial age economy now they worried people like khanna whose parents emigrated from india were surging past them they just got here and they are doing really really well khanna imagined these people saying what happened to us not everyone at the tech gathering was buying khanna s analysis atam rao a nuclear engineer told khanna that he had come to the united states from india 50 years earlier rao s son who founded a successful video game company in los angeles was born in america the day after trump was elected his son suggested shifting some money to a bank account in india just in case they needed to return someday are we welcome here he said his son asked he believed that khanna was underestimating the racial anger in the country they found someone to blame rao said of trump and his backers this is not going to be won by logic but that wasn t the america khanna knew it didn t fit with his experience growing up in suburban philadelphia or arriving in silicon valley where indians had become rock stars and ceos of companies such as google and it didn t comport with the results of the 2018 election he said now speaking directly to rao the same country that elected trump just elected the most diverse congress in the country s history khanna said khanna didn t deny the problem of racism but like sanders he saw the country s divisions primarily through the prism of capitalism s shortcomings and the economy not race a few days after the meeting at the cupertino mansion khanna was standing in front of 16 000 amped up sanders supporters the san francisco skyline rose in front of him and the golden gate bridge spanned the bay behind him in his gray suit and pressed white shirt the two term congressman looked a bit out of place an emissary from establishment washington crashing someone else s revolution khanna gave a brief speech introducing sanders who a few minutes later rushed onto the stage and into the same campaign spiel he had been delivering since the 2016 democratic primaries he bashed the billionaire class and its influence over american elections democracy means one person one vote and not billionaires buying elections sanders yelled in his brooklyn growl we say no to oligarchy he continued yes to democracy khanna s eyes fixed on steve spinner a big tech investor in silicon valley and major fundraiser for obama s 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns spinner who chaired khanna s congressional win was listening with his arms folded across his fleece vest we dragged him out here khanna said he s about as far from bernie as you can get many of khanna s billionaire supporters even those who worried about capitalism and inequality seemed genuinely puzzled by khanna s affection for sanders for khanna it was simple in sanders khanna found a candidate who shared his diagnosis of the country s most vexing problems inequality and the failures of unrestrained capitalism sanders wasn t a perfect match for khanna sanders didn t really understand the tech industry though he wasn t calling for the breakup of big tech companies like warren and some other candidates warren s proposal if executed would hurt companies in khanna s district and alienate some of his wealthiest backers khanna wished sanders would talk more about the greatness of the american economy and the power of the tech industry when properly taxed and regulated to lift people out of poverty but on that score khanna believed he could help sanders we can quibble over his plans to solve this issue or that issue khanna said but i have no doubt that if bernie sanders was in the white house he d wake up every day thinking how do i solve structural inequality in america the 77 year old socialist s speech had passed the one hour mark and the crowd was still laughing cheering hooting and shouting we re probably not going to get a lot of support from the one percent and the large profitable corporations sanders said a voice in the crowd screamed an expletive that s ok sanders continued i don t need and we don t want their support the congressman in the gray suit gazed out at the crowd which stretched to the back of the park khanna saw sanders revolution as an imperfect solution to a near impossible problem for now though it was the best he could find first published in the washington post

poor people fed up is arguably the most f amous lyrics of the poor people s governor bounty killer aka rodney price this call to arms is not just a cry for more of the country s scarce benefits rather it is an umbrella statement that rings true for the majority of jamaicans who continue to exist on the margins many of us accept the tenet that for the rich to exist they must live on the backs of the poor unfortunately this umbilical linkage exists despite classic economic theories and contrite religious promises that a better day is around the corner for poor people poverty is not just a case of money in the bank but extends to a paucity of opportunities to enrich the mind and bolster one s self esteem and self worth successive governments have touted the trickle down theory as the solution to help poor people climb the ladder obviously that has not worked is the new balm in gilead the just announced bubble up theory in the colonial plantation state backra massa had the bushas and church leaders to keep the masses in check and accept their state of poverty as their natural lot before salvation this perpetuation has become the purview of our politicians whose primary concern is to maintain state power as a means of becoming the new kings of the fiefdom by promising that manna soon come from heaven the church and the politicians continue to massage the ego of the poor with pregnant platitudes that speak of a better tomorrow we have been lulled into complacency by the teaching of the bible in matthew 5 which proclaims that blessed are the poor for they shall inherit the kingdom of god the bible s archaic but well meaning pronouncement ignored the fact that being poor is more than just the amount of money that a person has headlines delivered to your inbox sign up for

according to the uk based think tank oxford poverty and human development initiative one step forward four steps back after more than a century since emancipation and many decades after adult suffrage and more than half a century of independence the majority of jamaicans remain in a slough of poverty with no life raft in sight yes some of us escaped the cane field when we passed our common entrance

shoemaker and dressmaker are being made redundant with the proliferation of cheap imports from china japan and the usa because of international free trade agreements our political leaders are impotent to protect poor people and pull them out of perpetual poverty without decent work and pay there can be no dignity for the poor but man haffi eat a food so instead of the cutlass the fork and the hoe young men following in the myth of how david killed goliath turned to the slingshot before graduating to the ratchet knife and the ultimate weapon of choice the gun we continue to rain tears of sorrow when another person gets murdered but we soon forget them because our uptown social conditions and sensibilities are camouflaged by towering high rise apartments the new cathedrals surrounded by freshly laid cyaapets gifted by our new gods the chinese as long as the international monetary fund and its tangential linkages continue to heap cheap loans on us the rich will remain happy with our stunted growth and questionable inflation rates while poor people remain fed up until there is qualitative and quantitative change for the poor their only salvation seems to be a passport and a visa

university of adelaide in south australia not accepted he went directly to knock at the dean s door i struggled to use all the english words i knew about wine the 30 year old man recalled the dean was i think more surprised than persuaded but he agreed to let me have a try he said it was the start of yuan s story of wine now he is marketing officer with nova vita a wine group in adelaide hills of south australia in the past years he saw a boost of wine trade between china and australia according to wine australia australian wine producers exported 2 82 billion australian dollars worth of product to the world about 2 billion u s dollars last year of which 40 percent was sold to china an increase of 18 percent from the previous year no longer luxury wine which appeared more on the screen than on dinner tables in china s ordinary families three decades ago was once seen as an icon of petty bourgeois after china s reform and opening up people s living standard is improved and the population of middle class is on the rise with the increase of international exchanges wine became an ordinary drink with everyday dishes in many families yuan visited his father s friend in 2010 in adelaide i was attracted by the vineyard he said after graduation he found a job in nova vita when the wine company was about the march into chinese market in australia the demand of wine was not as high as the supply therefore more than half of the products would be exported as a chinese i joined the company at the right time he said nova vita was founded in 1999 now the company boasts more than 66 hectares of vineyard and could produce two million bottles of wine in the recent years our sales growth rate was about 80 percent yuan said during my first visit most of the inquiries are about entry level wine what i call everyday drinking wine about 3 australian dollars a bottle mark kozned managing director of nova vita said now most of the inquiries about wine are mid level something you can have at home with dinner or with good friends or for premium wine which people tend to use for gift giving especially around mid autumn festival or the chinese new year kozned said chinese bond growing kozned has visited china for more than 25 times since 2012 with the most recent visit the china international import expo ciie last year ciie last year was a fantastic event it was well put on both by the chinese government and the organizer he told xinhua i was impressed that the chinese business people from around china that visited really wanted to do some business he added our achievement from the ciie was that we gained three to four potential clients and during the event we actually signed contracts we discussed with three other parties post ciie to send the wine in the next three to four months he said since participation of the ciie nova vita has received orders for more than a dozen containers of wines to china according to the australian trade and investment commission china is the world s third largest market for imported wine behind the united states and germany the china australia free trade agreement further reduced the tariff of australian wine to china to zero it made australian wine in chinese market more and more competitive we are closing on france as the no 1 wine supplier in volume into the chinese market kozned said australia has also attached great importance to chinese market last year wine australia promoted australian wine in china with more than 100 companies involved australia wine reached not only metropolis like beijing and shanghai but also smaller cities currently nova vita has two branches in china in east china s zhejiang province and southwest china s chongqing municipality yuan whose hometown is in zhejiang spends several months each year in china doing business more chinese people joined in australian wine companies yuan said i graduated in 2013 when i was the only one of more than 10 chinese students to land a full time job now that the chinese students majoring in wine business haven t graduated yet but most of them have received job offers he said more than just a job the bond between china and australia wine is so close that chinese people are not satisfied with just becoming employees in wine companies guo song arrived in australia in 2007 two years later he bought the jarressa estate with friends in retrospect he said that in the past three years sales of wine in chinese market grows at a rate of about 50 percent in 2018 jarressa sold more than 10 million bottles of which 96 percent were sold to china he also said that china is also affecting the wine industry in australia chinese people prefer red wine to the white and the preference affected grape planting here he said with china s development and further opening up guo saw the wine industry as very promising whereas kozned believed that the wine like an important bridge between china and australia he has decided to attend the second ciie this year we will spend more time in preparation and put on better presentation he said the second time you will always do things better he added australia is to have the federal election in may however kozned said that no matter who wins and however the international trade environment changes the wine trade between china and australia will continue to boom we are like two brothers china and australia he said
by tawanda musarurwa the zimbabwe electricity supply authority holdings zesa s request for a 30 percent increase in electricity tariff may be underpinned by a need for sustainable electricity generation but the real problem may even not be the tariff per se a 2016 world bank study titled making power affordable for africa and viable for its utilities identifies incremental tariff increases as one of several solutions that can help address viability concerns for electricity producers the study showed that removing inefficiencies cannot expand electricity access hence tariffs must be increased to allow utilities to expand their reach and this is exactly what zesa is suggesting although government has already turned down the suggestion zesa holdings group acting chief executive officer engineer patrick chivaura said recently that the proposed 30 percent tariff increase is necessary to ensure the country continues to enjoy a steady supply of electricity as it will allow for energy infrastructure rehabilitation and expansion the country s sole electricity producer and distributor has also said the proposed adjustment will align the tariff to the prevailing exchange rate following the introduction of an inter bank foreign currency market by the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz in february we want to review those tariffs in accordance with the monetary policy statement that was made which brought a dimension of 1 2 5 rate of rtgs dollars compared to united states dollars said engineer chivaura so it s not an increase in tariff as such but we do have inputs like coal inputs like diesel those have gone up significantly we are not enjoying rebate yet on diesel because we use a sizable volume of diesel at hwange power station and at any other smaller power station and because of that we will review the tariff but as indicated earlier the government has rejected the proposed tariff increase on the basis of affordability zesa has been seeking to get a tariff increase for the better part of this decade with the zimbabwe energy regulatory authority zera turning down an application in 2016 which would have taken the electricity tariff beyond what the world bank defines as affordable at the time zesa had asked for a 49 percent tariff increase which would have taken the tariff from usc9 86 kwh to usc14 69 kwh the world bank defines affordable electricity as 30kwh of electricity that costs no more than five percent of a household s income and in 2016 the zimbabwe national statistical agency calculated the country s poverty datum line at between 430 and 574 for an average household of five depending on location provincial statistics nevertheless whatever the justifications for a tariff increase or an incremental tariff increase such as eskom s annual price increases zesa may need to reconsider its tariff model a study by university of zimbabwe economics lecturer dr takawira mumvuma asserts that the power authority s current pricing model has been rendered unworkable in terms of ensuring future infrastructure refurbishment by the extensive debts owed to it by consumers despite implementing prepaid electricity which reduces wastage as it allows households to dictate their own electricity usage and also improves debt recovery corporates and households arrears to zesa are still in excess of 1 billion blame can also be equally apportioned to the rate of return ror price determination model which only caters for revenue collection meant to cover recurrent expenditure but not capital expenditure which is very high for zesa the implicit assumption built in the ror methodology is that infrastructure rehabilitation and development should be met from the returns on assets which is pegged at 8 5 percent of the net asset value however zesa has not been able to get a return due to the inability of consumers to pay even if the consumers where in a position to pay the 8 5 percent of the net asset value it is still inadequate to improve the dilapidated power generation transmission and distribution infrastructure given the fact that the funding needs of zesa are in excess of us 8 billion all things being equal an effective tariff rate should cover operating costs while simultaneously allowing for some capital expenditure observers have said a mere tariff hike is inadequate to help zesa implement significant infrastructure rehabilitation and expansion in view of an apparently unrecoverable debtors book government has put in concerted efforts to rehabilitate dilapidated power infrastructure aimed at restoring system stability and security notably the us 1 4 billion hwange power station 7 and 8 expansion project where construction work has since commenced when complete the project will add 600 megawatts to the national power grid and is anticipated to create over 3 000 jobs at the peak of its implementation in 2021 but more still needs to be done a significant power supply demand gap still exists which can only be offset through significant new investment in power generation infrastructure sunday mail
the rebound in retail sales underscores that the domestic outlook remains favourable and well supported by the labor market and it dispels the misguided concerns that the us economy is slipping into recession said kathy bostjancic head of us macro investor services at oxford economics in new york on thursday the commerce department said retail sales surged 1 6 per cent in march the biggest increase since september 2017 after dropping 0 2 per cent in february economists polled by reuters had forecast retail sales accelerating 0 9 per cent last month with march s rebound retail sales have now erased the plunge in december that put consumer spending and the overall economy on a sharply lower growth trajectory retail sales last month were probably lifted by tax refunds even though they have been smaller than in previous years following the revamping of the us tax code in january 2018 excluding automobiles gasoline building materials and food services retail sales rebounded 1 0 per cent in march after declining 0 3 per cent in february these so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of economic activity and is being buoyed by a tightening labor market that is driving up wage growth advertisement a separate report from the labor department before the long easter weekend holiday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 5 000 to a seasonally adjusted 192 000 for the week ended april 13 the lowest level since september 1969 claims have now declined for five straight weeks economists had forecast claims rising to 205 000 in the latest week though the trend in hiring has slowed job gains remain above the roughly 100 000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working age population the reports boosted the dollar against a basket of currencies stocks on wall street were mixed while us treasury prices rose as a result of march s strong core retail sales the atlanta fed raised its first quarter gdp estimate by four tenths of a per centage point to a 2 8 per cent annualized rate growth forecasts for the january march quarter have been upgraded from as low as a 0 5 per cent rate following the recent trade inventories and construction spending data the economy grew at a 2 2 per cent pace in the fourth quarter advertisement stronger growth in the first quarter will probably not change the view that the economy will slow this year as the stimulus from a us1 5 trillion tax cut package diminishes and the impact of interest rate hikes over the last few years lingers it also is unlikely to have any impact on monetary policy after the fed recently suspended its three year campaign to tighten monetary policy the central bank dropped projections for any rate hikes this year after increasing borrowing costs four times in 2018 key downside risks to us growth are fading from view said allison nathan an economist at goldman sachs in new york while we still think the next fed move is much more likely to be a hike than a cut we ve pushed back our forecast for the next hike from the first quarter to the fourth of next year goldman sachs has lifted its growth estimate for the second half of 2019 by 25 basis points to 2 5 per cent despite the recent wave of relatively strong data business surveys suggest pockets of weakness persist especially in manufacturing a third report on thursday from the philadelphia fed showed factory activity in the mid atlantic region slowed in april and manufacturers were less optimistic about business and labor market conditions over the next six months that was corroborated by a fourth report from data firm ihs markit showing its measure of national factory activity was unchanged near a two year low in early april with the survey s gauge of factory employment dropping to its lowest level since june 2017 many of the hard readings on activity suggest that the economy started picking up momentum late in the first quarter but this is not evident in much of the recent survey data said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york reuters
lenin moreno president of ecuador source es wikipedia org the election also comes midway through president moreno s four year term and will be seen as a measure of his popularity opinion polls published this month showed moreno s approval rating has plummeted continuing a year long decline cuenca ecuador sectional elections will be held throughout ecuador this sunday march 24 2019 at stake are the election in all 24 of the country s provinces of prefects the highest elected official in a province mayors and urban and rural municipal council seats the election occurs in the context of a stagnating ecuadorian economy the government of president lenín moreno has implemented budget cuts and layoffs and also negotiated new loan agreements with the international monetary fund and world bank to deal with ecuador s budget deficit and national debt ecuador opec s smallest producing member country nevertheless the government receives significant income from oil exports and has suffered in recent years from low oil prices the election also comes midway through president moreno s four year term and will be seen as a measure of his popularity opinion polls published this month showed moreno s approval rating has plummeted continuing a year long decline president moreno has broken sharply with the politics of his predecessor former president rafael correa moreno had worked closely with correa for many years served as correa s vice president for 6 years from 2007 to 2013 and narrowly won election as president with correa campaigning for him despite all this moreno dramatically turned against correa only months after being elected president moreno accused the correa and his government of rampant corruption running up the national debt and cronyism in government and judicial appointments including the stacking ecuador s highest courts since then government prosecutors have been investigating correa for allegedly ordering the kidnapping of an opposition lawmaker who was hiding from ecuadorian justice in colombia as well as allegations of corruption correa was ordered to appear in court in ecuador and when he declined offering to testify via video link instead a warrant was issued for correa s arrest numerous figures in correa s administration have been and are being prosecuted on corruption charges moreno s own vice president jorge glas a close associate of correa was arrested tried for corruption convicted and is now in prison glas has continued to insist he is innocent and at one point went on a long hunger strike while in prison this past january a story damaging to glas was published was r that a telecommunication company named teleconet had agreed to return 13 5 million to invested by glas uncle to the government of ecuador because it was said to be corrupt money ecuador requested that interpol issue an arrest warrant for correa who currently lives in belgium but interpol rejected the request stating that the evidence presented wasn t strong enough to order the arrest of the former president interpol practically said that ecuador s case against correa was likely politically motivated moreno has returned to neoliberal economic policies as reflected in the loan agreements negotiated with the international monetary fund and world bank in sharp contrast to correa s severing of relations with those institutions he has also changed the country s geopolitical orientation and warmed relations with the united states eschewing correa s anti imperialist rhetoric while turning away from former leftist allies such as venezuela bolivia and cuba moreno has recognized u s backed juan guaidó as the interim president of venezuela moreno has sought dialog consensus and compromise with many of ecuador s diverse political factions including those representing the oligarchy and moneyed classes rather than adopt correa s more combative approach while moreno has changed many policies and moved markedly to the right he has also sought to retain some credibility in left circles too in an interview moreno claimed he was a new type of socialist using the ideology of the right to produce while the government distributes equitably and helps the poor according to the ideology of the left he has also sought to be seen as a champion against government corruption a deeply rooted problem with a very long history highlighted by the prosecutions of leading figures from correa s government and even his own moreno has won praise from the u s and its allies the corporate media has lauded his new approach as a restoration of democratic norms including freedom of the press as opposed to their narrative about correa s dictatorial and undemocratic tendencies however his popularity among ecuadorians has taken a nose dive from 75 percent approval in early 2018 to only 30 percent in the very recent poll two ecuadorian s polling organizations cedatos and pefiles de opinion announced their findings at a press conference on march 7th the population realizes that this economic restructuring was not taking place this real fight against corruption was not taking place and that made the approval of the president turn downward said polibio córdova president of cedatos according to a report by the reuters news service perfiles de opinion s director paulina recalde revealed that its survey found that 80 percent of respondents believe that the government is on the wrong road though president moreno will not be on the ballot in sunday s elections nor will any seats in the national assembly be up the president s party alianza pais ap has a lot to lose it along with allied parties currently holds the majority of the prefectures mayor s offices and local council seats in the country ap by itself has 11 of the 24 prefects 67 of 221 mayors and 527 of 1305 council seats in the country by comparison the party with the next most sectional offices avanza get moving a centrist party with a social democratic ideology loosely allied with alianza pais has 36 mayors 196 council seats but only 1 prefecture avanza holds no seats in the national assembly partido social christiano psc social christian party and movimiento suma united society for more action movement creo is the party of guillermo lasso a banker who narrowly lost to moreno in the presidential runoff of 2017 lasso is again considered to be a top contender for president in 2021 the psc s jaime nesbot the mayor of guayaquil is another potential presidential candidate suma is the party of quito mayor mauricio rodas another popular politician on the ecuadorian right the party has recently led militant anti mining struggles to prevent environmental destruction and water pollution pachakutik will be trying to hold on to it s 4 precfectures 23 mayor s offices and 92 council seats it will challenged in its stronghold of manabi province by correista candidates sunday s election will also feature a local referendum in giron on whether residents approve of mining in that area the referendum became controversial when the moreno government sought to stop it on technical grounds however an initial judicial victory by the government was reversed by a higher court and the referendum will go forward the ecuadorian constitution specifies that development decisions such as areas open to mining and the sale of mining concessions to multi national corporations are to be made by the national government so the results of the giron referendum are advisory only ecuador is a multi party democracy with a lot of political parties many are regional and not influential at the national level the ecuadorian political spectrum is skewed to the left in comparision to the electoral spectrum in the united states liberalism on the left of the electoral spectrum in the u s is a right of center ideology in ecuadorian politics because of its strong advocacy of capitalist economics parties in the center of the ecuadorian political spectrum tend to identify themselves as social democratic progressive or populist the left of the electoral spectrum in ecuador is occupied by parties which identify with some variant of socialist politics it should be noted however that the larger parties that identify themselves as socialist have not sought to nationalize industries nor pushed policies to transition from a capitalist economy to a socialist dominated economic system the correistas did very little along those lines when they were in power only smaller socialist and communist ecuadorian parties advocate moving now to further nationalize industry ecuador founded a national oil company 42 years ago and it is currently called petrorecuador ecuador s oil industry remains open to the private sector and also to multi national corporations most experts expect that alianza pais will suffer substantial losses in sunday s elections if that occurs the question is which parties those of the right center or left will benefit the most also how will this election set the stage for the 2021 presidential election voter turnout will be high as voting is compulsory in ecuador for literate people ages of 18 to 65 though the voting franchise extends to all those over the age of 16

that is tearing the country apart on a quiet weekday at a strip mall coffee shop the conversation between khanna and larsen turned to what went so wrong americans still loved technology khanna said but too many of them felt locked out of the country s economic future and were looking for someone to blame what happened to us he imagined people in these left behind places asking part of khanna s solution was to sign on as co chairman of the presidential campaign of sen bernie sanders i vt the democratic socialist who rose to the national stage by railing against the handful of billionaires who control the economic and political life of this nation and who disproportionately live in khanna s district the other part of khanna s solution was to do what he was doing now talking to billionaire tech executives like larsen who worried that the current path for both capitalism and silicon valley was unsustainable boosted by a cryptocurrency spike last year larsen s net worth had briefly hit 59 billion making him the fifth richest person in the world before the currency s value fell without an intervention he worried that wealth would continue to pile up in silicon valley and anger in the country would continue to grow it seems like every company in the world has to be here larsen said it s just painfully obvious that the blob is getting bigger at some point larsen and khanna worried something was going to break the 2008 financial crisis may have revealed the weaknesses of american capitalism but it was donald trump s election and the pent up anger it exposed that left america s billionaire class fearful for capitalism s future rep ro khanna d calif talks to bernie sanders before the senator from vermont takes the stage in sanders khanna whose district includes silicon valley found a candidate who shared his diagnosis of the country s most vexing problems inequality and the failures of unrestrained capitalism middle of a revolution khanna was elected in 2016 just as the anxiety started to spread in europe far right nationalist parties were gaining ground closer to home socialists and trump inspired nationalists were winning state and congressional elections conversations of the sort that khanna was having with larsen were now taking place in some of capitalism s most rarefied circles including harvard business school where last fall seth klarman a highly influential billionaire investor delivered what he described as a plaintive wail to the business community to fix capitalism before it was too late the setting was the opening of klarman hall a new 120 million conference center built with his family s donation it s a choice to pay people as little as you can or work them as hard as you can he told the audience gathered in the 1 000 seat auditorium it s a choice to maintain pleasant working conditions or harsh ones to offer good benefits or paltry ones if business leaders didn t ask hard questions about capitalism he warned that they would be asked by ideologues seeking to point fingers assign blame and make reckless changes to the system six months after that speech klarman was struck by how quickly his dire prediction was coming to pass leading politicians such as trump sanders and sen elizabeth warren d mass were advocating positions on tariffs wealth taxes and changes in corporate governance that would have been unthinkable a few years ago klarman wasn t opposed to more progressive taxation or regulation but he worried that these new proposals went much too far i think we re in the middle of a revolution not a guns revolution but a revolution where people on both extremes want to blow it up and good things don t happen to the vast majority of the population in a revolution he said he wasn t the only one who felt a sense of alarm one of the most popular classes at harvard business school home to the next generation of fortune 500 executives was a class on reimagining capitalism seven years ago the elective started with 28 students now there were nearly 300 taking it during that period the students had grown increasingly cynical about corporations and the government said rebecca henderson the harvard economist who teaches the course what the trust surveys say is what i see she said they are really worried about the direction in which the u s and the world is heading a few dozen of those students spent their winter break reading winners take all a book by anand giridharadas a journalist and former mckinsey consultant that had hit the bestseller list and was provoking heated arguments in places like silicon valley davos and harvard business school giridharadas book was a withering attack on america s billionaire class and the notion that america s iconic capitalists could use their wealth and creativity to solve big social and economic problems that have eluded a plodding and divided government this spring giridharadas took his argument to klarman hall he slammed mark zuckerberg taking aim at the facebook founder s 100 million effort to fix newark s faltering schools and his 3 billion push to end disease in a generation i m glad he s trying to get rid of all the diseases i wish facebook wasn t a plague giridharadas said he trashed starbucks ceo howard schultz s independent presidential run as an effort to protect the interests of the uber wealthy and he lambasted the notion frequently championed by the likes of bill gates and barack obama that silicon valley s innovations would disrupt old hierarchies and spread capitalism s rewards really giridharadas asked now five companies control america instead of 100 and a lot of those companies are whiter and more male than the ones they disrupted for many of the students schooled in the notion that business could make a profit while making the world a better place giridharadas ideas were both energizing and disorienting erika uyterhoeven a second year student recalled one of her fellow classmates turning to her when giridharadas was finished so what should we do her colleague asked is he saying we shouldn t go into banking or consulting added another student there was a palpable sense of personal desperation runaway capitalism khanna experienced a version of this desperation almost every day in his district he grew up in an overwhelmingly white middle class suburb of philadelphia after college and yale law school he moved to silicon valley in 2003 hoping to use his training as a lawyer to help set the rules for a lawless online world in 2014 backed by the tech community and a long roster of billionaire donors khanna challenged an eight term incumbent in a democratic primary and lost the defeat caused him to reflect on what he had missed in particular the problems that runaway capitalism were causing in his district where the median home value in formerly blue collar cities surged past 2 million the best thing that happened to me was that i lost my 2014 election he said had i won maybe i would ve been a traditional neoliberal it really forced my self reflection and it pointed out every weakness i ever had in california khanna s home is a small apartment around the corner from a dollar tree one of only two in his district his wife and two children live most of the year in washington where home values are cheaper his days are split between meetings with billionaires and his many constituents who are struggling to stay afloat amid silicon valley s success i am an 11 year renter with a master s degree a teacher told him at a meeting with school employees her question wasn t about whether she would ever be able to afford a home but about a fellow teacher who couldn t afford health insurance a few days earlier he had met with two activists who wanted his help pressuring big tech companies to pay contract janitorial and cafeteria workers a living wage khanna agreed to host a press event on their behalf the billionaires in khanna s district meanwhile were consumed by a different worry mixed in with the valley s usual frothy optimism about disruption and inventing the future was a growing sense that the tech economy had somehow broken capitalism the digital revolution had allowed tech entrepreneurs to build massive global companies without the big job producing factories or large workforces of the industrial era the result was more and more wealth concentrated in fewer hands as technology advanced some feared things were only going to get worse robots were eliminating much factory work online commerce was decimating retail and self driving cars were on the verge of phasing out truck drivers the next step was computers that could learn and think what happens if you can actually automate all human intellectual labor said greg brockman chairman of openai a company backed by several silicon valley billionaires such thinking computers might be able to diagnose diseases better than doctors by drawing on superhuman amounts of clinical research said brockman 30 they could displace a large number of office jobs eventually he said the job shortages would force the government to pay people to pursue their passions or simply live only andrew yang a long shot presidential candidate and tech entrepreneur supported the idea of government paying citizens a regular income but the idea of a universal basic income was discussed regularly in the valley the prospect was both energizing and terrifying openai had recently added an ethicist brockman sometimes referred to her as a philosopher to its staff of about 100 employees to help sort through the implications of its innovations to brockman a future without work seemed just as likely as one without meat a possibility that many in the valley viewed as a near certainty once we have meat substitutes as good as the real thing my expectation is that we re going to look back at eating meat as this terrible immoral thing he said the same could be true of work in a future in an era of advanced artificial intelligence we ll look back and say wow that was so crazy and almost immoral that people were forced to go and labor in order to be able to survive he said a blueprint for opportunity khanna heard such prophecies all the time but mostly discounted them as sci fi fantasy his focus was on fixing the version of capitalism that existed today he often pleaded with big tech executives to spend just 10 percent of their time thinking about what they could do for their country and 90 percent to their companies the tougher question was exactly what he wanted them to do with that 10 percent on a warm spring evening khanna was trying to answer that question for about two dozen silicon valley tech executives software engineers and venture capitalists the group gathered at a 5 million mediterranean style villa perched atop a hill overlooking cupertino which glittered in the valley below khanna described a december trip he organized to tiny jefferson iowa for a group of tech executives that included microsoft s chief technology officer and a linkedin co founder the executives donated to the community college s scholarship fund and paid to equip its computer lab with the goal of training 25 to 35 students for software developer jobs starting at 65 000 a year khanna had made similar trips to west virginia ohio and kentucky the total number of jobs these trips produced was small and the pay wasn t great still khanna believed they served a larger purpose they proved that people in silicon valley cared about places like jefferson a rural town of only 4 200 they gave people hope that even the remotest parts of america could take part in the country s tech revolution the next step khanna told the executives at the mansion in cupertino california was a 100 million effort to build 50 technology institutes similar to land grant colleges to train workers in left behind parts of america khanna had already introduced a bill that he admitted was unlikely to pass but that wasn t really the point it sets a blueprint he said khanna s blueprint reflected his broader view of how to unite an increasingly polarized country many democrats blamed trump s victory and the country s divisions on racial tensions as the nation grew more diverse and whites lost their favored positions khanna had a different view he saw the country s problems primarily as the product of growing income inequality and a lack of opportunity sometimes khanna imagined what people in these left behind parts of the country were thinking their grandparents had fought in world war ii and helped build the country s industrial age economy now they worried people like khanna whose parents emigrated from india were surging past them they just got here and they are doing really really well khanna imagined these people saying what happened to us not everyone at the tech gathering was buying khanna s analysis atam rao a nuclear engineer told khanna that he had come to the united states from india 50 years earlier rao s son who founded a successful video game company in los angeles was born in america the day after trump was elected his son suggested shifting some money to a bank account in india just in case they needed to return someday are we welcome here he said his son asked he believed that khanna was underestimating the racial anger in the country they found someone to blame rao said of trump and his backers this is not going to be won by logic but that wasn t the america khanna knew it didn t fit with his experience growing up in suburban philadelphia or arriving in silicon valley where indians had become rock stars and ceos of companies such as google and it didn t comport with the results of the 2018 election he said now speaking directly to rao the same country that elected trump just elected the most diverse congress in the country s history khanna said khanna didn t deny the problem of racism but like sanders he saw the country s divisions primarily through the prism of capitalism s shortcomings and the economy not race a few days after the meeting at the cupertino mansion khanna was standing in front of 16 000 amped up sanders supporters the san francisco skyline rose in front of him and the golden gate bridge spanned the bay behind him in his gray suit and pressed white shirt the two term congressman looked a bit out of place an emissary from establishment washington crashing someone else s revolution khanna gave a brief speech introducing sanders who a few minutes later rushed onto the stage and into the same campaign spiel he had been delivering since the 2016 democratic primaries he bashed the billionaire class and its influence over american elections democracy means one person one vote and not billionaires buying elections sanders yelled in his brooklyn growl we say no to oligarchy he continued yes to democracy khanna s eyes fixed on steve spinner a big tech investor in silicon valley and major fundraiser for obama s 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns spinner who chaired khanna s congressional win was listening with his arms folded across his fleece vest we dragged him out here khanna said he s about as far from bernie as you can get many of khanna s billionaire supporters even those who worried about capitalism and inequality seemed genuinely puzzled by khanna s affection for sanders for khanna it was simple in sanders khanna found a candidate who shared his diagnosis of the country s most vexing problems inequality and the failures of unrestrained capitalism sanders wasn t a perfect match for khanna sanders didn t really understand the tech industry though he wasn t calling for the breakup of big tech companies like warren and some other candidates warren s proposal if executed would hurt companies in khanna s district and alienate some of his wealthiest backers khanna wished sanders would talk more about the greatness of the american economy and the power of the tech industry when properly taxed and regulated to lift people out of poverty but on that score khanna believed he could help sanders we can quibble over his plans to solve this issue or that issue khanna said but i have no doubt that if bernie sanders was in the white house he d wake up every day thinking how do i solve structural inequality in america the 77 year old socialist s speech had passed the one hour mark and the crowd was still laughing cheering hooting and shouting we re probably not going to get a lot of support from the one percent and the large profitable corporations sanders said a voice in the crowd screamed an expletive that s ok sanders continued i don t need and we don t want their support the congressman in the gray suit gazed out at the crowd which stretched to the back of the park khanna saw sanders revolution as an imperfect solution to a near impossible problem for now though it was the best he could find first published in the washington post
a perfect california day the sun was shining a gentle breeze was blowing and at a silicon valley coffee shop rep ro khanna was sitting across from one of his many billionaire constituents discussing an uncomfortable subject the growing unpopularity of billionaires and their giant tech companies there s some more humility out here khanna d calif said the billionaire on the other side of the table let out a nervous laugh chris larsen was on his third start up and well on his way to being one of the wealthiest people in the valley if not the world realizing people hate your guts has some value

first a review of last week s events eur usd most experts 65 expected that the pair would go down this forecast was supported by signals from a third of the oscillators indicating that the pair was overbought all this happened the weekly amplitude of fluctuations was about 100 points and the low was fixed at 1 1225 perhaps the fall of the euro on thursday april 18 would not have been so strong if it had not been for the short working week before catholic easter when many banks and exchanges were closed on good friday the main reasons for the fall were disappointing market data on business activity in the eurozone and dollar friendly data on retail sales in the united states on friday evening the european currency however managed to win back some of the losses and the pair completed the week at 1 1240 gbp usd this pair showed a slightly larger amplitude 140 points at the same time the experts indicated the precise low to which it should sink actually with the forecast at 1 2985 the pair felt the bottom at the horizon 1 2978 inside the support zone which it has been unsuccessfully trying to break through for two months already usd jpy some experts expected the growth of this pair some thought it would fall however fluctuations with a maximum range of 40 points can hardly be attributed to bullish or bearish trends for the whole week we were able to observe the classic sideways trend which started at 112 00 and ended at 111 92 cryptocurrencies as has been said many times the cryptocurrency movement is largely motivated by the news background which this week was mildly positive the guru involved in the crypto business continued to repeat the mantra of the imminent rise of bitcoin for example tom lee a former financial analyst at jpmorgan and now co founder of fundstrat global advisors said that given the success of the first cryptocurrency this spring bitcoin s exchange rate to the dollar will show growth throughout the year and reach 10 000 by its end and according to the head of the bitmex exchange arthur hayes in just a few years we will see btc usd quotes around 50 000 the main positive news of the week in our opinion was the message that the world bank and the international monetary fund jointly launched an internal cryptocurrency so far only for the educational purposes of their employees but as they say the first step is the hardest as for our forecast it came true almost 100 the standard cryptocurrency stayed in the range of 4 975 5 370 adding about 3 5 over the week ethereum eth usd and litecoin ltc usd showed an increase of about 4 but the growth of ripple xrp usd was less than 2 as for the forecast for the coming week summarizing the opinions of a number of analysts as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis we can say the following eur usd the world economy is moving towards recession and much in europe depends on how well eu leaders can withstand the negative trends it is not only about how the political situation will develop in the eu countries and not only about how the ecb will behave in an effort to stabilize the economic situation in the euro area but also about how for example the us china trade negotiations will end and how president trump will behave after that many analysts believe that today europe is prepared for the global economic recession and external attacks worse than other economic blocs the past week brought the euro back within the 15 week downward channel and 70 of experts supported by graphical analysis on h4 believe that the european currency will continue to give up its positions falling to the zone of the 2019 lows 1 1175 1 1185 it is only 30 of analysts that hope that the pair will be able to return to 1 1325 at the same time attention should be paid to the data on the us gdp which will be published on friday april 26 according to forecasts the gdp growth will be only 1 8 which is significantly lower than the previous value of 2 2 if this prediction turns out to be correct bulls can move the pair to the next target at the height of 1 1420 gbp usd the pair completed the previous five days in the support zone of 1 2975 which it has been trying to break through for eight weeks already most experts 75 believe that it will succeed and will be able to descend to the zone of 1 2770 1 2830 however some analysts hope that amid the dovish rhetoric of the ecb and the us federal reserve the bank of england will nevertheless decide to raise the interest rates one can add to this the still persistent euphoria caused by the delay of brexit taken together these factors let the bulls hope for the pair to return above the 1 3100 mark the nearest resistance levels are 1 3130 and 1 3200 it is only 25 of analysts who agree that this will happen next week but in the transition to the monthly forecast 60 of the experts and graphical analysis on d1 side with the bulls as for the readings of oscillators 15 of them signal that the pair is oversold which means if not a complete reversal of the trend then at least a quick correction of the pair upwards usd jpy we expect the bank of japan s interest rate decision and a press conference on the monetary policy of this bank on thursday april 25 however both of these events are unlikely to present any surprises the side trend of this pair is also not conducive to forecast accuracy that is why analysts opinions on its behavior in the next five days have been divided almost equally a third are for for its growth a third are for a fall and a third are for a continuation of the lateral movement however in the longer term 65 of the experts supported by graphical analysis on d1 vote for the pair to fall 25 of oscillators also give signals that it is overbought at the moment the pair is still in the reversal zone near the upper boundary of the medium term channel 109 70 112 15 and in the case of its downward movement the targets for it will be the support levels 110 85 110 35 and the lower boundary of the channel 109 70 if the dollar continues to grow against the japanese currency then its immediate task will be to consolidate in the zone of 112 20 113 25 the next resistance is at 113 70 cryptocurrencies despite a more or less positive news background 65 of experts remain pessimistic believing that in the near future the btc usd pair will not be able to break through the resistance of 5 500 moreover according to their forecasts bears will have a certain advantage in this market pressing the pair to support 4 600 however during the transition to the medium term forecast the alignment of forces changes to the opposite and here already 60 of analysts believe that bitcoin quotes at 5 750 5 800 are realistic

why gold has been the second best asset class for the last 20 years frank holmes ceo and chief investment officer of u s global investors speaks to streetwise reports about the fundamentals for gold his company s funds and a handful of companies on his radar screen streetwise reports since the beginning of the year gold has been trading fairly narrowly in the 1 300 range what are some of the macro factors working behind this and how do you believe they ll affect the price moving forward frank holmes when we look at macro factors at u s global and we write about them every month in particular the purchasing managers index pmi we try to take this complexity and simplify it by dividing it into big chunks the first is commodities 50 of all commodity demand is china so china is very very important when you add the populations of china and india chindia you get 40 of the world s population that s a lot of food that s a lot of clothes that s a lot of airplanes they ll be buying for india next we look at global trade interestingly enough if you put china and america together that s 40 of the world s global trade then we take a look at gold demand that s predominantly china and india but more generally from the middle east to southeast asia sixty percent of all gold demand is for the love trade so we get these chunks and we try to understand the movement of those chunks one of the things that contributes to those big numbers is rising gross domestic product gdp per capita seems to be one of the strongest correlations for the love trade of gold in particular for chindia today china america and india have the largest gdps per capita china s gdp on a per capita basis has surpassed america that means a continuous consumption of gold rising gdp is highly correlated to grams of gold that s an important long picture demand cycle then we have supply there have been no major gold discoveries there have been no technological breakthroughs as there have been in oil and gas with fracking a lot of the mines are low grade now so it takes more and more dirt to get an ounce of gold out of them then you also have political risks around the world where you have rich deposits so the supply of gold is basically slowing down we believe that gold has peaked some analysts say gold production is always growing because they re looking at the gold mines that are reporting rising production but a great data point and it never changes is that if a company says it s going to grow at 8 it s in reality negative 5 because murphy s law hits these gold mining companies for so many different reasons it s not just because management may be inept you can have social unrest in central america you can have an earthquake or you can have environmentalists slowing down production so we believe peak gold production is behind us another thing that s interesting is that gold now with the bank for international settlements has become recognized as money and banks can use it as collateral gold is the fourth most liquid asset class in the world so it has taken on this new meaning of money in the past year we ve had some really serious new buyers of gold poland czech republic hungary china and russia continue to consume gold but they are joined by many new countries and gold got knocked down dramatically the other day because turkey has a currency crisis and blew up its gold but then the last time it did this we found out poland bought it not since president nixon have there been so many central banks as net buyers of gold a 50 year peak so we have rising gdp per capita for the love trade and for the fear trade gold is money an increasing number of central banks are owning gold this is all behind why gold is trading higher i am amazed that with the real rates of return in america gold would normally be 1 200 1 150 not where it is so that s a very positive sign that with any real drop in interest rates as the federal reserve tries to make sure the economy stays okay gold is going to 1 500 i remain bullish on it sr how do you feel about precious metals stocks fh one has to be very selective i think what you can learn from what eric sprott did is you focus on high grade don t focus on the big low grade picks at this stage unless you re trading for optionality you should be looking at the high grade one of those stocks that we love is gran colombia gold corp gcm tsx the largest gold producer in colombia and it s also high grade it is way undervalued relative to other names the company offers gold notes it s like getting a money market fund of 8 5 it s called gran colombia gold corp 8 25 nonconvertible senior secured gold linked notes gcm nt u tsx they are gold backed bonds you get a yield that s 8 25 basis points at gold at 1 250 anything above 1 250 you get a higher yield so if gold goes back to 1 900 all of a sudden you ll have a 20 yield you just can t get money market funds to give you an 8 25 base rate now gran columbia produces 200 000 ounces of gold it s very profitable and it s going through a new rerating again it s very undervalued relative to its peers if you look at the gold notes for yield they re excellent it s just excellent to have 5 of your portfolio giving you almost a 10 yield monthly and it s listed so you get quotes every day so it s liquid sr how is the u s global go gold and precious metal miners exchange traded fund etf goau nyse arca doing fh i m really proud of it it s unique because it has a portfolio structure that recalibrates every quarter and then there is the stock picking element half of the portfolio is looking for momentum and the other half is looking at the cheapest stocks for that quarter as stocks appreciate the fund sells them out and looks for the next cheapest so it s like a natural scooper and that s why we ve witnessed it outperform the vaneck vectors junior gold miners etf gdxj nyse arca 92 of the time in rolling quarters sr you now have nearly two years of history with the fund i m curious to know what you ve learned running an etf fh one thing is we have a third party run our algorithms and then we run them too every quarter there are one or two names we have to discuss because we differ on whether we believe they should be in the portfolio or not that means it s somewhat active it is very dynamic too i ve learned that you have to have an outside set of eyes and let them run the model and see if they come up with different names sr have you had to tweak the model or the algorithms along the way or are they basically working as planned fh no it s working like clockwork sr what are some of the best performers in the fund fh what s unique is 30 of the fund is royalty and streaming companies one of the things i like about royalty companies is they preserve their values per share in fact when you own a royalty company like royal gold inc rgld nasdaq rgl tsx or wheaton precious metals corp wpm tsx wpm nyse or franco nevada corp fnv tsx fnv nyse they have royalties in many junior miners you basically get tremendous exposure to a lot of juniors through their portfolios plus royalty companies have very low debt compared to mining companies they have rising dividends these are some factors that make goau a superior business model i believe embedded inside the etf i don t know of any active gold fund manager who beat it last year even our own guys didn t beat it sr let s talk about some companies that you are excited about fh i love goldspot discoveries inc spot tsx v it offers huge optionality and is run by a team of really intelligent people they have young staff members men and women with phds in machine learning applying monte carlo simulation to geostatistical models montreal is becoming a center for artificial intelligence it s so big there that microsoft is opening a campus for 5 000 people because they can t get these young people to move to seattle or new york it s so exciting for me because i m around all these really smart young people sr tell me a little bit more about goldspot what it does and where it is going fh as a little background the company won second place in an artificial intelligence ai competition back in 2016 against as many as 4 600 worldwide applicants it consolidated more than 30 years of historical mining data into a 3d geological model and was then able to identify a handful of target zones with the highest potential for gold mineralization rob mcewen was pretty impressed with the team s skill set and now owns 3 of the company hochschild mining plc hoc lse owns 10 of the company and gave goldspot a multimillion dollar contract goldspot realized the ibm watson model is really expensive a 25 million contract 5 million a year over five years that s what goldcorp inc g tsx gg nyse is doing goldspot is so much less expensive the difference is goldspot has geologists and engineers in montreal that work for the company for companies using ibm because ibm s experts weren t geos they d always have to ask the geos questions and the geos were busy with their work so this is a completely different turnkey operation goldspot looks to help mining companies cut some of the costs and risks associated with discovering high quality deposits something it s already managed to do for a number of its clients and partners including hochschild mining mcewen mining and yamana gold goldspot will also invest in junior companies it invests in and acquires royalties from exploration companies similar to the business model practiced by firms like franco nevada and wheaton precious metals the companies use goldspot s technology to advance their understanding of their projects and drill where there are great targets goldspot helps de risk it but also gets a royalty on that so with one discovery the stock can go up fivefold sr are there other companies you would like to talk about fh speaking about optionality there is copperbank resources corp cbk cse we own 12 of the company we have quant model for juniors where we take the amount of reserves a company has plus the cash minus 300 000 divided by the shares outstanding so a dollar is treated the same as a pound of copper or an ounce if a company wastes money and doesn t find more reserves then the stock gets sold copper is so inexpensive it s in deficit when i look at copperbank using our algorithm you get 38 pounds of copper per share trading at 0 06 0 07 with all the buildup for data centers electric cars alternative energy there s going to be a greater need for copper than ever so when copper does make this move then these things tend to snap copper goes to 4 and all of a sudden the stock will be 1 that s why we buy it copperbank s ceo gianni kovacevic doesn t take a salary he s very frugal and he s trying to tie up assets that have other money calls on copper sr is there anything else that you d like our readers to know fh for the past 20 years the biggest hedge fund in the world has been bridgewater associates llc run by ray dalio he is an intellectual gold investor and if you drill down into bridgewater s sec filing for the fourth quarter of 2018 you ll find that dalio holds significant positions in gold across all tiers in the industry he also always likes to pair gold against other countries currencies and he s had this incredible track record for the past 20 years on top of that now we re seeing that the second best performing asset class for the past 20 years according to j p morgan s research has been gold so dalio is on to something and that just relates to the 10 golden rule i always talk about where i advocate having 10 of your liquid assets in gold and rebalancing each year i think the only thing that has outperformed gold since 1999 has been reits last year gold bullion outperformed the market so i can go short term or long term gold is just a great asset class and i think that more people are going to wake up to it as a portfolio diversifier if readers haven t watched ray dalio s animated videos on youtube please they should all go see them they re so well done and they re great for young kids to understand how the economy works he talks about where he lost all of his money and how he clawed his way back it s his voice narrating the animation tgr thanks for your insights frank frank holmes is ceo and chief investment

the uae and saudi arabia on sunday announced a 3 billion aid package that includes a 500 million payment by the two countries to the central bank of sudan sudan has suffered for years under a sluggish economy in which an estimated 70 per cent of government spending went to the security agencies the country has been hit by an acute lack of foreign currency which became a key factor behind the nationwide protests that led to the removal of president omar al bashir by the army this month since december as the price of staples such as bread rose dramatically protesters have taken to the streets the uae and saudi aid package was to strengthen the financial position and ease the pressure on the sudanese pound the saudi press agency said the shortage of foreign currency made it difficult to import even crucial medicine the aid package was also to be spent on urgent needs such as food medicine and oil sudan lost much of its once large oil reserves in 2011 when south sudan became independent the sudanese pound surged on the black market on sunday over expectations that mr al bashir s removal would lead to new inflows of dollars and ease the foreign currency shortage since he was removed the pound has steadily strengthened on the black market and on sunday it jumped to 45 a dollar compared with 72 last week the official exchange rate is 47 5 pounds to the dollar many people who had dollars are coming to exchange them for sudanese pounds a black market trader said they feel that more dollars will come which will strengthen the pound further another black market trader said since saturday i had 20 people coming to my shop asking for pounds nobody wants dollars the sudanese currency plunged since the us lifted its 20 year trade embargo on the country in october 2017 expectations that the end of us sanctions would bring an economic recovery were unrealised putting pressure on the long suffering pound

that we re going to make sure they cannot afford subsidized adventurism subsidized subversion of democracy outside of their borders said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was

afflicted by deep inefficiency and corruption many state employees demand bribes to provide services to the public others spend only a few hours a day at their jobs spending the rest of their time doing informal private work or selling supplies stolen from their office warehouse or factory despite a highly educated and generally well qualified workforce cuba s industrial sector is dilapidated after decades of underinvestment the country produces little of value on the global market besides rum tobacco and the professionals who earn billions for the government working as doctors teachers or engineers in friendly third countries the agricultural sector is in shambles requiring the country to import most of its food economy minister alejandro gil said saturday that cuba would spend 5 billion on food and petroleum products this year over the last 20 years many of those billions came from venezuela s socialist government which has deep ties to cuba s and sent nearly 100 000 barrels of oil daily for years with venezuela s economic collapse that has roughly halved along with deep cutbacks in the economic relationship across the board and the news has been bad in virtually every other sector of the cuban economy nickel production has dropped from 72 530 metric tons in 2011 to 50 000 last year according to rodríguez the former economics minister the sugar harvest dropped

it is funny how friendly someone gets when they re trying to sell you something saudi arabian oil co is doing its best to make nice with one of its biggest customers with the ink barely dry on the takeover of 70 of the country s chemical giant saudi basic industries corp and the issuance of its first ever corporate bond aramco is looking to buy a stake in the world s biggest oil refinery indian billionaire mukesh ambani s reliance industries ltd is seeking to sell as much as a quarter of its refining business for at least 10 billion and is entertaining offers from aramco and abu dhabi national oil co people with knowledge of the matter told bloomberg news this week that represents quite a prize reliance s jamnagar refinery is about twice the size of the biggest us plant aramco owned port arthur and is so massive that maintenance work occasionally skews india s entire trade balance trade is also the reason india should be cautious of aramco s embrace the country has a dangerous addiction to imported crude and it should be wary of getting too cozy with its dealer for more than a century the rise of major economic powers has been fuelled by petroleum the us is both the world s biggest oil consumer and its biggest producer the soviet union was built on its oilfields in the caucasus and siberia while china has overtaken america as the biggest oil importer it is also the biggest producer outside the middle east after the us russia and canada india is different the us produces about 1 8 metric tons of oil a year per capita and even china manages 138 kilograms india at a far earlier stage of development than either country ekes out just 30 kilograms production peaked all the way back in 2010 and shows no sign of recovery industrialisation is an energy intensive process if india s development is going to be powered by crude oil it is going to be buying a whole lot more from aramco and its ilk such a future would pose some profound risks balance of payments crises are a recurring danger for emerging economies and even at its current stage of development oil typically accounts for about a quarter of india s imports if prices spike higher as inevitably they will from time to time that is good news for riyadh but potentially devastating for new delhi when crude is averaging 85 a barrel roughly the level at which saudi arabia can balance its budget according to the international monetary fund oil imports would reduce india s gross domestic product by about 3 6 percentage points according to a study this year by rbi higher prices will also push up inflation and weaken the government s fiscal position the authors found at present that dynamic is somewhat mitigated by the fact that about a third of india s oil imports are re exported as petroleum products giving the country a natural hedge against rising prices jamnagar for instance produces almost exclusively for export meaning that it probably makes a modestly positive contribution to the trade balance since oil products are more valuable than the crude they re made from should domestic consumption grow faster than export refinery capacity though india s oil dependence will start taking a deeper bite out of its current account in a worst case scenario a spike in oil prices could drive the country toward a balance of payments crisis like the one it suffered in 1991 when a splurge on oil imports over the previous decade resulted in new delhi pledging its gold reserves as security for bailouts from multilateral lenders india is aware that its dependence on imported crude risks constraining growth the government wants 30 of new cars and two wheelers to be electric by 2030 and is already home to more than 1 5 million electric rickshaws it has also adjusted tax policies to encourage that transition in a country at grave risk from climate change whose cities are already choking on vehicle smog reducing the reliance on imported fossil fuels is more than just an issue for the current account that goal isn t an unrealistic one given the rock bottom local cost of wind and solar still no country has managed a low carbon industrialisation on this scale before so it won t be easy and saudi arabia will be hoping it proves all but impossible by promising to buy a chunk of reliance and help fund a new 44 billion jamnagar sized refinery in western india aramco is counting on the country being unable to kick its self destructive oil habit indians should hope that it is wrong this column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or bloomberg lp and its owners
the redacted mueller report hit washington like a political sonic boom last week making a huge noise but apparently changing few minds in connecticut or elsewhere about donald trump s fitness to be president or the propriety of his conduct as u s rep jahana hayes d 5th district put it regardless of the results of the mueller report president trump and his administration give the american people evidence on a daily basis that we need a change of leadership she has been focusing on education and gun safety issues which intersected last week at a congressional hearing the most likely scenario is that rather than pursue impeachment democrats will continue to peck at the president with a series of investigations the most recent to question his plan to bus asylum seeking migrants to so called sanctuary cities like hartford and new haven u s rep jahana hayes during a congressional hearing on education meanwhile a large number of democrats jockey for a chance to run as the party s presidential nominee proposing a range of issues including bernie sanders medicare for all the most obvious effect of that has been a drop in stock prices of connecticut s health insurers and though the democrats now control the u s house their new dominance has not translated into an increase in their campaign finances irrespective of trump s apparent comfort with russia s participation in the 2016 elections and his efforts to have his subordinates lie on his behalf he is still the president and as far as gov ned lamont is concerned should not be unnecessarily antagonized especially at a time when connecticut needs the cooperation of agencies like the federal highway administration if it is going to implement highway tolls certainly connecticut and the governor who has completed his first hundred days in office have plenty of problems that need attention connecticut unemployment rose slightly for example which does not bode well for a continued economic recovery during a time of strained finances neither does it encourage legislation that incurs additional expense such as a plan to extend state sponsored health insurance to undocumented children to raise additional funds some democrats are proposing a tax increase on the investment income of connecticut s wealthiest households a move that directly confronts the governor s wish to increase sales and sin taxes and ones that have greater impact on the poor and middle class legislators have until may 2 to come up with some combination of efforts to raise revenue or reduce spending while stimulating economic growth board of regents for higher education matt fleury chairman mark ojakian president of cscu and merle harris board member on thing seems certain unless the lawmakers increase their allocation to the connecticut state colleges and universities the institution will be facing a 22 million shortfall despite the imposition of a 2 1 percent tuition increase at the system s 12 community colleges workers in the state s nursing homes also want raises an estimated 40 million expense and have threatened to strike may 1 if they don t get them state officials are preparing contingency plans in the event of a work stoppage that could affect 3 000 nursing home residents these days legislative votes are required for approval of collective bargaining agreements and lately republicans to no effect voted against raises for six tax attorneys in the department of revenue services the newest of those voting will be democrat tammy exum winner of a special election to fill 19th house district seat vacated by derek slap
jesseca chatman stands in front of the brand new 1 584 square foot home she shares with her husband in the hillside neighborhood it s one of the first warm days after a particularly lengthy winter and the sun only seems to underscore the brightness of her tangerine home we wanted to be the pop on the block the 30 year old new homeowner said this is what we ve always wanted to consider our home this community and the chatmans are the pop on the block in more ways than one the couple bought a home using a city mortgage assistance program called edge fund which is designed to help people with low to moderate income buy homes at below market interest rates the house built late last year is worth more than 200 000 with edge fund the chatmans got a discount on the price as well as the lower interest rate we wouldn t have been able to afford to live here because of our income said chatman who works for the indiana housing and community development authority her husband charles 31 is in medical school at indiana university school of medicine every other house is half a million or more the chatmans came to indianapolis for charles schooling and represent a projected surge in new homebuyers through increased job growth over the next 20 years according to a study released last fall by mibor realtor association with bagi the builders association of greater indianapolis the chatmans might have found a way to work around their issue but the study underscores why programs such as edge fund are important in short the study paints a pessimistic picture for people looking to buy affordable new homes because for various reasons builders simply aren t building enough new affordable homes to keep up with future demand the demand for central indiana builders to meet employment driven housing demands construction would have to increase by 21 percent over the course of the next two decades according to the housing study one of two released by mibor and bagi that examined the needs of the region s homebuyers one study a telephone survey of 2 163 adults 18 and older and conducted aug 2 26 revealed that people in central indiana are largely satisfied with their quality of life that said four in 10 people still said they planned to move within the next few years and 62 percent of renters wanted to become homeowners residents leaned more toward suburban and urban communities that offer a mix of houses offices and shops over residential only neighborhoods they also preferred to buy homes within their budgets than those in their preferred location the other study an analysis of central indiana s ability to meet its future demand for housing details how job growth will drive demand for new housing units the associations project the region will gain 274 576 net jobs over the next two decades the analysis covered 12 counties in central indiana and was conducted by indianapolis based real estate consultant greenstreet ltd and virginia based lisa sturtevant associates while such studies might accurately point out a lack of new affordable homes a ball state economics professor notes that in truth indiana has a housing glut largely due to older often vacant homes that are affordable but not necessarily desirable professor michael hicks along with research professor dagney faulk published a study in february disputing the housing inventory shortage in indiana and said that new construction would only contribute to indiana s existing excess housing supply statewide we have too many homes far too many homes that have to be bulldozed and removed he said the problem is that they re not in the places people want to live hicks found 316 000 vacant single family homes in indiana the real issue hicks contends is that realtors and builders are asking to relax zoning and architectural rules so they can put lower priced homes in higher priced communities where it s profitable to sell homes i think what you re really seeing is not a shortage in the housing market hicks said it s a disagreement between realtors and builders and the communities that are most popular in central indiana housing and real estate representatives counter that it doesn t really matter if central indiana has a glut of affordable houses if those are houses that sit abandoned because they are in an undesirable location or fail to address the dynamics and needs of the modern family the supply historical building trends suggest that developers in the region are under building on average 1 750 housing units each year the mibor study shows but perhaps more significantly the homes that are being built are beyond what many people can afford to buy new households can support homes that cost 260 000 or less but many new homes are priced above that the study found people are finding it more and more difficult to find homes within the price range that people can afford chris pryor mibor s senior vice president of government and community relations they are finding it difficult to find the type of housing that they are looking for to be clear central indiana isn t experiencing an affordability crisis despite the shortage of new units at the lower and moderate end of the market the region s housing sector is healthy and the metro area remains more affordable than other large msas across the nation especially for homebuyers moving from other cities jun zhu principal research associate for the urban institute housing finance policy center and adjunct professor at iu kelley school of business in bloomington describes the region s housing problem specifically as a supply gap of new construction we don t have enough housing supply she said but in terms of the people who can have enough money to purchase a house i don t think there s any affordability crisis nevertheless homes are slightly less affordable than the historical average according to attom data solutions first quarter affordability index the company which tracks real estate trends and data also reported that year over year median home prices in the indianapolis carmel anderson msa grew faster than wages rising 10 5 percent to 2 1 percent respectively pent up demand from the housing crisis has contributed to a trend in increasing land prices said john eaton a custom home builder with about 25 years of experience in the industry eaton recently sold a home for 750 000 in an area he would never have expected to command such a high value near 38th street if you had told me that five years ago i would ve told you you were insane he said before the rule of thumb you wanted the lot value to be 20 percent of the house that s changed lot now we re in bigger city prices some of these lots are 50 percent the value of the house the upside eaton says is that rising land prices will spur more development on the eastside and westside of the city the downside those land prices also might keep those new homes from being affordable to entry level homebuyers or people who currently live in those neighborhoods fishers mayor scott fadness has witnessed valuation surges in his own community it would be a difficult exercise trying to build a home in fishers for 200 000 today even though an affordable home in the city would probably be in the 175 000 to 225 000 range he said the reasons for that mismatch are layered fadness said he points to a supply and demand issue in hamilton county where land values are being pushed up as more and more people gobble up acres for homes and commercial developments fishers with a population of roughly 90 000 has become a vibrant tech hub in recent years according to mibor the median selling price of homes in hamilton county in february the latest data available was nearly 281 000 about 9 percent above the median sales price of homes in february 2018 fadness said there s a disconnect when it comes to what affordable housing can mean to a community s long term sustainability and vision for instance when fishers developed fishers 2040 its comprehensive plan one of the concerns that surfaced was how to ensure that neighborhoods remain vibrant 10 to 20 years from now i don t think that anybody from our perspective from a policy perspective has an issue with building homes that are lesser dollar value than what we re currently building fadness said but we haven t seen a product today or concept plan that we would ensure could be a vibrant neighborhood for the next two or three decades furthermore fadness said indiana s tax policy which caps property taxes complicates the relationship between cities and developers and builders currently you have a bit i don t want to call it a disincentive but when you talk about making decisions that are in the best financial interest of the city from a long term sustainability model there is a question as to what type of housing you should be putting into your community fadness said bagi s government affairs director kate collins offered a similar explanation adding that indiana s property tax caps may have caused some cities to enact architectural standards that aim to drive up housing prices and generate tax revenue the caps placed into the state s constitution in 2010 limit property tax bills to 1 percent of a homestead s gross assessed value 2 percent on rental and farmland and 3 percent on business and personal property put another away while city officials might prefer new housing that meets the needs of all residents it s simply in the city s financial best interest to build more expensive homes that drive more tax revenue so long as there is a market for those homes with property tax caps basically what s happening is you find yourself at kind of an impasse where a builder does come in and shares hey we don t think there s a market for these types of homes fadness explains for the first time now mayors and city council members are saying it s not that big of a deal if you don t build any homes because we gain most our money off of commercial development and higher end homes until you re ready to build those in our city we would rather not do anything to build a home that isn t going to meet it financial need the effect of politics if you ask steve hatchel chief business development officer for indianapolis based arbor homes silverthorne homes it s harder to build affordable housing in some communities now four or five years ago our average price point was right at about 160 000 and now it s running 215 220 000 hatchel said big difference arbor homes caters to the niche market of first time home buyers there s a large demand for housing worth between 125 000 and 175 000 he said with the existing market having a very low inventory anything that comes up in that price point and that s in relatively good shape gets eaten up off the market almost immediately and a lot of times it s at a price higher than the asking price he said the gap is widening aside from outside pressures such as labor and land costs which have risen since the great recession hatchel said politics also can play a role in where below market rate housing is built municipalities builders and the developers can be at odds over what a local housing market needs and what some people would like to see in their communities if elected officials have a financial reason to attract more expensive homes to their city so too do the people who elect them residents protective over their property values can put pressure on elected officials to not approve higher density lower cost housing the result is that community regulations on zoning and architectural standards also can make new home construction more expensive mibor and bagi said hamilton county is an interesting exercise in the question about affordable housing fishers fadness said i think the comments about zoning restrictions and architectural standards i think there is some truth behind those restrictions and developers ability to build exactly what they like versus what the community might see from a vision perspective arbor joined bagi and the indiana builders association in a lawsuit against the city of greenwood in 2016 after it implemented new home construction standards the prior year the rules were retroactive and the three parties accused the city of implementing stricter rules on elements such as building materials and decorative elements to drive up homes prices the lawsuit filed in johnson county was settled in 2017 with the city agreeing to let arbor move forward with a project approved prior to the standards passage calls to greenwood officials were not returned but those new standards are now in effect hatchel said he believes the ability to produce a home at the company s previous price point is nonexistent now unless a home builder goes outside of indianapolis if the builder goes too far out he or she risks running into a lack of utility connections politics needs to be taken out of the process hatchel said discussions are taking place between cities and builders about how to supplying a diverse housing crop for buyers at all levels the shortage of new inventory at the lower end of the market is not unique to central indiana building permits for privately owned housing units in march fell 7 8 percent year over year to 1 26 million according to u s census bureau data released friday the national association of home builders said builders across the u s are having trouble constructing lower priced homes as older millennials want to become home buyers and baby boomers downsize fewer buildable lots escalating land infrastructure and material costs since the recession and labor shortages make building low to moderate income single family homes less profitable for builders the future still mibor and bagi fear the shortage of new housing inventory could have a long term adverse impact on the region s workforce and its ability to attract new employers their analysis projects the indianapolis region to gain a net 274 576 new jobs over the next 20 years with hamilton and marion counties capturing the largest share of job growth and following economist and university of california berkeley professor enrico moretti s thinking on the multiplier effects of new jobs the analysis notes that for every new job attracted to the region whether it s in tech or health care five support jobs are created as well it s at this level that future workers could be locked out of becoming home buyers the organizations said leaders are super excited to tout the jobs said bagi s collins it seems that next step of where are we putting these people isn t part of the conversation both mibor and bagi are advocating for housing to become an integral part of the region s economic development strategy the associations projection is what king park development corporation executive director steven meyer and his team are in part working to avoid the mibor study demonstrated that not only is there a housing shortage but also that the housing needs for all spectrum levels are not being met he said so it s an opportunity for us to use this information to think more globally about how housing needs are being satisfied king park represents seven neighborhoods just north of downtown and it s the community development corporation behind edge fund in an effort to allow for more diverse home ownership in its neighborhoods and to avoid future housing shortfalls edge fund is for people who make less than 80 percent of the area median income the prediction meyer said isn t unexpected none of it is terribly surprising for those of us who work in the industry he said we ve always seen a lack of supply for high quality affordable housing i think it is interesting to see projections of what the housing need will actually be looking at what we anticipate the need being in 2038 gives us an opportunity to respond in a more proactive way and the outcome could change in part with more programs like edge fund meyer said the program just less than a year old is funded partially by the city and selected an area called the monon16 to partner with first the funds that are being used to fund the mortgage repaid by borrowers are reinvested back into the area meyer said it creates a perpetual funding source monon16 includes 70 houses to be built around the area of 16th street and the monon trail of those about 20 will be designated as low or very low income like chatman s and they re dotted throughout the neighborhood meyer said it s surprising when you come across the monon and see 20 brightly colored houses on previously vacant lots he said monon16 is an example of everything from very low income housing to houses that are 500 000 are all being built next to each other indyhub executive director blake johnson who is also a member of the indianapolis city county council works to attract and connect young professionals in the city if they re not able to afford to buy a home it could negatively impact indianapolis ability to retain millennials affordable housing is incredibly critical to why they pick a city to move to he said still he was hopeful indyhub along with city and state advocates is doing the right things to connect 20 and 30 somethings to the right resources to stay in the city we are well positioned to remain affordable johnson said but for the chatmans who view themselves as living the american dream becoming educated on assistance programs opened a door to a market they otherwise wouldn t have been able to touch what does homebuying look like who buys a home chatman said everyone assumed oh these houses on this street are so expensive but these houses are sprinkled through that onus on the buyer she said could help central indiana avoid the possible housing shortage it s just a matter of the buyer bearing responsibility in the future she said we need to have more edge fund minded people at the table

from my experience within the fixed income space specifically the riskier bonds segment we have been observing an increase in the number of companies borrowing from other jurisdictions over the past years we have seen a substantial increase of us companies borrowing in europe undoubtedly the low interest rate environment is one of the main reasons but not the sole factor looking at the ice bank of america merrill lynch european currency non financial high yield constrained index an index that is composed of risky bonds 16 3 per cent are american companies while a further 8 9 per cent of this high yield index are non european issuers companies look at several aspects when considering borrowing from other jurisdictions in our view the lower financing cost is one of the primary factors admittedly when interest rates over the past years in the us started to rise while in europe these remained intact the spread over european counterparts increased notably in fact the current yield spread between the us 10 year and the european 10 year government bonds currently stands at around 2 48 per cent thus when considering for instance pricing a 10 year bond in the us the starting point is 2 5 per cent whereas in europe the starting point would be 0 003 per cent in the case of the current 10 year german bund there is clearly a remarkable discrepancy and therefore the lower borrowing costs entice companies to borrow capital in lower yielding jurisdictions europe is a clear example in fact over the recent years we have seen companies such as apple netflix hertz and avis among others issuing bonds in euro as opposed to their historical dollar issues another very interesting aspect is the alignment of debt to revenues at times companies want to reduce risk by adopting the alignment concept a very practical example is global ports a turkish port operator which coincidently has an important shareholding of 55 6 per cent in malta s valletta cruise port in 2014 the operator issued a dollar denominated bond which was aligned to its revenue dollar stream the macro aspect has a huge impact on pricing indeed apart from the fact that it was cheaper for the company to borrow in dollar rather than in turkish lira this acted also as a natural hedge simply put given that half of its revenues were in the us currency the company could hold the dollar cash received and use the same proceeds to service its dollar denominated debt thus mitigating the possibility of facing currency risks this is a very important aspect which we as portfolio managers look into detail as general market movements might generate opportunities another aspect are mergers and acquisitions a company might be targeting a transaction involving an overseas company and would want to raise funds in local currency to finance the deal given its potential strong reputation and performance among domestic investors this would ease capital funding undoubtedly there are other aspects but certainly the above mentioned factors are very important considerations which companies adopt in their financing rationale from an investor s point of view one of the prime advantages is the mispricing element as investors are aware the macro aspect has a huge impact on pricing at times price movements tend to move irrationally and this is when investors should take the plunge and invest at lower valuations for instance in line with the above aforementioned concept emerging markets dollar denominated issues were trading at very opportunistic levels in january this year companies that local investors are familiar with such as petrobras were at the forefront of this trend another advantage for investors is the diversification aspect for those investors who would like to broaden their investment portfolio this is surely a huge advantage in addition they would not be exposed to currency risk for the said diversification for instance apple in 2014 issued for the very first time a euro denominated bond which gave the opportunity to euro based investors to invest in the firm and thus take the operational risk of the company without the necessity of currency conversions this diversified their investment spectrum furthermore apart from the diversification aspect an unknown issuer to investors in other jurisdictions might need to ramp up the coupon to entice investors this is seen as added advantage for investors to lock in a higher return in today s globalised markets having a well diversified portfolio is imperative in this regard lending to solid companies outside one s comfort zone is surely a helping hand in achieving diversification research companies like ours and others across the globe encounter very interesting business models which potential might not be tapped given the geographical positioning of such companies by consulting with investment professionals investors should take the plunge and search for investment options which are beyond the usual geographical parameters and which offer the possibility of investing in our base currency the information views and opinions provided in this article are provided solely for educational and

medicare for all requires squeezing hospitals bernie sanders and other advocates focus on insurance companies and drug companies but that s not where the money is james joyner 49 comments image under cco public domain license under the provocative headline this is the part of medicare for all that you never hear about huffpo s jonathan cohn points to an issue we actually hear about only occasionally sen bernie sanders i vt and his allies talk a lot about how medicare for all would take back money from insurers and drug companies and use those savings to help make sure every american has generous health insurance that is accurate but sanders and his allies rarely mention that medicare for all would also restrict the flow of money into the rest of the health care industry including the parts that aren t as easy to demonize in speeches at the top of that list are hospitals which alone account for roughly one third of the nation s health care spending no other sector not even pharmaceuticals rivals it under the medicare for all proposals from sanders as well as some other potential reforms getting attention these days the federal government would limit payments to hospitals quite possibly reducing their incomes significantly sanders goes after insurers and drug companies because they re easy villains given a mostly private medical system the former provide peace of mind and protection against financial ruin but they re an unnecessary middle man that jack up costs the latter provide life saving or enhancing miracles but they do so at enormous cost hospitals are a different story while people hate their administrative bloat they tend to like physicians nurses and other practitioners but obviously if society is going to pay for everyone s health care we have an interest in containing costs and as with willie sutton and banks we need to go after hospitals because that s where the money is the case for squeezing hospitals is strong given the available research on what they charge and why even some experts historically wary of government regulation are warming to the concept but actually crafting a policy that would cut hospital payments enough to free up big sums of money without adverse effects wouldn t be easy and getting such a policy through congress could be even tougher the hospital industry is already pushing back and as this debate moves forward it s only going to push harder well sure both the sanders bill and a house counterpart from rep pramila jayapal d wash envision enrolling nearly everybody in a single newly created government insurance plan that would control payments to all parts of the health care system including for hospitals sanders would make this transition in four years jayapal in two with the sanders bill the federal government would simply pay hospitals the way that medicare does now which for the most part means providing a fixed fee based on each patient s diagnosis in the jayapal version the government would basically give hospitals lump sums of money based on past expenses and let them decide how best to allocate it either of these approaches would represent a major break with the status quo in which hospitals have to take whatever the government gives them on medicare and medicaid and other programs but can then demand higher payments from private insurance the result is a messy confusing system where hospitals try to maximize revenue from a mix of private insurance paying more and public programs paying less with a huge spread between the two this is not how developed countries typically operate even in countries like the netherlands which provide universal coverage through private insurance government limits what hospitals make by establishing fees overall budgets or some combination of the two here in the u s more than half the states used to regulate hospital prices in one way or another and in the 1970s then president jimmy carter pushed hard for legislation to regulate hospital charges nationally it was supposed to be the first step toward creating a national health system that effort failed in the face of industry opposition and nearly every state with a system for setting hospital rates eventually ditched it as regulation fell out of fashion among the nation s most influential politicians and intellectuals but after watching the private sector try and fail to control hospital prices for the better part of 50 years even some economists who once dismissed the idea of government price controls are saying the idea deserves more serious consideration okay so what s the problem medicare covers a little less than 90 percent of actual hospital costs according to industry data and although some experts question the figure s accuracy or significance few doubt that forcing hospitals to take medicare payments for all patients would reduce their revenue even after allowing for the savings hospitals would likely realize from streamlined billing fewer charity care obligations and other changes that medicare for all would bring i m admittedly not an expert on health care financing still if medicare covers some 90 percent of costs and under medicare for all there would be zero patients getting free care zero need to deal with other insurance companies i d think the net would be something of a wash regardless cohn makes the case that a haircut would be reasonable so i m continuing to not see a significant downside we don t have this great flexibility to drive down operating costs we have shortages of talent we don t set the price of drugs says larry tisdale vice president for finance at the idaho hospital association half of idaho hospitals today over half actually don t have a positive operating margin whether or not those figures tell the whole story even advocates for more ambitious cuts to hospitals like don berwick co founder of the institute for health innovation and a former administrator of medicare and medicaid say there is a lot of variation from institution to institution small and rural hospitals are highly vulnerable berwick said one needs to be very gentle not every hospital closure is a problem the worry is that some hospitals might cut back on services like psychiatry that typically lose money but are already insufficient to meet current demand reducing hospital income crudely could make these sorts of problems worse causing even longer waits for services or simply making it harder to deliver care effectively yes there s plenty of waste and administrative inefficiency but that couldn t be wrung out of the system overnight said larry levitt senior vice president at the henry j kaiser family foundation there is a real risk of delays in care and quality problems if payment rates are cut too much and too fast while coverage is being expanded so we might need to pay slightly higher rates in rural areas or maybe the rural areas are currently charging less because the markets won t bear major city prices these seem like small obstacles there s quite a bit more to the post and it s worth a read one takeaway and it s obvious when pointed out but probably not something most of us think about is that medicare for all isn t actually a policy so much as an idea sometimes this can be a major problem an obvious recent case is brexit given a choice between the status quo and some vaguely defined alternative a slightly majority of brits took a leap of faith on the latter when forced to turn it into an actionable plan however there hasn t yet been enough support to implement the idea but i don t see that as the situation here even if candidate sanders had an incredibly detailed implementation plan ready to go which would be politically stupid given that opponents would be able to attack specific pieces of it a president sanders would have to get it through both houses of congress there s no way to know what that would look like there are just too many unknown variables presumably most of the details of a medicare for all law would be left to regulators at the department of health and human services and or the food and drug administration to flesh out and they would be constantly tweaked as we learned from practice additionally i would expect a lot of follow on reforms if the federal government took over the entirety of the burden of financing healthcare we d almost certainly increase the number of physicians in the system especially in the primary care field presumably we d heavily or entirely subsidize their education to relieve them of the massive debt that now accompanies going to medical school and the need to generate massive fees to recoup those expenses

the u s has accused cuba of sending soldiers and spies to both countries to strengthen their leaders against protests and potential defection cuba denies that we re going to make sure they cannot afford subsidized adventurism subsidized subversion of democracy outside of their borders said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about u s policy toward cuba at an extraordinarily vulnerable time in their history they re going to have to refocus on the domestic needs their domestic pressures despite some market oriented reforms over the last decade cuba is one of the last countries to maintain a soviet style economy with most business run by the state that economy is afflicted by deep inefficiency and corruption many state employees demand bribes to provide services to the public others spend only a few hours a day at their jobs spending the rest of their time doing informal private work or selling supplies stolen from their office warehouse or factory despite a highly educated and generally well qualified workforce cuba s industrial sector is dilapidated after decades of underinvestment the country produces little of value on the global market besides rum tobacco and the professionals who earn billions for the government working as doctors teachers or engineers in friendly third countries advertisement the agricultural sector is in shambles requiring the country to import most of its food economy minister alejandro gil said saturday that cuba would spend 5 billion on food and petroleum products this year over the last 20 years many of those billions came from venezuela s socialist government which has deep ties to cuba s and sent nearly 100 000 barrels of oil daily for years with venezuela s economic collapse that has roughly halved along with deep cutbacks in the economic relationship across the board and the news has been bad in virtually every other sector of the cuban economy nickel production has dropped from 72 530 metric tons in 2011 to 50 000 last year according to rodríguez the former economics minister the sugar harvest dropped nearly 44 to a million tons the number of tourists grew only 1 with many coming on cruise ships a relatively unprofitable type of visitor overall gdp growth has been stuck at 1 for the last three years meanwhile under agreements castro struck to rehabilitate cuba s creditworthiness the country is paying 2 billion in debt service to creditors such as russia japan and the paris club state run stores that sell low quality chinese household goods at double or triple their price outside the country are facing competition from vendors in panama guyana mexico haiti and even russia where cubans fly in fill suitcases with goods and return to sell them at a profit that overseas shopping has become a vacuum sucking precious hard currency out of cuba economist omar everleny perez said he estimated that cubans spent more than 2 billion a year buying products overseas with less cash on hand there s been even less in the state run stores the manager of the butcher shop where castell waited for chicken said she needed 80 boxes of chicken to fill that day s demand and only 40 arrived advertisement fears of a return to darker times are growing during the special period we had it bad like everyone even when we had money we couldn t buy anything said castell a mother of six it was really rough blackouts no food at all i don t want to go back to that said ariadne medina a 47 year old worker in a private restaurant who was waiting to buy chicken behind castell independent experts say a return to the depths of the special period is unlikely cuba does business with dozens of nations and hosts nearly 5 million tourists a year and cubans can travel freely to dozens of countries on direct flights to the u s europe and latin america expatriates send billions home in annual remittances the new government is trying to halt the deterioration but it s a tough assignment perez said it s going to take resources and time rodriguez and weissenstein write for the associated press

why fixed income assets are gaining investors confidence wealth management is a segment in banking that lenders are exploring to build sustainable wealth for their customers standard chartered bank global chief investment strategist steve brice and head wealth management nigeria simpa adaba speak with charles okonji on nigeria and global investment climates and what it takes to sustain wealth creation for clients excerpts how would you assess the bond market from a global perspective from a trade tension perspective between the world s two biggest nations united states and china we are not too concerned in the short term as negotiations regarding the issue is going pretty well from our perspective we think a deal is going to be struck in april which will calm down tensions temporally between the two nations in terms of the bond market outlook generally in 2018 we saw a pretty bit of a perfect storm in terms of liquidity we saw tightening policy thickness in terms of a rate hike credit space widening treasury yields going up dollar strengthening which was quite a bad environment for bond investors in emerging markets including the challenging environment in terms of returns perspective they have reversed their record this year as we heard information that the us federal reserve fed is taking down on their rate expectation we were supposed to have two more rate hikes so that should be a positive environment for bond investors generally however our preference is for emerging market bonds generally and the rationale for that is because generally stocks are going to be cheaper yields will be more attractive and the dollar as we expected may be slightly weaker on a global basis that should be positive for those taking risks in emerging markets generally particularly the bond market space even though our main focus is global we still talk about the implication it can have for emerging markets we were in kenya a few weeks ago and now we are here in nigeria we expect people to be looking out for more yields and that will benefit both offshore and onshore debt markets around the frontier and emerging markets as well what prospects do you see in emerging and frontier markets should we expect to see more sell offs outflows or more inflows in the emerging market space we expect that the dollar does not strengthen which is our core view then emerging market bonds should do well we may see some volatilities which we can t rule out that possibilities as there is a pretty big collaboration between short term interest rate in the u s and equity markets volatility which can be into the risky areas and in the bond market as well but the big picture that i will say in emerging market bonds is if you did see any risk opportunity rallying excessively then you can be worried about what is your overview of the standard chartered wealth management operations in the emerging market and frontier markets such as nigeria from a bank perspective we are asia african middle east with a vast operation of our markets in those two regions some of them are emerging markets we have our big operations for instance in china india we also have in more frontier markets including in africa nigeria it s our specialty and that s what we do there has been a sell off in the equity market despite impressive earnings results from quoted firms investors are piling to the fixed income market what can you say is driving investors sentiments in this regards i think it is only a natural reaction talking about asset classes in times of volatility and uncertainty you would find people moving to where they see as safe to a great extent while all asset classes have their proportions and it is essential that clients remain invested in all asset classes in times where people are not sure it is only natural for them to run to the fixed income space where they have a sure bet on them also looking at the nigerian space you will clearly understand that a lot of people have a history of equity in nigeria so there is a flight to safety in times like this do you see them turning back to the equity market locally even though we are not into equities of course there is a general understanding to how this is done you would always see those flows if something happens in the us while we understand the general you will always find a scenario of people responding in the local market but essentially i think people are very clear on what fixed income is and i think in the last couple of months talking about flows we have had a lot of flows going into the fixed income space what are foreign investors perceptions of nigeria i think it s quite normal people on the ground are generally being more pessimistic than those standing offshore and looking in a different perspective has different value and they are much focused on unless something is really fantastic in a country or really bad in a country i think the global environment is very important to drive what is going to happen to local asset particularly currencies and bonds last year we were worried about what s going to happen in the election circle it went very smoothly i think that gave people confidence and then you got the positive dollar liquidity environment and positive external environment that way we are going to be seeing more money coming into the country how does the issue of multiplicity of taxation affect investment in the wealth management space it is not something under our purview but of course in terms of what we do locally is about investing in government instruments and these instruments are tax free so to that extent it is pretty very clear that we don t see double taxation as an issue in that space because we are not getting our clients to ship money abroad they are investing in instruments and it is basically coming back except you are moving to another country but what we are offering in nigeria is not taking you out it is all within nigeria pretty much can you give a percentage allocation of your investments across the various asset classes wealth management structure in nigeria is not an access management structure meaning that we basically allow the clients to decide where they want to put their money and their choice is within the asset classes that we offer in that regard it is really not us creating a framework for them it is really their decision for instance if they show up and they are more comfortable with the fixed income we will still tell them to diversify because there are awesome benefits when they diversify but the reality is it is evenly spread and there is no huge concentration anywhere from what we see broadly which is speaking to clients behaviour and not what we are influencing what are you going to do to bring more of your presence into nigeria speaking from a wealth business perspective we are investing in the wealth business and me coming here is part of that investment this is the third time i am coming to nigeria as i have been coming every year within the past three years and i think what i m very impressed with when i come in here is that the team is doing a very great job so generally we have so much confidence in the local team here and we expect that there is more to come i think it is a good business for us and we want to continue investing in it how does your bank view 2019 and what preparations it is making to get the best out of it we do see volatility as being the new norms in 2017 global equity market went straight as there was no volatility so given that short term interest rate went up we expect a two year cycle rate hike to feed into volatility so that 2017 scenario is the least likely one for us but if we see it in equity market volatility global inferences we will say it is a viable opportunity because we are concentrating more on global growth we can see central bank policies are being supported and that is why we are saying we should prepare and react at the beginning of december we were a little bit worried about the short term outlook for equities so we were a little bit anchoring down and at the beginning of january we are going to move a bit higher and that was what we meant by reacting to opportunities when they arise so we will be monitoring the fundamentals as well as the market performance as we go forward to see when people should take risk off the table or when should they add risk the derivative market in nigeria is still picking up how is the bank playing in the market given that the growth in the economy is a market that has already demonstrated a lot of potentials we do not do derivatives because the current structure of where we are in wealth management does not include derivatives but the reality is that the derivatives market would only take a few from the level of development in that market so it s going to be punctual and i think to an extent regulators are well aware of the understanding that they have but the market itself must understand this product we do not create products we look at products that already exist with the federal government bond for example and the issuer is the federal government

iran s latest monthly inflation rate has hit 51 4 percent according to the iranian statistical center isc the first month of the iranian year march 21 april 20 showed a more than 50 percent rise in prices compared to the same month last year isc also reported that the inflation rate in the past 12 months reached 30 6 percent this is lower than the international monetary fund s estimate of inflation in iran in 2018 at 31 2 percent for 2019 imf has predicted inflation at 37 2 percent iranian institutions usually underreport inflation and unemployment rates but isc s figures are sometimes closer to reality than statistics offered by other institutions worsening economic conditions specially inflation and unemployment led to mass protests across iran in late 2017 early 2018 the government suppressed the revolt by arresting thousands of protesters what is more alarming for ordinary iranians in isc figures is the rise in prices for food drinks and tobacco in the latest iranian month prices for these three daily consumer items have jumped 85 3 percent compared to a year ago the iranian currency rial began a steep fall one year ago as the markets felt uneasy about the possibility of the united states pulling out of the 2015 nuclear agreement and reimposing sanctions when in may 2018 president donald trump announced the u s withdrawal from the deal the iranian currency devalued faster losing its exchange rate almost fourfold against the usd and other major currencies at the beginning of 2018 one us dollar bought around 40 000 rials while now it fetches more than 140 000 on the non governmental or free currency market the fall of the currency which stems from the inherent weaknesses of the iranian economy and accelerated by u s sanctions led to an ever higher rate of inflation in the country the annual rate of inflation for food drinks and tobacco was 45 percent and other items 25 percent according to isc s estimates the annual rate is usually calculated by comparing a given period of 12 months with the averages of the previous 12 month period these latest figures also show that inflation was much higher in rural areas standing at 59 4 percent compared with urban areas at 50 percent vegetables had the highest monthly price increases at 155 6 percent followed by meat at 117 percent in march 21 april 20 2019 compared to the same month in 2018 both vegetables and meat are being exported to neighboring countries as the falling iranian currency opens up a huge gap in domestic and foreign prices for wholesale dealers it is much more profitable to export these items than sell them at domestic markets recently the iranian government has announced bans on exporting various food items including onions in late march when one kilogram of the important food staple reached 1 25 while this might not seem too high compared with other countries for a minimum wage earner in iran it can be a prohibitively high price the minimum wage is around 110 monthly for many iranian workers

sentiment releases with both euro wide and german measures both rebounding well beyond forecasts had anticipated to print in positive optimistic territory since mid 2018 above zew german economic sentiment supplementary commentary provided with the release suggested the uptick in sentiment was largely attributed to an assessment of improving external conditions zew president professor achim wambach wrote the slight improvement recorded by the zew indicator of economic sentiment is largely based on the hope that the global economic environment will develop less poorly than previously assumed the postponement of the brexit deadline may also have contributed to buoy the economic outlook overall recent german data has painted a mixed picture of the bloc s largest contributing economy

releases manufacturing activity within the bloc registered a marginal uptick while service sector activity slid above euro area purchasing managers index lloyds commercial banking analysts wrote the eurozone pmi s for april were once again disappointing the manufacturing measure did rise modestly from what had been a six year low in march but at 47 8 it was still well in contractionary territory meanwhile services activity which had gone up for the past two months slipped back the market reaction was immediate and dramatic with the eur usd taking a nose dive until finding support around 1 123

january last month the index registered a marginal increase with median forecasts for next week s release calling for a further rise to 99 6 chief international economist james knightley of ing wrote against the backdrop of the brexit flex tension and positive signals from china and trade the german ifo index due next wednesday should see a marginal improvement us dollar usd exchange rate forecast us gdp growth in focus amid mixed consensus last week saw the greenback largely at the mercy of peer currency factors alongside global levels of risk appetite with little in the way of cues to direct markets the bright spot in an otherwise largely low impact data week came from the latest us retail sales releases according to the census bureau the volume of sales at the retail level for both core and non core items rebounded well above forecast to rpint at 1 2 and 1 6 respectively released post eurozone pmis the upbeat sales figures accelerated the declines in the euro to dollar exchange rate elsewhere the latest philly fed manufacturing index release suggested that while manufacturing activity had continued to grow in april indicators for general activity and shipments fell from their readings last month above philadelphia federal reserve manufacturing index from the release the firms responses indicated continued growth in the region s manufacturing sector this month the survey s broadest measures of economic growth remain positive but the directions of movement were mixed looking ahead next week s first quarter gdp growth release is the highlight of the week for the greenback with market consensus calling for a decline to 1 8 annualised versus the previous quarters 2 2 print lloyds senior commercial banking economist rhys herbert summarised the bank s expectations we expect annualised growth of 1 8 down from 2 2 in q4 which would be the weakest quarterly rate since q1 2017 adding however that the expected drag from the us government shutdown earlier in the year and seasonal effects could be offset by an anticipated rebound in q2 economists at ing however feel an upside surprise could be on the cards which given the market consensus 1 8 could prompt further greenback appreciation the newsflow has progressively improved in recent weeks with the atlanta federal reserve s gdpnow model based on data already released suggests the economy may have expanded by as much as 2 4 annualised which is an acceleration from the 2 2 rate seen in 4q18 they wrote adding trade should make a positive contribution while consumer spending and investment should have held up inventories are likely to be a modest drag but we think the market is being a little too pessimistic in predicting an expansion of 1 8 we re looking for 2 1 growth euro exchange rate under performance to weigh on eur usd outlook looking at the euro to dollar eur usd exchange rate in the week ahead lloyds cross asset strategist robin wilkin wrote prices have developed into a range between 1 1275 and 1 1325 near term pullbacks from 1 1320 30 resistance remain corrective in nature so risks are biased for another test towards 1 1350 and 1 1390 resistance levels a breakdown through 1 1280 50 would negate that bias and suggest a re test of the 1 1170 1 1100 support region lloyds herbert added that we remain wary that the rebound in eur usd from 1 1170 is more corrective in nature but prefer to

574 214 7965 email richarwrightforsouthbend gmail com facebook facebook com richardforsouthbend the outgoing mayor has argued that south bend has transformed from what some labeled a dying city to one with robust development and population gain do you agree with this assessment of the past seven years if so what will you do to continue this progress if not why not and what needs to be done differently coleman i think the current administration has made some positive gains but i also believed that they had the opportunity to build on the momentum of the administration before them our city was not dying mayor luecke and his staff were addressing issues that had faced this community for years they addressed the old studebaker building redeveloped the scottsdale business area and worked with notre dame and the neighborhood association to develop eddy street commons and began to raise salaries for city employees all while leaving the incoming administration with a surplus budget i think we have to be more in touch with all the neighborhoods and make sure we involve them as we move forward critchlow mayor pete has done a great job contributing to the development and culture of our city in these past seven years i also believe that south bend s comeback has taken place over many years the foundation of which was laid by decades of public servants and dedicated community members amenities such as the east race four winds field and century center are components that have been leveraged to create the south bend we are seeing today but in order to take that progress to the next level we must revitalize all our neighborhoods come up with a plan for ending poverty and fix our struggling public schools system my administration will address these issues by creating public private partnerships that provide economic opportunity to everyone as well as address the quality of life issues holding our city back from sustained population gain through responsible growth and investments in people davis the nearly 8 years of success which mayor pete buttigieg experienced was grounded in the difficult challenging decisions which were made by former mayor stephen luecke by those of us who served as members of the south bend common council who worked to navigate south bend through the financial crisis which was experienced not only in south bend during the 1st decade of the 2000s but throughout our state of indiana in the united states since the close of the luecke administration the city of south bend has been able to have an aa credit rating with standard poor s a global financial rating agency an aa credit rating is a designation that means the borrower has a very strong capacity to meet its financial commitments according to mr herschel frierson managing director at crowe llc oliver has will continue to advocate for our city leaders to prepare for the 2020 fiscal cliff by making sound fiscal decisions being creatively cautious with our tif other city funds inez yes south bend has seen positive transformation my plan to continue this progress is 10 000 housing units in 10 years mueller people used to talk about south bend as if our best years were behind us but over the past eight years we ve turned a corner we ve become a city that believes in itself once again i have been proud to work alongside mayor pete and community partners to help turn our city around but we have much more work to do we must make sure that everyone is benefiting from the growth in our city no matter where they live we must start writing the next chapter of our neighborhoods our schools desperately need our help we must ensure that our communities are safe and that there is trust in law enforcement we must invest in our infrastructure and improve city services we must keep listening to residents and finding ways to address their needs we must make sure all feel welcome regardless of ethnic group sex orientation or gender identity or disability we have come a long way but we must build on our progress and keep moving forward rodriguez mayor pete has made great improvements to the city and i agree that the work he did has in fact given south bend a new reputation i want to continue this trend of growth and development but unlike the past several years we really want to focus on the neighborhoods surrounding downtown at some point lasalle turns into lincolnway and we want to close that barrier if we don t begin allocating our attention to struggling areas we will be faced with a severe housing crisis one of our biggest goals is to improve the entire city by using resources to repair roadways and bridges we want to repair buildings that can be repaired and put them to use and we want to tear down the buildings that we can use to make room for new potential business and developments williams preston we should celebrate the fact that we are seeing new growth but when 54 of working people in south bend live paycheck to paycheck we have to recognize that so far this investment and prosperity has served to benefit a relatively small segment of the community we need to ensure that revitalization and investment comes to south bend in a way that all residents can participate in and benefit from we need to review our existing policy and practice to understand who has benefited and who has been left out we need to be intentional and deliberate about development decisions moving forward to make sure we are tapping the human resources that exist investing in the people of south bend and addressing the racial wealth divide we will target tax incentives for investment in underserved areas invest in worker owned businesses and continue the work our organizing inspired providing financial assistance to help neighbors repair their homes wright yes by the effort of the previous administrations we have improved our business development south bend stays current by growing with new times people and technology green spaces and recycling efforts need to be improved we need more single family housing for growth as mayor how will you encourage development outside of downtown and improve the quality of life for residents from all socioeconomic groups coleman i think we have to encourage the development of small neighborhood business and home ownership business s look at property owners when they consider moving to communities if all the properties are rental properties they are less likely to choose that area i think we have to focus on developing programs that give citizens an opportunity to become home owners property owners creates pride provides community stability and better opportunity for business development critchlow this issue is the foundation of my campaign not only will i prioritize school quality and the quality of life improvements but it is vitally important that economic development occurs not only in our downtown but in all areas of our city around and within our neighborhoods my administration will not only utilize traditional financial incentives to encourage economic development in all areas of the city but we will also lead an effort to create training and entrepreneurship programs in order to assist residents in creating economic opportunities within their own community deindustrialization has created large tracts of vacant commercial property that exist as dangerous hazards to the surrounding neighborhoods but they provide great opportunities for the future as mayor i will pursue innovative but proven tactics such as land banking and social impact bonds to engage and include residents in improving both economic and social outcomes davis oliver was very supportive an advocate for the pokagon tribal council s development that is greatly re energizing the southwest side of the city of south bend on behalf of the pokagon tribal council and all pokagon citizens we d like to thank the bia mayor pete buttigieg former active south bend common council members councilman oliver davis members of the michiana pokagon alliance and all of the local citizens and organizations that have supported us during this lengthy process said john p warren former chairman of the pokagon band of potawatomi indians oliver has supported initiatives which promoted the growth of business on western ave he also voted to establish innovation park at notre dame and ignition park during his 15 years on the transpo board of directors oliver has worked to promote transit routes services to help meet the needs of our passengers to get to work oliver will continue to work to promote development throughout our city of south bend inez 10 000 housing units in 10 years plan mueller as mayor one of my top priorities will be improving the quality of life in our neighborhoods and ensuring that all our residents share in the benefits of our growth we must make south bend one of the most vibrant and enjoyable places to live in the midwest that means having walkable safe neighborhoods with amenities like public spaces retail stores and community organizations we must invest in infrastructure like sidewalks streets and streetlights we must remove barriers to development and update zoning regulations so that it is easier for neighbors to invest in their own communities as our city continues to grow our prosperity must be shared all our residents must be empowered to thrive regardless of income level or location as an initial step to reducing barriers we must invest in universal pre k and transportation options we must provide support to our minority owned businesses increasing access to opportunity will be a cornerstone of my administration rodriguez i ve already touched on this but improving the quality of life also goes far beyond fixing streets and revamping old buildings we also need to lower crime and improve our schools we want to get students interested in their futures which we believe in the long run will drastically improve the quality of living williams preston the city has used a traditional model of economic development start from the downtown core and move out into the neighborhoods in concentric circles what these traditional models of development have gotten us not just south bend but in cities across the country is gentrification revitalization with the displacement of poor people and people of color as mayor i will make a commitment to development without displacement the revitalization of the northeast neighborhood was done with a deliberate focus on creating a diverse inclusive neighborhood but after the project was complete the neighborhood which was 99 african american was now 99 white development was directed by a diverse board that included neighbors and local business but having the value of diversity wasn t enough they needed a new model for inclusive economic development that would review each decision through a lens of equity and inclusion wright receiving input from individual neighborhoods on these specific needs public transportation to reach jobs and entertainment for all members of our community is there a signature project such as 1 000 houses in 1 000 days or smart streets you would advance if elected coleman yes education i think education or the lack there of is the catalyst of many of the problems we face students that don t receive a good education are more likely not to find a good job not to be a home owner drug and alcohol addiction homelessness criminal justice system all level of violence we address public education we can help our community immensely therefore if i become mayor for the city of south bend i will immediately began working with the south bend school corporation to strengthen our educational system critchlow south bend universal pre k in order to support our public school system my administration will work to increase capacity and resources with the goal of ensuring every pre k student in south bend has access to early childhood development teacher friendly south bend my administration will brand south bend as a teacher friendly city by providing incentives to educators choosing to teach in south bend schools south bend works with 54 of south bend households living near or below the poverty level we must work to provide economic opportunity to everyone to combat this poverty my administration will lead the implementation of a workforce development program that creates a strong collaboration to connect students and workers with high paying career paths and training with a focus on the areas of vocational technical or trades davis the bow tie is oliver s key symbol which stands for tying our future together in south bend these seven 7 words speak to how we will tie together the future of our six 6 districts our 1 downtown area in south bend during the tenure of oliver s leadership to our city of south bend as our mayor through the seven 7 priority keys of the mayor of south bend oliver davis will establish collaborative groups within the six districts one in downtown area to work together with the neighborhoods associations business groups south bend common council and various organizations that will help to strengthen each district area and ensuring that the city of south bend s budget reflects what it will take each year to ensure that we are truly tying our future together in south bend which is an awesome way for us to have many beautiful days in our neighborhood in a manner which would make mister fred rogers proud of our neighborhoods that are within our city of south bend inez 10 000 housing units in 10 years this is a development plan that leverages public owned land assets leased to developers at a rate that incentives affordable mixed use multifamily residential and commercial property development and generates more revenue for the city in the form of property investment revenue than traditional property taxes ex a 200 unit apartment building along lincoln way w with commercial space at the ground level that is valued at 40 million on one public owned block leased to a developer at 1 generates the city 400 000 in property investment revenue vs one block in the same area generating the city approximately 10 000 50 000 in property tax revenue to accomplish affordable housing and spur economic activity in under served neighborhoods it is vital to ensure those who build housing can actually do it and do it in a way that saves tenants money and benefits our city mueller as mayor my first signature project will be establishing universal access to quality pre k our children are our city s future we must ensure that they are equipped to enter our school system ready and able to learn finding affordable childcare is also a major barrier to employment for many in our city by ensuring access to pre k we will also be empowering more residents to pursue career opportunities in addition we need to establish a cradle to career path for our youth that includes pre k summer youth programs internships and training opportunities we must attract and support top quality teachers making it easier for them to buy homes and put down roots in our community we must set up partnerships with unions and technical schools to provide skills and training opportunities we must encourage local employers to partner with our educational institutions to design programs that meet their hiring needs so graduates have jobs waiting for them rodriguez candidate did not answer williams preston south bend suffers from the consequences of u s income inequality a signature project for my administration will be leveraging public and private investment in worker owned cooperatives a model that has proven to reduce income inequality in progressive cities around the country south bend is home to large institutions that spend billions of dollars every year on goods and services sending those dollars outside our community my administration will work with local universities and hospitals to utilize local businesses i e laundry services or food production and funnel those dollars to small businesses right here at home pumping millions of dollars directly back into our economy will grow existing businesses and help local entrepreneurs start new ventures creating jobs that not only provide living wages but also actually help people in low income communities build wealth the more people able to engage in our economy the stronger our economy becomes wright i will continue pushing for diversity commerce and education for all what if anything can the mayor of south bend do to tackle the problems of poverty and homelessness in the city of south bend coleman this is not just a city administration problem it s a community problem and we have to have the community involved in solving it i would be encouraging other community partners to the table center for the homeless hope rescue mission state and federal agencies for resources mental health providers and most importantly the homeless themselves again inclusion is important how can you heal them if you don t ask them where they hurt working with the homeless organizations in the city we would look at other communities and how they are addressing the problem critchlow chronic homelessness is an issue that cannot go unaddressed as i believe we have both a moral and economic interest in ending chronic homelessness in our city the city must move forward with finding a location for the gateway center as a transitional facility where unsheltered individuals can be assessed and received short term care before transitioning to permanent housing it is estimated that every unsheltered person costs between 30 000 40 000 in annual tax dollars through utilization of emergency health and social services in addition to economic impact i embrace scattered site permanent housing with social work as both a moral and fiscally responsible solution scattered site permanent house is estimated to cost roughly 17 000 per person this solution offers the city the opportunity to see cost savings while improving quality of life and ending the cycle of chronic homeless in our community davis the mayor of south bend can set the tone of compassion for the city of south bend oliver in his leadership role as an elected councilman on the south bend city council for 12 years as a licensed clinical social worker for 20 years has worked to set the tone of compassion by passing a resolution in 2018 to ensure that south bend will start its weather amnesty programs on time passing a resolution in 2017 in 2019 to consider employing people who are panhandling to help to beautify the city of south bend like other cities such as indianapolis in albuquerque nm have had success in doing by serving on the michiana 5 for the homeless board of directors in south bend oliver also advocates that the gateway center not be placed right in front of the oliver apartments which is a housing first initiative to help people who are homeless oliver believes that the gateway center if not housed in the old salvation army building should be at diverse sites throughout our city inez first we will provide year round housing for our homeless with additional wraparound services every situation is different some need affordable housing some need skills development for employment and some need mental rehabilitation but all need our help mueller south bend must be a city where everyone can thrive regardless of race gender orientation or age our city must be measured not by the success of its wealthiest residents but rather by the experience of its most vulnerable members to help our residents experiencing homelessness we have taken steps to establish a one stop intake center create permanent supporter housing and coordinate care with other service providers we must keep working tirelessly to help our vulnerable neighbors while ensuring that everyone is respectful of our neighbors and city regulations poverty is a critical issue in our city over 25 of our residents are below the poverty line this is not acceptable raising income and lowering barriers to opportunity will be a top priority for my administration the city must play a role in ensuring safe and affordable housing is available with pathways to home ownership we must support service providers and invest in skills training and career pathways rodriguez for the poverty struck citizens of the city i believe though local government we could find them better paying jobs that offer benefits such as health insurance and 401k through offering programs that pave way for more opportunities such as finishing a ged and getting job certifications also i believe we should begin to work closely with the working class of the city to find out what each individual is talented in so everyone has a job that they will not only enjoy but that is secure as for the situation for the homeless i believe we could expand upon the existing homeless shelter so the facility can house more people also on the same note expand on advertising the homeless shelter so people know there is an option if times run tough williams preston as mayor i will engage the people living in poverty and experiencing homelessness to hear their perspective on the problem and their ideas for solutions at a recent community forum for economic justice forum homeless people spoke for themselves attendees reported this was more informative than any previous meeting summit or working group put together speakers shared information about programs in other cities that have actually put an end to chronic homelessness fort worth texas provided an apartment at no cost to city residents as long as the resident held a job city employees worked with local employers to hire residents and provide transportation with the basic needs of shelter work and transportation met people stabilized their lives and moved out of crisis another key takeaway from the forum 20 of the chronic homeless in south bend did not suffer from mental health issues or addiction they just needed a chance wright giving more resources to the outreach program of downtown south bend the violent crime rate is down citywide but many residents continue to feel besieged by senseless violence what specific suggestions do you have to curb violence or make citizens feel safer coleman public safety is one of the most important things we have to do violence is often times the end results of other problems such as drugs addiction mental health education employment housing we have to deal with those issues but we can t do it alone i will be working with other community organizations and stake holders to help address those issues programs such as group violence intervention gvi has proven to be successful and we have to continue to build on it contact coleman critchlow law enforcement officials cannot effectively do their job without the support of the community and the community cannot support its law enforcement officials unless they establish trust through transparency accountability and relationship building as mayor i will increase opportunities for police officers to establish relationships with residents by providing additional support to officers residents and community organizations that facilitate those relationships i support this community policing model in addition to proven methods such as hot spot policing i will continue proactive efforts through gang violence intervention and seek to broaden its impact by engaging additional individuals who have broken the cycle of violence to assist in outreach towards individuals experiencing similar struggles davis serving on the south bend common council oliver has always voted to support the funding of our police and fire departments for they are at the forefront of helping to promote our public safety in our city of south bend as a licensed clinical social worker oliver strongly believes that enhancing our communication between our police our youth our parents during times of peace remains a key need to help us during our times of crisis thus having a police officer full time in our middle schools in high schools instead of part time is a key resource to empower our youth learn how to trust our police during peace times furthermore promoting neighborhood block captains both in our community neighborhood block captains on line facebook snapchat twitter on other online settings helps us to be proactive in learning about crimes prior to them taking place helping us to more readily solve crime when it does occur promoting youth who keep the law is very important inez restorative practices are necessary in fighting crime and reducing violence a community partnership must be formed between police schools and hospitals schools to keep our youth from entering into the system we have to address and provide proper behavioral care to students showing early signs of high risk criminal behavior jail our local jail does not have the adequate resources to provide services to reduce recidivism by releasing low risk offenders and utilizing technology to help them navigate the justice system our county jail will save 91 in inmate operations cost and will free financial resources to properly care for those in the system hospitals we need to make use of hospitals access to victims and implement systemic restorative practices to reduce retaliatory violence many victims become offenders because of retaliation or getting back at someone mueller while violent crime is down one death is too many neighbors must feel safe in their homes and in their communities crime and violence have no place in our city i will focus on building trust between the community and law enforcement ensuring that police officers and firefighters have the resources they need to protect the community and providing opportunities to at risk youth as mayor i will work to implement best practices for community policing including regular foot patrols setting meet n greets in neighborhoods and having officers regularly check in with residents to ensure that our law enforcement reflects the community they serve i will push for the recruitment and retention of diversity within the department as chief of staff i helped expand the group violence intervention program that has helped curb violent crime i will build on this innovative trust building program as well as increasing opportunities for our at risk youth and neighbors rodriguez there are many solutions i feel our biggest is with returning offenders it s a vicious cycle you commit a crime go to prison get out now what you struggle to find somewhere to hire you with good pay you can t find somewhere to live because of your record so you fall back into crime breaking the law to get by whether it s by selling drugs or stealing etc we want to connect ex offenders to stable housing and help them find secure living wage employment these are key factors in reducing not only repeat offenders but crime rates overall williams preston the loss of life in our community to violence is intolerable the solution to this problem is not just more effective and community based policing and not just getting more guns off the street we need to continue to invest in group violence intervention which plays an important role in public safety we have to nurture our ability to resolve conflict without violence as mayor i will invest in the goal of being a restorative city with peaceful neighborhoods where children can feel safe and supported my community relations committee has convened a diverse team of committed people from schools neighborhoods non profits and universities to build a citywide plan to reduce violence by building peace as we build strong relationships among community members we will improve our ability to communicate to prevent conflict and when conflict arises we will be able to resolve our differences without violence wright i would promote more police living in these areas more off duty police cars parked in these neighborhoods more police foot and bike patrols

the minister of finance mrs zainab ahmed says while government borrows to deliver on its promises it was also mindful of rising debt burden which eats up about 25 per cent of the country s annual earnings ahmed said this in an interview with the news agency of nigeria nan on the side line of the just concluded imf world bank meetings which took place in washington dc from april 9 to 14 nigeria currently has an external debt stock of about 24 27 billion dollars as at december 31 2018 euro bonds loans from world bank group china and africa development bank group make up over 80 per cent of the country s debt stock ahmed insisted that in spite of warnings by the imf and world bank the country was not in any way near a debt crisis the world bank and imf are cautioning us on the rate at which we are borrowing they are also cautioning us on the need to build fiscal buffers because the global economy is going to be facing some risks and we agree with that we are very mindful of the level of our borrowings our borrowing is very much within fiscal limits right now what we are doing is to increase our revenue generating capacity to make it easier for us to meet our debt obligations and our routine as well as capital expenditure she said nan correspondent raised concerns about whether the chinese loans to finance the idu kaduna lagos ibadan and abuja light rail projects the expansion of four airport terminals and some hydroelectric projects across the country were healthy for the nation s economy the correspondent also raised concerns about whether the conditions for the loans were favourable to the overall interest of nigeria ahmed responded saying to borrow we go through several processes of assessments as well as negotiations we make sure we get the best possible terms and whether we are borrowing from financial institutions or in europe or china or anywhere else we try to get the best rates of borrowing so far the conditions we ve got are very good ones she said ahmed restated the commitment of the president muhammadu buhari led administration to ensure that the country grows in a manner that would bring many people out of poverty according to her it is for this reason that the government takes its social investment programmes like the school feeding conditional cash transfers to the poor and vulnerable and trader moni programme very seriously

wanted suitable candidate to run one of the world s leading central banks applicants should demonstrate the economic acumen of a keynes the diplomatic skills of a metternich the political cunning of a machiavelli and the hide of a rhinoceros those interested should register their interest with the right hon philip hammond esq at hm treasury interviews will take place in the coming months and the name of the new governor will be announced in the autumn now that there is a bit of brexit breathing space hammond can get on with a couple of the other issues in his intray one of which is to find a successor to mark carney at the bank of england when he leaves next january hammond has already twice persuaded carney to stay on at threadneedle street from his original summer 2018 scheduled departure date but knows that there will be no further extension as a result the treasury is starting to think about who might be a suitable replacement the chancellor warned while in washington dc for the spring meeting of the international monetary fund that some potential candidates might be deterred from applying due to the toxic political atmosphere in the uk as a result of the brexit process this seems unlikely running the bank of england is a plum job and carries enormous prestige yes carney has taken a lot of stick from tory mps over brexit but every central banker these days can expect a bit of political rough and tumble ask jerome powell of the us federal reserve who is on the receiving end of incessant demands from donald trump to stimulate the american economy or mario draghi of the european central bank faced with the near impossible task of keeping all 19 members of the single currency happy it was all a bit different when carney s predecessor mervyn king became the bank s governor in 2003 back then growth was steady and inflation deviated only marginally from its 2 target all threadneedle street s monetary policy committee needed to do was give an occasional tweak to interest rates but the financial crisis and its aftermath changed all that anybody who thinks a central bank is above politics and can be run by a pure technocrat really hasn t been paying attention in the past decade the bank of england has expressed controversial views about reducing the uk s budget deficit scottish independence and the likely effects of a no vote in the eu referendum the fact that there has been no lasting recovery despite rock bottom interest rates and oodles of quantitative easing means that central banks are under scrutiny as never before any candidate hoping for a quiet cloistered life should not be applying and would not be worth interviewing if they did so who gets the gig one school of thought is that brexit makes it inevitable that hammond will go for one of the home grown candidates rather than someone for another country a few eyebrows were raised when carney was appointed in 2013 the argument being that britain a nation that specialises in financial services should be capable of finding one out of 66 million people suitable to run the bank of england if the government does go down that route there are plenty of names to consider sir jon cunliffe has an impressive looking cv having worked at the treasury and as the uk permanent representative in brussels before becoming one of the bank s deputy governors cunliffe knows how eu works which could prove useful whichever way the brexit process pans out andrew bailey the chief executive of the financial conduct authority is another considered a safe pair of hands although perhaps a bit too safe it is not that bailey s time running the watchdog has had its share of problems because that is always going to be the case with a body that is supposed to root out wrongdoing rather the question is whether anyone actually fears the fca a bank of england governor needs to be feared as carney certainly is ben broadbent the bank s deputy governor for monetary policy and andy haldane the bank s chief economist are also mentioned among the list of runners and riders for the job the question mark over broadbent is whether he actually wants the job enough haldane would have a better chance if john mcdonnell were chancellor spreading the net wider hammond might want to talk to shriti vadera who worked for gordon brown and is now the chair of santander uk and minouche shafik a deputy governor of the bank before becoming director of the london school of economics sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk all this though suggests that hammond is set on giving the job to a brit and there is no evidence that this is the case hammond likes and admires carney he thinks people sit up and take notice when the governor holds forth at international meetings and that he is good for the uk s reputation every time hammond goes to an imf meeting he sizes up possible candidates for the bank job he is for example a big fan of agustín carstens the mexican born general manager of the bank for international settlements but the likeliest overseas candidate and one who ticks an awful lot of boxes would be raghuram rajan he is a distinguished economist has run the indian central bank and so knows a think or two about how to handle political pressure and is a good communicator his appointment would suggest that global britain might be more than a slogan rajan says he is happy where he is at chicago booth school of business and may play hard to get but then again so did carney

visualizing the happiest country on every continent for the latest update check out the happiest countries in the world in 2023 the state of our world is shifting beneath our feet economics alone no longer equate to satisfaction let alone happiness today s visualization pulls data from the seventh world happiness report 2019 which ranks 156 countries by their happiness levels we ve previously shown the variables used to measure happiness in this report but here we break down rankings by continent and region for a clearer picture of where each country lies north america unhappy americans have caused the country to tumble in rankings for a third straight year despite evidence that things are generally looking up the report attributes much of this erosion to a variety of addictions opioids workaholism gambling internet exercise and even shopping are among them haiti is the least happy country in this region the country is still struggling to rebuild sanitation infrastructure and other educational and healthcare programs despite foreign aid in brighter news nicaragua is seeing great gains in happiness levels as the country makes a concentrated effort to reduce poverty south america in south america the majority of countries cluster around a score of six on the happiness scale the one notable exception to this is venezuela which is faltering in both happiness rank and regional improvement the nation s hyperinflation and humanitarian crisis both show no signs of slowing down europe finland comes out on top of the world for a second consecutive year and it s not difficult to see why the country boasts a stable work life balance bolstered by a comprehensive welfare state scandinavian countries appear among the happiest nations for similar very reasons elevating the region s score to 16 above the global average on the flip side ukraine is the unhappiest likely intensified by the ongoing war in southeastern donbass greece is the least improved as it continues to heal from the sovereign debt crisis middle east and central asia uzbekistan shows the swiftest regional improvement as the country has launched an ambitious reform agenda for greater economic social and political development and openness unfortunately syria s continued civil war comes with a heavy price for its people and economy as does the palestinian israeli conflict although the latter doesn t seem to impact israel s happiness ranking in fact israel finished with the 13th best score globally rest of asia and oceania in east asia the average happiness score is quite close to the global average with taiwan standing out as the happiest country singapore out competes other countries within southeast asia despite only being home to a population of 5 6 million its neighbor malaysia however plunged from 35th to 80th place oceania stands alone australia and new zealand are closely matched in their individual happiness scores africa the african continent as a whole fares 19 2 below the global average but there are silver linings with strong strides towards improvement being made mauritius benefits from good governance and a buoyant tourism sector with visitor arrivals equal to the island s 1 3 million population meanwhile benin has soared in the rankings and is supported by the world bank in key structural reforms such as poverty reduction and access to basic services what could these rankings look like in another ten years notes the africa map was updated to show more country scores the report only covers 156 countries so oceania only refers to australia and new zealand in this instance
