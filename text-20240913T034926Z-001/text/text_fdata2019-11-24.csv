one day in 2010 goldman sachs ceo lloyd blankfein inadvertently provided a glimpse into the fundamental economic assumptions behind the financial crisis which had recently rocked the globe when asked why his bank was so profitable in the face of a sluggish american recovery he replied â the people of goldman sachs are among the most productive in the world arguably he was doing the duty of a ceo in defending his employees under media pressure still it was high praise for a sector whose recklessness had thrown the worldâ s richest economy into chaos and who were rewarded for it with a bailout deal and it raised a further question that had suddenly become relevant again because of the crisis productive by what measure when mariana mazzucato discusses that question the blankfein quote remains one of her favorite go toâ s based at university college london and founder of the institute for innovation and public purpose mazzucato has spent her professional career on answering it her latest book on the topic is the value of everything making and taking in the global economy published in 2018 the book is a tour de force of economics history and policy such breadth is arguably necessary for mazzucatoâ s fundamental goal reopening the debate about economic value what it includes and who has the power to define it what should count as real economic wealth who truly creates it who merely assists the process and who might be actively impeding it the answers to that question have directed how economies develop how governments direct or impede production and what forms of economic power come to dominate human life once the question of value dominated economic discourse the french physiocrats argued that wealth was produced from the land conversely adam smith tended to see landlords as a rentier class marx famously defined labor itself as the source of value but this debate about value once core to economic discourse has long been de emphasized in the discipline as mazzucato demonstrates the marginal revolution in economics heralded a subjective utility focused approach that effectively sidestepped the historic debate about value a sidestep that in mazzucatoâ s telling drastically impoverished the discipline an undergrad student today is likely to hear the above names once or twice in the opening lecture of an introductory course and then only as a one off primer how did this happen following a historical primer on how the question of value was obscured the book takes the reader through the successive results chief among these are the rise of financial power and its cannibalization of large parts of economic life the extractive institutions in technological and medical innovation and the gutting of a once innovative and bold public sector which had produced immense value across fields from consumer technology to medical products ultimately mazzucato exposes an orthodoxy of silence about value in modern economics as well as in government this orthodoxy claims mazzucato has undermined public and private institutions and fundamentally weakened the ability of modern neoliberal economies to innovate but mazzucato is optimistic the glory days of innovation are not lost to the mid 20th century by returning to the question of value mazzucato is calling for state and private actors to address on a large scale what forms of value our economic life should create in taking this frame it becomes impossible to flee political and social questions for the bloodless realm of technocracy the minimization of governanceâ s moral and political judgements in favor of a â scientificâ cloak such an approach to economics restores the social and collective element to how value is created it is a bold call and one which undergirds the bookâ s detailed and multifaceted contents mazzucatoâ s introductory chapters on the value debate are especially useful in how they subvert popular dichotomies she begins with familiar names like adam smith david ricardo karl marx and vilfredo pareto but they are no longer categorized and opposed to each other on the basis of â free markets â or other discourse tropes of the political commentariat the important question here is that of what creates value and on this point smith and marx find themselves fighting on a similar front against their successors decades later a key tool for understanding the divide is the production boundary as an accounting tool the boundary determines what is considered production in national accounts for example modern economists generally consider a service worker at a hotel to be contributing to the labor marketâ s supply side while someone doing chores in their own house is generally not considered to be part of a market at all as countries developed national accounts records the question of what to consider real wealth was vitally important the sides which later economists took represent not only theoretical differences but different sides in class conflicts political battles and strategies for national and imperial greatness as mazzucato notes adam smith himself conceived of his project as â giving guidance to â statesmenâ on how to act to â enrich both the people and the sovereign â â if early economists aspired to an objective understanding on how to achieve their ends the ends themselves were immensely political smith ricardo and marx took labor as key to understanding how value was created smithâ s stricter production boundary leaves only primary and secondary sectors as productive and excludes what we now call the service sector his thesis takes labor specifically labor realized in a â permanent objectâ of material production as the source of value in doing so he broke with earlier thinkers who had considered industry to be merely a facilitator of wealth drawn from the land like agriculture smith also highlighted what he considered to be the great enemy of production monopolistic power rentier landlords mercantilist protectionism and competition stifling guilds were impediments to the marketâ s freedom unlike many who invoke him in the present smith saw government as playing a leading role in establishing what he defined as a â free marketâ one free from rent seeking monopoly power not from government regulation ricardo in his turn explored subjects like the distribution of income and the vital role of surpluses in spurring development marx in contrast to smith placed the service sector in his production boundary ironically neither marx nor smith considered government to be inside the production boundary an assumption mazzucato challenges later in the book as mazzucato elaborates marxâ s contribution was not strictly speaking the tying in of labor with value rather it was his recognition that the capitalist form of production created a new form of society characterized by class realities and relationships markedly different from what came before but he also introduced a more subtle production boundary what mattered was not occupation per se but whether labor produced surplus value like ricardo he understood rents as redistribution and not value creation despite his radical politics marxâ s economic thinking its focus on labor on value and on classes and occupations was explicitly building on his predecessors for mazzucato the real rupture has a different source the marginal revolution and the rise of utility rather than value in economic thinking built on the work of leon walras william jevons and carl menger this change shaped the rise of what we now call neoclassical economics its assumptions shape the discipline to this day and itâ s what undergraduates are regularly taught rather than focusing on how wealth was created and what counted as wealth economists began to ask how utility satisfaction from consuming a good or service was satisfied by decisions on the margin this allowed for the mathematical approaches used and abused in modern economics the notion of utility in this sense is fundamentally subjective mazzucato notes that discourses about just or unjust prices like those in thomas aquinas become not just outmoded but impossible under this view prices are not a reflection of some objective sense of value rather value exists only in the eye of the consumer price in turn reflects utility gained by a consumer from an additional unit of goods or services the production boundary becomes weak in terms of economic analysis since all market exchanges are effectively contained within it only non market transfers remain outside it most damaging of all for mazucatto the concept of â unearned income â once fundamental to smithâ s conception of free versus unfree markets effectively ceases to exist while economists can continue to distinguish between monopolistic oligopolistic and competitive markets the far more political question of whether market based value extraction can be parasitic fades from view the debate might seem overly abstract but its implications have had concrete effects on the economic and political life of the worldâ s most powerful countries and governments in the remainder of the book mazzucato turns her focus to explaining how the next several chapters focus on mazzucatoâ s bãªte noire the leviathan sector of finance its blankfeinian mythos of hyper productivity and its power over both economic and political life its ascension is a tale all its own and embodies how the more abstract themes of value impact the real economic life of families workers and countries the notion that finance is part of the productive sphere at all is relatively new in the history of economic development aquinas and other medieval thinkers treated it with suspicion adam smith more or less ignored it and marx treated it as part of capitalâ s â circulation phase â economists in the 20th century also critiqued it mazzucato notes keynes and minsky but these warnings were not earth shaking at a time when financial services were a very low share of national output interestingly mazzucato points out that keynes prefigured modern concerns about financeâ s brain drain of engineers and scientists with his quip that rather than participating in a success story of laissez faire capitalism â the best brains of wall street have been in fact directed towards a different object â measures like gdp give the impression that measures of wealth reflect scientific and objective empiricism economics may find itself among social sciences and arts departments in universities but unlike its counterparts in sociology or history it aspires to the higher realm of expertise in reality gdp and similar measures have evolved over time based on the judgment of those doing the measuring mazzucato covers notable problems and changes before 2008 the international system of national accounts sna considered r d an input a cost subtracted from final output but that year in house r d became considered a final output since it increased the stocks of knowledge important for companies as mazzucato notes the u s update of this measure in 2013 â added 400 billion 2 5 of us gdp to national income overnight â by its nature this was a qualitative decision so too are decisions about whether to measure black market economies as in italy whether to legalize certain markets and begin to account for them prostitution in the netherlands marijuana in canada how to distinguish profits and rents the sna has tried for years and non market economies housework and social fabric this is important when we consider how finance became a major and powerful part of the â productiveâ economy financeâ s case is founded on the notion that it is a necessary part of spurring production by allocating capital this is true in a basic sense household savings donâ t always cover costs and business revenues donâ t always cover investments if finance merely pooled and directed resources to match these needs it would not be a very exceptional industry but in reality finance does much more like other firms banks are profit driven rather than simple matchmaking they act strategically to channel their revenues especially into interest payments and toward shareholders this logic fuels speculation bubbles which are then continually refinanced through securitization and other strategies for inflating assets without investment mazzucato cites the case of the australian bank macquarie which acquired the major british utility company thames water rather than provide direct investment macquarie ballooned the companyâ s debt to â 7 8 billion 10 05 billion over the next 6 years in other words the company was leveraging the privatized assets they had acquired into increasing debt thus saving their own revenues for interest payments and shareholder distributions this might benefit the financial companies involved but it is hard to make the case that public assets are well served by privatizing them into the hands of risky debt leveraging operations the financial crisis in 2008 9 is the most infamous example of what happens when debt is used to inflate asset values which are in turn used to back up financial instruments as mazzucato points out the large scale effect of financeâ s market strategies since the financial crisis has been debt deflation followed by unemployment and wage suppression â in other words value is extracted from labourâ s share of earnings in order to restore corporate profits â despite the reality of systematic value extraction in addition to real saving and lending the financial sector is viewed as a key part of the economy one of the key sna revisions that cemented this status only came in 1993 that year the sna was revised to include a metric called â financial intermediation services indirectly measuredâ fisim fisim measures the differential in interest that borrowers will pay and lenders will receive in relation to a â reference rate â multiplied by the stock of loans to the extent that this measure is high banks are seen as providing real value to both mazzucato reflects that after this change fisim was considered a real productive contribution rather than a representation of services that were ultimately consumed by firms as inputs with the full implementation of this change by the late 2000s â just in time for the 2008 financial crisis â mazzucato blithely notes the financial sector has continued to make growing â contributionsâ to gdp particularly in the u s and u k and yet events during those decades have made clear how different they are from other firms sectors like tech or natural resources canâ t contribute to the money supply the way commercial banks can and canâ t as easily hedge parts of the economy against each other while playing both sides even the economic fallout has been to their benefit as households are forced to compensate for the marketâ s sluggishness through private debt but this is far from the whole story the financialization of the economy has unfolded far beyond the activities of banks mazzucato provides an account of the process which is both rigorous and approachable to non expert readers the effect is most obvious in asset management and the world of hedge funds private equity and venture capital firms once distinct from risk averse pension funds the rules on pension fund investments have been relaxed since the 1970s the differences between lender and borrower interest rates reflected by the fisim metric theoretically represent a transaction cost on the movement of liquidity but governments count them as productive contributions from the financial sector monopoly power and high charges for taking on risk which might be assumed to lend themselves to more effective regulation have gone hand in hand with unchained speculation all these qualities which would be regarded as unacceptable inefficiencies in other industries and proof of government incompetence in the public sector conversely finance seems to exist in a realm all its own such financialization has deeply affected the real economy mazzucato points to the american icons of ford and general electric â in the 2000s for example the us arm of ford made more money by selling loans for cars than by selling the cars themselves over the same period ge capital the finance arm of the enormous general electric ge group made around half of the whole groupâ s earnings â hard production is further undermined by short termist pressures which divert revenues from risk taking r d toward share buybacks mazzucato brings clarity to the situation in examining how private equity firms ratched up the debt to equity ratios in two vital services in the u k care homes and water care homes increasingly went from family firm or local control to becoming parts of larger chains many of these have private equity involvement mazzucato examines the case of four seasons health care where a series of debt expansions and resales ultimately left the company with an annual interest charge of over â 100 nearly 130 per bed per week by 2008 in the case of water companies those owned by private equity firms itself a result of english and welsh water privatization in 1989 carried the highest net debt mazzucato points out that â the company with the lowest gearing ratio of debt to equity and the highest credit rating was welsh water which is mutually owned â welsh water is owned and operated as a not for profit operation by a single purpose private company for the benefit of customers with its board made up mostly of independent directors who do not play an executive role in all these cases political decisions opened the path for the financial sectorâ s actions often this was undergirded by an ideology which vaunted private sector discipline and efficiency compared with public sector stagnation and sluggishness the truth isnâ t as rosy in the case of four seasons their financial straits later became severe enough that twenty eight homes were embargoed for further residents following her exacting discussion of financial power mazzucato spends the final chapters of the book on two other great myths in the modern story of value innovation and the public sector these chapters serve a valuable purpose in ensuring the reader doesnâ t lose the forest for the trees ultimately the stories we tell about economic value are the point here not just another discussion about finance as such for mazzucato deeply influenced by joseph schumpeter the great standard bearer of innovationâ s centrality to capitalism the great myths around innovation surround its very sources in particular the true investments and risks which have driven modern innovation are far more collective efforts in her reading in contrast many of the rewards have been captured and privatized by tendencies similar to those in finance and in the classic rent problems of thinkers like smith one of mazzucatoâ s great points of advocacy has been championing how many of the worldâ s biggest companies have built themselves on the legacy of state backed publicly funded innovation for example nearly all major parts on modern smartphone including touchscreens were originally developed in university based research facilities with public money the optimization of these technologies into industrial products is the significant contribution of the private economy but the foundational technological innovation itself does not originate in private industry other prominent examples include the role of the defense advanced research projects agency darpa in developing the internet and siri the u s navyâ s creation of the gps system used by phones and computers and the national science foundationâ s grant contributions to creating the algorithm behind google one example that stands out is pharmaceutical drugs it is a common refrain among american drug companies and one mazzucato examines in depth that exorbitant prices are necessary for r d revenues but in her analysis â research has shown that two thirds of the most innovative drugs new molecular entities with priority rating trace their research back to funding by the us national institutes of health â mazzucato contrasts the stages at which research is financed by public versus venture capital funding generally speaking public funding tends to step in at risky early stage research the stage where most ventures necessarily fail the private sector generally desires greater certainty nevertheless it is possible to speculate on uncertainty and mazzucato details how the biopharmaceutical private sector has repeatedly done so despite a patchy record of product delivery it is very much worth considering the implications venture capital funds like the aforementioned banks take on risk and are surely entitled to reward but in these sectors a large payout is seen as a sign of success the public sector alone is seen as â inefficientâ and an â obstacleâ insofar as it actually earns direct revenues from its ventures through taxation or otherwise the rest of mazzucatoâ s survey of the innovation sphere takes the reader through other strategies of extracting value of course there is the renowned debate on patents and intellectual property by nature a monopoly the equivalencies between rent and incomes from intellectual monopoly have been widely discussed and mazzucatoâ s overview is succinct her following analysis of pharma pricing brings back the question of value in a very real way under heavy criticism for the old canard that high prices are justified by much inflated r d expenses companies have invoked â value based pricing â arguing that high prices reflect the value provided by the drug but this value is often highly questionable since true â free marketsâ do not really exist in much of the medical sphere the degree of investment and administrative specialization required favors large conglomerates and companies with the capacity to build expertise mazzucato cites the research of well known oncologist and critic of pharmaceutical pricing dr peter bach who has argued that true values based pricing should lower prices in many cases but should medical necessities treated as such commodities at all who should be the buyer and what their incentives this is a political question and one which should take into account that as we have seen much of this research is already publicly funded to begin with finally we get a look at first mover advantages and network effects collective realities which generate the user base and mass data which companies effectively privatize in terms of value this brings us to the culmination of a theme which mazzucato weaves through the entire book the public sector as a true creator of economic value value which could not just as easily be created by private counterparts in anglo american political commentary john maynard keynes is still seen as the prophet of state investment mazzucato gives a useful introduction to his lens but points out an important fact keynes was focusing on state activity during bad economic times the spending he discusses is â counter cyclical â intended to shock sluggish and shrinking output in reality states have been able to create value beyond the bounds of correcting market failures the battles over measuring whether public spending multiplies value or not characterized much of 20th century economics as mazzucato points out european austerity cuts may have provided test cases as cuts led to falls in total output one study she cites finds that the multiplier value of public spending in advanced economies the effect that an increase in public expenditure has on total production is 1 5 what this means is that on net such spending creates more value on net than it destroys or crowds out public choice theory holds its place in the university of chicagoâ s legacy of ideas with its focus on the potential of bureaucratic capture by crony corruption it brought an attitude of caution even suspicion to the possibility of state intervention to resolve market failures with a risk averse attitude toward government failure it served as a powerful ideological tool in government turns toward privatization the imf and world bank became vehicles for global pressure backed with development dollars for growing states to shed their assets to the private sector the idea was that the private sector would in most cases do a better job and where market failures existed governments ought to be stringent in ensuring that they did not do more harm than good some decades later itâ s time for test cases mazzucato takes cases from healthcare and other public initiatives particularly prominent is britainâ s national health service nhs in which the private sector has had a creeping presence thanks to outsourcing in that case â internal marketsâ were intentionally created and hospitals turned into trusts and encouraged to contract services as mazzucato details the result was increasing levels of private public administrative bureaucracy importantly the resulting markets were hardly competitive since only a few specialized firms can service particular needs a fact which doubtlessly makes collusion easy even informally such administrative transaction costs create no direct value but grow with privatized outsourcing while current information on the nhs appears unavailable mazzucato contrasts the capture by such administrative costs of 30 of total healthcare expenditure in the u s compared with only 6 in the nhs prior to its marketization phase with vertical integration along supply chains long proven to create economic gains for multinationals it should not be entirely surprising that the reverse trend in the name of privatization might actually raise costs mazzucato also looks at examples like scottish infrastructure and private contractors which work with both u s and u k governments particularly troubling is the pattern of contractors repeatedly winning contracts despite multiple breaches and fines one example is the british security firm g4s which has been fined for â at least 100 breaches of prison contracts between 2010 and 2016 including â failure to achieve search targets smuggling of contraband items failure of security procedures serious cases of â concerted indiscipline â hostage taking and roof climbing â nevertheless g4s and similar companies across service sectors continue to win contracts thanks to their dominance in a niche industry requiring specialized administrative expertise one of mazzucatoâ s most startling citations is a study showing federal approval for contract billing rates which net these private companies 1 83 times more than it pays federal employees in compensation and more than 2 times the private sector equivalent and all this despite the fact that the actual workers in contractor firms often suffer poor wages and conditions rather than lean and efficient services privatization appears to have led to administrative bloat price inflation and a gutting of state capacity this gutting is in essence the most harmful aspect of the whole operation when it comes to state capacity in a world where existing technologies are built on the legacy of bold and successful public investment states have been convinced that they should not and cannot achieve great things cuts undermine previously successful initiatives leading to propaganda about inherent public sector inefficiency and then to the capture of state achievements by private capital and adding insult to injury the cronyism continues and even worsens mazzucatoâ s challenge is not just to revive the economic debates about where value comes from it is to bring that debate to the center of modern questions about economic growth and innovation the consequences of 2008 9 have not simply been economic but political it is difficult to see how the populist movements which have rocked western countries since then could have grown without that period moreover stagnation has allowed china to increase legitimacy as a superior alternative and partner for countries seeking economic growth political consequences are the wellspring of historyâ s great conflagrations when the polity breaks down completely internal appetites turn from growth and stability to spite and revenge instead mazzucato calls for an â economics of hope â a bolder and competent public sector does not come at the expense of private initiative but rather creates opportunities for willing private actors markets in this understanding become tools to be used rather than hedges by cowardly states or some kind of economic â state of nature â she points to the great austro hungarian economist karl polanyiâ s understanding of markets as â deeply embedded in social and political institutions they are outcomes of complex processes of interactions between different actors in the economy including government â particularly vital is the rebuilding of the public sectorâ s in house capacity for innovation the private sector which has outsourced much of its production line abroad will likely have a role to play here the mission oriented approach which mazzucato calls for and has written about in her other work does not subsume the economy into the bureaucracy of a leviathan state the age of the apollo missions and of the research which undergirds modern technological and medical knowledge existed side by side with a dynamic private sector so too do the state directed market economies of today mazzucato refrains from providing a fleshed out value theory of her own however her clear goal is that economists and governments alike to cease viewing value as a purely subjective and individualistic measure the value of everything is absolutely worth the deep and reflective read it will remain a vital resource for those interested in going beyond the tropes which make up much of public economics commentary ideally it will also become a valuable guide for those who create bold and enduring alternatives to spur on the governments and innovators of the future ash milton is contributing editor at palladium magazine you can follow him at miltonwrites
small and big businesses are openly selling their goods and services in foreign currency particularly the united states dollar in direct contravention of the law which made the zimbabwe dollar the sole legal tender in local transactions there are fears the practice which is gradually being entrenched will work against government s efforts to de dollarise on june 24 government through statutory instrument si 142 of 2019 known as reserve bank of zimbabwe legal tender regulations abolished the use of the british pound united states dollar south african rand botswana pula and any other foreign currencies as legal tender it marked the transition from the multi currency system which had existed for 10 years to a mono currency two additional pieces of legislation enacted in september si 212 and si 213 of 2019 gazetted under the presidential powers temporary measures amendment of exchange control act regulations 2019 further imposed civil as well as criminal penalties on companies and individuals who either sell or quote their goods or services in foreign currency a survey conducted by the sunday mail indicates that retailers including listed companies right in the heart of the central business district continue to sell fast moving consumer goods fmcgs and household items in foreign currency however operators in the hospitality sector claim si 191 of 2019 empowers them to charge tourists in foreign currency but the provision which is presently being extended to local customers as well does not expressly give tourism designated businesses this right it only specifies that the the operator shall remit levy in the same currency as received from the tourist or user there is also confusion in distinguishing between local and international tourists the sunday mail managed to buy a meal along first street for us 2 from outlet belonging to one of the country s biggest fast food retailers without any hassles and was issued with a receipt confirming the us dollar transaction zimbabwe tourism authority zta acting chief executive officer givemore chidzidzi insists tourist designated businesses can charge tourists in foreign currency since their mandate is to raise foreign currency for the country ideally as is in other countries tourists are required to change their money and settle local transactions in local currency but currently it is very difficult to access funds on the interbank market hence this provision he said fast foods outlets are designated tourism businesses hence they qualify to charge in forex however the problem is that sometimes there is no way for them to determine who is a tourist and who is not my only concern is whether they go on to bank the money private schools pharmacies property owners grocery stores furniture and appliance stores and motor spares dealers have joined the bandwagon complaints consumers are now beginning to raise the red flag on the practice which has become pervasive director of legal services in the ministry of industry and commerce mr never katiyo said they were being inundated with complaints against property owners who are charging rentals in foreign currency the issue of property owners charging their tenants in foreign currency is a serious issue that needs to be looked into he said we have received so many complaints in almost every province property owners should know that pegging their rentals in foreign currency is illegal property owners who continue with the practice he added will be handed over to the police formal businesses complying the law are however pricing their goods using us dollar parallel market rates some businesses have even established bureaux de change dealerships on site for convenience of accessing the greenback the monetary policy committee mpc a key advisory organ of the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz which was constituted recently said inflation was partly being stoked by inflation expectations which describes the tendency to peg prices markedly higher in order to enable businesses to replenish their stock joint operation national police spokesperson assistant commissioner paul nyathi claimed a joint operation with the central bank is underway there is a joint operation between rbz and the police which is actually going on at the moment to rein in those culprits he said it involves all stakeholders and is being led by the rbz and our teams are already on the ground as police we encourage members of the public to report such issues so that we can deal with them but he could not comment on whether any businesses had been arrested as yet finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube told a post 2020 budget breakfast meeting in the capital on friday that it was increasingly difficult for an economy to de dollarise the solution he said lay in ensuring the stability of the exchange rate if you can keep the exchange rate stable that can delink or rather reduce the transmission of the exchange rate to inflation that is the trick a reuters trading system which incorporates live market data trading and automated matching of trades between counter parties placement and execution of orders will be

jan pieter jansen a 77 year old retiree from the netherlands had high hopes for a worry free retirement after having saved diligently into a pension during his working life but jansen a former manager in the metal industry has been forced to reappraise his plans after receiving notice from his retirement scheme one of the netherlands biggest industry sector funds of plans to cut his pension by up to 10 understandably the news has hit like a sledgehammer this is causing me a lot of stress says jansen who retired 17 years ago and hoped to use his pension pot to treat his grandchildren and afford good hotels on holidays the cuts to my pension will mean thousands of euros less that i can spend on the family and the holidays we like i m very angry that this is happening after i saved for so long advertisement jansen is not alone in experiencing pension pain tens of millions more pensioners and savers around the world are facing the same retirement insecurity as plunging interest rates since the financial crisis wreak havoc on the funding of schemes as average life expectancy increases pensions have become a defining political issue in countries as diverse as russia japan and brazil general electric the industrial conglomerate recently announced that it is joining a growing list of companies that are ending guaranteed final salary style pension schemes affecting about 20 000 of its employees in the u k tens of thousands of university academics are preparing to take strike action over steep rises in their pension contributions a common factor in this global pension upheaval has been suppressed bond yields bonds have historically provided a simple match for the cash flows needed to be paid out to the members of retirement schemes but decades of declining bond yields have made it far harder for pension funds to buy an income for their members pushing them more into equities and other riskier untraded investments such as real estate and private equity buoyant financial markets have so far ensured robust investment gains for pension plans on their existing holdings yet given their long term liabilities the dimming outlook for future gains is causing anguish their house is on fire says alex veroude chief investment officer for the u s at insight investment which manages money on behalf of many pension funds and rates can and probably will go lower from here even if the house is on fire it s still only the first floor we think it can hit the second and third floor as well advertisement this is not merely a danger to individuals like jansen who may see their pensions cut it could also have a wider effect on the economy if people set aside more money for retirement it may hamper economic growth by reducing consumption the opposite of the intention of central banks when they cut rates there may even be more systemic consequences last month the international monetary fund warned in its annual report on global financial stability that the rush by pension funds into illiquid assets will hamstring the traditional role they play in stabilizing markets during periods of stress as they will have less money available to scoop up bargains the push into more unorthodox investment strategies is worrying some in the industry who warn that it could exacerbate market downturns we re seeing some really unusual behavior and we ll see some payback says con michalakis chief investment officer of statewide an australian pension plan the trillion dollar question is when i ve been doing this for long enough not to want to predict when it will happen when christopher ailman studied for a degree in business economics at the university of california in the late 1970s federal reserve chairman paul volcker was ratcheting up interest rates sending bond yields spiraling higher soon after he graduated in 1980 the 10 year treasury yield hit a record of nearly 16 and the concept of subzero yields seemed preposterous today the yield on the 10 year

pension plan but here we are in the wake of the financial crisis many central banks deployed unconventional new tools to reinvigorate the global economy once interest rates hit zero at first this

japan and the rest of europe with the desperate scramble for bonds pushing yields lower growing concerns over the health of the global economy a subdued inflation outlook and expectations of even

stanley that s great for today s asset owners especially those close to retirement it is much less good for anyone trying to save invest or manage well into the future who face an increasingly barren return landscape the tumble in bond yields is particularly problematic for defined benefit pension plans which promise members a specific payout they use high grade bond yields to calculate the value of their future liabilities and every small move downward deepens their funding challenges a 1 percentage point fall in long term interest rates will increase liabilities of a typical pension scheme by about 20 but the value of their assets would go up only about 10 estimates baroness ros altmann a former u k pensions minister clearly then scheme funding will deteriorate and employers will need to increase funding she adds advertisement many u k pension schemes are now using sophisticated liability driven investment strategies hedging against the effect of lower rates on their liabilities this has slowly started to catch on in europe and the u s as well but those schemes that have not taken steps to guard against interest rate risk now face huge increases in their deficits and are having to make difficult decisions about how to bridge the funding gap across the western world pension fund managers face similar challenges the industry outlook is now as grim as it has ever been in peter damgaard jensen s two decade stint at the top of pka a danish pension fund in some countries the pension system cannot survive if things don t change he warns they either have to pay in more or

ratcheting up their investments in alternative or private assets such as private equity real estate venture capital infrastructure and untraded loans for long term investors who can accept the illiquidity in return for the promise of higher returns this makes sense a housing project or toll road can produce a bond like steady income stream yet with almost every institutional investor exploring this avenue it has led to froth in private markets there are some dangers says damgaard jensen it can create bubbles when people go into new areas they re not the cheapest asset classes to go into and there are a lot of fees often the only people that get rich are the fund managers and you have to make sure you can hold on as it s hard to sell these private market investments involve allocating money to private equity or real estate funds which will be called when their managers want to make a big acquisition but this could reduce how much money pension funds have available the imf estimates that pension plans have doubled their allocations to illiquid assets over the last 10 years and for about a fifth of funds these capital commitments amount to more than half their liquid assets returns can fluctuate but longevity has been extended dramatically we just have to explain to millennials that their parents might have to move back in with them christopher ailman chief investment officer at calstrs given higher liquidity risks pension funds will probably have to set aside more of their liquid assets to cover potential outflows during and after periods of stress especially if market funding becomes more expensive the imf said in its global financial stability report this would make it more difficult for them to buy assets traded at distressed price levels limiting their ability to invest counter cyclically and thus play a stabilizing role during periods of market stress advertisement faced with a continued subdued outlook for investment returns fund managers face the unpalatable prospect of inflicting further pain by asking for bigger contributions from pension members and employers imposing benefit cuts or closing their schemes altmann believes intervention is needed to limit the impact of pension pain spreading to the wider economy as businesses divert cash from investment into paying more money to plug retirement scheme deficits government and regulators should be planning to help those pension schemes and their sponsors who may never be able to afford full annuity buyout without becoming insolvent she says the development of a regime for winding down rather than winding up which does not require annuity purchase and which would see pensions paid out of a pooled fund of assets would be more likely to deliver higher pensions overall without intervention there are also wider risks to society as more workers could be shunted out of company backed guaranteed schemes and into arrangements where their pension is at the mercy of the stock market in 20 years we may find ourselves with a real global crisis where we haven t saved enough money for retirement says calstrs ailman returns can fluctuate but longevity has been extended dramatically we just have to explain to millennials that their parents might have to move back in with them

we have many things going for us a young literate population with a median age of 23 and with 60 percent of working age this together with decades of increasing earnings from bpos and ofw remittances is expected to fuel the continuing growth of the middle class poverty levels have declined from 26 percent in 2015 to 20 8 percent in 2019 and are expected to decline further to 18 7 percent in 2021 despite the global uncertainties the macroeconomic environment remains favorable notwithstanding the slower growth in the first half of the year gdp has been growing at over 6 percent since 2010 and we expect this trend to continue in the next few years powered by the build build build program of the government and the continued implementation of market reforms reforms began in the 1980s with trade and foreign exchange liberalization opening up of the telecommunications and financial services sectors and the privatization of power more recently the passage of train drove another ratings upgrade advertisement important reforms important reforms that had languished for years had finally been passed the rice tariffication law instrumental in bringing down inflation which spiked last year the national id which in turn should greatly help in implementing the ease of doing business law the bangsamoro basic law which has the potential to unlock the wealth of the armm and end decades of conflict the bsp is doing its part to support growth aggressively lowering interest rates and reducing the reserve requirement ratio for banks while the bsp has been doing a stellar job for years despite being hampered by an obsolete governing law the passage of the new central bank act allows it to align with global best practices and gives it more levers to act proactively in response to changing market conditions in the world bank s ease of doing business report we received the welcome news that we moved up to 95th place from last year s 124th out of 190 countries yet despite all of these foreign investments so critical to moving the country forward and turning it into a middle class economy continue to significantly lag those of our asean neighbors the reasons are many and you have probably heard this over and over first it is simply not easy to do business here the dti and now the arta have done much to improve the business climate and for this they deserve to be lauded but much more needs to be done advertisement it was said that constitutions while supposed to be lasting were often influenced by the issues of the times in which they were written ours is no different but in the over three decades since it was ratified the world had moved on and globalization had changed the environment dramatically foreign equity restrictions have prevented sorely needed investments in vital industries such as telecommunications transport and energy competition is restricted which protects unproductive or poorly performing firms at the expense of more productive ones and reduces the incentive for firms to innovate limited competition in key sectors has significant consequences for the economy witness the impact of poor transport on logistics and on every industry which relies on the movement of goods trade costs could be greatly minimized by improving our port and logistics infrastructure to catch up with our asean neighbors we need to lift these restrictions to encourage the entry of capital we can start by simply reducing the number of sectors on the negative list why for instance do we bar foreigners from teaching at the tertiary level singapore jumpstarted its tech industry by building excellent universities understanding the heavy reliance of technology development on human capital and to attract good students they brought in well known and highly respected educators from overseas the ease of doing business act has great provisions and we have been eagerly awaiting its implementation in particular we need to make it easier to start new businesses get approvals and pay taxes burdensome administrative procedures not only deter new businesses from starting up and existing ones from expanding they also encourage corruption as do complicated tax rules and processes they also hold back badly needed infrastructure such as new power plants many of which are mired in the approval process despite the looming power shortage labor market rigidities labor market rigidities make it difficult to do business here i remember numerous instances when i had to explain to our corporate and regional offices overseas why we couldn t fire an obviously incompetent employee and worse why we had to give him a separation package after months or even years of nonperformance while we need to ensure that employees are protected from abusive employers we also need to ensure that our laws adapt to the times for example rather than security of tenure why not portability of benefits everywhere in the world we see employees moving away from lifetime employment to taking on varying roles in different industries throughout their working life but each time they move they lose all the benefits such as pensions which they may have accumulated if they take those accumulated benefits with them as they move they would have a nest egg by the time they retire biggest factors addressing all these issues will definitely help but we also need to remember that one of the biggest factors which make investing attractive is predictability money is the most cowardly of things and when you are investing billions even hundreds of millions you need to know that the conditions under which you invested would not suddenly change i ran a canadian company which had been in the country for close to 125 years through wars coups changes in government our contracts with clients lasted decades knowing that the rules would not suddenly change has helped the company prosper and invest more in the country one of our biggest strengths and our most valuable asset is our human capital i truly believe the filipino is world class we note that the government s medium term philippine development plan its development blueprint to 2022 is people centered focusing on inclusiveness resilience and a competitive knowledge economy building a competitive workforce means strengthening our human capital even further this starts with the very basic food security it is estimated that 26 percent of filipino children are malnourished the damage to health physical development and brain development from malnutrition is often irreversible affecting children for life the world bank in its human capital index estimates that at the current levels of nutrition health care and education today s children will only be 55 percent as productive when they grow up as they would have been had they been able to enjoy a complete education and full health support thus ensuring affordable food is important the rice tariffication law is a step in the right direction helping filipino farmers by giving them the tools and know how to grow more lucrative crops and increase productivity not only helps ensure food security but also helps farmers escape poverty and drive inclusive growth secretary dar deserves our full support in his efforts to modernize the agriculture sector the universal health care law is also very welcome there remains a gap however in its fulfillment as we need to build an additional 2 600 health care centers perhaps lgus should also find a way to engage private practitioners to provide certain packages of services education is another critical area prior to 2012 the philippines was one of only three countries in the world and the only one in asia with only 10 years of basic education the shift to k 12 has brought us more in line with the rest of the world and should allow even high school graduates to find jobs not everyone is cut out for college and it has always puzzled me why we require a university diploma for people being hired as clerks and data center operators free education in state universities and colleges sounds good but one wonders how the government can fund all our sucs in addition to all the other services it is trying to provide quality education is costly perhaps rather than free tuition for everyone we can implement a voucher system so that the more economically disadvantaged students get the support they deserve while those who can afford it pay more this would also allow private universities to participate in educating the youth with the lack of facilities we need both public and private universities an educated population is critical if we are to build a competitive society in a rapidly changing world where whatever you know today will be obsolete in five years the ability to learn and adapt will determine how we evolve as a nation innovation which brings me to my last point innovation this is one which is a personal advocacy as we have seen technology render once dominant companies obsolete history is littered with the carcasses of business giants who have gone bankrupt forced out by new technologies and new business models kodak nokia blockbuster sears household names which are gone or are about to disappear when we look at what drives our economy we see the twin engines of bpos and ofw remittances these are what have powered our gdp growth over more than a decade but both are being impacted by technology some months ago i was speaking with a colleague visiting from singapore and he told me of a call center operation which had just closed 3 500 seats eighty percent of the seats were replaced by machines powered by artificial intelligence the remaining 20 percent required more complex skills which the bpo had difficulty finding locally so they decided to bring back the seats to singapore where talent was more expensive but also more readily available as ai becomes more advanced we can expect the need for large backrooms to decline even further perhaps to the point where companies which are currently offshoring simply take those functions back to their home countries we are already seeing this in manufacturing where some companies have relocated their factories back from asia to the united states as ai and robotics have allowed them to operate entire plants with a minimal number of staff it is said that as much as 89 percent of bpo jobs may be at risk while information technology changes are the most visible technological change is also happening in other areas the bulk of our ofws are located in the middle east which is primarily dependent on oil as countries shift to green energy and lessen their dependence on oil what will happen to the thousands of filipinos working there indeed as technology changes every single industry what will happen to filipinos working all over the world the world economic forum estimates that 75 million jobs will be lost by 2022 due to technological changes but 133 million new jobs will be created for a net gain of 58 million but these are not jobs in the fields we know these are jobs in data science analytics artificial intelligence machine learning we need to ensure that our human capital evolves and adapts as the world around us changes this means not only enhancing stem education but emphasizing critical thinking complex problem solving and creativity in our curricula this will help us to create an enabling environment for innovation so that we are at less risk of obsolescence as a nation further enabling foreign capital and talent to come in will spur competition which is key to innovation and improve the quality of our physical and digital infrastructure more importantly it should enable knowledge transfer tourism while the government needs to do its part we in the business community also need to do ours we need to invest in innovation the dost has presented a whole range of technologies our scientists and engineers have developed which are in need of funding we also need to prepare our workforce for the future it is estimated that more than half of them including executive leadership will need significant re skilling and upskilling incidentally one area where we can innovate fairly easily is tourism which has the potential to become another growth engine for the country to become a middle class nation as is the goal of ambisyon natin 2040 we need to surpass a 7 1 percent growth rate for the next 20 years to achieve this we need to generate 1 3 to 1 5 million new jobs a year for the next 20 years triple per capita income to 11 000 and increase annual total factor productivity growth rate by 1 5 percent or higher in the next 22 years double the world average since 2000 it seems almost impossible yet even as we play catch up our

the euro was hit from all sides today first german pmis were mixed with the data showing improvements in the manufacturing sector and deterioration in services later on the eurozone pmis confirmed that the region as a whole grew at a slower pace due to a continued contraction in manufacturing and slower expansion in services in between ecb president christine lagarde described the global economy as marked by uncertainty and called for europe to develop a new policy mix that includes fiscal stimulus this suggests that regardless of her bias for monetary policy she feels that the eurozone needs more policy support this outlook combined with better than expected us markit pmis and an upward revision to the university of michigan consumer sentiment index was enough to drive eur usd below 1 1050 a test of 1 10 appears likely with a further move lower if the ifo report ez confidence or cpi numbers surprise to the downside the gains in the dollar were not limited to the euro in fact the greenback traded higher against most of the major currencies today the new zealand dollar was the lone exception the rally in the greenback should surprise no one as it comes off the heels of brighter less dovish fomc minutes president trump s comment that a trade deal with china is very close also helped usd jpy its too early to say but it looks like trump is trying to separate the trade deal from the hk bill while markit pmis are less market moving than ism the latest reports show faster growth in the manufacturing and service sectors this month the persistent gains in us stocks also helped to bolster market sentiment looking ahead there are very few market moving economic reports on next week s calendar thanksgiving is on thursday which means that it will be a shortened week for most us traders with that said central bank speak and trade headlines could rock the fx markets fed chairman powell speaks on monday rba governor lowe speaks on tuesday and rbnz governor orr delivers a press conference on the financial report wednesday local time the worst performing currency today was sterling which fell hard on softer pmis according to the latest reports the slowdown in the uk economy deepened in the month of november manufacturing and service sector activity contracted driving the composite pmi index to its lowest level since britain voted to leave the european union in july 2016 this is consistent with our view that the decision to leave the eu will lead to ongoing pain for the uk and the worse may be yet to come gbp usd dropped below the 20 day sma opening the door for a deeper move below 1 2700 if the data continues to deteriorate the bank of england could resort to an early 2020 rate cut the canadian dollar traded lower despite better than expected retail sales consumer spending contracted in september but the decline was less than expected better yet excluding autos spending increased by 0 2 these numbers along with the uptick in consumer prices and less dovish outlook from bank of canada governor poloz should have cemented the top in usd cad however the pair recovered its earlier losses to end the day in positive territory part of this was driven by the slide in oil prices but the main reason for the pair s gains is the recovery of the us dollar usd cad will remain in play next week with quarterly and monthly gdp numbers due on friday the manufacturing and service sectors in australia are contracting according to cba and this deterioration explains why the australian dollar has been on its backfoot throughout the week while the pair remains firmly confined in a tight 6835 to 6770 range it is hugging the bottom end of this band the new zealand dollar on the other hand was the only currency to outperform the greenback considering the lack of nzd news this could be driven entirely by aud nzd flows the rba and rbnz s diverging outlook drove aud nzd to its lowest level since august
salt lake city officially bernie sanders and elizabeth warren are vying for the chance to run against one billionaire president donald trump but many of their policies take aim at the 600 plus americans with assets of a billion dollars or more are these presidential candidates waging a war on wealth warren the u s senator from massachusetts is selling billionaire tears mugs on her website sanders the senator from vermont has tweeted that billionaires should not exist even billionaire tom steyer another democrat in the race is saying the u s needs to tax the assets of its richest citizens meanwhile as income inequality grows both in america and around the world some people are calling on the richest americans to do more than invest in space travel or pledge to give away most of their wealth before they die one twitter account for example asks daily if jeff bezos has decided to end world hunger yet pointing out that the reported net worth of the amazon founder is 10 times that of what one nonprofit has estimated it would cost to feed the world for a year and a theologian who calls economic inequality the world s most pressing moral problem says enough wealth currently exists to satisfy everyone s needs but it s too highly concentrated to reach them all in other words wealth is the problem not poverty says elizabeth hinson hasty chair of theology department at bellarmine university in louisville kentucky in her 2017 book the problem of wealth what we need to do is radically alter our attitudes systems and policies that support and justify the increase of one s individual wealth at the expense of a larger commons and to learn to distribute wealth and money more justly hinson hasty wrote in a country where the american dream has long been associated with financial success how did billionaire become a four letter word and what if anything do extremely wealthy people owe the rest of the world a penalty for success in both the christian and jewish traditions people have historically been called on to give 10 of their earnings back to god in the form of a tithe regardless of their earnings as christians we are called to tithe beyond that there are opportunities all around to put wealth to good use in the world said chris hogan host of a radio show on the dave ramsey network and author of the book everyday millionaires it s not required but giving always feels good no matter who you are or how much you have i ve never known a millionaire to lie on his deathbed and say i wish i hadn t given so much to other people hogan said nearly 10 years ago billionaires bill and melinda gates and warren buffet founded the giving pledge a nonprofit that encourages billionaires around the world to vow to give away at last half of their money according to the group s website 204 people signed the pledge including steyer mark zuckerberg and his wife priscilla chan mackenzie bezos elon musk and the late jon huntsman and karen huntsman the signers may give to philanthropic causes or charitable organizations of their choosing and are encouraged to find their own unique ways to give that inspire them personally and benefit society proponents of new taxes on the wealthy however say that leaving it up to billionaires to decide what to do with their wealth even if goes to charity or education is another driver of inequality since their choices may not address the nation s most critical needs and often the money goes outside the u s consider the bill and melinda gates foundation which has spent more than 15 billion on vaccines over the past 19 years during that time period the number of children s deaths worldwide declined from almost 10 million in 2000 to 5 million in 2017 in a 2018 letter entitled ten tough questions we get asked melinda gates acknowledged that the foundation spends less in the u s 500 million a year compared to 4 billion in developing countries but added we don t compare different people s suffering we do however assess our ability to help prevent different kinds of suffering when we studied the global health landscape we realized that our resources could have a disproportionate impact we knew we could help save literally millions of lives so that s what we ve tried to do the giving of billionaires not only addresses social problems but is a major source of revenue for universities and the arts to include symphonies and ballet adam michel a senior policy analyst at the heritage foundation in washington d c called wealth tax proposals a solution in search of a problem and said that a war on wealth also hurts what michel called the american ethos being able to try hard have a good idea succeed and become fabulously wealthy that drive without a doubt is a good force in american society it s the thing that drives innovation and entrepreneurship he said all those forces ultimately materialize in the iphone in amazon being able to deliver packages to us in 24 hours at a lower cost than we ve ever seen before a wealth tax telegraphs to future american innovators that we don t want good ideas here if you have a good idea go somewhere else can wealth be grotesque both sanders and warren want to tax the overall wealth not just the income of the richest americans in order to fund programs such as free college and health care for americans warren s ultra millionaire tax would kick in when a couple has a net worth of 50 million or more that s estimated to be about 75 000 households these households would pay an annual 2 tax on every dollar of net worth above 50 million and a 6 tax on every dollar of net worth above 1 billion the warren campaign says this tax would collect 3 75 trillion in its first decade sanders wealth tax begins at 32 million with a 1 tax on total assets and progressively rises to 8 on wealth of 8 billion or more the campaign says the tax would collect 4 35 trillion over 10 years and would halve the total net worth of the nation s billionaires in 15 years which would would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small privileged class at a time when millions of americans are working two or three jobs to feed their families the three wealthiest people in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of the american people this is outrageous sanders spokesman joe calvello said in an email for years billionaires have been using their grotesque wealth to buy power and influence in washington we are going to put an end to this calvello said more than a dozen european nations have tried a wealth tax but only four remain in spain norway switzerland and belgium give when you re dead paul zane pilzer an economist entrepreneur and author who lives in park city utah said it s almost impossible for the average person to envision a billion dollars let alone the total wealth that america s 600 plus billionaires own which amounts to about 9 trillion between them their holdings however said pilzer account for less than 8 of the total net worth of americans overall which is 113 5 trillion according to the federal reserve but much of our wealth is in our homes and property and is offset by debt americans had 15 trillion in debt in 2018 two thirds of which was in home loans the brookings institution reported and brookings noted that 77 of total household wealth in 2016 was held by the top 20 of americans an amount more than triple what the middle class held in fact the top 1 alone holds more wealth than the middle class they owned 29 or over 25 trillion of household wealth in 2016 while the middle class owned just 18 trillion the brookings report said adding that this has not always been the case by one measure 52 of americans now live in middle class households according to pew research center before 2010 the middle class owned more wealth than the top 1 since 1995 the share of wealth held by the middle class has steadily declined while the top 1 s share has steadily increased billionaires of course are another category altogether they represent 00018 of the population and the u s has 607 of them more than any other country according to forbes while pilzer acknowledges that the number of billionaires and the amount of their holdings is unprecedented he said that a great equalizer already exists much of their wealth goes to the government when they die we have a huge wealth tax right now in the current federal estate tax pilzer said the government takes 40 of estates that exceed 11 4 million and 18 states have estate and inheritance taxes pilzer noted utah is not among them there s a windfall coming to the federal government of 3 6 trillion 40 on the 9 trillion owned by u s billionaires that money will flow to the u s treasury as the current billionaires pass away and the real question is what we re going to do with it pilzer said sanders has proposed raising the estate tax to 77 on estates worth 1 billion or more pilzer whose books include unlimited wealth and the next trillion isn t opposed to a wealth tax he just wants it to be branded as a homeland security or military tax since he believes it s the strength of the u s military that creates a low interest rate economy from which the wealthy benefit the most i ve always been amazed that we don t have a federal wealth tax with all proceeds going to our great military he said a simple 1 tax on all americans net worth would yield 1 13 trillion enough to fund our entire 686 billion military budget with 444 billion left over eye of the needle despite growing calls for public policies that would mitigate inequality in the u s the majority of americans don t agree with sanders indictment of billionaires as a class recent polling by the cato institute found that just under 17 of americans believe that billionaires shouldn t exist even when broken down by party just 27 of democrats agreed with sanders and nearly 84 said people should be able to make as much money as they honestly can cato s 2019 welfare work and wealth national survey found david decosse director of religious and catholic ethics at the markkula center for applied ethics at santa clara university in california said he is troubled by the libertarian cul de sac that many americans operate in the mindset that any sort of taxation is immediately called into question as theft of private property i think that is a fundamentally wrong way to think about wealth and the proper role of government he said adding that it s proper for societies to make collective decisions about how to advance the important social interests of its communities he s also skeptical of the mindset that billionaires have unique qualities that make them deserving of great wealth when they may have been helped by other people or policies hinson hasty the theology professor in louisville believes that escalating inequality enabled by technological advances demands that americans entertain disruptive and difficult questions about how society should respond among them whether or not individuals and social groups should have the right to unlimited wealth it is the essential question that has to be raised in the context of the united states she said we have avoided that question in the united states and i think much to our peril it s logical to assume that if someone is able to grow their wealth indefinitely there is going to be an impact on people who are working at minimum wage because we share the same resources even if we do not have the same jobs she believes it s time for americans to question the pursuit of unlimited economic growth and to become familiar with other theories of economics such as the late e f schumacher s argument that small is beautiful and the idea that a steady state economy may be sufficient as for the billionaires hinson hasty said she thinks the better question for america isn t about individuals but about the systems and structures within which we all live work and hope to flourish if the wealth of one impacts the well being and ability of others to survive or thrive then legitimate questions should be raised about the ability to amass wealth without limits that said the responsibility doesn t start and stop with the wealthy she added i m a middle class person working the professional managerial sector as a professor so i m aware that i m also one who has to squeeze through the eye of the needle i m not a person living in poverty who is more vulnerable at risk but that doesn t relieve me of my responsibility

the raft of investment taxes that democratic presidential candidate elizabeth warren plans to levy to pay for her social programs would advantage foreign investors a side effect that would run counter to her goal shared with president trump of lowering the trade deficit to pay for medicare for all and other major new government benefits warren would radically increase taxes on investments made by rich taxpayers including through a major new wealth tax by taxing american investors warren would give a boost to foreign investors looking to buy u s assets stocks real estate and so on the spike in foreign investment would also entail an increase in the trade deficit foreign ownership of american companies accrues benefits to foreigners said ric edelman a top wealth adviser for rich individuals this weakens the strength of americans in terms of global dominance and interferes with the ability of ordinary americans to save and invest for the future to the extent that warren s tax plan privileges foreign investors the trade deficit will go up and a greater share of american assets will be owned by those in other countries like china germany said kyle pomerleau an economist at the american enterprise institute a right of center think tank the trade deficit would rise because to invest in the united states foreigners must get dollars higher demand for dollars raises the exchange rate making foreign goods relatively cheaper and sales of u s goods to other countries relatively more expensive foreign dollars that would otherwise be used to buy american exports would be used to invest in our economy instead said bryan riley a director of the free trade initiative at the national taxpayers union foundation when our foreign counterparts invest in our economy instead of exports that leads to a trade deficit you can t use the same dollar to do both it s an either or trump has made lowering the u s trade deficit a cornerstone of his agenda and is pursuing multiple trade deal renegotiations toward that purpose warren herself has identified the trade deficit which has risen to 481 3 billion in the first nine months of this year as a problem in a campaign plan under the banner of economic patriotism warren called for actively managing the dollar to reduce the trade deficit and increase exports while economists generally don t see trade deficits as a problem some analysts argue that they can cost the country good jobs because they mean that more manufactured goods are sourced abroad rather than domestically eliminating manufacturing jobs in places like the rust belt former joe biden economic adviser jared bernstein for instance has written that trade deficits mean the loss of good jobs wages and incomes for those in firms hit by competition from imports bernstein however now a fellow at the left of center center on budget and policy priorities told the washington examiner that he didn t think that warren s tax policies would influence investors still multiple other economists told the washington examiner that the hikes in investment taxes would push up the trade deficit while the taxes warren is proposing would apply to the rich they would be substantial 2 trillion over 10 years altogether they include a new 14 8 social security tax on all investment income of individuals earning more than 250 000 also she would raise a significant sum by taxing the capital gains of the top 1 of households at a higher rate the 37 rate on ordinary income rather than the preferential 20 tax rate for long term capital gains she would also tax unrealized capital gains each year rather than waiting for the gains to be realized in a sale in addition warren would lower the estate tax rate which taxes the total wealth and assets that a person owns when they die from 11 4 million down to 3 5 million in order to collect more revenue lastly she would impose a new wealth tax that would make households pay an annual 2 tax on every dollar of net worth above 50 million and a 6 tax on every dollar of net worth above 1 billion in effect an additional tax on investments when asked for comment on this story a warren spokeswoman only said that elizabeth warren s economic agenda returns power to american workers and puts money in their pockets spurring greater demand and economic growth history has shown that higher investment taxes do provide an advantage to foreign investors during the early 1990s and late 2000s when congress raised the capital gains rate it did indeed result in a significant flow of investments from abroad noted garrett watson of the tax foundation a center right think tank
as the government celebrates the transition from the multi currency regime to a mono currency system as one of its successes towards currency reforms it is a different situation altogether in rural matabeleland where there is a thriving rand economy by nqobani ndlovu as the government celebrates the transition from the multi currency regime to a mono currency system as one of its successes towards currency reforms it is a different situation altogether in rural matabeleland where there is a thriving rand economy the government in june promulgated statutory instrument si 142 of 2019 which ended the multi currency system that had been in place since 2009 but in most of matabeleland s rural areas the rand is the trading currency of choice for many shops and individual traders si142 was promulgated after claims by government that foreign currency is not an available commodity of exchange in the money market however for communities in the periphery of zimbabwe s borders with south africa and botswana foreign currency remains the sole medium of exchange in business transactions access to foreign currency enables local traders to import goods from neighbouring countries and selling them in rand pricing is lower in foreign currency in these shops compared to prices in urban areas rand remittances from the diaspora are usually on the increase towards the festive season contributing to a boom in businesses according to the world bank diaspora remittances to zimbabwe amounted to about us 1 9 billion or 9 6 of the country s gross domestic product in 2018 local industry and bankers have been lobbying with little success for the use of the south african rand as a transacting currency and the united states dollar as a reserve currency at tsholotsho business centre in matabeleland north one cannot miss the big number of south african registered vehicles some of which are cross border transporters commonly referred to as omalayitsha ferrying groceries sent by many zimbabweans based in south africa a significant population from rural matabeleland such as tsholotsho bulilima mangwe matobo tsholotsho and gwanda receives monthly remittances from family members living in south africa or botswana thus sustaining the trading in foreign currency many traders import their goods from south africa for re sale locally in that country s currency a recent visit to tsholotsho showed that while some traders still accepted the zimbabwe dollar the pricing forces consumers to transact in rands basic commodities are ridiculously expensive in local currency but quite affordable in rands nkosikhona ncube a villager observed a 2kg packet of sugar is 45 rand or 40 cash which is scarce and 60 using the mobile money transfer facility while some commodities like mealie meal are sold in forex only while the use of the rand has brought relative stability and affordability and a steady supply of goods and services to rural matabeleland the situation has impacted negatively particularly on civil servants who get their salaries in local currency villagers who have no relatives in the diaspora have been the hardest hit some civil servants have even resorted to selling airtime using south african currency so that they can be able to buy basic commodities which are cheaper in rand betty sibanda said a teacher at tsholotsho high school said he changes his salary into rand as soon as he gets paid to preserve value i have no option but to change my salary which is in zimbabwe dollars to the south african rand every month he said this is the only way to ensure i can buy some grocery here in tsholotsho instead of travelling all the way to bulawayo over 100km away to buy my groceries in local currency in bulilima matabeleland south most commodities are now pegged in foreign currency even though traders accept local currency however they do not accept mobile money payments as there is limited or no access to mobile networks communities there rely mainly on botswana mobile phone networks due to lack of enabling telecommunications infrastructure some parts of rural matabeleland still suffer from poor network connectivity with villagers forced to climb trees and mountains just to make telephone calls making it impossible to transact using mobile money transfers such as ecocash the postal and telecommunications regulatory authority through the universal services fund usf has however been on a drive to construct base stations a development that is envisaged to see people living in some parts of rural matabeleland being connected to local mobile network operators the usf was established to among other things finance the extension of communication services to underserviced areas in some parts of plumtree villagers especially those living far from the border town still do not have access to local radio and television 39 years after independence many people in the area especially those living in mphoengs and maitengwe border areas listen to radio and television from neighbouring botswana because there is no local broadcasting signal effie ncube the executive director of the national consumer rights association a local consumer watchdog said it was unfortunate that the country s economic situation has created pockets of different economies which he said while benefiting some left those vulnerable worse off the economic crisis led to the scattering of people into the diaspora who are now remitting different currencies and those currencies are forming their own currencies on the ground and those without access are left a lot poorer ncube argued the crisis we face as a country has created pockets of different economies for the poor and for the rich for the rural and urban people for those who have access to the rand and those who don t that the chaos that was introduced by the economic collapse of zimbabwe government policies like the one outlawing the use of foreign currencies must be in tune with social and economic realities on the ground in matabeleland the rand has always been the preferred currency of choice the economic situation on the ground was self regulating and it worked for the people gwanda based commentator bekezela maduma fuzwayo weighed in saying the situation in matabeleland south was difficult particularly in the districts bordering botswana and south africa he said businesses in the areas were not accepting the local currency which is in very short supply compared to the south african rand and botswana pula the small businesses are also getting goods for the shops from across the borders and so cannot deal in local currency fuzwayo said it s even particularly worse that most of the areas do not have mobile phone coverage and so mobile money cannot be used in as much as government allowed the tourism sector to use foreign currency i think special consideration should be given to the province particularly border districts to use foreign currency

china and pakistan have urged the united states to sift fact from fiction before questioning their bilateral infrastructure development program which beijing is funding under its global belt and road initiative bri the reaction came after a senior american diplomat spoke critically of the multibillion dollar collaboration known as the china pakistan economic corridor cpec and warned it would eventually worsen islamabad s economic troubles and benefit only beijing speaking to an audience at the woodrow wilson international center for scholars on november 21 alice wells acting assistant secretary of state for south and central asian affairs said the u s offered a better model that would improve the fundamentals of pakistan s troubled economy she also raised questions about the transparency and fairness of cpec projects as well as related chinese loans islamabad has received her remarks drew a strong response from chinese and pakistani officials on november 22 beijing s ambassador to islamabad yao jing said wells lacked accurate knowledge and relied primarily on western media propaganda to level the accusations i would like to remind my american colleague that if you are really making this kind of allegation please be careful show your evidence give me evidence we will take action yao said while addressing reporters he said china and pakistan are determined to ensure the infrastructure project is free of corruption the chinese diplomat said cpec is open to investment from anywhere in the world and china would happily welcome u s investment in it yao described wells remarks as astonishing saying he had personally briefed her twice on the program during her recent visits to islamabad meanwhile pakistani senate foreign affairs committee chairman mushahid hussain described the allegations by wells as disappointing he noted that cpec has ensured energy security for pakistan and set the stage for an industrial revolution in the next stage of the massive project which is already in progress cpec is central to pakistan s future and it s a pivot of our strategic relationship with china and for which pakistan has benefited already we feel she had got her facts mixed up because of unfounded media reports so i think it is important to sift fact from fiction hussain said beijing has invested around 20 billion in pakistan over the past five years to help upgrade and build ports roads and power plants effectively ending nationwide crippling electricity outages most of the money has come as direct foreign investment while some has been in the form of soft loans and grants the overall investment of cpec is estimated to grow to around 60 billion by 2030 critics in the u s and elsewhere see china s bri program as a debt trap for countries like pakistan which have struggling economies that would make it difficult for them to make chinese loan repayments islamabad s repayments are due in the next few years and analysts say that process will bring the country s depleting foreign exchange reserves under pressure ambassador yao dismissed those concerns saying unlike washington and west governed lenders like the international monetary fund beijing does not offer or suspend financial loans for political reasons china will never ever ask for these loan repayments as long as you are in need of this money if pakistan needs it we keep it here he told the audience yao took issue with the u s for questioning chinese aid or loans he said were meant only to help partner nations to improve and stabilize their economies the united states is the biggest loan taker from the world and even china gave them in credit about 3 trillion said the chinese envoy wells noted however that even if loan payments are deferred they are going to continue to hang over pakistan s economic development potential to hamper prime minister imran khan s reform agenda she said cpec relies primarily on chinese workers and supplies noting that local industry does not benefit from the initiative and that cpec is not addressing the issue of rising unemployment in pakistan yao rejected the assertions saying cpec has provided more than 75 000 direct jobs to pakistani workers and is expected to create as many as 2 3 million jobs by 2030 the chinese envoy said the project will have built several special economic free zones by then enabling pakistan to improve the quantity and quality of its exports to bring home much needed dollars to boost its foreign exchange reserves yao criticized wells for using reported estimated costs of certain projects in her speech he said those projects were still under discussion and their final cost had not been determined
asian markets mostly rose friday as a sense of optimism returned to trading floors after a report said china s point man on the us tariffs talks had offered to host a meeting to help push through their crucial mini pact however investors were nervous that the deal could collapse at any minute after us lawmakers passed a bill supporting hong kong rights causing anger in beijing expectations that the economic superpowers would be able to sign off on the agreement soon has helped fan a rally across world markets for weeks though a lack of detail or signs of progress of late is becoming unsettling for many hopes were given a lift thursday after the wall street journal said top negotiator vice premier liu he had invited his us counterparts for further discussions to haul the deal over the line that came a day after he had expressed confidence they would eventually reach a breakthrough adding to the positivity was a report in the south china morning post that said washington would probably delay imposing fresh tariffs planned for next month even if they have not reached a deal by then the rolling back of levies is a key demand of china s in the talks the market is looking for some bullish signal that things aren t going to get worse and that we re not going to see further deterioration in trade talks between the us and china erin browne at pacific investment management told bloomberg tv they just don t want to see further escalation china not afraid on friday president xi jinping said china wanted to hammer out a deal but was not afraid to fight back when necessary he told former us officials and other foreign dignitaries at a meeting in beijing that he wanted to work for a phase one agreement on the basis of mutual respect and equality the remarks came two days after donald trump complained beijing had not made sufficient concessions so far making him reluctant to conclude a bargain asian investors broadly maintained early gains hong kong added 0 3 percent in the afternoon while tokyo ended up 0 3 percent singapore rose 0 7 percent sydney rose 0 6 percent seoul and bangkok gained 0 3 percent while taipei was up 0 1 percent however shanghai slipped 0 6 percent while wellington manila mumbai and jakarta were in the red eyes are on the white house after congress sent the hong kong bill to trump to sign into law beijing has warned of consequences over the bill and there are fears for the trade talks if trump signs it worries about china s reaction caused a sharp drop on global markets thursday still some observers say that while highly contentious the bill will more likely prevent a more detailed agreement being reached rather than cause the complete collapse of the talks stephen innes at axitrader said the fact that liu had offered the invitation and remained optimistic indicates that china may be willing to compartmentalise this contentious bill away from the broader trade negotiations but he added that this tangled web of trade talk confusion has investors sitting in that all too familiar predicament of trade war limbo and david madden at cmc markets said that thursday was a bit of a downbeat day as stocks lost ground but if traders were genuinely fearful about the trade story stocks would be much lower the broadly upbeat mood provided support to higher yielding currencies such as the south korean won south african rand and mexican peso the chinese yuan was also up against the dollar while the greenback made gains on the yen which is usually seen as a safe asset in times of turmoil afp

but mr dalio went further concluding that the american entitlement crisis meant the us federal reserve would have to continue to inflate its own balance sheet indefinitely and keep rates low or even negative well into the future so the us could keep paying its bills that would depreciate the us dollar taken to its extreme that never ends well prior experiments with rapidly falling currencies include late third century rome germany s interwar weimar republic and zimbabwe prior experiments with rapidly falling currencies include late third century rome germany s interwar weimar republic and zimbabwe ap at some point mr dalio argued nobody would want to own us debt or the dollar and investors would look to other assets for safety the question is what else he asked that s the environment i think that we ll be in and there s a saying that gold is the only asset you can have that s not somebody else s liability i haven t bought any gold yet myself though i did sell out of equities entirely in august that decision has been somewhat painful given the recent upsurge in the s p 500 and yet it is one that i do not regret there is logic in believing as i do that us blue chips and bonds are no longer a safe haven while also believing that prices could stay high for some time to come after all holding two seemingly contradictory thoughts in your head at once is the sign of a mature mind i believe us stock prices are staying up for precisely the same reason that investors might need to be in gold someday advertisement analyst luke gromen laid out the mathematical logic of this very well in a recent newsletter he calculates that us annual entitlement payments which he defines as medicare medicaid and social security plus defence spending plus interest on the federal debt adds up to 112 per cent of us federal tax receipts that total has risen from 103 per cent only 15 months ago and 95 per cent two years ago as government revenue fell due to president donald trump s tax cuts the proceeds of those cuts helped to further inflate equity prices the us has become utterly dependent on asset price inflation for tax receipts mr gromen writes adding that the only way the us will be able pay its yearly bills is for asset prices to climb on their own or for the fed to print enough money to make asset prices rise i expect the fed will like every central bank before it do what is politically required neither the us nor the world can afford for america to nominally default on its treasury bills so stock prices will rise for now the essence of economic policy is as joseph schumpeter reportedly put it politics politics politics share price inflation has been under way since the fed switched gears and began lowering rates in july it will probably be helped along by the easing of financial regulations enacted after the 2008 crisis and possibly even a new round of tax cuts before the 2020 elections mr trump measures his own success by that of the market but in the longer run this financially engineered growth must erode confidence in the dollar particularly at a time when the us and china are going in different directions china is now the world s largest natural gas buyer and is looking to start setting prices for this and other commodities in its own currency advertisement china is also doing more business in euros as it tries to woo europe into its own economic orbit china recently issued its first euro denominated bonds in 15 years it is also moving away from buying oil in dollars and strengthening ties with eu companies such as airbus the de dollarisation of eurasia would support mr dalio s worldview so would a shift to a non dollar reserve asset such as gold such a change would force the us to sell dollars in order to settle its balance of payments in the new neutral reserve asset one could argue that even if the us dollar were to weaken and creditors to lose faith in america s ability to repay its debt markets might still remain high for a period of time but we are undergoing a period of deglobalisation and history shows that when that happens it eventually tends to trigger asset price collapses in whatever country is associated with the old order no wonder gold bugs abound rana foroohar ft com financial times financial times
copenhagen denmark louise purup nohr s morning routine is like something out of a sustainable future when she hustles her kids into the bathroom what flushes down the toilet will later turn into the natural gas that warms breakfast on the stove the eggs come from the chickens in the backyard the coffee machine s gurgling is powered by electricity generated from the wind the water that washes the dishes is heated by sustainable sawdust pellets the recycling gets shunted in eight directions so that little ends up in the dump and the commute first to school then to work is on a cargo bike that bumps across copenhagen s extensive bike lane network amid mounting global concern about climate change denmark has turned into a buzzing hive of green experimentation with efforts underway inside homes across cities and on a national scale households such as purup nohr s are seeking to limit their carbon footprints by cutting back on consumption copenhagen is trying to become the first carbon neutral capital by 2025 a full 25 years before washington and other major world cities expect they might have a shot at canceling their emissions denmark s newly elected center left leaders are trying to turn the whole country into a showcase for how to go green without going bankrupt danes hope they will inspire others to follow suit creating an impact that goes beyond the borders of this country of 5 8 million people the societal effort is also a measure of just how much needs to change to slow climate change for purup nohr s family being environmentally conscious has involved conscious trade offs we re not minimalists said purup nohr 31 but she and her husband have examined every aspect of their lives for its environmental impact it is a journey she said you start looking and then you look at your food and then you look at your transport when you start thinking about the environment you want to make your life fit some of their adjustments have been relatively minor they phased out liquid shampoo in favor of soap bars that don t require bottles and hung an hourglass into the shower to keep themselves from dawdling under the water they bought used reusable cloth diapers which they plan to resell to someone else when they are done with them the little red cart their 1 year old uses to toddle around is secondhand as are the rest of the toys so as not to fuel more production and consumption but the family has also made more significant lifestyle decisions with climate and the environment in mind purup nohr her husband and two small children don t travel on planes they ve committed to exploring denmark s many islands during their vacations for years to come she works part time reasoning that earning less spending less and consuming less all go together and they ve contented themselves to live in a small apartment in town instead of something like the more spacious suburban houses they grew up in the family isn t radical by danish standards they haven t cut meat from their diet for instance though they ve reduced it they rent cars from time to time and they try not to be doctrinaire about their efforts danes have long tilted toward green friendly action especially in copenhagen a city of 624 000 with a rich countercultural tradition nearly half of danes 47 consider climate change to be the most serious problem facing the world according to european union polling that s more than double the eu average of 23 and yet researchers from the norwegian university of science and technology pegged the annual carbon emissions of the average dane at 14 5 tons above the eu average and reflective of the country s wealth many scientists say a two tons per person annual limit will be needed to meet the 2050 goals of the paris climate accords people are always saying that denmark is doing so much said mathilde vallat 16 we re still polluting like hell vallat is among the danish students who have joined the fridays for future movement inspired by the example of 16 year old greta thunberg who comes from neighboring sweden thousands of high schoolers have marched through the cobbled streets of copenhagen decrying their parents generation for not doing enough the deliberate choice to live small purup nohr said is one way people can be kinder to the planet than their parents might have been she and her husband she said live in a world where our parents live in big houses with a lot of money and we don t we have no debt we have no savings it s a choice we could also have chosen to have different jobs with more money i think we live the good life she acknowledged that climate issues can feel overwhelming i don t read articles about the ice melting or the biodiversity crisis she said we never talk about climate with the children i think it s way too scary instead she focuses on things within her control while asking herself do you want to give a better world to your children or a catastrophe having a motivated population with families like purup nohr s has enabled copenhagen to set one of the world s most ambitious climate goals the dash to become carbon neutral within the next six years has sent city planners scouting across the baltics for sustainable sawdust turned what were once traffic choked roundabouts into tree studded miniature wildernesses and led to the construction of an urban ski slope atop a hulking new power plant that burns trash to make electricity livability and the green transformation go hand in hand said copenhagen mayor frank jensen who helped establish the climate goals soon after taking office in 2010 the combined ski slope and power plant with emerald green artificial turf that can be used year round is visible from the historic 18th century city center across the harbor it s the visual centerpiece of the city s efforts to reduce emissions by shifting to greener energy sources the city has also switched from coal to sawdust pellets left over from logging and lumber production to heat the water that runs from central plants to homes a preexisting system called district heating that was already more efficient than home boilers it s only a small city said joergen abildgaard head of the team running copenhagen s climate plans but it matters because when you look at a global perspective we know that people are moving to cities we know there s a growing middle class if those investments are done in a sustainable way it s positive another major focus of the city s efforts is how people get around copenhagen officials estimate that at least 75 of all trips must be done by foot bike or public transportation to meet the 2025 goals bicycling was already popular it s often the speediest way to get from one place to another but city planners have brainstormed everything they can do to make biking even more attractive right down to installing footrests at stoplights to make it easier for cyclists to wait out a red also in the service of copenhagen s emissions goals a subway line opened in september with 17 new stations that encircle the city center and to reduce cars in the city center copenhagen has raised the annual resident parking fee from 1 48 to 148 jensen the mayor said the green sales pitch got more buy in after a 2011 downpour in which 6 inches of rain fell on copenhagen in less than three hours causing massive floods and more than 1 billion in damage all the citizens of copenhagen could see we have to act jensen said since the flooding city planners and residents have sought to make the urban landscape more absorbent in one stretch of streets in oesterbro a dense district just outside central copenhagen parking spaces have been given over to plots of land where trees and bushes grow wild a roundabout that was once a desolate stretch of pavement is now a birch studded parkland cars still move through but on narrowed lanes birds fly from tree to tree kids run across small footbridges something has happened in denmark said sara jorn who runs miljoepunkt oesterbro a community organization that helped craft the area s climate plans politicians and leaders are listening now in total the city plans to spend about 400 million over the course of the 11 year effort which started in 2013 but officials emphasize that economic growth has continued even while the city has invested in becoming greener and they say residents will be shielded from rising fossil fuel prices as well as from some of the damage from extreme weather events in a warming world abildgaard the copenhagen project director was tasked with making changes without sending costs for city residents soaring which constrained some of his decisions but he anticipates copenhagen will reach its 2025 goal or come very close it has already cut its emissions by 40 compared to 2005 in which time its population increased by a quarter but some critics say the efforts don t go far enough among other issues being carbon neutral the product of an elaborate set of calculations offsets and assumptions is not the same as being emissions free burning all those wood pellets still pumps carbon dioxide into the atmosphere even if in theory new trees can be planted somewhere to reabsorb it some have suggested that copenhagen is cheating by not including its international airport officially outside city limits in its calculations and perhaps the biggest issue of all according to critics the city s plan doesn t demand much sacrifice from its citizens it doesn t require any changes at all for individuals said fanny broholm a city council member from the left wing alternative party and we need to change everything if we are to get to two tons of carbon emissions per person per year broholm said danes need to consume less something not addressed by copenhagen s emissions plans which focus on what comes out of the city s smokestacks not on the environmental impact of purchasing a plastic toy from china flying for a beach vacation to the mediterranean or eating red meat in september broholm s party successfully pushed a plan to cut the meat in meals prepared by municipal kitchens copenhagen schoolchildren city employees and seniors who eat at municipal elderly centers will all have less meat at lunch time eating burgers and meatballs and stuff we shouldn t do it broholm said but abildgaard said cities aren t necessarily well placed to change that sort of individual behavior more broadly you do have to ask what is the role of the city when it comes to where they go on vacation what they eat what clothes they wear he said copenhagen got a partner for its climate efforts with the election of a center left coalition in june after a campaign dominated by green issues among the top priorities of the new government cutting national emissions 70 by 2030 from their 1990 levels we re at 0 1 of emissions globally said danish environment minister dan joergensen whose government issued car is a gleaming electric mercedes sedan that s not going to save the planet but we want to show the world that we can do this the goal has broad public support and every major party in denmark has signed on even if joergensen admits officials don t yet know how they can achieve it leaders say they will unveil how they ll get there and how they ll pay for it in the coming months there s a sweeping list of recommendations to consider prepared by a commission established in 2015 to advise danish leaders on climate policy potential changes include slimming the size of denmark s dairy herds planting the countryside with fast growing willow trees to burn later for energy production and ushering out cars that use internal combustion engines in favor of electric ones danish leaders say they want to demonstrate that it is possible to live sustainably without a massive new spending commitments or a hit to living standards by many measures they are already moving in the right direction on sept 15 for the first time wind turbines generated enough power for all of denmark s electricity demands for a full 24 hours it was a milestone in the country s effort to become fossil fuel free by 2050 a commitment made by a previous center left government danes already face steep taxes intended to encourage green friendly choices car buyers pay an 85 tax on the first 27 500 of any car purchase above that price the tax rises to 150 that s actually less than the tax used to be and the new danish leaders are considering raising it again green efforts in other western european countries have at times tripped up politicians french president emmanuel macron sparked months of yellow vest protests in france when he proposed raising his country s gas tax his critics said he wasn t being mindful of the economic difficulties of rural populations danish leaders fresh off their electoral victory say that they have a strong mandate to go green and they say relatively low levels of inequality in denmark will help insulate them from complaints for now they say danes have told them to be ambitious instead of asking what s possible we ask what s necessary joergensen said
and lastly the us federal reserve the european central bank and other major central banks have got ahead of geopolitical headwinds by easing monetary policies with central banks once again coming to the rescue even minor green shoots such as the stabilisation of the us manufacturing sector and the resilience of services and consumption growth have been taken as a harbinger of renewed global expansion yet there is much to suggest that not all is well with the global economy for starters recent data from china germany and japan suggest that the slowdown is still ongoing even if its pace has become less severe second while the us and china may agree to a truce the ongoing decoupling of the world s two largest economies will almost certainly accelerate again after the us election next november in the medium to long term the best one can hope for is that the looming cold war will not turn hot third while china has shown restraint in confronting the popular uprising in hong kong the situation in the city is worsening making a forceful crackdown likely in 2020 among other things a militarised chinese response could derail any trade deal with the us and shock financial markets as well as push taiwan in the direction of forces supporting independence a red line for beijing fourth although a hard brexit may be off the table the euro zone is experiencing a deepening malaise that is not related to the uk s impending departure germany and other countries with fiscal space continue to resist demands for stimulus worse the ecb s new president christine lagarde will most likely be unable to provide much more in the way of monetary policy stimulus given that one third of the ecb governing council already opposes the current round of easing advertisement beyond challenges stemming from an ageing population weakening chinese demand and the costs of meeting new emissions standards europe also remains vulnerable to trump s oft repeated threat to impose import tariffs on german and other european cars and key european economies not least germany spain france and italy are experiencing political ructions that could translate into economic trouble fifth with crippling us led sanctions now fuelling street riots the iranian regime will see no other choice but to continue fomenting instability in the wider region in order to raise the costs of america s approach the middle east is already in turmoil massive protests have erupted in iraq and lebanon a country that is effectively bankrupt and at risk of a currency sovereign debt and banking crisis in the political vacuum there the iranian backed hezbollah could decide to attack israel turkey s incursion into syria has introduced many new risks including to the supply of oil from iraqi kurdistan yemen s civil war has no end in sight and israel is without a government the region is a powder keg an explosion could trigger an oil shock and a renewed risk off episode in a race to the bottom more countries may pursue policies to restrict the movement of goods capital labour technology and data sixth central banks are reaching the limits of what they can do to backstop the economy and fiscal policy remains constrained by politics and high debts to be sure policymakers could turn to even more unconventional policies namely monetised fiscal deficits whenever another downturn occurs but they will not do so until the next crisis is already severe advertisement seventh the populist backlash against globalisation trade migration and technology is worsening in many places in a race to the bottom more countries may pursue policies to restrict the movement of goods capital labour technology and data while recent mass protests in bolivia chile ecuador egypt france spain hong kong indonesia iraq iran and lebanon reflect a variety of causes all are experiencing economic malaise and rising political resentment over inequality and other issues eighth the us under trump may become the biggest source of uncertainty trump s america first trade foreign policies risk destroying the international order that the us and its allies created after wwii some in europe such as french president emmanuel macron worry that nato is now comatose while the us is provoking rather than supporting its asian allies such as japan and south korea at home the impeachment process will lead to even more bipartisan gridlock and warfare and some democrats running for the party nomination have policy platforms that are making financial markets nervous finally medium term trends may cause still more economic damage and disruption demographic ageing in advanced economies and emerging markets will inevitably reduce potential growth and restrictions on migration will make the problem worse climate change is already causing costly economic damage as extreme weather events become more frequent virulent and destructive and while technological innovation may expand the size of the economic pie in the long run artificial intelligence and automation will first disrupt jobs firms and entire industries exacerbating already high levels of inequality whenever the next severe downturn occurs high and rising private and public debts will prove unsustainable triggering a wave of disorderly defaults and bankruptcies the disconnect between financial markets and the real economy is becoming more pronounced investors are happily focusing on the attenuation of some short term tail risks and on central banks return to monetary policy easing but the fundamental risks to the global economy remain in fact from a medium term perspective they are actually getting worse
last month cnbc 10 7 19 reassured us that fears of a potential recession are overblown because the hard data shows that the us economy remains strong if you ve been keeping track of corporate media coverage of the us economy over the past several years you might have noticed a contradictory pattern you ll find that corporate media make ubiquitous references to a strong economy while simultaneously providing many reports on the increasingly impoverished and precarious working class alongside the continuously rising fortunes of the rich last month a new york times report 10 20 19 exemplified this seemingly bizarre practice when it wondered why so many workers are striking when we apparently live in such a strong economy because the piece also discussed how today s strikes are fueled by a deeper sense of unfairness and economic anxiety even though corporate media are now warning us not to be too complacent because of a potential imminent recession and slowing gdp growth cnn 8 18 19 wall street journal 10 30 19 references to a strong economy and an economic recovery from the great recession still abound three years ago the new york times 12 2 16 remarked that former president barack obama was handing off a strong economy to president donald trump even as it noted that tens of millions of americans understandably feel that the recovery has passed them by two years later times columnist david brooks 11 29 18 led off a column by declaring we re enjoying one of the best economies of our lifetime this year the los angeles times 5 3 19 pondered the two great conundrums of the trump presidency how does his approval rating stay so bad when the economy is so good and what might that forecast about his prospects for reelection politico 10 15 19 and reuters 10 15 19 advise us that election models are forecasting trump s likely reelection based on economic trends in key swing states under his administration as cnn 7 5 19 proclaimed that the strong economy is functioning as trump s safety blanket for his reelection chances the financial times 5 8 19 declared that there is no doubt that the us is the strongest large economy in the world even as it warned that much of the growth surprise appears temporary the strong economy narrative is so thoroughly entrenched the atlantic 8 5 19 observed that even democratic presidential candidates are wary of mentioning economic growth lest it sound like an implicit endorsement of the trump administration s policies however following slower gdp growth and recession forecasts some democratic presidential candidates like joe biden are changing their campaign strategies by claiming that trump is squandering the strong economy inherited from the obama administration reversing their previous view of discussing the strong economic data as a losing electoral strategy reuters 8 22 19 to the extent that there is a debate over the existence of a historic recovery and a strong economy it is largely restricted to whether the economy was better under the obama administration or under the trump administration and over who really deserves credit for this allegedly amazing economy the washington post has run several comparative articles 6 25 18 5 7 19 8 20 19 arguing that trump inherited the strong economy from obama even wondering if this economy is too good to be true while noting that the vital signs look solid cnbc 9 7 18 declared that trump has set economic growth on fire praising a economic boom uniquely his as a tremendous achievement the wall street journal 5 5 19 discussed how a poll found that select groups of americans who disapprove of his job performance are still willing to credit trump for a bustling economy while usa today 7 1 19 discussed a survey that found that the solid economy is doing little to bolster support for president donald trump some articles have pushed back on the idea that trump deserves the credit for the strong economy instead crediting the federal reserve and congress or a vague broader global trend new york times 8 8 19 wall street journal 11 8 17 but who determines whether we live in a strong economy and what metrics should we use to find out despite what media say most americans believe that the economic system is rigged to benefit the wealthy elite at the expense of the working class cnn 6 28 16 pew research 10 4 18 common dreams 4 29 19 do the standard economic metrics deployed by corporate journalists accurately capture and explain the feelings and economic situation of most american workers when one also reads the contradictory coverage found in corporate media regarding the precarious situation facing the american working class it s clear they don t here s a nonexhaustive catalog of facts that make elite pundits like the new york times david brooks declaration that we re enjoying one of the best economies of our lifetime appear fatuous and puncture this myth of a strong economy overwhelmingly many of these reports point to gdp growth increased annual spending on total goods and services a low unemployment rate currently at 3 6 and the number of jobs added to the us economy as evidence of a strong economy however the standard unemployment rate in the us only includes people with no job who have been searching for work within the past four weeks this leaves out significant portions of the population like the underemployed and involuntary part time workers those who want full time work but can t find any and discouraged workers who have given up searching for a job quartz 6 7 18 this is why the new york times 10 31 19 found that there are still millions of people not captured in the official unemployment rate and people having trouble finding work in this strong economy the u 6 unemployment rate considered to be more accurate by economists because it includes discouraged workers and part time workers seeking full time employment is 7 almost double the u 3 unemployment rate usually cited by corporate media another figure that complicates this picture of a strong economy is the labor force participation rate the sum of all workers who are employed and actively seeking employment divided by the total working age population the current labor force participation rate is 63 3 4 percentage points lower than the average of 67 3 at the beginning of the 21st century although the number of involuntary part time workers dropped this year even people who only work one hour a week would not be considered unemployed by the bureau of labor statistics a 2016 study by economist lonnie golden found that the number of involuntary part time workers increased almost 45 from 2007 while there has been pushback against a widely cited 2016 study from economists lawrence katz and the late alan krueger which found that 94 of job growth from 2005 to 2015 has been in precarious alternative work arrangements in the gig economy there s no shortage of studies and projections showing that freelancing independent contracting and temp work for corporations like uber are playing a larger role in the us economy without much of the job security and benefits found in more traditional jobs nbc 8 31 17 forbes 2 15 19 new york times 8 22 19 critically throughout several years of reports on this strong economy there have also been numerous reports on the persistent problem of low and stagnant wages although there are reports indicating that workers are finally seeing slightly better wage growth after decades of stagnant wages it s still only a fraction of record corporate profits washington post 11 2 18 the long term trend of wages not keeping up with the prices of essentials hasn t improved much as it s been reported that minimum wage workers can t afford a two bedroom apartment anywhere in the us the economic policy institute 7 19 18 2 5 19 found that if the minimum wage tracked productivity growth since the 1960s it would now be over 20 an hour almost half of us families are unable to afford the basics like rent and food and 40 can t afford an unexpected 400 expense with almost 80 of us workers living paycheck to paycheck perhaps this is why increasing numbers of people are living in poverty in cars and on the streets despite having jobs cbs 7 31 18 new york times 9 11 18 washington post 3 22 19 these low and stagnant wages may also be why americans are increasingly buried in debt as student loan debt reached 1 5 trillion last year exceeding all other forms of consumer debt except mortgages and auto debt is up nearly 40 from the last decade reaching 1 3 trillion wall street journal 8 1 19 one of the grimmest signs that the economy is not working for many is that us life expectancy continues to drop from a peak of 78 9 in 2014 to 78 6 in 2017 the drop is led by rising deaths from suicide drug overdose and alcohol related disease known as diseases of despair among men particularly those without college degrees brookings institution 11 7 19 richard wolff has been one of the few economists who have argued that the media s false recovery hype is a weapon of mass distraction extra 12 14 and observed in capitalism s crisis deepens that the finance industry s decades long wave of spectacular growth has coincided with stagnating wages beginning in the 1970s as more and more americans have to rely on debt to maintain their lifestyle and keep up with the soaring costs of essentials like housing healthcare and higher education historically private debt not public debt is the harbinger of economic disaster contrary to the obsessive focus of media austerity hawks atlantic 9 9 14 guardian 11 4 13 fair org 2 22 19 despite corporate media s ludicrous factchecks on presidential candidate bernie sanders correct claim that three people in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of america the washington post argued that the comparison is not especially meaningful because people in the bottom half have essentially no wealth as debts cancel out whatever assets they might have journalists have consistently reported on the reality of rising prosperity of the wealthy record stock markets and soaring corporate profits of course such stories are often presented as good news as if higher stock prices benefited anyone other than people who own stock extra 7 8 02 matt bruenig at the people s policy institute found that the top 1 percent s net worth has increased by 21 trillion while the bottom 50 of the population saw theirs decrease by 900 billion from 1989 to 2018 perhaps this is due to massive criminal tax evasion avoidance by the wealthy and corporations in overseas tax havens euphemistically labeled loopholes coupled with unprecedented tax cuts for the rich alongside relentless selective enforcement and increased taxes on the working class fair org 12 6 17 1 17 18 given all this gdp growth tells us little about how wealth and income are distributed amongst the us population it s theoretically possible for gdp growth to be entirely accounted for by things like increased military spending for a us driven arms race corporations buying back stocks and paying out dividends to further inflate their stock prices instead of giving raises to employees or hiring more of them and the wealthy s environmentally destructive conspicuous consumption of things like private jets and superyachts since all of them count towards gdp journalists shouldn t use gdp as an indicator of economic health without further context because growing gdp alongside skyrocketing income and wealth inequality is not evidence of a strong economy but of a parasitic economy what explains corporate media s credulous reliance on uninformative economic measures and contradictory references to a strong economy alongside reports on a struggling working class it makes little sense if one assumes corporate journalists are primarily concerned with informing the public it makes a great deal of sense when one realizes that corporate news outlets have an inherent interest in cloaking class warfare by equating a strong economy with the prosperity of the investor class even if it comes at the expense of everyone else fair

in 2016 the mckinsey global institute mgi published a tool kit to close californiaâ s housing gap â extending our earlier work on affordable housing worldwide and on productivity in the construction industry yet housing comes down to many individual and highly local choices which has led mgi to apply a more detailed lens to the los angeles region and to affordability the city of la is leading the state in housing production with the addition of more than 88 000 units since 2010 it has produced more units relative to its population growth than almost any other city in california despite this burst of residential construction only about 9 percent of the new units added over the past five years have been affordable to households earning less than the area median income the comparable figure for all of la county is only slightly better at 12 percent increases in rents and home prices have far outpaced wage growth for most of the regionâ s workers as a result one million households or 70 percent of all households in the city of los angeles would have to stretch financially to obtain a standard size unit in their current neighborhood this number rises to a little over 1 9 million households across la county the cost of housing has always weighed most heavily on people in the lowest income brackets but it is now squeezing the middle class as well while many homeowners are affected the situation is inherently more precarious for renters we estimate that the shortage of affordable housing depresses gdp across the metro area by more than 2 percent this translates into 18 billion to 22 billion in lost output every year for the city of la and almost double that amount for all of la county most of this occurs as households forgo other types of consumption to pay the rent or mortgage consumption is limited even further for angelenos who face high transportation costs because they cannot afford to live near their place of employmentâ a situation that contributes to some of the nationâ s worst traffic congestion and related environmental consequences the affordable housing shortage is also one of the factors contributing to homelessness in los angeles and increasing the challenge of getting people back on their feet and into permanent housing los angeles a city of four million people added fewer than 7 300 units of affordable housing over the most recent five year period the rest of la county added approximately 6 200 affordable units in the same period production is rising year over year but both the city and the county are far short of where they need to be to meet the 2021 regional housing needs assessment rhna goals for affordable units los angeles is taking action voters approved 1 2 billion under proposition hhh to accelerate development of affordable housing and permanent supportive housing for the homeless more than 9 000 psh units have been approved for funding since 2016 incentives built into measure jjj have helped create more than 3 800 affordable units near mass transit since its adoption in november 2017 â in addition the city is moving to simplify the zoning code digitize the permitting process and provide case management services to speed through high priority projects la county has significantly increased funding through the affordable housing trust fund measure h and the no place like home program almost all proposition hhh projects in the city of la have also received funding from the county one million households or 70 percent of all households in the city of la would have to stretch financially to obtain a standard size unit in their current neighborhood despite this progress a huge share of the population remains underserved the initiatives currently under way need to be expanded and accelerated even as los angeles continues to look for new solutions it will take not only public agencies but developers nonprofits investors and community groups working together to address a challenge of this magnitude itâ s time to turn the regionâ s housing crunch into an opportunity to reimagine los angeles the region is already undertaking the biggest package of public works in the country including transit expansion revitalization of the la river the complete streets program and modernization of the cityâ s major port and airport now that same kind of ambition and investment has to extend to housingâ and particularly to transit oriented development this does not have to involve placing high rises on every open space higher density is a given but much of the gap could be bridged with low and mid rise redevelopment that capitalizes on the ongoing expansion of public transit and is within current zoning prioritizing select sites near major transit hubs and primary transit corridors for medium and some high rise development early in this effort could accelerate progress los angeles must ramp up construction of affordable units with a specific focus on serving households earning less than 120 percent of the area median income central to our vision is the underlying principle that development should be undertaken in a way that supports low income tenants through any disruption and helps them remain in their current neighborhood if they wish it should also create a positive environmental impact by reducing commutes and adding more energy efficient buildings this would further ease the financial burden on residents by lowering what they spend on transportation and utilities barriers of both land scarcity and high cost structures can be overcome very little land sits vacant in los angeles but the parcels that are available can be prioritized for development the regionâ s biggest capacity gains could come from redeveloping residential parcels that are currently not taking full advantage of their zoning allowances as well as underutilized commercial land in the city of los angeles current zoning allows for 1 5 million to 1 9 million additional housing units on highly underutilized residential parcels this theoretical potential which does not include redevelopment of underutilized commercial land is far beyond what los angeles would realistically build in the near future but the existence of this much capacity indicates that communities have a wide range of choices available to add new housing while maintaining their existing character laâ s ongoing transit expansion is creating an important window of opportunity building housing near transit can reduce traffic congestion and create a better work housing balance in the city of la itself much of the potential we identify for new affordable development comes from the higher density already allowed near transit stations these allowances are set out in the transit oriented communities toc incentives that are part of measure jjj other cities throughout la county can adopt similar incentive programs in fact almost half of metro rail stations are outside the boundaries of the city of laâ and as its transit networks continue to expand the broader region will gain even more capacity for affordable housing this is a crucial point since the city of la produced more than 70 percent of the new housing units added across the county from 2014 to 2018 despite accounting for only 40 percent of its population meeting this challenge will require all cities within la county and in the surrounding region to do their part and work collaboratively the current shortage is a regional problem that needs regional solutions public funding resources are limited since 2008 cuts in federal and state funding have reduced investment in affordable housing in la county by more than 496 million annually a drop of 70 percent more public funding is urgently needed but realistically los angeles will have to mobilize private capital to meet the scale of this challenge the region has ample capital available now it needs to create a pipeline of projects with sufficient returns to put it to work if private development can provide units affordable to most income cohorts through deed restriction or other methods the public dollars that are available could be directed toward the most vulnerable whose needs are least likely to be met by market solutions â â projects utilizing both nontraditional housing formats and prefab construction could reduce per unit costs by some 50 percentâ while minimizing the number of buildings that must go up and bringing more new housing online faster under current market conditions the economics do not work for developers to build standard units that are affordable for households earning less than 120 percent of the area median income as a result most affordable units have historically been produced through public subsidies to compensate the developer for lower rents more recently the city has experimented with replacing subsidies with incentivesâ that is â density bonusesâ that allow developers to build bigger projects near transit in exchange for defined affordable housing commitments this approach has proven successful and could be scaled up even further if combined with new housing formats innovative construction techniques and the opportunity to capitalize on public transit expansion micro units co living developments and single family home conversions are cheaper to build per unit than standard size housing units assuming appropriate streamlining of the approval process and policy accommodations regarding issues such as open space and parking these types of homes are not for everyone but they have enough appeal and utility to account for a sizable subset of the housing the region needs to add their reduced construction costs can allow market driven development of housing that is affordable for moderate income households without the need for additional subsidies or incentives they can also support higher set asides for lower income brackets under the right conditions modular and prefab construction can further bring down costs without sacrificing good design and quality although these methods need to be adopted on a large scale to realize the full potential savings and efficiencies utilizing both nontraditional housing formats and prefab construction has the potential to reduce per unit costsâ by some 50 percentâ while minimizing the number of buildings that must go up and bringing more new housing online faster six priorities for delivering affordable housing in la this report provides an in depth assessment of what it will take to accelerate progress the six recommendations below have been developed in the context of the city of los angeles but they apply equally to the broader region 1 turbo charge the process of creating a fully integrated plan with shared accountability for all of los angeles every part of laâ including affluent areas and major employment centersâ will have to plan and deliver more affordable housing but instead of piecemeal projects the region needs a cohesive and integrated approach with strengthened planning capabilities at the core in the city of la each council district can commit to delivering a share of the overall affordable housing goal and identify the right types of land the city planning department in collaboration with the city council can create an overarching policy document that provides a framework for achieving affordable housing goals clear consistent principles on transit adjacent housing density and housing formats especially nontraditional alternatives can be applied across all neighborhoods the next level of detailed community level planning should incorporate these principles and respond to potential city and state level actions among the priorities are expanding the conditions under which desired housing types such as affordable micro units and prefab affordable projects can be considered by right standardizing select building code requirements and approval processes across municipalities and reconsidering limits on housing development on commercially zoned parcels especially near transit 2 adopt new construction techniques and technologies at scale to decrease costs and accelerate development prefab construction involves producing standardized components of a structure in an off site factory then assembling them on site it can reduce the development cost of multifamily housing by 5 to 15 percent if adopted at scale with even greater benefits over the longer term this approach promotes standardization within and across projects which can speed approvals the city has funded a number of prefab projects as pilots and set up a peer review process to accelerate approvals but there is room to do more establishing new standards and regulations that account for these techniques mandating accelerated approval of these projects seamlessly integrating permitting and inspections at both factory and assembly sites and offering favorable financing terms the city or the county can also partner with select prefab companies to help them build a pipeline of demand a thriving prefab construction industry will need a workforce with the right skills which will require investment in training in addition to building housing faster this initiative can bring high quality jobs to the region 3 gradually increase set aside requirements to reflect the savings from new housing types and lower cost construction methods californiaâ s density bonus program and the cityâ s own transit oriented communities incentive program grant developers the right to build larger projects in exchange for designating a portion of the units as affordable housing but these set aside requirements were established with standard property types and traditional construction techniques and cost structures in mind with the appropriate policy accommodations in place micro unit and co living properties can support a greater proportion of affordable units while maintaining sufficient returns to secure financing â a co living property can support set asides of up to 35 percent of units for extremely low income tenants while a micro unit development could economically set aside up to 33 percentâ a significant increase from the 11 percent set aside that can be supported by standard properties with the same level of density bonus prefab construction when adopted at scale can bring costs down even further los angeles can consider raising set aside requirements over time as these formats and technologies are more widely embraced 4 reduce the time uncertainty and complexity of approval and permitting processes the city has several initiatives under way to improve the entitlement and permitting process including online permit submissions and review plan level exemptions to california environmental quality act ceqa review and simplification of the zoning code high priority affordable housing developments can take advantage of case management services as well as parallel processing of entitlements and building permits these initiatives are all positive steps the city can now accelerate implementation track data on their effectiveness and expand the scope of successful programs the re code la zoning revamp for example can be completed hand in hand with community plan updates over the next two to three years to incorporate design requirements of new housing formats eliminating the need for discretionary review the city recently launched buildla a multi year effort to digitally streamline development services and improve collaboration and communication between developers and city offices this platform can be used to provide a comprehensive view of citywide development with a consolidated live performance dashboard tracking projects in the pipeline and the time taken at each stage similar initiatives can be adopted by other cities in the region we estimate that fully digitizing and integrating processes and making targeted operational changes could trim total development time by 30 to 35 percent 5 stabilize and consolidate public financing for affordable developments affordable housing developers in the region report that their projects may require up to 15 different sources of funding each with its own application requirements restrictions and timeline for approval los angeles should aim to bring greater coordination predictability and transparency to the financing of affordable projects the city and county are already implementing a single digital application portal where developers can access all public funding sources it should help coordination between various approval processes and surface ways to create more consistency just as a universityâ s financial aid office does the city can also work with smaller affordable developers to help them navigate these highly complex processes and consider consolidating philanthropic and other private funding sources as well in addition establishing professional management of city owned land and other real estate assets as new york city london copenhagen and stockholm have done can generate additional revenue for affordable housing there are 14 000 publicly owned parcels in the city of la and slightly more than half are owned by the city itself professional management of this real estate can identify suitable city owned sites for affordable developments other sites can be developed commercially with the returns channeled back into affordable housing 6 strengthen the safety net for the most vulnerable tenants los angeles will need to redevelop many existing properties to add more affordable housing but that raises the issue of what happens to current low income residents during construction we take it as an underlying principle that redevelopment should not ultimately force them out of their neighborhood while affected tenants are entitled to compensation from developers if they have to move out due to construction they may need additional assistance in finding a new unit the la homeless services authority has developed a â coordinated entry systemâ to match homeless individuals with affordable housing units funded by the city now the city may need to establish a similar program for a wider population of at risk tenants laâ s housing community investment department is currently building an online inventory of all non subsidized affordable units to provide a single platform for tenants to apply this effort could be scaled up and accelerated in addition more than 10 000 affordable units across the city will convert to market rates as their 30 year affordability covenants expire between 2019 and 2023 this threatens to displace more tenants and set back progress a citywide strategy and program can work with neighborhoods to extend those covenants or place affected tenants in new affordable units nearby making case by case assessments hcidlaâ s 2018 21 strategic plan provides a foundation for what could be an effective citywide initiative the region has ample capital available now it needs to create a pipeline of projects with sufficient returns to put it to work moving los angeles forward the southern california region is currently undergoing the sixth regional housing needs assessment rhna process for the eight year cycle that will run from 2021 to 2029 in november 2019 the southern california association of governments finalized its allocation methodology for this cycle giving la county an overall housing production goal of 818 943 units out of this total 475 694 units should be affordable to households earning less than 120 percent of the area median income these targets are more than four times higher than the previous cycleâ s goals at the current pace it would take la county more than 35 years to hit an overall housing production goal it is meant to achieve in an eight year period meeting higher rhna goals in the decade ahead will require a significant increase in construction and investment in general building more increasing density and capitalizing on set asides in private sector developments will improve the regionâ s chances of meeting its goals in a timely mannerâ with fewer public and social sector dollars la county would have to increase its build rate by a minimum of 4 5 times adding almost 102 000 units per year to achieve its overall housing production goal for the upcoming cycle it can meet the affordable housing component of this total in two ways through public financing and through market driven developments with set asides for affordable units meeting 100 percent of the countyâ s affordable housing goal through public financing of standard units alone would require more than 133 8 billion over the eight year cycle the alternative is taking steps to achieve a portion of this goal through the private market la county could adopt an incentive program similar to the transit oriented communities provision in measure jjj which has already had success in the city of la if the county fully meets its goals for adding new housing geared to above moderate income households it would gain enough set asides to meet almost 9 percent of its affordable housing goal if the region adopts new housing formats and lower cost construction techniques as described above it could achieve up to 17 percent of its affordable housing goals through set asides this shift would also help to produce housing that is affordable to moderate income households approximately 28 percent of the affordable housing goal without the need for public subsidies if these approaches are combined los angeles could potentially achieve almost 45 percent of the next cycleâ s affordable housing target through market driven development alone covering the remaining 55 percent of the rhna target for new affordable units would require 41 billion to 81 billion in subsidies over the eight year period the size of this range reflects variations in housing formats whether lower cost construction techniques are used and the level of affordability desired the combination of density around transit innovative construction techniques and housing formats and higher set aside requirements could be a powerful one to attract private investment in both moderate income housing and deed restricted low income housing policy makers can consider giving projects that follow this model by right approvals and incentives when the state and city took broad action to allow accessory dwelling units permit applications shot up citywide a positive trend that could be replicated on a bigger scale with micro units and prefab construction public dollars could then be directed toward efforts to support households with more acute needs such as supportive services rental assistance preservation and eviction support the regionâ s fragmented housing ecosystem needs to become more cohesive and easier to navigate a public private social delivery coalition could be the catalyst needed to bring about this change it should bring together for profit and nonprofit developers builders relevant city agencies and neighborhood representativesâ plus the cityâ s

illustration by shout for time on march 29 2003 at a wedding reception in the harvard faculty club lawrence w reed gave a toast in honor of the friend whom he was serving as best man one joseph p overton overton had worked at dow chemical he had since become an executive at a free market small government think tank in central michigan among his duties at the mackinac center for public policy was raising money and in doing so he had made a brochure that would become his legacy overton was trying to describe the role of think tanks in a society and he posited an idea that would come to be called the overton window in a given society at a given moment there is a range of policies politically acceptable to the mainstream a 70 top tax rate and a 20 top tax rate are both within this window in america today abolishing taxes is not generally the theory went politicians will only propose ideas that fall within the window it falls to think tanks and others to propose unpopular things outside of the window in the hope of shifting the window and making the previously unthinkable achievable overton was an ardent libertarian who pushed ideas like school choice and according to reed s wedding toast he had on occasion resorted to more extreme methods of moving the window of the possible including the time reed recounted that day we flew in a cessna 172 in broad daylight at treetop level 150 miles into war torn mozambique to assist armed rebels fighting the marxist regime there overton died just weeks after his wedding were overton still alive he would be pushing 60 and might be aghast to learn that his window having become famous after his death is now invoked to describe america s great unlikely backlash against the system he defended so ardently capitalism a democratic socialist bernie sanders is among the top contenders to be the next democratic nominee for u s president his rival and fellow senator elizabeth warren is also among the top tier of candidates declaring herself a capitalist who wishes to transform american capitalism as we know it with a wealth tax a green new deal and the elimination of private health insurance a more centrist candidate mayor pete buttigieg of south bend ind illustrated the shifting winds when he recently declared that neo liberalism is the political economic consensus that has governed the last 40 years of policy in the u s and u k its failure helped to produce the trump moment now we have to replace it with something better in 2016 the democratic socialists of america dsa had 5 000 members since then its dues paying membership has multiplied more than tenfold this new energy on the left terrifies chief executives and billionaires and yet many of them have been voicing similar alarms about a crisis of capitalism ray dalio the billionaire co chairman of the investment firm bridgewater associates warned in april that america faced a national emergency in capitalism s failure to benefit more people and he pronounced the american dream lost the anti capitalist impulse has some purchase on the right too before he pushed a tax cut that lined the capitalists pockets donald trump ran most improbably as a republican skeptical of the financial elite s loyalty to americans on fox news tucker carlson has entertained a surprising skepticism of capitalist doctrines and said positive things about warren america loves a capitalist reckoning the way the nfl loves colin kaepernick but it is having one anyway and if this year that reckoning seemed to reach new intensity it was because the economic precariousness stalled mobility and gaping social divides that have for years fueled the backlash now had an improbable sidekick plutocracy itself and the win win ideology that has governed the past few decades this year america s ultra elites seemed to bend over backward to lend support to the idea that maybe the system they superintend needs gut renovating as a political movement bubbled up to challenge their wealth and power the elite s own misbehavior trickled down and where the two met ideas that once seemed unutterable started to many to sound like the future history is the story of conditions that long seem reasonable until they begin to seem ridiculous so it is with america s present manic hyper capitalism until recently it seemed normal that a technological revolution that began with promises of leveled playing fields had culminated in an age of platform monopolies normal that businesspeople should try to make as much money as possible by paying as little as possible in taxes and wages then donate a fraction of the spoils to pr friendly social causes normal that economic security for most americans was becoming a relic of the past normal that people in the street level marijuana business go to prison while people in the business of selling ads to russian intelligence go on magazine covers normal that bankers could shatter the world economy with their speculating and that they would be among the few to be made whole after the crisis for years there have been voices trying to denormalize this state there were protests in seattle in 1999 there was occupy in 2011 there was the dsa there was the world social forum to rival the world economic forum there was eternally bernie sanders saying the exact stuff he is still saying today there were civic groups trying to organize workers and poor communities there were outcasts in silicon valley warning that mark zuckerberg wasn t really about human connection but america was in the grips of the ideological consensus that buttigieg described hyper capitalism was the intellectual stadium in which the country played there was a left side of the field more wary of capitalism s extremes and a right side of the field prone to capitalist boosting but the stadium as overton understood demarcated the boundaries of the debate for most people capitalism more or less as we practice it is our system and it is the best system so how do we tweak it to make it better then in 2016 something happened sanders ran for president he built a formidable national movement powered by small donations and won 22 states mind you as a democratic socialist in the united states of america sometimes the thing that could never happen happens and it makes people doubt their sense of reality and in that election cycle if sanders discredited capitalism as a conscious project his cause received unexpected unintentional help from the man who would become president trump ran as a flamboyant capitalist wary of certain aspects of capitalism but promising that his capitalist mind and his capitalist fortune would make him a uniquely gifted uniquely incorruptible president when that turned out not to be the case trump not only damaged himself but the idea of the selfless billionaire savior too the overton window was moving then came the 2018 midterms and a new wave of democratic candidates most prominently representative alexandria ocasio cortez of new york questioning capitalism as capitalism in a way that seemed unfamiliar and fresh as the 2020 campaign approached warren jumped into the race a beneficiary of the opening sanders had helped carve for capitalist critical aspirants to america s highest office with her now famous litany of plans warren detailed an agenda that would put american business in a headlock that she and sanders both veritable enemies of big business are among the top candidates shows how much the politics of capitalism has changed who should be time s person of the year for 2019 cast your vote in the reader poll but politics can be abstract it can be complicated people are busy living politics often benefits from scandal from prominent misbehavior from a dramatization of the discourse and this was what was so remarkable about 2019 because of the coming election in these populist times it was already a year potentially full of trouble for the plutocrats or plutes as i like to call them to save space and thus paper and therefore trees but almost as if to assist the cause the plutes seemed this year to put on an extended exhibit of performance art whose plain if unstated thesis is that plutocracy is maybe a bad idea exhibit a early in the year amazon run by one of the world s richest people jeff bezos announced it was pulling out of its planned hydra like second headquarters in new york city it seemed to come as a surprise to bezos that in a city where a significant number of people struggle to keep up with rising costs and stagnant pay many weren t excited by the idea of the state and city giving his company a few billion dollars in tax breaks that wouldn t be available to a regular joe starting a business in the debate that erupted the conventional wisdom that it is always better to attract jobs even by offering companies major incentives came to be questioned exhibit b the college bribery scandal wealth and privilege are already great guarantors of securing a spot in a university what the scandal unearthed by federal prosecutors illustrated is that many very rich people are not satisfied with the general advantage of hyper privilege nor even with the specific advantage of donations to universities that give you an edge but not a guarantee the ascendant critics of capitalism in american politics have called the system rigged for years but here was a biopsy of the rigging the most revealing subplot of the college scandal was the arrest of bill mcglashan many others ensnared in the scheme had bolder faced names but mcglashan was significant because he had become a symbol of the hope promoted by so many of the winners of our age that they would lead the charge toward a fairer society mcglashan through the rise fund that he helped create and is managed by his private equity firm tpg growth had helped popularize the growing field of impact investing in which a fund pursues not only economic returns but also the betterment of the world he was charged with and pleaded not guilty to trying to bribe his son into the university of southern california thus depriving the people whom he supposedly helped for a living of a fair shot at that college seat exhibit c in july facebook on account of just one of the scandals hovering over it this one involving privacy violations received a 5 billion fine from the federal trade commission now for you that may be a big fine for facebook it was such a feathery tickle that the company s stock surged on the news reaching its highest price in nearly a year facebook s massive market power its dubious behavior in the face of russian intelligence activities its fueling of polarization and its enabling of mis information and even violence were unaffected by the ftc fine a penalty that if anything left the impression that companies like facebook enjoy near total impunity still in response to these scandals and outrages many in the business world declared themselves newly interested in reform the most prominent and heralded instance this past year was a statement by the business roundtable an umbrella organization whose members are the chief executives of many of america s largest companies for decades the roundtable has clung to a particular interpretation of the purpose of a business that it is solely to make money for shareholders with its new statement issued in august the roundtable updated its view business roundtable redefines the purpose of a corporation to promote an economy that serves all americans it was inspiring limited stuff what it really revealed was how hard it will be for the old guard capitalists to change at all the statement was a call for every corporate signatory to decide voluntarily to behave in ways more supportive of people and the planet as far as i know no company because of the statement announced the cessation of practices in lobbying tax avoidance employment or other realms when i publicly questioned the teeth of a pledge that reminded me of my own pledges not to eat fries jamie dimon the chief executive of jpmorgan chase and chairman of the roundtable contacted me we talked on the phone for half an hour he was incredulous that i didn t trust that the pledge would mean action i challenged him to give the pledge teeth why not begin to lobby for proposals in congress that would make stakeholder capitalism the law not just an airy promise why not excommunicate companies that lobby for things contrary to the stated values of the roundtable he said the roundtable wasn t a police force when i put to him that many signatories of this pledge to treat people better were known to be fairly exploitative of workers he pushed back with words that illustrate that self reformed capitalism is a lot like unreformed capitalism but with better public relations he said that he knew the chief executives i was talking about and that he liked them they were good people he was sure they were kind to employees plus he said a lot of people just don t like to work a spokes person for dimon later said to the washington post these quotes don t reflect the conversation in public relations an important term of art is getting out ahead of the story if bad news about you is coming pre empt it by telling the story on your terms the business roundtable s move long on rhetoric short on support for any actual reforms with teeth seemed very much in that tradition get out in front of the backlash to extreme capitalism by proposing an optional capitalism lite then there is the other classic way in which the plutes get out in front of such backlashes philanthropy if you re goldman sachs contribute to a financial crisis that costs millions of men and women their homes and livelihoods then give back and scrub your name through something like the 10 000 women program to mentor entrepreneurs yet this year more people seemed to see through this take and give playbook a striking moment came in late march when new york state led by its new attorney general letitia james filed a lawsuit against members of the sackler family and others whom it accused of abetting the opioid crisis in addition to alleging malfeasance in selling the drugs the complaint made a claim about the use of philanthropy to lubricate wrongdoing ultimately the sacklers used their ill gotten wealth to cover up their misconduct with a philanthropic campaign to whitewash their decades long success in profiting at new yorkers expense the suit cited donations to many arts institutions resulting in sackler wings and institutes and centers while also serving to cleanse their name in a way that allowed the grim machinery of drug peddling to grind on for years then there was the jeffrey epstein case epstein the late sexual predator and maybe tycoon gave endless ammunition to plutocracy s critics here was a man who had allegedly trafficked and raped children who had been convicted of serious offenses and who managed through deftly arranged philanthropy and social climbing to re establish himself in high society epstein ingratiated himself with harvard he gave money to the massachusetts institute of technology and was given the chance to meddle in its research a phenomenon that one writer aptly called sugar daddy science he even spent a surprising amount of time with bill gates a children s advocate who has since apologized for his lapse in judgment yet what epstein revealed was less individual lapses than systemic rot in our culture especially at our universities which have become drive through reputational laundromats as the chances have increased that a candidate outside the neoliberal consensus will win the nomination we have begun to see the great plute freakout of 2019 a wave of plutes have weighed in about the dangers of a sanders or warren presidency although their obvious motivation is clear not wanting to lose their money to the federal government that s seldom how they argue it instead they engage in economic concern trolling framing their self preservational worries as being in fact worries about you and yours zuckerberg of facebook warned us that taxing wealth would limit the diversity of philanthropic efforts in medical research leon cooperman a hedge fund billionaire warned us that taxing wealth would curb the good works that he and his friends do and then in the cherry on top michael bloomberg the former new york city mayor and media billionaire made moves to launch his own bid for the democratic nomination peak billionaire may be a billionaire deciding to possibly attempt to purchase a party nomination because of his fear that some candidates in the race aren t plutophilic enough and then running against a maybe billionaire who promised that being a billionaire would make him specially incorruptible and now is in impeachment proceedings over his alleged corruption america s crisis of capitalism has cousins abroad in chile an increase in subway fares triggered massive antigovernment pro reform protests in recent months killing at least 20 and injuring more than 1 000 a slogan of the protests has been neoliberalism was born in chile and will die in chile the protesters have been demanding that education and health care be established as rights under the chilean constitution argentina has also been rocked by protests as it grapples with an economic crisis rising hunger and the angry fallout from an international monetary fund bailout last year in britain the chaos of brexit drags on fueled by feelings that the economy wasn t working for enough people and questions about whether billionaires should exist the mercy of all this elite failure and backlash is this the ongoing collapse of any pretense of selflessness among the winners of our new gilded age if a single cultural idea has upheld the disproportionate power of this class it has been the idea of the win win they could get rich and then give back to you win win they could run a fund that made them sizable returns and offered you social returns too win win they could sell sugary drinks to children in schools and work on public private partnerships to improve children s health win win they could build cutthroat technology monopolies and get credit for serving to connect humanity and foster community win win as this seductive idea fizzles out it raises the possibility that this age of capital in which money was the ultimate organizing principle of american life could actually end something could actually replace it after all a century ago america was firmly planted in the first gilded age and then it found its way into the progressive era and the new deal an era of great public ambition business didn t go away it wasn t abolished capitalists didn t go into gulags it was just that the emphasis of the society shifted money was no longer the lodestar of all pursuits the choice facing americans is whether we want to be a society organized around money s thirsts a playground for the whims of billionaires or whether we wish to be a democracy the second gilded age will end at some point the question is what comes next what trump offers is tribal nationalism strongman politics and plutocrat friendly policy greased by populist rhetoric the other possibility is that as occurred a century ago a gilded age collapses into an age of reform an era defined culturally by renewed public purpose and politically by the restoration of the state in areas where people are too powerless to solve problems of their own defined by the use of shared institutions to solve shared problems you can already see glimpses of how an age of reform is being dreamed up higher taxes on the very fortunate to be sure more regulation and worker protections and the like an attack on climate change almost as dramatic as climate change itself programs to give workers greater security it would be an age in which it was cooler more thrilling more admired more viable to change the world democratically if there is one thing that could hasten the end of the age of capital and accelerate the coming of an age of reform it is a vigorous new culture of joining in american life not clicking not liking not retweeting not tiktokking not screaming at msnbc fox but actually joining political movements and civic organizations with memberships so vast that politicians cannot ignore them the age of capital has been facilitated by a remarkable solidarity among the ultra fortunate putting that period in the museum will take other broader solidarities giridharadas is a time editor at large and the author of winners take all the elite charade of changing the world
copenhagen denmark louise purup nohr s morning routine is like something out of a sustainable future when she hustles her kids into the bathroom what flushes down the toilet will later turn into the natural gas that warms breakfast on the stove the eggs come from the chickens in the backyard the coffee machine s gurgling is powered by electricity generated from the wind the water that washes the dishes is heated by sustainable sawdust pellets the recycling gets shunted in eight directions so that little ends up in the dump and the commute first to school then to work is on a cargo bike that bumps across copenhagen s extensive bike lane network amid mounting global concern about climate change denmark has turned into a buzzing hive of green experimentation with efforts underway inside homes across cities and on a national scale households such as purup nohr s are seeking to limit their carbon footprints by cutting back on consumption copenhagen is trying to become the first carbon neutral capital by 2025 a full 25 years before washington and other major world cities expect they might have a shot at canceling their emissions denmark s newly elected center left leaders are trying to turn the whole country into a showcase for how to go green without going bankrupt danes hope they will inspire others to follow suit creating an impact that goes beyond the borders of this country of 5 8 million people the societal effort is also a measure of just how much needs to change to slow climate change for purup nohr s family being environmentally conscious has involved conscious trade offs we re not minimalists said purup nohr 31 but she and her husband have examined every aspect of their lives for its environmental impact it is a journey she said you start looking and then you look at your food and then you look at your transport when you start thinking about the environment you want to make your life fit some of their adjustments have been relatively minor they phased out liquid shampoo in favor of soap bars that don t require bottles and hung an hourglass into the shower to keep themselves from dawdling under the water they bought used reusable cloth diapers which they plan to resell to someone else when they are done with them the little red cart their 1 year old uses to toddle around is secondhand as are the rest of the toys so as not to fuel more production and consumption but the family has also made more significant lifestyle decisions with climate and the environment in mind purup nohr her husband and two small children don t travel on planes they ve committed to exploring denmark s many islands during their vacations for years to come she works part time reasoning that earning less spending less and consuming less all go together and they ve contented themselves to live in a small apartment in town instead of something like the more spacious suburban houses they grew up in the family isn t radical by danish standards they haven t cut meat from their diet for instance though they ve reduced it they rent cars from time to time and they try not to be doctrinaire about their efforts danes have long tilted toward green friendly action especially in copenhagen a city of 624 000 with a rich countercultural tradition nearly half of danes 47 consider climate change to be the most serious problem facing the world according to european union polling that s more than double the eu average of 23 and yet researchers from the norwegian university of science and technology pegged the annual carbon emissions of the average dane at 14 5 tons above the eu average and reflective of the country s wealth many scientists say a two tons per person annual limit will be needed to meet the 2050 goals of the paris climate accords people are always saying that denmark is doing so much said mathilde vallat 16 we re still polluting like hell vallat is among the danish students who have joined the fridays for future movement inspired by the example of 16 year old greta thunberg who comes from neighboring sweden thousands of high schoolers have marched through the cobbled streets of copenhagen decrying their parents generation for not doing enough the deliberate choice to live small purup nohr said is one way people can be kinder to the planet than their parents might have been she and her husband she said live in a world where our parents live in big houses with a lot of money and we don t we have no debt we have no savings it s a choice we could also have chosen to have different jobs with more money i think we live the good life she acknowledged that climate issues can feel overwhelming i don t read articles about the ice melting or the biodiversity crisis she said we never talk about climate with the children i think it s way too scary instead she focuses on things within her control while asking herself do you want to give a better world to your children or a catastrophe having a motivated population with families like purup nohr s has enabled copenhagen to set one of the world s most ambitious climate goals the dash to become carbon neutral within the next six years has sent city planners scouting across the baltics for sustainable sawdust turned what were once traffic choked roundabouts into tree studded miniature wildernesses and led to the construction of an urban ski slope atop a hulking new power plant that burns trash to make electricity livability and the green transformation go hand in hand said copenhagen mayor frank jensen who helped establish the climate goals soon after taking office in 2010 the combined ski slope and power plant with emerald green artificial turf that can be used year round is visible from the historic 18th century city center across the harbor it s the visual centerpiece of the city s efforts to reduce emissions by shifting to greener energy sources the city has also switched from coal to sawdust pellets left over from logging and lumber production to heat the water that runs from central plants to homes a preexisting system called district heating that was already more efficient than home boilers it s only a small city said joergen abildgaard head of the team running copenhagen s climate plans but it matters because when you look at a global perspective we know that people are moving to cities we know there s a growing middle class if those investments are done in a sustainable way it s positive another major focus of the city s efforts is how people get around copenhagen officials estimate that at least 75 of all trips must be done by foot bike or public transportation to meet the 2025 goals bicycling was already popular it s often the speediest way to get from one place to another but city planners have brainstormed everything they can do to make biking even more attractive right down to installing footrests at stoplights to make it easier for cyclists to wait out a red also in the service of copenhagen s emissions goals a subway line opened in september with 17 new stations that encircle the city center and to reduce cars in the city center copenhagen has raised the annual resident parking fee from 1 48 to 148 jensen the mayor said the green sales pitch got more buy in after a 2011 downpour in which 6 inches of rain fell on copenhagen in less than three hours causing massive floods and more than 1 billion in damage all the citizens of copenhagen could see we have to act jensen said since the flooding city planners and residents have sought to make the urban landscape more absorbent in one stretch of streets in oesterbro a dense district just outside central copenhagen parking spaces have been given over to plots of land where trees and bushes grow wild a roundabout that was once a desolate stretch of pavement is now a birch studded parkland cars still move through but on narrowed lanes birds fly from tree to tree kids run across small footbridges something has happened in denmark said sara jorn who runs miljoepunkt oesterbro a community organization that helped craft the area s climate plans politicians and leaders are listening now in total the city plans to spend about 400 million over the course of the 11 year effort which started in 2013 but officials emphasize that economic growth has continued even while the city has invested in becoming greener and they say residents will be shielded from rising fossil fuel prices as well as from some of the damage from extreme weather events in a warming world abildgaard the copenhagen project director was tasked with making changes without sending costs for city residents soaring which constrained some of his decisions but he anticipates copenhagen will reach its 2025 goal or come very close it has already cut its emissions by 40 compared to 2005 in which time its population increased by a quarter but some critics say the efforts don t go far enough among other issues being carbon neutral the product of an elaborate set of calculations offsets and assumptions is not the same as being emissions free burning all those wood pellets still pumps carbon dioxide into the atmosphere even if in theory new trees can be planted somewhere to reabsorb it some have suggested that copenhagen is cheating by not including its international airport officially outside city limits in its calculations and perhaps the biggest issue of all according to critics the city s plan doesn t demand much sacrifice from its citizens it doesn t require any changes at all for individuals said fanny broholm a city council member from the left wing alternative party and we need to change everything if we are to get to two tons of carbon emissions per person per year broholm said danes need to consume less something not addressed by copenhagen s emissions plans which focus on what comes out of the city s smokestacks not on the environmental impact of purchasing a plastic toy from china flying for a beach vacation to the mediterranean or eating red meat in september broholm s party successfully pushed a plan to cut the meat in meals prepared by municipal kitchens copenhagen schoolchildren city employees and seniors who eat at municipal elderly centers will all have less meat at lunch time eating burgers and meatballs and stuff we shouldn t do it broholm said but abildgaard said cities aren t necessarily well placed to change that sort of individual behavior more broadly you do have to ask what is the role of the city when it comes to where they go on vacation what they eat what clothes they wear he said copenhagen got a partner for its climate efforts with the election of a center left coalition in june after a campaign dominated by green issues among the top priorities of the new government cutting national emissions 70 by 2030 from their 1990 levels we re at 0 1 of emissions globally said danish environment minister dan joergensen whose government issued car is a gleaming electric mercedes sedan that s not going to save the planet but we want to show the world that we can do this the goal has broad public support and every major party in denmark has signed on even if joergensen admits officials don t yet know how they can achieve it leaders say they will unveil how they ll get there and how they ll pay for it in the coming months there s a sweeping list of recommendations to consider prepared by a commission established in 2015 to advise danish leaders on climate policy potential changes include slimming the size of denmark s dairy herds planting the countryside with fast growing willow trees to burn later for energy production and ushering out cars that use internal combustion engines in favor of electric ones danish leaders say they want to demonstrate that it is possible to live sustainably without a massive new spending commitments or a hit to living standards by many measures they are already moving in the right direction on sept 15 for the first time wind turbines generated enough power for all of denmark s electricity demands for a full 24 hours it was a milestone in the country s effort to become fossil fuel free by 2050 a commitment made by a previous center left government danes already face steep taxes intended to encourage green friendly choices car buyers pay an 85 tax on the first 27 500 of any car purchase above that price the tax rises to 150 that s actually less than the tax used to be and the new danish leaders are considering raising it again green efforts in other western european countries have at times tripped up politicians french president emmanuel macron sparked months of yellow vest protests in france when he proposed raising his country s gas tax his critics said he wasn t being mindful of the economic difficulties of rural populations danish leaders fresh off their electoral victory say that they have a strong mandate to go green and they say relatively low levels of inequality in denmark will help insulate them from complaints for now they say danes have told them to be ambitious instead of asking what s possible we ask what s necessary joergensen said

cutting national emissions 70 by 2030 from their 1990 levels we re at 0 1 of emissions globally said danish environment minister dan joergensen whose government issued car is a gleaming electric mercedes sedan that s not going to save the planet but we want to show the world that we can do this the goal has broad public support and every major party in denmark has signed on even if joergensen admits officials don t yet know how they can achieve it leaders say they will unveil how they ll get there and how they ll pay for it in the coming months there s a sweeping list of recommendations to consider prepared by a commission established in 2015 to advise danish leaders on climate policy potential changes include slimming the size of denmark s dairy herds planting the countryside with fast growing willow trees to burn later for energy production and ushering out cars that use internal combustion engines in favor of electric ones danish leaders say they want to demonstrate that it is possible to live sustainably without a massive new spending commitments or a hit to living standards by many measures they are already moving in the right direction on sept 15 for the first time wind turbines generated enough power for all of denmark s electricity demands for a full 24 hours it was a milestone in the country s effort to become fossil fuel free by 2050 a commitment made by a previous center left government danes already face steep taxes intended to encourage green friendly choices car buyers pay an 85 tax on the first 27 500 of any car purchase above that price the tax rises to 150 that s actually less than the tax used to be and the new danish leaders are considering raising it again green efforts in other western european countries have at times tripped up politicians french president emmanuel macron sparked months of yellow vest protests in france when he proposed raising his country s gas tax his critics said he wasn t being mindful of the economic difficulties of rural populations danish leaders fresh off their electoral victory say that they have a strong mandate to go green and they say relatively low levels of inequality in denmark will help insulate them from complaints for now they say danes have told them to be ambitious instead of asking what s possible we ask what s necessary joergensen said

i m sure most of you are inundated with black november 70 off and clearance email promotions from the usual cast of brick mortar online chain retailers it started with my inbox in october this is because retailers are terrified of what could be one of the worst holiday spending seasons in years the mainstream financial media planted with soundbytes from wall street snakeoil salesmen have already created this year s the dog ate my homework excuse for poor holiday spending with the absurd notion that the period between thanksgiving and christmas is shorter this year quite frankly i would not be surprised if many households used amazon s amzn prime day and easy amazon credit lines offered to buy holiday gifts early this year speaking of amzn it warned that its expected holiday sales would be lower than previous guidance and home depot hd lowered its q4 revenue estimates for the second time in three months perhaps october retail sales offer a glimpse at what we can expect the headline retail sales report promoted the idea that retail sales rebounded in october recall september retail sales dropped 3 october s retail sales reportedly increased 0 3 the headline number was rounded up from 0 27 compare this to the headline 0 36 cpi this means that real retail sales in october i e ex inflation declined keep in mind that a survey of more than 5 400 americans by the financial health network revealed that 70 of households are struggling financially in some capacity 17 said they can t maintain a majority or all aspects of their finances another 54 said they re struggling with at least one aspect of financial stability likely credit card auto debt about 20 of middle class workers are spending more than they earn this study confirms and reinforces other studies i ve seen showing similar results core retail sales which are ex automobiles and gasoline increased 0 1 which was worse than expected when you think about it aside from all of the statistical errors from estimating 16 out of 25 categories the core retail sales ex inflation was negative it looks like gasoline sales drove the headline number as it was up 1 1 which is the result of higher gasoline prices during the month away from food core discretionary categories suffered rather large declines from september clothing was down 1 sporting goods hobby books were down 0 8 furniture store sales dropped 0 9 and electronics appliance sales were down 0 4 consumers also cut back spending at restaurants and bars with sales dropping 0 3 the retail sales numbers for october preceded by the big drop in retail sales in september reflect and confirm my view that the consumer is running out road with the ability to assume more credit card debt for discretionary expenditures the results of the survey above suggest that a not insignificant percentage of households need credit cards to make ends meet this chart nicely summarizes the u s household financial conditions i suspect the census bureau will do its best to impose seasonal adjustment distortions at trump s behest in order to put the best possible spin on retail sales but truth is that a majority of households are struggling with a heavy debt load and with real income after taxes that barely covers non discretionary expenditures do not mistake a rising stock market as an indicator that economy is healthy right now the largest component of economic activity at 70 of gdp is terminally ill financially original post editor s note the summary bullets for this article were chosen by seeking alpha editors
dedicated to amigisimo and contrarian thinker ernest leung there is no question that the philippines needs a boost to its dismal investment rate 22 24 of gdp while our neighbors are punching at 25 35 but the question is how the government s corporate income tax and incentive rationalization act citira claims that a lower statutory corporate income tax has to be part of the mix the subsequent strident debate on citira mostly centers on how the replacement of gross income tax git at 5 with a corporate income tax cit will impact locators and foreign investment in peza the source of most of our manufactured exports but truth to tell this replacement issue as important as it is is a derivative one while overstaying incentives are a legitimate issue the major prior reason for the restructuring of peza incentives including the replacement of gross with corporate income tax for locators is to plug the potential fiscal hole punched by the proposed lowering of the statutory corporate income tax cit rate from 30 to 20 the crucial claim is that lower statutory cit will boost investment and growth a claim mind you that is by contrast largely glossed over surely the department of finance dof team must have this issue well covered but merely pointing to the lower average cit in our asian neighborhood average 20 today where the investment rate today is higher is no proof that higher investment rate will result in the philippines in 1980s when they were making their move malaysia s and singapore s cit was at 40 while indonesia s was at 35 nor does it suffice to point to sweden s and denmark s corporate income tax at 22 in 2019 since sweden s was at 60 in 1989 and denmark s was at 50 in 1985 a cursory check of the evidence seemed in order if only to confirm the claim the citira position finds support in lee and gordon 2004 who over a panel data throughout the period 1970 1997 for 70 countries found a negative and significant relation between growth per capita and cit however shevlin et al s 2016 cross country regressions found that the association between statutory corporate income tax and per capita income growth for the period 1995 2011 disappears altogether when area and year fixed effects are added questioning the robustness of the lee and gordon result of even more interest is their result that statutory corporate income tax does not associate at all with long run two to five year horizon economic or employment growth shevlin et al however find that lower effective tax rate what firms actually pay accounting for tax avoidance and on average 7 2 lower than the statutory rates does associate significantly with higher growth hunady and orviska 2015 find a non linear relation between economic growth and statutory corporate income taxation for the eu economies from 1999 to 2011 positive for lower corporate income tax rates but becomes negative for higher rates see also misuru and nakamura 2019 they do not say whether 30 is high rebelo and jaimovich 2018 conceding at the outset that there is no relation between the long run growth of the us economy and corporate tax rate nevertheless argue that the 2017 trump corporate income tax cut can still deliver a bump in economic growth in the short run if the initial tax rate is exceptionally high they do not say where the high tipping point lies how about firm level investment djankov et al 2008 find that the statutory corporate income tax has no effect on the investment behavior of firms across the world fdis do fall with statutory corporate income tax rates but the fdi issue in citira is different a switch from a 5 git with cit equivalence of 13 as per dof computation to a 20 cit an effective rise in statutory rates for fdi by contrast a higher effective corporate income tax rate see also ohrn 2018 for the case of us firms does have a negative effect on investment while the number of studies cited here is limited the overall flavor is clear within a reasonable range statutory cit and growth investment are not associated the djankov et al results draw from cross country regressions for only one year 2004 most of the results in this area of study are for affluent developed economies such as the eu or usa with no allowance made for low income economies as a group the behavior of the poor is markedly different than the economic behavior of the rich ask the authors of poor economics and 2019 nobel memorial prize winners banerjee and duflo that the link between statutory cit on the one hand and economic growth and corporate investment on the other seems so tenuous was a surprise in the long debate over low investment rate in the philippines in the last two decades the weak rule of law on property rights and contracts the high power cost the unstable regulatory environment and the licensing hurdles for investors were the recognized binding constraints the corporate income tax came up occasionally only because ours is higher than regional average if there is no real progress in those other identified binding constraints the envisioned growth and investment boost from lower cit may be a mirage lower cit may only finance higher dividends for shareholders more spirited stock buybacks which rewards shareholders or if higher corporate investing materializes at all among local firms it may find its home not in the philippines but in vietnam indonesia or thailand to embark on a reduction of the statutory cit and make the export manufacturing sector foot the bill on such unsolid ground seems reckless i hope i am mistaken and merely

testifying to congress this month federal reserve chair jerome powell sent a message seldom heard from his predecessors that the fed should consider the struggles of the lowest income americans in setting its interest rate policies we want to remind ourselves powell said that prosperity isn t experienced in all communities low and moderate income communities in many cases are just starting to feel the benefits of this expansion it wasn t the first time powell had sounded that theme of late at a news conference in july he noted that pay had begun rising fastest for lower skilled workers a shift from earlier in the economic expansion this underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind he said the notion that the fed should try to sustain the expansion to help the most disadvantaged people might seem self evident but throughout its history the fed whose mandate is to stabilize prices and maximize employment has rarely expressed the need to suit its policies to benefit the least fortunate with the economy expanding for an 11th year and unemployment near a 50 year low most of powell s predecessors would have focused on the threat of high inflation and the possibility of raising rates to forestall it the prevailing belief has been that addressing economic inequality or poverty is the purview of congress not the fed powell still says the fed s main focus is the health of the job market and the stability of prices but as he nears the end of his second year as chairman he has increasingly opened the door to the idea that the fed can also lift up those who still struggle years after an economic expansion has boosted the fortunes of most americans one driver of that change is an outreach effort the fed launched a year ago as part of a review of its financial tools and strategy the outreach has included 14 meetings between fed officials and representatives from labor unions educators and community development groups many participants have told fed officials that despite entrenched poverty in some areas of the country more disadvantaged americans are finally finding jobs and making economic progress on monday in a working class neighborhood in east hartford connecticut powell and eric rosengren president of boston federal reserve bank will visit a career development program and meet with residents to get a closer look at their challenges back in august at an annual gathering of central bankers in jackson hole wyoming powell began his speech by observing how the u s economic expansion the longest on record was finally benefiting working people through higher pay and more plentiful job opportunities his speech took some economists by surprise it is almost inconceivable that powell s predecessors would have begun an important talk on monetary policy this way dean baker an economist at the progressive center for economic and policy research later wrote in a column that called powell a labor day hero powell has explicitly made the plight of the poor and working class part of the fed s agenda baker wrote janet yellen powell s immediate predecessor had begun to raise these issues during her tenure at the 2016 jackson hole conference some of yellen s deputies met with members of fed up an organization that advocates for low rates to support economic growth and hiring but stephanie aaronson director of economic studies at the brookings institution and a former fed economist said powell has linked fed policy more explicitly to issues like inequality ben bernanke who preceded yellen as fed chair spoke about economic inequality but his stated remedies were in areas outside the fed s reach like education and job training and in the past when fed officials would meet with community groups they tended to discuss issues that only indirectly help the economically disadvantaged fairness in bank lending for example the fed s current outreach is actually about monetary policy and that does make it really different from the usual types of interactions that the fed has with community groups aaronson said aaronson co authored research this spring that found that a persistently low unemployment rate can significantly narrow employment gaps between whites and african americans and latinos her research also found that the narrowing of that gap accelerated as unemployment fell further j w mason an assistant professor at john jay college said that fed officials haven t often acknowledged that their policies have varying consequences for different socioeconomic groups many economists have long argued for example that when the fed raises rates to try to stop prices from accelerating it risks hindering the kind of robust job market that disproportionately helps disadvantaged workers it s not just about the whole economy mason said it s about who s benefiting it s always been true but people didn t want to acknowledge it in some ways powell has more flexibility than most of his predecessors to keep rates low low inflation makes it easier to hold down borrowing costs and the political environment has changed bernanke and yellen were frequently criticized by republicans in congress for their low rate policies but with president donald trump regularly attacking powell for not cutting rates faster the chairman faces little pressure from capitol hill to reverse course david wilcox a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics and a former top fed staffer noted that as fed chairman alan greenspan took a famous risk in the late 1990s his belief was that an acceleration in worker productivity would allow him to keep rates low and let unemployment fall steeply most economists believe the risk paid off as unemployment fell below 4 without spurring inflation but greenspan never articulated any particular concern about reaching into communities that had been previously hard hit wilcox said that was not a part of greenspan s rhetoric

washington testifying to congress this month federal reserve chair jerome powell sent a message seldom heard from his predecessors that the fed should consider the struggles of the lowest income americans in setting its interest rate policies we want to remind ourselves powell said that prosperity isn t experienced in all communities low and moderate income communities in many cases are just starting to feel the benefits of this expansion it wasn t the first time powell had sounded that theme of late at a news conference in july he noted that pay had begun rising fastest for lower skilled workers a shift from earlier in the economic expansion this underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind he said the notion that the fed should try to sustain the expansion to help the most disadvantaged people might seem self evident but throughout its history the fed whose mandate is to stabilize prices and maximize employment has rarely expressed the need to suit its policies to benefit the least fortunate with the economy expanding for an 11th year and unemployment near a 50 year low most of powell s predecessors would have focused on the threat of high inflation and the possibility of raising rates to forestall it the prevailing belief has been that addressing economic inequality or poverty is the purview of congress not the fed powell still says the fed s main focus is the health of the job market and the stability of prices but as he nears the end of his second year as chairman he has increasingly opened the door to the idea that the fed can also lift up those who still struggle years after an economic expansion has boosted the fortunes of most americans one driver of that change is an outreach effort the fed launched a year ago as part of a review of its financial tools and strategy the outreach has included 14 meetings between fed officials and representatives from labour unions educators and community development groups many participants have told fed officials that despite entrenched poverty in some areas of the country more disadvantaged americans are finally finding jobs and making economic progress on monday in a working class neighbourhood in east hartford connecticut powell and eric rosengren president of boston federal reserve bank will visit a career development program and meet with residents to get a closer look at their challenges back in august at an annual gathering of central bankers in jackson hole wyoming powell began his speech by observing how the u s economic expansion the longest on record was finally benefiting working people through higher pay and more plentiful job opportunities his speech took some economists by surprise it is almost inconceivable that powell s predecessors would have begun an important talk on monetary policy this way dean baker an economist at the progressive center for economic and policy research later wrote in a column that called powell a labour day hero powell has explicitly made the plight of the poor and working class part of the fed s agenda baker wrote janet yellen powell s immediate predecessor had begun to raise these issues during her tenure at the 2016 jackson hole conference some of yellen s deputies met with members of fed up an organization that advocates for low rates to support economic growth and hiring but stephanie aaronson director of economic studies at the brookings institution and a former fed economist said powell has linked fed policy more explicitly to issues like inequality ben bernanke who preceded yellen as fed chair spoke about economic inequality but his stated remedies were in areas outside the fed s reach like education and job training and in the past when fed officials would meet with community groups they tended to discuss issues that only indirectly help the economically disadvantaged fairness in bank lending for example the fed s current outreach is actually about monetary policy and that does make it really different from the usual types of interactions that the fed has with community groups aaronson said aaronson co authored research this spring that found that a persistently low unemployment rate can significantly narrow employment gaps between whites and african americans and latinos her research also found that the narrowing of that gap accelerated as unemployment fell further j w mason an assistant professor at john jay college said that fed officials haven t often acknowledged that their policies have varying consequences for different socioeconomic groups many economists have long argued for example that when the fed raises rates to try to stop prices from accelerating it risks hindering the kind of robust job market that disproportionately helps disadvantaged workers it s not just about the whole economy mason said it s about who s benefiting it s always been true but people didn t want to acknowledge it in some ways powell has more flexibility than most of his predecessors to keep rates low low inflation makes it easier to hold down borrowing costs and the political environment has changed bernanke and yellen were frequently criticized by republicans in congress for their low rate policies but with president donald trump regularly attacking powell for not cutting rates faster the chairman faces little pressure from capitol hill to reverse course david wilcox a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics and a former top fed staffer noted that as fed chairman alan greenspan took a famous risk in the late 1990s his belief was that an acceleration in worker productivity would allow him to keep rates low and let unemployment fall steeply most economists believe the risk paid off as unemployment fell below 4 without spurring inflation but greenspan never articulated any particular concern about reaching into communities that had been previously hard hit wilcox said that was not a part of greenspan s rhetoric christopher rugaber the associated press

reserve chairman jerome powell normally spends his days in the marble halls of washington meeting with senators and fed economists on monday he learned about the job market from an 18 year old named jasmine advertisement a recent high school graduate jasmine ayala explained to powell how she has just landed a good job as a laser operator at aircraft engine manufacturer pratt whitney after graduation she received seven weeks of training backed by a grant from a local nonprofit called east hartford connects it was an amazing opportunity ayala said her exchange with the chairman of the world s most powerful central bank came during a visit powell paid monday to a hardscrabble neighborhood of east hartford the trip included a neighborhood tour and a meeting with residents to get an up front look at their challenges advertisement monday s events are part of an ongoing outreach by the powell fed to representatives of labor unions educators and community development groups many participants have told fed officials that despite entrenched poverty in some areas of the country more disadvantaged americans are finally finding jobs and making economic progress one major reason for that is the existence of training programs like the one that helped ayala since becoming chairman nearly two years ago powell has sent a message seldom heard from his predecessors that the fed should consider the struggles of the lowest income americans in setting its interest rate policies advertisement low interest rates generally help sustain a solid job market which in turn can encourage job training efforts as unemployment has reached a nearly a 50 year low of 3 6 more employers are taking more chances on young people without college degrees and are training them we try to create a strong labor market but for some it s not enough powell said after residents told of vital help they have received from east hartford connects including child support assistance that allowed them to re enter the job market they need to be given a chance the notion that the fed should try to sustain the expansion to help the most disadvantaged people might seem self evident but throughout

most of powell s predecessors would have focused on the threat of high inflation and the possibility of raising rates to forestall it the prevailing belief has been that addressing economic inequality

inflation said tim duy an economist at the university of oregon powell still says the fed s main focus is the health of the job market and the stability of prices but as he nears the end of his second

workers a shift from earlier in the economic expansion this underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind he said the notion that the fed should try to sustain the expansion to help the most disadvantaged people might seem self evident but throughout its history the fed whose mandate is to stabilize prices and maximize employment has rarely expressed the need to suit its policies to benefit the least fortunate with the economy expanding for an 11th year and unemployment near a 50 year low most of powell s predecessors would have focused on the threat of high inflation and the possibility of raising rates to forestall it the prevailing belief has been that addressing economic inequality or poverty is the purview of congress not the fed powell still says the fed s main focus is the health of the job market and the stability of prices but as he nears the end of his second year as chairman he has increasingly opened the door to the idea that the fed can also lift up those who still struggle years after an economic expansion has boosted the fortunes of most americans one driver of that change is an outreach effort the fed launched a year ago as part of a review of its financial tools and strategy the outreach has included 14 meetings between fed officials and representatives from labour unions educators and community development groups many participants have told fed officials that despite entrenched poverty in some areas of the country more disadvantaged americans are finally finding jobs and making economic progress on monday in a working class neighbourhood in east hartford connecticut powell and eric rosengren president of boston federal reserve bank will visit a career development program and meet with residents to get a closer look at their challenges back in august at an annual gathering of central bankers in jackson hole wyoming powell began his speech by observing how the u s economic expansion the longest on record was finally benefiting working people through higher pay and more plentiful job opportunities his speech took some economists by surprise it is almost inconceivable that powell s predecessors would have begun an important talk on monetary policy this way dean baker an economist at the progressive center for economic and policy research later wrote in a column that called powell a labour day hero powell has explicitly made the plight of the poor and working class part of the fed s agenda baker wrote janet yellen powell s immediate predecessor had begun to raise these issues during her tenure at the 2016 jackson hole conference some of yellen s deputies met with members of fed up an organization that advocates for low rates to support economic growth and hiring but stephanie aaronson director of economic studies at the brookings institution and a former fed economist said powell has linked fed policy more explicitly to issues like inequality ben bernanke who preceded yellen as fed chair spoke about economic inequality but his stated remedies were in areas outside the fed s reach like education and job training and in the past when fed officials would meet with community groups they tended to discuss issues that only indirectly help the economically disadvantaged fairness in bank lending for example the fed s current outreach is actually about monetary policy and that does make it really different from the usual types of interactions that the fed has with community groups aaronson said aaronson co authored research this spring that found that a persistently low unemployment rate can significantly narrow employment gaps between whites and african americans and latinos her research also found that the narrowing of that gap accelerated as unemployment fell further j w mason an assistant professor at john jay college said that fed officials haven t often acknowledged that their policies have varying consequences for different socioeconomic groups many economists have long argued for example that when the fed raises rates to try to stop prices from accelerating it risks hindering the kind of robust job market that disproportionately helps disadvantaged workers it s not just about the whole economy mason said it s about who s benefiting it s always been true but people didn t want to acknowledge it in some ways powell has more flexibility than most of his predecessors to keep rates low low inflation makes it easier to hold down borrowing costs and the political environment has changed bernanke and yellen were frequently criticized by republicans in congress for their low rate policies but with president donald trump regularly attacking powell for not cutting rates faster the chairman faces little pressure from capitol hill to reverse course david wilcox a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics and a former top fed staffer noted that as fed chairman alan greenspan took a famous risk in the late 1990s his belief was that an acceleration in worker productivity would allow him to keep rates low and let unemployment fall steeply most economists believe the risk paid off as unemployment fell below 4 without spurring inflation but greenspan never articulated any particular concern about reaching into communities that had been previously hard hit wilcox said that was not a part of greenspan s rhetoric christopher rugaber the associated press
there is no conservative manifesto there is just a boris johnson manifesto as he rollicked round the stage in telford on sunday the prime minister had only one message to the electorate whatever your supposed party loyalty forget it vote me i will promise you anything we both know i don t mean it but you will still love me for it the past week s manifestos mark the effective end of traditional party responsibility in british politics they may not have meant much in the past but they were a sort of conscience for a future government subject to at least a cursory budgetary discipline their degeneration into fiscal promiscuity marks the arrival of raw populism johnson s manifesto is routine except that it can barely be called conservative his silence on nine years of tory government was deafening his manifesto is vaguely blairite contrasting with jeremy corbyn s retro 1970s effort absent are such tory concepts as fiscal responsibility belief in open markets private enterprise and self reliance today s targets are old labour brexit supporters indicated by a remarkable yougov poll indicating that 45 of working class voters intend to vote conservative or johnson against just 31 for labour this result if true represents an upheaval in british politics hence the manifesto s specific items aimed at low earners with a higher start for national insurance contributions and a higher living wage the costly pensions triple lock remains in place as does the winter fuel allowance and energy price cap taxes on struggling small businesses will fall to pay for this johnson recently told the cbi that it could forget its promised cut of 6bn in corporation tax it barely murmured dissent the now ritual splurges tumbled on for new hospitals 20 000 more police millions for first time buyers day care and austerity hit schools johnson could not resist the headline grabbers filling in potholes cutting hospital parking charges reopening patches of long closed railway banning fracking and rescuing small village pubs in a normal democracy these matters belong to local government yet there is to be no relief to butchered local budgets every extra pound will be ringfenced by whitehall so johnson can take personal credit centralism is the essence of populism labour at least had the intellectual courtesy to dream up a few new taxes on the rich for its fantasy generosity the tories offer no indication of where the money is coming from except that it will not come from higher taxes and has been costed which means borrowed paul johnson of the institute for fiscal studies now pops up each night like jiminy cricket to these pinocchios warning of figures not adding up using phrases such as inconceivable and come back to bite us he is a voice from a distant past no one listens in northern ireland johnson was flexible the devious pledge breaker recast as deft pragmatist the new extravagance reflects the fact that across europe austerity is politically bust britain is not alone in moving towards more borrowing and spending but forgotten too is the memory of austerity s predecessor the age of inflation and debt electorates are careless of debt for italy spain hungary and even america low interest rates mean that borrow and spend has lost its terror moody s may downgrade britain s debt from stable to negative but no one cares not even its prime minister johnson s domestic programme is thus warm familiar and mildly leftwing but the populist paradigm demands a chauvinism and xenophobia to outsiders hence we hear that defence must get ever more money aid is no longer sacred immigrants are suspect at home and are to be deterred from abroad if business desperately needs them that is too bad at this point all roads lead back to brexit johnson outrageously maintains that everyone but he is responsible for delay dither and acrimony he knows it was the brexiters who delayed brexit by opposing theresa may s deal he himself withdrew his own withdrawal bill last month after parliament had approved it on second reading he delayed brexit to hold an election his own private second referendum because he thought he would be more likely to win with brexit delayed than with it achieved cynicism is populism s best friend the manifesto implies finality to brexit if johnson wins an overall majority britain should indeed leave the eu formally in the new year but battle will recommence over the subsequent eu trade deal on this the manifesto is depressing it suggests that getting brexit done will unleash britain s potential there is no evidence for this whatever britain was doing fine before brexit as it is a hard brexit will cripple british trade it is a self imposed economic sanction that will take years to mitigate there is no brexit dividend hence hope lies elsewhere that johnson s deal would at least lance the political boil of brexit having asserted its machismo the country may return to its traditional pragmatism in negotiating a new eu trade relationship the manifesto explicitly rejects remaining in the customs union and single market this is very close to no deal yet johnson accepted that this could not apply to northern ireland for the simple reason that it was unworkable it is near to unworkable for britain too in northern ireland johnson was flexible the devious pledge breaker recast as deft pragmatist deep inside he must know he will have to act likewise for britain as a whole it is on johnson the pledge breaking pragmatist that britain must now rely it is a desperate hope but the only one

experts feel the gdp print could be below 5 percent against 5 percent in q2fy20 but there could be recovery in second half of this year especially after government measures gdp is expected to be below the 5 percent it is probable that the forecasted growth of 6 1 percent for fy20 is likely to be downgraded further vinod nair head of research at geojit financial told moneycontrol prabhudas lilladher also said as against gdp growth of 5 percent in q1fy20 we estimate around 4 5 percent growth in q2 and gradual recovery there after among others infrastructure output and government budget value for

resistance at psychological 12 000 mark which has been acting as crucial resistance zone during the week gone by on the weekly scale the index formed doji candle for third consecutive week which indicates a tug of war between bulls and bears while on friday it formed bearish belt hold kind of pattern on daily charts experts expect the index to remain in the above mentioned range in coming week as well and needs decisive close above 12 000 levels which can easily help it surpass earlier record high of 12 103 we would like to reiterate our cautious stance on index the index is not yet out of the woods and the major breakout is still awaited which is placed at its all time high of 12 103 while on the downside 11 800 has been acting as a crucial support one should focus on stock specific action nilesh ramesh jain derivative and technical analyst at anand rathi told moneycontrol however taking a little cautious step won t harm anyone as we all know precaution is better than cure the nifty index is still making higher top high bottom formation thus if the bulls manage to drag the index on their side and push it above its resistance of 12 103 levels then a possibility of an upmove towards 12 300 then 12 450 levels cannot be ruled out he said public issues the subscription for rs 410 crore initial public offering of csb bank will remain opened for two more day and will

inflation target emefiele said monetary policy measures embarked upon by the cbn in the next five years will be geared towards containing inflationary pressures and supporting improved productivity in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors of the economy one of the things the cbn wants to do to achieve its single digit rate target is to work with other stakeholders in the economy to bring down the cost of food items which it said had considerable weight in the consumer price index basket emefiele noted that decisions by the monetary policy committee on inflation and interest rates will be dependent on insights generated from data on key economic variables the cbn said it will continue to sustain a positive interest rate to the delight of its important stakeholders the cbn helmsman made it clear that his ultimate objective was to anchor the public s inflation expectation at single digit in the medium to long run meanwhile central bank said it was not unmindful of the challenges it will have battle with to achieve its target on inflation vis à vis a double digit economic growth emefiele identified the fragile growth of the economy as a major domestic threat to achieving its five year growth target he said the recovery of the economy from recession in 2017 was yet to deliver a significant benefit in terms of job creation and there had not also been a substantial increase in credit to the private sector external factors which pose big threats to achieving economic goals set by the cbn as highlighted by emefiele include the lingering trade war between the united states and china u s and mexico and subdued growth in the eurozone rising volatility in the crude oil market occasioned by the rapid increase in the supply of shale oil by the united states remains a potential hindrance for growth in nigeria
brexit and peak oil the uncertainty of the future of brexit has left the united kingdom s economy in stagnation as business investment falters on the eve of the nation s december general election while boris johnson tries to rally voters to instill their confidence in him to usher in a new era of economic prosperity and growth in britain by way of leaving the european union at any cost the economy is in fact doing just the opposite this is just one of the great ironies of brexit the separatist movement that just can t seem to cut the cord british business investment has fallen 1 1 percent since the june 2016 brexit referendum and analysts warn that it could cause long term damage to the economy according to reporting from al jazeera this week for the sake of comparison over the same period business investment in the other group of seven g7 big industrialised economies has risen 10 percent with the united states posting an increase of 13 percent that being said low confidence in investment sectors and a general air of risk aversion is certainly not limited to great britain the al jazeera report continues the international monetary fund says china us trade tensions are hurting investment globally but brexit uncertainty threatens to turn the uk problem into a crisis the crisis is already beginning as weak investment patterns have already make the uk s economy too at risk for inflation for the central bank to be able to stimulate it by cutting interest rates according to a representative from the bank of england all of this will have major implications for the oil industry in the uk s north sea from the obvious impacts of economic slowdown on the domestic energy sector to the added uncertainty of scotland potentially splitting off from the uk to stay in the european union back in 2014 scotland voted by a thin margin to stay in the uk but the issue has since been complicated by brexit back and forth in the original brexit vote way back in 2016 every single voting district in scotland voted to stay in the eu now the scottish national party is gunning to retake districts it lost in 2017 s snap election by calling for another independence referendum according to reporting by bloomberg businessweek in an article that proclaims in the original brexit vote way back in 2016 every single voting district in scotland voted to stay in the eu now the scottish national party is gunning to retake districts it lost in 2017 s snap election by calling for another independence referendum according to reporting by bloomberg businessweek in an article that proclaims the end of the united kingdom may be nearing what s more hardline brexiteers and johnson supporters have made it clear that the loss of scotland and or northern ireland is a price they are more than willing to pay for secession from the european union click to enlarge if scotland does decide to break away from the uk definitively it would make major waves in the north sea drilling industry pun most definitely intended in the extremely possible scenario of an independent scotland if operating costs or ease become compromised or complicated it is likely that many north sea oil producers would very soon opt to take their business elsewhere back when this concern first surfaced in 2016 ceo of oil and gas company petroplan andrew speers many of the operators and service companies with scottish operations are global by nature and the most important thing is scotland remains an easy and profitable place to do business in the extremely possible scenario of an independent scotland if operating costs or ease become compromised or complicated it is likely that many north sea oil producers would very soon opt to take their business elsewhere back when this concern first surfaced in 2016 ceo of oil and gas company petroplan andrew speers told cnbc that at the same time however there were some experts that speculated that the opposite could be true and that an economic slowdown could ultimately be a boon for uk oil producers thanks to a deflated pound sterling for those in the u k and those producing oil in the u k north sea the weaker u k currency will reduce costs because operating costs are paid in pounds but the product oil is sold in u s dollars ihs energy director spencer welch told cnbc these concerns and hopes are still as valid now as they were in 2016 as brexit still hangs in the bureaucratic balance in august of 2018 oilprice published a report titled what would a hard brexit mean for british oil when deal or no deal was the biggest question in the brexit bulletin the answer to this question in a nutshell was and is that the taxes on international trade that will be brought in swiftly by a no deal brexit will be a huge blow to the region s oilfield services exporters in particular as well as to industrial exports in scotland and the rest of the uk to a slightly lesser degree in particular the subsea technology located in the uk s north east region would be highly impacted there s also a danger of too much demand for skilled workers as the right of eu workers to practice their trades in the uk is only

has raised the prospect of more uncertainty if it wins on december 12 it would try to strike a new exit deal and hold another referendum throwing the brexit question up in the air yet again ultimately the story of brexit is that the more things change the more they stay the same despite all the bluster and upheaval the ousting of theresa may and the raucous rise of boris johnson the yes deal no deal and forced deal proposals brexit remains in much the same place as it was in 2016 when the referendum was first passed and so too does north sea oil when everything is uncertain however it s not exactly business as usual it s business with nagging uncertainty and an air of doubt both of which are ultimately fatal for economic growth with brexit looming the north sea supply chain is only as good as its weakest link the article goes on to say that key factors such as licensing and taxation of oil and gas exploration development and production activities are already uk government responsibilities while the legal and regulatory regime under the petroleum act 1998 is generally regarded as satisfactory while expectations for this year are optimistic the added complication of brexit could impede recovery as a consequence of the downturn the market is now oversupplied except in a few specialised areas what s more with the complexity of modern transnational supply chains nothing is simple and absolutely nothing is isolated this has led to hesitant investment in a great number of uk industries including north sea oil since as the uk s press and journal puts it the article goes on to say that key factors such as licensing and taxation of oil and gas exploration development and production activities are already uk government responsibilities while the legal and regulatory regime under the petroleum act 1998 is generally regarded as satisfactory while expectations for this year are optimistic the added complication of brexit could impede recovery as a consequence of the downturn the market is now oversupplied except in a few specialised areas as long as brexit drama continues uncertainty and a lack of trust in the british economy will continue to fester continuing the cycle of economic downturn and inflation in the uk this means that north sea investors one of the uk s more important economic sectors undoubtedly see the writing on the wall and are already looking for foreign failsafes if they haven t secured them already
washington testifying to congress this month federal reserve chair jerome powell sent a message seldom heard from his predecessors that the fed should consider the struggles of the lowest income americans in setting its interest rate policies we want to remind ourselves powell said that prosperity isn t experienced in all communities low and moderate income communities in many cases are just starting to feel the benefits of this expansion it wasn t the first time powell had sounded that theme of late at a news conference in july he noted that pay had begun rising fastest for lower skilled workers a shift from earlier in the economic expansion this underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind he said the notion that the fed should try to sustain the expansion to help the most disadvantaged people might seem self evident but throughout its history the fed whose mandate is to stabilize prices and maximize employment has rarely expressed the need to suit its policies to benefit the least fortunate with the economy expanding for an 11th year and unemployment near a 50 year low most of powell s predecessors would have focused on the threat of high inflation and the possibility of raising rates to forestall it the prevailing belief has been that addressing economic inequality or poverty is the purview of congress not the fed powell still says the fed s main focus is the health of the job market and the stability of prices but as he nears the end of his second year as chairman he has increasingly opened the door to the idea that the fed can also lift up those who still struggle years after an economic expansion has boosted the fortunes of most americans one driver of that change is an outreach effort the fed launched a year ago as part of a review of its financial tools and strategy the outreach has included 14 meetings between fed officials and representatives from labour unions educators and community development groups many participants have told fed officials that despite entrenched poverty in some areas of the country more disadvantaged americans are finally finding jobs and making economic progress on monday in a working class neighbourhood in east hartford connecticut powell and eric rosengren president of boston federal reserve bank will visit a career development program and meet with residents to get a closer look at their challenges back in august at an annual gathering of central bankers in jackson hole wyoming powell began his speech by observing how the u s economic expansion the longest on record was finally benefiting working people through higher pay and more plentiful job opportunities his speech took some economists by surprise it is almost inconceivable that powell s predecessors would have begun an important talk on monetary policy this way dean baker an economist at the progressive center for economic and policy research later wrote in a column that called powell a labour day hero powell has explicitly made the plight of the poor and working class part of the fed s agenda baker wrote janet yellen powell s immediate predecessor had begun to raise these issues during her tenure at the 2016 jackson hole conference some of yellen s deputies met with members of fed up an organization that advocates for low rates to support economic growth and hiring but stephanie aaronson director of economic studies at the brookings institution and a former fed economist said powell has linked fed policy more explicitly to issues like inequality ben bernanke who preceded yellen as fed chair spoke about economic inequality but his stated remedies were in areas outside the fed s reach like education and job training and in the past when fed officials would meet with community groups they tended to discuss issues that only indirectly help the economically disadvantaged fairness in bank lending for example the fed s current outreach is actually about monetary policy and that does make it really different from the usual types of interactions that the fed has with community groups aaronson said aaronson co authored research this spring that found that a persistently low unemployment rate can significantly narrow employment gaps between whites and african americans and latinos her research also found that the narrowing of that gap accelerated as unemployment fell further j w mason an assistant professor at john jay college said that fed officials haven t often acknowledged that their policies have varying consequences for different socioeconomic groups many economists have long argued for example that when the fed raises rates to try to stop prices from accelerating it risks hindering the kind of robust job market that disproportionately helps disadvantaged workers it s not just about the whole economy mason said it s about who s benefiting it s always been true but people didn t want to acknowledge it in some ways powell has more flexibility than most of his predecessors to keep rates low low inflation makes it easier to hold down borrowing costs and the political environment has changed bernanke and yellen were frequently criticized by republicans in congress for their low rate policies but with president donald trump regularly attacking powell for not cutting rates faster the chairman faces little pressure from capitol hill to reverse course david wilcox a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics and a former top fed staffer noted that as fed chairman alan greenspan took a famous risk in the late 1990s his belief was that an acceleration in worker productivity would allow him to keep rates low and let unemployment fall steeply most economists believe the risk paid off as unemployment fell below 4 without spurring inflation but greenspan never articulated any particular concern about reaching into communities that had been previously hard hit wilcox said that was not a part of greenspan s rhetoric christopher rugaber the associated press
several factions of argentina s bondholders are jostling for influence ahead of restructuring talks with incoming president alberto fernandez as latin america s third largest economy tries to avert a default more than a dozen sources familiar with the process said argentina is once again buckling under the weight of its sovereign debts which total around 100 billion and fernandez needs to urgently agree a deal with creditors to ease the burden and give his government space to try to revive the economy several investors told reuters they are growing increasingly annoyed by a lack of clarity on the plans of the new government which is set to take over on december 10 fernandez has not yet named his economic team or said how he will deal with the debts which have become painfully costly after the collapse of the peso the general frustration is how slow the incoming administration has been to name people and get the ball rolling a source at a large fixed income investor that holds argentine debt said adding that with more clarity things could change fairly quickly fernandez this week told the international monetary fund s imf head kristalina georgieva he has a sustainable plan to meet creditor obligations as well as maintain growth without giving details a media representative for fernandez did not immediately respond to a request for comment on friday a creditor committee of at least 20 members was formed last month as bondholders look for ways to avoid losses which could reach tens of billions of dollars on their holdings a second group is now being assembled led by us based emerging markets focused investment manager gramercy three sources said amid differences over the way forward a third group of mostly hedge funds holding bonds restructured after a prior argentine default was also being brought together sources said gramercy has previous experience in argentina where its distressed debt chief investment officer robert koenigsberger was involved in debt talks in 2009 several bondholders said a range of proposals for bundling creditors were circulating although some said they would rather stick to a larger single group controlling a bigger debt slice the process of organising creditors is still in the early stages and it is not clear how much of argentina s debt each grouping represents at this stage gramercy s proposal which also involves emerging markets investment manager macrosynergy partners has put together a number of possible scenarios three sources familiar with the plans said one of these includes an extension of maturities to ease the pressure on argentina s struggling finances but no write down the group s preferred scenario is to get a five year extension but there is no haircut one of the sources said the imf says that until the new government sets an economic path it cannot decide if private creditor haircuts are needed to keep its 57 billion bailout programme in place in the absence of the whole macroeconomic strategy it is very hard to judge how their operation would lead to a sustainable debt position alejandro werner head of the western hemisphere department at the imf said on wednesday at an event in new york once you have the policy proposals you can judge what kind of debt operation is consistent with those policies he added the last major default by argentina in 2001 tipped the country of 44 million people into years of recession and economic crisis from which it only emerged in 2015 argentine bonds almost 80 per cent of which are denominated in foreign currency were given a small lift by fernandez s comments this week but they are still trading at less than half their face value
labour s plans for britain involve a big increase in the size of the state government spending as a share of national output would rise to 45 and apart from brief spikes in the mid 1970s and during the more recent financial crash it has not reached those levels since the second world war to which the mature response should be so what a glance around the world shows that there are rich developed countries where the state is relatively small and there are rich developed countries where the state is large in democracies voters get the right to choose between the competing models take sweden and the us as examples of the contrasting approaches the scandinavian country population just over 10 million has a state that spends 50 of gross domestic product the united states population 329 million operates with a much smaller state that accounts for 38 of national output the received wisdom particularly among free market economists is that a small state means economic dynamism while a big state means the opposite a sclerosis caused by governments burdening their populations with levels of taxation that stifle enterprise so how do the us and sweden stack up against each other in terms of growth rates there s not been a lot to choose between the two in recent years with both averaging around 2 5 a year in the half decade up to 2018 if anything sweden s growth rate was a tad higher the us has a slight edge when it comes to living standards the average american had an income of 59 928 46 700 in 2017 while sweden s per capita income was 51 405 but the swedes as tends to be the way in europe are prepared to sacrifice income for leisure time they work 1 621 hours a year on average compared to 1 781 hours for the average american what s more the focus on gdp per capita is a bit misleading since it says nothing about the way in which national income is divided up in some countries there is a wide gulf in incomes between those at the top and those at the bottom in others there is a more even split the us falls into the former category sweden into the latter one way of assessing income inequality is through the gini coefficient if income was distributed evenly in a country it would have a gini coefficient of zero if on the other hand one person had all the income its coefficent would be 1 obviously every country is bunched around the middle of this range but sweden is closer to the bottom than the us it has a gini coefficient of 0 27 while the us s is 0 41 big state sweden has a higher unemployment rate than the us 6 3 against 3 9 in 2018 but its employment rate is also higher according to figures from the paris based organisation for economic cooperation and development dating back to 2016 69 4 of americans aged 15 to 64 are in work compared to 76 2 of swedes the two countries have very similar inflation rates of around 2 but there is no evidence that high levels of public spending have impaired sweden s export performance a current account surplus of 1 7 of gdp in 2018 was in contrast to the us s 2 4 of gdp deficit the big economic numbers income per head unemployment inflation and the current account do not provide a complete picture of how successful a country is sweden has a much lower murder rate than the us 1 1 per 100 000 inhabitants against 5 3 and has a much lower incarceration rate 59 per 100 000 people as opposed to 655 per 100 000 in the us swedes live more than four years longer than americans on average when it comes to nobel prize winners the countries have similar records once their differing populations are taken into account 383 for the us and 32 for sweden here though the us has the edge only three of sweden s laureates have come since the turn of the millennium while 130 americans have been awarded during the same period the comparison between these two quite different countries helps to illuminate the debate in the uk apparently the size of the state has no bearing on whether a country is successful or not at a guess not many swedes would want to see their country transformed into small state america sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk this is the right time to have just such a debate about the size of the state because there are factors in britain that are systemically putting upward pressure on spending demographic changes mean all parties need to address the rising costs of an ageing population the bills for the state pension the nhs and social care are all going to increase the climate emergency will require hefty state investment to make the transition to a zero carbon economy but a word of warning sweden has evolved its model gradually whereas labour s plans involve abrupt change the price for a big state is high levels of taxation and it is a price the swedes are prepared to pay overall government revenues are 49 5 of gdp and taxes on the average swedish citizen are substantially higher than they are in the uk the conservative party is going into the election promising both lower taxes and higher spending the labour party says a big state can be paid for by rich individuals and the corporate sector with everybody else tucking into a free lunch there are politicians who want britain to be more like the us and some who favour the swedish approach both are possible what s not possible is to have swedish levels of public spending with american levels of tax

china amidst forever conflicting updates via various media coverage casting minds back to mid week headlines china said it would strive to reach a phase one trade deal with the us in an environment of heavy stocks and government bond yields rebounding from recent slides in a collective consolidation of trends as investors await concrete trade news a focus started to shift from conflicting headlines to china s invitation for face to face talks in china before thanksgiving which left the us dollar in consolidation indeed investors wait to see whether the us administration accepts the invitation before the december 15th u s tariff increase deadline on friday there was an air of relief and the us dollar was firmer not only due to solid us data but there was word that president donald trump said that a deal with china was potentially very close which also boosted risk sentiment on the whole giving a boost to stock futures and risk fx resulting in a down day for gold ending 2 20oz however trump as always gives a two sided case and glimpses of optimism were hindered by an air of caution trump insisted that any deal would have to be weighted in favour of the us after years of trade imbalances with china the dxy was ending friday 0 31 fuelled by not only firm markit pmi data and improved michigan consumer sentiment but technical moves in the fx sphere helped the dollar to catch a bid as well meanwhile an immediate threat for any such acceptance of china s invitation to meet face to face would potentially emanate from washington s reluctance to turn a blind eye to what happens in hong kong united states national security adviser robert o brien warned that while a dal was possible the growing worries that a chinese crackdown on anti government protests in hong kong could further complicate matters on the trade front between the two superpowers and such efforts by both parties to put an end to a prolonged trade war that has undercut global economic growth forecasts on friday president trump commented on the hong kong bill and said that an announcement will come very soon this has the potential to set back any progress of a trade deal into 2020 an immediate threat to risk sentiment today district elections in hong kong will hopefully proceed without violence otherwise we can expect a potential risk off start to the week for trump on friday also said he had told chinese president xi jinping that crushing the hong kong protesters would have a tremendous negative impact on efforts to reach an accord on a more positive note however there have been recent reports that china said it will raise penalties on violations of intellectual property rights in an attempt to address one of the sticking points in trade talks with the us according to a bloomberg article published prior to the open today brexit manifesto and polls in focus gbp positive the other main attraction in global financial markets has been with developments on the brexit front now with just 19 days until the general election and only 69 days until the official brexit deadline prime minister boris johnson and labour party leader jeremy corbyn met last wednesday in asia for a much anticipated televised debate on an itv there was not much of uptake from the markets from a debate that seemed to have resulted in a stalemate besides the tory government clearly ahead in major polls but quite some margin in the end a snap yougov poll suggested the debate was basically a tie with 51 percent of voters calling johnson the winner compared with 49 percent for corbyn in general johnson stayed blinkered on his pledge to get brexit done while attacking the opposition leader corbyn for failing to make clear how he would campaign if there were another referendum corbyn took the opportunity in the first time there had been a one on one matchup between them to attack johnson over the state of the country s public services specifically over the possibility of privatisation of the nhs corbyn this week unveiled his party s 2019 manifesto but it had very little to do with brexit and instead focussed on a general expansion of the role of the state in british public life titled it s time for real change pledging major increases in spending social programs and taxes it also included ambitious plans to fight climate change the main takeaway for markets is that the manifesto highlights in a pledge to get brexit sorted in six months by ditching johnson s withdrawal agreement instead labour wants to negotiate a new one that includes a much closer future relationship with europe including a customs agreement this would spell a new referendum but crucially corbyn is still too vague as to whether his party will campaign for leave or remain a regular yougov poll also reveals today that labour s manifesto launch last week when mr corbyn set out a series of eye wateringly expensive spending plans has failed to move the dial with the public meanwhile uk pm boris johnson unveiled the tory party s manifesto which focused on moving on from brexit and austerity and to open a new chapter for uk including 33 9bn for nhs and 50 000 more nurses while freezing taxes for five years a plus

chile has been forced into economic concessions after protests partly fueled by a privatised pension system delivering low and often delayed payouts photo ap comment after witnessing an epidemic of speculative fervor the great scientist isaac newton 1642 1726 concluded he could calculate the motion of heavenly bodies but not the madness of people had newton observed new zealand under the fourth labour government when all business caution was abandoned and speculative fervor raged he would have drawn the same conclusion in neoliberal mythology new zealand was a decrepit socialist state on the brink of economic collapse in 1984 that claim is absurd read more nz superannuation unaffordable expert brian gaynor why aussies are winning the retirement race the superannuation fund has divested almost 20m from seven gun producing companies diana clement beware the pitfalls of nz super sooner rather than later in 1984 new zealand switched from a mixed economy to neoliberalism neoliberals worldwide applauded neoliberalism prescribes small government and unregulated untrammeled market forces as inherently conducive to prosperity and social progress hence the removal of all regulatory and legal safeguards to free up the economy for example food safety regulations mine inspectors building codes consumer protection legislation and financial market supervision are all slammed as soviet style infringements on capitalist freedom neoliberals detest affirmative public action or state intervention to rectify market failure against this background the claim persists that all new zealanders particularly superannuitants would now be vastly better off had the kirk government s superannuation fund and compulsory superannuation continued that claim is totally implausible most would have been lost to post 1984 speculative excesses governments can run superannuation schemes far more effectively and efficiently than the private sector sir robert muldoon s national superannuation scheme paid out of national income guarantees every new zealander lifetime retirement income security adequacy and certainty something privatised superannuation simply cannot do the present chilean situation is instructive there are massive violent protests in chile against privatised superannuation as the superior outcomes originally promised from privatisation have not materialised sound familiar in 1981 chile replaced its public pension with a privatised defined contribution superannuation model based on individual retirement accounts managed by private administrators initially chile s new privatised pension system appeared highly successful it increased national savings economic growth employment and boosted capital markets the world bank imf and the oecd applauded but the adverse effects of inferior policy choices can often take decades to show up chile s economy just one third larger than new zealand s is shared by 18 million people hence its per capita income and wages are exceedingly low the chilean superannuation model requires all workers to contribute 10 per cent of wages to the scheme so far accumulated savings exceed 200 billion or 70 per cent of national income chile s retirees were originally promised a 70 per cent replacement rate of final salary but chile s economy has a high share of informal labour not covered by the private pension system as a result chilean workers now receive on average a 38 per cent replacement rate women have been hit hard their replacement rate is a miserly 28 per cent in other words the average pension in chile is far lower than the income of the minimum wage of a very low wage nation and those outside the labour market fare even worse the world bank now concedes the administration costs of chile s privatised pension system absorb between a quarter to one third of all individual retirement accounts the end result is that after administration costs contribution gaps and inflation chile s pensioners are left with a pittance millions now face old age misery hence massive unrest and calls for the nationalisation of its once vaunted privatised pension model by contrast the administration costs of the united states social security administration s public pensions are below 1 per cent of budget 99 per cent is paid directly to retirees the administration of australia s compulsory superannuation exceeds 20 billion a year or 700 billion since inception the australian pension system is extraordinarily complex highly segmented subject to frequent change and has not entirely eliminated poverty among their elderly new zealand s superannuitants unlike pensioners in chile and australia need not be concerned about longevity risk outliving savings excessive fees inequity under performing investments contribution gaps inflation or stock and capital markets volatility national superannuation sees to that accordingly the claim that all new zealanders would now be vastly better off with compulsory superannuation is just nonsense on stilts john gascoigne is a cambridge based economic commentator
in september and october an uprising swept through ecuador and chile while elections in argentina uruguay and bolivia resulted in the left coming to power these events signalled the return of the left to the forefront of the history of the caribbean and latin america at the end of this process havana cuba hosted the anti imperialist solidarity conference for democracy and against neoliberalism venezuela s president nicolas maduro laid out the three fronts for the revival of the left in the continent first there is the bolivarian alliance for the peoples of our america alba with cuba venezuela and nicaragua at the centre these are countries that withstood the adverse current of the past decade second in two major latin american countries mexico and argentina left leaning governments have returned to power while in two smaller countries bolivia and uruguay the left has maintained its electoral advantage third a new front has opened up on the streets of brazil ecuador colombia haiti and chile with people s mobilisation and people s movement in full display maduro said while the united states blamed cuba and venezuela for these uprisings it is the international monetary fund that is the only one to be blamed together with its neoliberal allies the ones being blamed those on the streets are searching for alternatives against the wild neoliberal policies that create hunger and misery maduro stood beside cuba s raul castro and miguel díaz canel at the conference his body language suggested confidence intense u s pressure to overthrow the venezuelan government has now dissipated venezuela cuba and nicaragua have thus far defeated attempts to overthrow their governments in fact u s national security adviser john bolton the architect of president donald trump s policy to overthrow the troika of tyranny has himself been fired surrounded by a revived left it is not maduro who has lost power it is the u s and its bloc that appear to be on the back foot a week after the havana conference brazil s judiciary was forced to release its imprisoned former president luiz inacio lula da silva who had spent 580 days in jail his release sparked enthusiasm in the region a sign that the champion of brazil s left was back on the streets lula immediately took to the streets lifted on the heads of his supporters in sao paulo the free lula campaign had become a key part of the political world of latin america s left and his release has given it immense buoyancy a few days after lula s release on november 8 a near coup was averted in bolivia the re election of evo morales in the october 20 presidential election was challenged by the country s oligarchy which had seeded protests in the main cities against the election the police joined these protests and the threat of a coup hung heavy over the country morales bolivia s first indigenous president who came to power in 2006 and won two successive elections seemed to have survived because the military initially declined to intervene in the political clash but on november 10 morales resigned and agreed to a fresh election and the setting up of a new election monitoring board by congress on november 12 morales facing threats to his life sought asylum and arrived in mexico city the sheer violence that the oligarchy visited upon indigenous leaders in the days when the coup seemed imminent suggests what they are capable of if morales is removed from power the memory of this violence will likely mobilise more people to the election whenever it takes place to re elect morales movement for socialism resilience when hugo chavez won a landmark election in venezuela in 1999 his victory was followed by election victories for the left in one country after another the phrase used to describe this phenomenon was the pink tide or marea rosa the alternative phrase used to describe the electoral wave was the turn to the left or giro a la izquierda this is a less elegant name but is far more accurate the turn to the left went deeper as each of these left governments hastily took advantage of high commodity prices to fight against deep problems of poverty the governments did not all share the same kind of radicalism but they nonetheless followed similar policies when it came to poverty alleviation venezuela s government devolved power to the poor through about 30 missions to tackle hunger illiteracy health housing indigenous rights and so on lula started a series of redistribution schemes such as fome zero zero hunger to provide the much needed food to the hungry in both venezuela and brazil despite the differences poverty and hunger rates declined significantly by 2015 for various reasons the turn to the left saw the defeat of several progressive governments and a return to the right it appeared as if the pink tide had receded fully and now the right would take back power but this was a faulty diagnosis looking only at the election results and not at the resilience of the political and social movements which continued their work in preparation for a return of the left the energy levels in the encampments of the landless workers movement mst in brazil did not abate after the inauguration of neo fascist jair bolsonaro as the president of the country on january 1 2019 we will keep fighting said one mst activist after another none seemed gloomy we emerged during the time of the dictatorship mst leader joao pedro stedile told this writer early this year this situation is difficult but our task is clear defeat the right wing and build our own strength these were brave words bolsonaro had just called the mst terrorists and said chillingly that they should be treated with bullets in the amazon where mining and agrobusiness conglomerates are eager to be dominant violence picked up speedily leaders of the landless and anti dam activists felt the hard edge of steel murders and intimidation became a daily reality nonetheless the mood in the encampments and settlements remained defiant we will keep fighting was their motto further south earlier this year massive protests took place in argentina both to fight for legal abortion and to battle the imf deal struck by the right wing president mauricio macri carrying the trademark green kerchief feminists took to the squares of argentina to argue against the cruel conservatism represented by macri on other days the same people held signs against austerity bitter about what they called the macrisis that devastated the livelihoods of ordinary people hunger had risen in argentina which is what provoked protests for an emergency bill to provide food to people members of the left front patria grande smiled when i asked them about their resilience we are fighting daily said manuel bertoldi of patria grande as we walked along the streets of buenos aires at the top of south america the political situation in colombia appeared fraught the left wing guerrilla group the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc had come to the government with the offer of a truce in 2016 complex negotiations took place in havana which ended with a way forward for peace but in a contentious election in which the right wing fought against the peace process the agreement was not accepted by the majority of the colombian population the right wing pushed by president ivan duque s camp began to intimidate and kill former farc fighters who entered the above ground political domain by the summer of 2019 between 289 government figures and 738 indepaz numbers ex fighters were killed by right wing militias kelly martinez who lives in the tierra grata reintegration camp told reuters our only weapons now are our words and that s how we are going to continue from one end of latin america and the caribbean to another despite defeats at the ballot box and despite what appeared to be the erosion of the left wing process that began with the election victory of chavez in 1999 the struggles continued undaunted and it is these struggles that have now borne fruit elections in the past month have brought the left back to power while protests on the streets have shifted the balance of forces in countries where elections are not due in all these countries the focus of attention is not merely on the largely incompetent right leaning governments but the policies that are made in washington by the u s government and the various multilateral organisations whose agenda is dictated by the u s treasury department for good reason the protests in ecuador and chile could be called imf riots while the elections in argentina and colombia could be called imf elections hybrid war in 2017 as the right wing wave swept across the american hemisphere representatives of 12 countries met in lima peru to form a bloc the purpose of the lima group was to overthrow the maduro government in venezuela the u s had tried to end the bolivarian revolution almost as soon as it had begun in 1999 a coup d etat failed in 2002 but this did not deter washington however the chaos caused by the u s wars in afghanistan and iraq deflected attention elsewhere and the pink tide in the caribbean and latin america prevented a full scale attack on venezuela by 2017 almost 20 years into the bolivarian revolution venezuela seemed an easier target reduced commodity prices produced economic problems for the country and a series of right wing governments were now present around the region the coup in honduras in 2009 began a process that brought right leaning governments to power in most of the countries that went to lima including argentina brazil and mexico the largest and most important countries in that group canada with significant mining interests in venezuela led the group on behalf of the u s diplomatic isolation came first followed rapidly by economic isolation led by harsh u s sanctions venezuela already struggling from low commodity prices saw its economy go into a tailspin the point of the lima group and the u s intervention was to create a social disaster in venezuela u s officials openly talked about using the full range of hybrid war techniques to create chaos in venezuela in 2018 the former u s ambassador to venezuela william brownfield said that the u s multilateral organisations and the lima group should accelerate the collapse of venezuela we should do it he said understanding that it s going to have an impact on millions and millions of people who are already having great difficulty finding enough to eat on the basis of this cruel judgment the various right wing governments in the region hardened their blockade on venezuela it was clear to the u s that if it could overthrow the bolivarian revolution in venezuela it could weaken cuba and force the collapse of the cuban revolution in january 2019 the u s attempted an open coup against the maduro government it set up a pretender government led by juan guaido a minor legislator and used every means including sabotage to weaken the government create social disorder fracture the bolivarian support base and erode the government s authority this hybrid war struck hard with venezuela finding its gold reserves in the united kingdom stolen its ability to use international financial channels closed and its facilities to sell oil sealed an almost total embargo of the country and its 32 million people went into place a report by the centre for economic and policy research found that from august 2017 trump s sanctions had killed at least 40 000 people and reduced the availability of food and medicines these sanctions which remain in effect prevent 80 000 people with hiv from obtaining anti retroviral drugs 16 000 people from getting regular dialysis 16 000 with cancer from getting treatment and four million people with diabetes and hypertension from getting insulin and cardiovascular medicines the social impact of these sanctions has been catastrophic yet the government did not fall in fact rally upon rally of the people on the streets of the main cities suggested that popular support from the working class the peasantry and the urban poor seemed to be with the government frustration led the u s and its asset guaido to attempt a military coup in april 2019 this failed maduro remained in power venezuela s economy remains fragile and its social life has been deeply impacted by sanctions yet the political commitment of a large part of the population to remain with the government is clear the hybrid war against venezuela did not succeed the determination of the bolivarian revolution to stand its ground provided an inspiration on the continent it is important to recognise that from mexico to chile there has been a clear sighted understanding that the u s hybrid war on venezuela was not for human rights or democracy but to expand its imperial interests the defeat of the u s in venezuela provided the confidence across the region to deepen the struggle not only against the tentacles of the u s and the imf but also against local oligarchies anti imf riots even if it looked like the pink tide or the turn to the left had abated protests and mobilisations against the policies of the imf and the far right never stopped whether it was students of chile who fought against the rise of university fees from 2015 or the indigenous communities of ecuador who fought against environmental devastation protests shaped the political world of south america when these small protests manifested themselves in much larger forms in chile and ecuador the pace of history speeded up the situation seemed almost revolutionary in chile it began following a hike in metro fares in ecuador the scrapping of fuel subsidy by the lenin morena government sparked protests but in both cases it was actually a much broader rebellion against the austerity budgets of the imf and against the corrupt political class that seemed more beholden to the u s treasury department than to their own citizens young people took the lead in both countries although in both ecuador and chile the question of the indigenous communities framed the uprisings in ecuador matters are simpler since the spine of the left is formed around the indigenous communities and their political organisations they along with student organisations and trade unions took the lead in the fight in chile at a major manifestation in plaza italia in santiago protesters flew a flag of the mapuche on top of a statue for generations organisations of the mapuche have fought for dignity and for their rights as workers recently the chilean state used anti terror ordinances to go after mapuche leaders such as machi francisca lincona the centrality of the indigenous communities in these uprisings is not surprising indigenous communities played an important role in the pink tide not only in bolivia which is a majority indigenous society but also in venezuela the uprisings disoriented the governments of lenin moreno ecuador and sebastian pinera chile and so these right wing governments which were called upon to resign by protesters were forced to concede the demands from the streets what impact this will have on washington is to be seen the u s treasury department and the imf set certain parameters so that they are followed to the letter there is no room for negotiation with the streets already the governments in ecuador and chile sent out their well armed police and paramilitary forces tear gas came alongside saccharine concessions it is the tear gas that will likely have the greater impact but moreno and pinera know that it is not going to be easy to keep their streets clear the cascading protests have created an expectation in both countries it will be hard to entirely ignore the energetic population imf elections washington did not want evo morales to be re elected he has been a symbol for the underdog in latin america both morales and maduro are working class men who have governed under immense pressure from washington this has earned morales respect but more than that during his three terms in office from 2006 morales managed to tackle historical inequalities that go back to 1542 when the spanish conquistadors overthrew the inca empire pressure on the streets to deny morales the electoral mandate he got in the october election forced him to resign on november 10 at one level there is confusion why are protests in chile and ecuador not the same as protests in bolivia people are on the streets people are making demands yet the politics of the situation is utterly different in chile and ecuador the working class the urban poor students and the indigenous are on the streets to expand the mandate of democracy in bolivia it is the middle class that is on the streets to curtail the democratisation process inaugurated by the people in 2006 this class difference produces a variety of reactions to the protests washington backs the people on the streets in bolivia but not those in chile and ecuador the left backs the people in chile and ecuador but not the middle class protesters in bolivia it is this that defines the attitude towards these countries and not a simple support of protest for protest s sake argentina s voters roundly rejected their incumbent president mauricio macri his return to the imf for a massive 57 billion loan was his downfall this has put argentina against the ropes even the winners alberto fernandez and cristina fernandez kirchner concede that they will face serious challenges in the years ahead but nonetheless they benefited from a massive anti imf surge the victory of their slate front for everyone has turned the eyes from across the region towards buenos aires their creativity in government will further embolden others in the region to recover hope in the possibility of a new pink tide it is improbable to imagine that in colombia shudders of the new pink tide might find a place colombia s right wing government had pushed aside the 2016 peace deal with the farc and it had played a leading even volatile role in the hybrid war against venezuela nonetheless in the local and regional elections on october 29 elements of the left broke through to win key mayoralties a former farc commander guillermo torres known as julian conrado in the farc won the seat in the town of turbaco not far from cartagena but even more dramatically claudia lopez of the alianza verde green party is the new mayor of bogota colombia s capital claudia lopez is the first woman to hold this post and the first openly gay mayor as well in the country s second largest city medellin the new feminist political movement estamos listas we re ready won its first city council seat with the victory of dora saldarriaga a lawyer and professor in the town of silvia cauca mercedes tunubala velasco won the mayor s post she comes from the misak indigenous community and is not only the first woman in this post but also the first person from an indigenous community whether in argentina or in colombia the fight against machismo and the machistas has played a major role in consolidating the pole of the left this is so even in venezuela and brazil where thousands of women form the most important pillars of the progressive and left movements whether it be the mayor of caracas venezuela erika farias pena or the youngest legislator to ever be elected in argentina ofelia fernandez powerful women form an important part of the left and they have put the question of machismo at the centre of discussions leaders such as mercedes tunubala velasco of colombia and milagro sala of argentina have made it impossible to set aside the indigenous question from the politics of this resurgent left these women do not see feminist or indigenous concerns as identity issues fissures of discontent that should be met in a fragmentary way ofelia fernandez of patria grande and the front for everyone does not want to define her politics narrowly she wanted to make it clear to me when i interviewed her in buenos aires that feminism must take up all the social issues from a feminist perspective not allow itself to be restricted to women s issues which are themselves she pointed out everyone s issues in the poorer parts of argentina organisations have emerged to fight against the outcome of the crisis hunger is a serious issue with special emphasis on the hunger of children most of the leaders of these popular organisations ofelia fernandez said were women their fight around the economy of care and against austerity must also be seen as a feminist fight the fight against hunger she said was also feminism that is the stance of this newly resurgent pink tide this new turn to the left

us china trade and brexit headlines were the markets main focus hong kong and uk leader manifestos garner immediate market attention in a 16 month tariff war markets are looking for a so called phase one trade deal between the us and china amidst forever conflicting updates via various media coverage casting minds back to mid week headlines china said it would strive to reach a phase one trade deal with the us in an environment of heavy stocks and government bond yields rebounding from recent slides in a collective consolidation of trends as investors await concrete trade news a focus started to shift from conflicting headlines to china s invitation for face to face talks in china before thanksgiving which left the us dollar in consolidation indeed investors wait to see whether the us administration accepts the invitation before the december 15th u s tariff increase deadline on friday there was an air of relief and the us dollar was firmer not only due to solid us data but there was word that president donald trump said that a deal with china was potentially very close which also boosted risk sentiment on the whole giving a boost to stock futures and risk fx resulting in a down day for gold ending 2 20oz however trump as always gives a two sided case and glimpses of optimism were hindered by an air of caution trump insisted that any deal would have to be weighted in favour of the us after years of trade imbalances with china the dxy was ending friday 0 31 fuelled by not only firm markit pmi data and improved michigan consumer sentiment but technical moves in the fx sphere helped the dollar to catch a bid as well meanwhile an immediate threat for any such acceptance of china s invitation to meet face to face would potentially emanate from washington s reluctance to turn a blind eye to what happens in hong kong united states national security adviser robert o brien warned that while a dal was possible the growing worries that a chinese crackdown on anti government protests in hong kong could further complicate matters on the trade front between the two superpowers and such efforts by both parties to put an end to a prolonged trade war that has undercut global economic growth forecasts on friday president trump commented on the hong kong bill and said that an announcement will come very soon this has the potential to set back any progress of a trade deal into 2020 an immediate threat to risk sentiment today district elections in hong kong will hopefully proceed without violence otherwise we can expect a potential risk off start to the week for trump on friday also said he had told chinese president xi jinping that crushing the hong kong protesters would have a tremendous negative impact on efforts to reach an accord on a more positive note however there have been recent reports that china said it will raise penalties on violations of intellectual property rights in an attempt to address one of the sticking points in trade talks with the us according to a bloomberg article published prior to the open today brexit manifesto and polls in focus gbp positive the other main attraction in global financial markets has been with developments on the brexit front now with just 19 days until the general election and only 69 days until the official brexit deadline prime minister boris johnson and labour party leader jeremy corbyn met last wednesday in asia for a much anticipated televised debate on an itv there was not much of uptake from the markets from a debate that seemed to have resulted in a stalemate besides the tory government clearly ahead in major polls but quite some margin in the end a snap yougov poll suggested the debate was basically a tie with 51 percent of voters calling johnson the winner compared with 49 percent for corbyn in general johnson stayed blinkered on his pledge to get brexit done while attacking the opposition leader corbyn for failing to make clear how he would campaign if there were another referendum corbyn took the opportunity in the first time there had been a one on one matchup between them to attack johnson over the state of the country s public services specifically over the possibility of privatisation of the nhs corbyn this week unveiled his party s 2019 manifesto but it had very little to do with brexit and instead focussed on a general expansion of the role of the state in british public life titled it s time for real change pledging major increases in spending social programs and taxes it also included ambitious plans to fight climate change the main takeaway for markets is that the manifesto highlights in a pledge to get brexit sorted in six months by ditching johnson s withdrawal agreement instead labour wants to negotiate a new one that includes a much closer future relationship with europe including a customs agreement this would spell a new referendum but crucially corbyn is still too vague as to whether his party will campaign for leave or remain a regular yougov poll also reveals today that labour s manifesto launch last week when mr corbyn set out a series of eye wateringly expensive spending plans has failed to move the dial with the public meanwhile uk pm boris johnson unveiled the tory party s manifesto which focused on moving on from brexit and austerity and to open a new chapter for uk including 33 9bn for nhs and 50 000 more nurses while freezing taxes for five years a plus for gbp at the start of this week will come in a new analysis by datapraxis of 270 000 voter interviews conducted by yougov which has predicted the conservatives will win 349 seats on december 12 a brutal blow for labour with jeremy corbyn s party set to lose 30 seats and potentially end up with just 213 mps gbp has been trading between a swing high of 1 3012 printed on 21st october tory party polled to win elections get brexit deal done and 1 2768 printed on 8th november due to the dovish twist seen in the boe s monetary policy announcement with two mpc members voted for a rate cut at this juncture below the 21 day moving average the pair is en route to the 200 4 hour moving average that guards the bottom of the channel a level in the 1 2760s from which channel traders would look for bulls to commit and expect a correction back to the upside a glimpse at scheduled events for the week ahead looking ahead for the week for the north americas there will be a major focus on canadian real gdp us pce and durable goods from europe eurozone hicp and the uk election campaign including the post manifesto polling
another important dispatch from the greanville post be sure to share it widely the bri also called the new silk road is based on a 2 100 year old trade route between the middle east and eastern asia called the silk road it wound its ways across the huge landmass of eurasia to the easternmost parts of china it favored trading based on the taoist philosophy of harmony and peaceful coexistence trading in the original sense of the term an exchange with win win outcomes both partners benefitting equally today in the western world we have lost this concept the terms of trade are imposed always by the stronger partner the west versus the poorer south the south where most of the natural resources are lodged mother earth s assets have been and are coveted by the west or north for building and maintaining a lifestyle in luxury abundance and waste this trend has lasted for centuries of western colonialism exploitation loot enslavement and rape of entire peoples of the global south by the global north to use the current soothing world bank lingo the new silk road or bri is chinese president xi jinping s brainchild it s based on the same ancient principles adjusted to the 21st century building bridges between peoples exchanging goods research education knowledge cultural wisdom peacefully harmoniously and win win style on 7 september 2013 xi presented bri at kazakhstan s nazarbayev university he spoke about people to people friendship and creating a better future he referred to the ancient silk road of more than 2 100 years ago that flourished during china s western han dynasty 206 bc to 24 ad referring to this epoch of more than two millenniums back xi jinping pointed to the history of exchanges under the ancient silk road saying they had proven that countries with differences in race belief and cultural background can absolutely share peace and development as long as they persist in unity and mutual trust equality and mutual benefit mutual tolerance and learning from each other as well as cooperation and win win outcomes president xi s vision may be shaping the world of the 21st century the belt and road initiative is designed and modeled loosely according to the ancient silk road president xi launched this ground breaking project soon after assuming the presidency in 2013 the endeavor s idea is to connect the world with transport routes infrastructure industrial joint ventures teaching and research institutions cultural exchange and much more since 2017 enshrined in china s constitution bri has become the flagship for china s foreign policy bri is literally building bridges and connecting people of different continents and nations the purpose of the new silk road is to construct a unified large market and make full use of both international and domestic markets through cultural exchange and integration to enhance mutual understanding and trust of member nations ending up in an innovative pattern with capital inflows talent pool and technology database bri is a perfect vehicle for building peacefully a world community with a shared future for mankind which was the theme of an international forum held in shanghai from 5 7 november a tribute to china s 70th anniversary of her revolution and achievements with a vision into the future bri is a global development strategy adopted by the chinese government already today bri has investments involving more than 150 countries and international organizations and growing in asia africa europe the middle east and the americas bri is a multi trillion investment scheme for transport routes on land and sea as well as construction of industrial and energy infrastructure and energy exploration as well as trade among connected countries unlike wto world trade organization bri is encouraging nations to benefit from their comparative advantages creating win win situations in essence bri is to develop mutual understanding and trust among member nations allowing for free capital flows a pool of experts and access to a bri based technology data base at present bri s closing date is foreseen for 2049 which coincides with new china s 100th anniversary the size and likely success of the program indicates however already today that it will most probably be extended way beyond that date it is worth noting though that only in 2019 six years after its inception bri has become a news item in the west remarkably for six years bri was as much as denied or ignored by the western media in the hope it may go away but away it didn t go to the contrary many european union members have already subscribed to bri including greece italy france portugal and more will follow as the temptation to participate in this projected socioeconomic boom is overwhelming germany the supposed economic leader of europe is mulling over the benefits and contras of participating in bri the german business community like business throughout europe is strongly in favor of lifting us imposed sanctions and reconnecting with the east in particular with china and russia but official berlin is still with one foot in the white house and with the other trying to appease the german and european world of business this balancing act is in the long run not sustainable and certainly not desirable at present bri is already actively involved in over 80 countries including at least half of the eu members to counteract the pressure to join bri the european union basically run by nato and intimately linked to washington has initiated their own silk road attempting to connect asia with europe through japan in that sense the eu and japan have signed a free trade agreement which includes a compact to build infrastructure in sectors such as energy transport and digital devices the purpose is to strengthen economic and cultural ties between the two regions boosting business relations between asia and europa it is an obvious effort to compete with or even sideline china s bri but it is equally obvious that this response will fail usually initiatives taken in ill faith are not successful and china non belligerent china is unlikely to challenge this eu japan competitive approach in another approach to counter bri the u s overseas private investment corporation opic australia s department of foreign affairs and trade dfat and japan bank for international cooperation jbic launched on 4 november the blue dot network bdn an initiative supposedly run entirely by private actors funded by private banking intended to bring together governments the private sector and civil society to promote high quality trusted standards for global infrastructure development in an open and inclusive framework it is not clear how the bdn will interact with or counteract bri anything run entirely by the private sector especially western private banking is no good omen for the country their development effort touches such investments objectives are primarily shareholder profits not socioeconomic development benefitting the countries where they plan to invest no competition for china s bri again non aggressive china is unlikely to react china s new silk road is creating a multipolar world where all participants will benefit the idea is to encourage economic growth distributed in a balanced way so as to prioritize development opportunities for those most in need that means the under developed areas of western china eastern russia central asia central europe reaching out to africa and the middle east latin america as well as to south east asia and the pacific bri is already actively building and planning some six to ten land and maritime routes connecting africa the middle east europe and south america the expected multi trillion dollar equivalent dynamic budget is expected to be funded by china largely but not exclusively by the asian infrastructure and investment bank aiib by russia and by all the countries that are part of bri and involved in singular or multi country projects the long term return on these massive investments in people s wellbeing is an exponential multiple of the original investments and cannot be limited to numerical economics as social benefits of wellbeing cannot be defined by linear accounting implementing bri or the new silk road is itself the realization of a vision of nations peaceful interconnectivity joint infrastructure and industrial development as well as joint management of natural resources for example bri may help with infrastructure and management advice resolving or preventing conflicts on transboundary water resources there are some 263 transboundary lake and river basins covering almost half the earth s surface and involving some 150 countries in addition there are about 300 transboundary aquifers serving about 2 billion people who depend on groundwater the chinese government calls the silk road initiative a bid to enhance regional connectivity and embrace a brighter future today john lennon s give peace a chance is more relevant than ever and china is a vanguard in promoting peaceful development across the globe bri china s foreign policy flagship is clearly an initiative towards world peace this is an article by senior contributing editor peter koenig

as an elite group of business and political leaders gathered in beijing last week to discuss global solutions to issues ranging from climate change to income inequality one question lingered in the background is globalisation which has helped fuel unprecedented growth in china over the past two decades still viable in its current form charlene barshefsky former us trade representative and a partner at the law firm wilmerhale said beijing s relationship with the west has reached an inflection point as china has become a more able competitor on the world stage the west s response is feeble the us retreats from global leadership global long term vision imposes protectionist tariffs and fails to invest in domestic infrastructure or its people and then blames china barshefsky said during a panel discussion at the forum on thursday technical shifts may de escalate tension in the short term but will not resolve fundamental differences which can no longer be papered over today s complexity will require a more credible and much more realistic effective framework for east west relations the global gathering which started on wednesday featured luminaries such as former us secretary of state henry kissinger wang xing the co founder of china s meituan dianping and bill gates the co founder of microsoft and the co chairman of the bill melinda gates foundation chief executives from many of the world s biggest banks including credit suisse goldman sachs hsbc standard chartered and ubs spoke at or attended the three day event the forum co hosted by the china center for international economic exchanges was in mainland china for the first time this year after being forced to move to singapore last year because of a scheduling conflict with a prominent trade expo in china bloomberg himself was originally supposed to host this year s conference but the billionaire founder of the news and financial data company that bears his name has begun exploring in recent weeks a bid to enter the race for the democratic nomination for president in 2020 as the field has shifted to more populist less business friendly positions story continues it is pretty clear that the old western driven models of globalisation need to change in part because it is not working in western societies but also because china isn t aligned with it said ian bremmer president of eurasia group the political risk analysis and consulting group speaking at the forum on thursday china s vice president wang qishan said the international order was under attack because of protectionism and populism he called for the abandonment of a cold war mentality in international relations tai hui asia chief market strategist at jpmorgan asset management said the path of globalisation has been more rocky for some time but it is not doomed as business continues to recognise the benefits of free trade businesses have to be more mindful of these geopolitical factors in planning their investments he said in the near term these uncertainties have dampened corporate spending yet in the longer run we think multinational companies will be more focused on diversifying their production base arguably this pushes for more globalisation not less the conference took place against the backdrop of a trade war that has raged between the united states and china for well over a year the trade dispute has weighed on global growth and stunted future business investment as the world s two biggest economies have placed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other s goods for example sonos the high end speaker maker warned on thursday it expects its fiscal 2020 pre tax profit to take a us 30 million hit because of tariffs introduced on september 1 and had accelerated a shift of its supply chain to malaysia as a result us president donald trump announced last month that the two sides had reached a substantial phase one deal but no agreement has been signed as disagreements continue over whether the us will rescind tariffs and chinese commitments to buying american agricultural products and increasing intellectual property protections if we don t make a deal with china i ll just raise the tariffs even higher trump told reporters on tuesday at the same time there have been increasing calls among american politicians to limit the ability of chinese companies to list in the us and restrict american pension funds from investing in chinese firms former us treasury secretary henry paulson said a forced decoupling would risk isolating the us or china from the rest of the world if you disconnect from others you can certainly insulate yourself from some risks but frankly you don t end up stronger and you create other risks in the process paulson said in a keynote address at the forum that s why it should concern every one of us who cares about the state of the global economy that the positive sum metaphors of healthy economic competition are giving way to the zero sum metaphors of military competition and those zero sum notions appropriate to the battlefield but not always to the marketplace are now driving tangible economic policies and meaningful real world choices james mccormack head of sovereigns at fitch ratings said the rise of trade protectionism has come hand in hand with a distinct slowing of global capital flows fitch expects the trend that began in 2019 of declining foreign investment outflows from the largest developed countries will continue into 2020 mccormack said in a research note on wednesday when companies are investing less at home due to economic uncertainty investing abroad can be even less compelling this is especially the case if the economic uncertainty is derived from trade protectionism so that investment assets abroad could be trapped behind tariff barriers that diminish their value that will affect growth and be a negative development for emerging markets he said trade tensions are rising around the world resulting in a dramatic spike in import restrictive measures said coleman nee senior economist at the world trade organisation s economic research and statistics division john woods chief investment officer for asia pacific at credit suisse said increasing protectionism has been a policy response by the us in reaction to the rise of china the tensions are likely to endure but the policy response might not he said nevertheless with the protectionism genie out of the bottle and current reality businesses and markets will have to continue to contend with this as a real risk woods said parang khanna managing partner of the singapore based consulting firm futuremap said the regional component of globalisation is becoming much stronger between asian nations as supply chains shift and is likely to intensify he said china now trades more with asean as a whole than it does with the us at the same time we still see a surge of truly global trade in the services and digital arenas as evidenced by the growing presence of silicon valley technology companies in southeast asia and india khanna the author of the future is asian said these countries are not choosing sides between the us and china but playing all sides to gain capital from china and investment from the us at the same time and boost their exports in all directions this article originally appeared in the south china

last week ended on a fairly quiet note eur and gbp underperformed following weak pmi data while the nzd continued to trade in a tight range us treasury yields were little changed against a backdrop of lower yields for the uk and euro area tgim thank god it s monday and we might have a more interesting week than last week s dull affair in financial markets the nzd closed the week within a few pips of where it began the week just above the 0 64 mark and traded a less than 50pip range for the entire week the aud ended the week slightly lower at 0 6785 and with its trading range for the week just above 50pips so not a great deal of volatility there either the week was dominated by us china trade war headlines and we are none the wiser about the likely outcome in a fox news interview president trump said that a us china trade deal was very close he declined to reveal if he ll sign a bill supporting hong kong s protesters which would complicate negotiations for a trade deal he said we have to stand with hong kong but i m also standing with president xi economic data released looked to have some impact on currencies and rates with weak data from the uk and euro area dragging rates lower alongside a weaker eur and gbp while us data came on the stronger side of expectations uk pmi data for both the manufacturing and services indices were below expectations falling further into contraction territory no doubt the uncertainty about brexit and the general election were factors markit the index compiler said that the data suggested a 0 2 contraction in q4 gdp in both germany and the euro area manufacturing pmis beat expectations and were consistent with an evident turning point in the manufacturing cycle but the services pmis were weaker adding to evidence that manufacturing sector recessions have spilled over into the services sector largarde made her first major speech as the new ecb president and said that she ll announce a strategy review of the central bank in the near future she called for government help to support the euro area economy saying public investment should be stepped up to ease the burden on monetary stimulus for the day eur fell by 0 3 to 1 1020 while gbp fell by 0 6 to 1 2835 the uk 10 year rate fell by 5bps while germany s 10 year rate was down by 3bps the markit pmis for the us were both stronger than expected for manufacturing and services while the final reading of the university of michigan consumer sentiment index also beat expectations with sentiment up to a four month high the 10 year treasury rate ended the day flat at 1 77 while the 2 year rate was up 2bps to 1 63 the day ahead looks to be another quiet one with the only economic release of note being germany s ifo survey tonight in the week ahead at least in nz s case there are some releases to look forward to including the anz business outlook survey the rbnz s financial stability report retail sales and the inaugural release of monthly employment data tomorrow rba governor lowe talks about unconventional monetary policy some lessons from overseas a speech that will be closely watched with the topic of great interest at present apart from that us china trade headlines will remain in focus in the us over the weekend ex ny mayor michael bloomberg announced that he will join the democratic presidential race so expect us politics to get some airing alongside the inquiry into impeachment of president trump
islamabad nov 24 ani pakistan on sunday made another effort to quell united states concerns over the china pakistan economic corridor cpec with foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi reaffirming islamabad s commitment to the multi billion dollar chinese project speaking to reporters in multan the foreign minister said islamabad had categorically rejected washington s claims on cpec and its impact on pakistan s economy the express tribune reported we do not agree with the assessment and we have conveyed as much in fact we have expedited cpec projects and have initiated the second phase of its implementation he said the minister asserted that china s share in pakistan s overall debt burden was minimal and that the mega project would only have a positive impact pakistan s total debt burden is usd 74 billion of which cpec is only 4 9bn cpec is a gamechanger for the entire region and there is no restriction for any country including the us to invest in the special economic zones being established under cpec said qureshi in a series of tweets earlier in the day special assistant to the prime minister on information and broadcasting firdous ashiq awan said cpec was a top priority for pakistan and would be a harbinger of economic development and prosperity for the entire region she said the economic zones established under cpec would generate more job opportunities for pakistanis and help address one of the country s most pressing challenges in her address at an event in washington last week us acting assistant secretary for south and central asian affairs alice wells had strongly criticised china s international development projects and lending practices under its belt and road initiative bri wells had deemed cpec a form of financing ensuring guaranteed profits for chinese state owned enterprises and pointed out that the multi billion dollar project is certain to take a toll on pakistan s economy at the time of the repayment of the debt and dividend in the coming years she had raised concerns over the lack of transparency in the project saying that it could foster corruption and increase the project cost thereby resulting in an even heavier debt burden for pakistan the cpec is a multi billion dollar development project with a planned network of roads railways and energy projects linking china s xinjiang uyghur autonomous region with pakistan s strategic gwadar port on the arabian sea ani
the nations of latin america are experiencing one of their most dramatic crises in decades although diverse in nature and intensity these national crises developed under both left and right wing regimes are rooted in fragile institutions unable to deliver democratic demands the countercurrents beneath the waves of the pink tide at the beginning of the century with the disastrous cold war era behind new forces started to form a new regional political establishment claiming to be more progressive and more democratic with china s ascent to the economic world stage latin america a natural commodity exporter started to quickly grow with promising times ahead these new left wing regimes known as the pink tide started to gain momentum in a region where weak democratic institutions have allowed the rule of small politico economic elites their message resonated throughout borders a hopeful message for ending poverty reducing inequality and fighting corruption and impunity as the waves began to come along with booming economies these governments had in common a narrative of ending the long pressing socioeconomic inequalities that have ravaged their nations for centuries it seemed like the region was heading to a brighter future however the foundations of such an experiment started to crack as economies felt short to deliver the high pace economic growth needed to sustain those changes furthermore the same perpetuated fragile democratic institutions were easily captured at the service of the new elite not only perpetuating old ways of corruption but also creating new ones once the commodity boom that propelled their political projects faded away and the political tide that surfed it rescinded the people of the americas started to feel unease as the economic growth and development they were promised started to crumble venezuela the alba and the ideological wall relying on skyrocketing oil prices chavez s socialist government in venezuela adopted a hard line populist agenda dramatically expanding social investments through the nationalizing of oil banking and industry chavez s ambitions drove him to the creation of the bolivarian alliance for the peoples of our america or alba and its oil subsidizing program petro caribe these multilateral organizations aimed not only to expand his political sphere of influence but also support allied political projects such as cuba s totalitarian regime and nicaragua s backslide to dictatorship emboldened by brazil s increasing leadership role in the region chavez s attempts to build an ideological wall against american imperialism soon were followed by evo morales in bolivia and rafael correa in ecuador at home chavez s policies resulted in poverty reduction fostering strong popular support by traditionally marginalized classes that saw on chavez a redeemer to their grievances however these policies were sustained on an economic line that proved itself not viable in the long run as oil prices could not keep up with popular demands by 2013 soon after oil prices started to fall venezuela s authoritarian government embarked on a desperate attempt to continue its bolivarian revolution alive by clawing itself to power after chavez s death maduro completed his predecessor s plans to capture the state at his will by consolidating the chavista dictatorship maduro condemned his country to its ongoing collapse maduro s infamous success to maintain control was the result of the elimination of venezuela s traditional high classes by replacing it with a new military led elite loyal to maduro praying not only on oil but also illegal gold extraction in the amazon and drug trafficking venezuela has fallen into the hand of the few consolidating a narco state and a security threat to the hemisphere despite mountainous evidence venezuela s humanitarian crisis and maduro s gross violations of human rights unfolded under the silence of the fading pink tide s old guard lula unasur and brazil s implosion into the far right in june 2013 after a 20 cents hike on public transportation fares a generalized feeling of uncertainty started to mobilize masses in the streets of brazil s main cities it was the start of a five year long crisis that ended with the election of the far right populist leader jair bolsonaro brazil saw the rise and fall of president lula as a prominent leader of the americas during an economic miracle that lifted millions out of poverty under his political support and leadership south america embarked on what was aimed to be its most ambitious regional integration project the union of south american nations unasur the organization quickly became a symbol of the progressive paradigm ruling the region legitimating the ideals of regionalism and sovereignty in the world stage despite lula s successes in fighting socio economic injustices in one of the most unequal countries in the world corruption during his tenure was rampant lula s successor dilma rousseff had to deal with a failing economy amid the end of the commodities boom and the revelations of the odebrecht scandal it was the unveiling of a colossal private and public graft scheme involving brazil s leading construction companies and the national oil company petrobras soon after it became the largest transnational bribery case in latin america s history president rousseff quickly became a scapegoat for the new middle classes that demanded their government accountability and reassurance that the socioeconomic progress they conquered would not wither away the downfall of lula for related corruption charges and rousseff s impeachment out of office marked a pivotal moment for brazil nonetheless the recent disclosure of allegedly private messages between lula s judge sergio moro and ranking prosecutor deltan dallagnol cast a cloud of doubt of the process lula was subject in the trial that took him to prison brazil fallout translated into a final blow into unasur and the initiative to sustain a major political project for latin america with the engage of the returning right wing governments in the second largest economy on the region argentina and the support of peru ecuador colombia and chile the organization recently closed its headquarters in quito lula s recent release from prison as the supreme court decides his fate continues to polarize the country despite being a divisive figure bolsonaro s authoritarian views and incapacity to solve the country s pressing issues remain an open window for lula s return the pacific and the weak consolidation of the right after social unrest ravaged ecuador amid the elimination of oil subsidies and a constitutional crisis shocked peru chilean president piñera claimed our country is a real oasis a week and a half later overwhelming protests in the southern country erupted after metro fares were raised in the capital santiago de chile the crisis in chile is the result of a generalized feeling of indignation that led into a figureless people led outcry for justice swiftly the manifestations transformed into a major movement against socioeconomic inequalities that have persisted despite massive economic growth decades of neoliberal policies instituted by pinochet s military dictatorship and followed by democratically elected regimes since 1990 generated both economic development and consistent inequality with a vibrant democracy and strong economic prospects chile s bouncing stability shocked the continent regardless of the recent political pact for a new constitution the chilean crisis will bear consequences for his neoliberal regional partners in the pacific peru and colombia the return of kirchnerism and the economic crisis in argentina a year ago buenos aires prepared to receive what would be the most important international summit under president macri the g 20 with the election of the right wing leader the country tried to cope with its economic decline after the end of the cristina fernandez de kirchner s populist regime under the majestic colon theater leaders from the most important economies in the world gather to watch argentum a spectacle aimed to present a renovated image of a modern country open to the world and proud of its history internationally macri supported the return of the right to the region joining the group of lima in denouncing the maduro regime and aiding guaido s failed attempts to form an interim presidency in venezuela macri s policies to gradually transform argentina into an open market society called gradualismo failed to meet the expectations of an economic revival despite his fruitful relations with trump and the imf during his administration argentinians have seen a dramatic rise in poverty and a severe devaluation of their wages as frustration mounted october s elections marked the return of the former president as vp of her unrelated ally alberto fernandez as soon as the election was conceded the new president elect moved to support old allies distancing himself from macri s stances denouncing a coup d état in bolivia thanking maduro for his support and calling lula a friend social justice anarchy and bolivia bolivia s anarchy made headlines as evo morales the first indigenous president of the nation fled to mexico after trying to according to the organization of the americas states mount a fraud to remain in power morales rose into leadership in one of the poorest nations of the region where socioeconomic injustices have discriminated against the indigenous majority of the country relying on gas and mining morales founded his anti imperialist economic model joining chavez s bloc morales s popularity derived from not only his economic miracle but also his social reforms aiming to include indigenous elements and identities to the state however during his thirteen year long tenure his consolidation of power critically debilitated the country s democratic foundations morales s dilemma arrived after seeking reelection despite losing a referendum to amend his own constitution former president meza and conservative opposition leader camacho led the national manifestations that ended with the military suggestion for morales to resign unable to pacify the nation right wing interim president añez has swiftly moved to support military suppression of the protesters while morales threatens to return to continue his political project the anarchy left by morales is the latest crisis in a leader less and politically stagnated corner of the world after the ideologization of international relations the failure of multilateralism and the absence of the us the high pace wings in the region are blowing towards a new era of isolationism however could mexico s proactive support for not only morales but for the return of left in south america under lopez obrador rule be the beginning of a new regional leader in the near future

karachi in a move to allay us concerns over china pakistan economic corridor cpec impact on pakistan s debt crisis the newly appointed federal minister for planning and development asad umar on saturday said the bilateral commercial debt from china would start declining in two to three years however he made it clear that pakistan would neither back out from the cpec and its time tested friends like china nor would it become a collateral damage of any conflict between major powers the minister expressed the resolve during a press conference at the karachi press club to counter the claims made by assistant secretary alice wells a day ago while addressing diplomats scholars and journalists at the wilson center a washington think tank she said the multi billion dollar cpec would take a toll on pakistan s economy at the time of repayments and dividend in the coming years mr umar explained that pakistan had already suffered collateral damage for nearly half a century only for others interest but it could not afford to have such policy anymore neither could any country push pakistan into any proxy war a major success of prime minister imran khan was the respect he had earned in the international community due to the balanced foreign policy that opened new avenues for the country he said asad umar vows pakistan will never become collateral damage of any proxy war the federal minister shared facts and evidence from the original plan of the cpec which is set to enter its next phase in response to a question about the future of the mega project particularly after the latest warning of the us regarding the project he said there is no doubt that there is an organised campaign against the cpec both from in and outside the country i can t say whether the us is behind that campaign or not what i can say is that we cannot step back from our friends especially from those who are time tested and helped us out at the time when we were in the deepest crisis of our history we are seeing a tense phase of the us china relations but we are not going to become part of any tussle we can no more be collateral of any conflict between any forces she mentioned about the debt servicing which is really a very big challenge for us the minister remarked but he explained we took loan from china for the cpec and some to meet the balance of payments crisis now we have signed the imf agreement and our multilateral and bilateral lending are restored mainly after restoration of multilateral lending for non projects by the adb and world bank you would see in two to three years our bilateral commercial debt from china would start declining in a speech described as unusually specific by the international media the top us diplomat for south asia had warned that cpec could push the country deeper into an already stifling debt burden fostering corruption and repatriating jobs and profits to china her warning came at a time when washington and islamabad are trying to rebuild their turbulent relationship but mr umar questioned the authenticity of the facts behind her concern about most of the points he called the information she shared with her audience was not true mr umar also referred to ms wells claim about the commercial loans from china that it had been offered to pakistan at an inflationary rate even they were not long term debt the federal minister called her both claims untrue citing figures of the agreement between the two sides this is not true the maturity of the public debt from china is 20 years this is called a long term debt secondly the average interest rate on these debts is only 2 34 per cent they are so much easy loans if we include the grant element in the number of sum we are receiving from china the interest rate further declines to two per cent he said the minister also questioned us assistant secretary s against the fact information when he highlighted her claim that the cpec project would restrict pakistan s industrial development as it would not move beyond infrastructure building let me say that this is not only incorrect but also her analysis is against the facts and ground realities he said our first phase of this project was infrastructure building and energy sector s development which has been completed now we are entering into a second phase which envisages nine special economic zones in all the provinces and the groundbreaking of the first one is scheduled to be held in next few days in rashkai area of khyber pakhtunkhwa the federal minister for planning and development announced ms wells had earlier challenged the notion that the cpec would create jobs in pakistan and claimed that cpec relied primarily on chinese workers and supplies even amid rising unemployment in pakistan he wondered over the source of her information and shared facts related to the project that negated her claim one needs to know that we were only in the first phase of the project he said the first phase was solely related to infrastructure investment everyone knows around the world that the investment over infrastructure is always a capital intensive which doesn t create jobs but it leads to industrialization which creates jobs we have infrastructure in place and now we are moving to second phase which would lead to industrialization and create hundreds of thousands of jobs published in

2 a more cautious optimism towards trade war seemingly optimism had begun to transform into complacency in global markets and last week s trade proved a small dose of reality traders were met with the cold hard facts that perhaps the us and china aren t quite so close to a trade deal as previously thought 1 stocks pullback last week on dose of reality global stock indices generally ended last week lower despite registering modest gains on friday trade negotiations remain the central concern with us president donald trump assuring on friday a phase one deal is very close fundamentally speaking friday s trade was all about international pmi data and the results were overall solid however the uk s set of pmi numbers proved brexit uncertainty still ails the british economy in policy news christine lagarde delivered one of her first speeches as ecb president and called for greater hope and more government stimulus the asx200 is expected to open 12 points higher today ahead of what s a relatively light data week trade headlines are still swaying markets with global indexes advancing to end last week based on president trump saying a deal with china was potentially very close it sets up the asx for gains this morning with futures at 7 45am aedt pointing to a rise of 12 points or 0 2 per cent at the open it s still a headline to headline proposition for markets right now with us president donald trump s assertion on friday night that a deal between his country and the chinese is very close supporting a slim rally in the s p500 but traders are clearly tempering their hopes for a deal this year the vix edged higher for the week and the put call ratio balanced out 3 global pmi s generally surprise to the upside the more essential issue for traders on friday was a raft of pmi data released across the globe and all in all the combined result built upon the view that business activity in the global economy is improving while clearly not out of the woods japanese european and us manufacturing pmi data exceeded economist forecasts sparking hope that the worst of the recent slowdown in the world s economy has bottomed it wasn t all bright news it must be said services pmi numbers were on balance a little weak suggesting that 6 12 months of weak manufacturing activity is now demonstrating its effects on the global services sector 4 uk pmi the weakest of the bunch there was something of an outlier to the positive pmi story on friday and that was the uk s version of the data the pound took a little spill after it was revealed that both services and manufacturing pmi contracted by more than forecast last month another little reality seemed to confront traders as a result of the poor data for all the hope engendered by the prospect of a conservative party victory in next month s election and therefore a smooth brexit the uncertainty engendered by years of political gridlock in the uk is still stifling economic activity the uk growth is probably a little on the soft side calling for eventual boe stimulus
by graham peebles food like shelter and health care is enshrined in the universal declaration of human rights as a fundamental right of all people irrespective of circumstances or income yet one in nine of the global population does not have enough to eat despite the fact that there is enough food to feed everyone the fact that around 800 million people are literally starving to death in a world of plenty is a level of human injustice which beggars belief women and children are the worst affected women who in many countries are not allowed to own land make up 60 per cent of the global total the world food programme estimates that if they were given equal access to resources the number of hungry in the world could be reduced by up to 150 million people the causes of hunger are not complicated while the rich indulge to excess and fill to overflowing people are allowed to die of hunger related illnesses simply because they don t have enough money to buy food this needless human destruction is not simply unjust it is atrociously immoral and should fill us all with shame as a wise man has said my brothers how can you watch these people die before your eyes and call yourselves men the poorest of the poor people starve and live with food insecurity for one fundamental reason poverty poverty is not simply defined by a lack of income but virtually all other types of poverty including poor health care poor education poor nutrition as well as the more psychological effects lack of self esteem personal shame and embarrassment flow from this basic underlying and decidedly crude form of poverty and while poverty affects everyone irrespective of age the impact on children is devastating making them vulnerable to all manner of exploitation threatening their safety rights health and education in developing countries according to the united nations children s emergency fund unicef more than 30 per cent of children about 600 million live on less than usd 1 a day poor nutrition rather than emergency famine causes nearly half 45 per cent of deaths in children under five 3 1 million children each year 90 per cent of whom are the victims of long term malnourishment and for those who survive early childhood hunger leaves a lifelong legacy of cognitive and physical impairment although the vast majority 98 per cent of those living with acute food insecurity are found in developing i e poor countries perhaps surprisingly an additional 50 million people or so 14 per cent of the population are in the united states supposedly the world s richest nation but significantly also the country with the highest levels of wealth and income inequality in the world sub saharan africa where 25 per cent of children are malnourished accounts for 214 million people living with food insecurity but the greatest concentration of starving human beings 525 million according to figures from the hunger project lives in asia inevitably given its population 1 3 billion the largest proportion is in india over 200 million where the causes of hunger are pretty much the same as everywhere else in the world high levels of poverty inequality rising food costs inflation and poor governance we could add to this list lack of sharing or distribution of foodstuffs to those in need and food waste according to the united nations development programme up to 40 per cent of the food produced in india is wasted 21 million tonnes of wheat alone india ranks 80th out of 104 countries in the global hunger index and is home to a third of the world s poor and hungry approximately one in three indian children are malnourished and some 3 000 die every day from diet related illnesses this in what is regularly hailed as the world s fastest growing economy where according to forbes 111 billionaires and almost 200 000 millionaires live the same absurdity of extraordinary insular wealth excess and greed alongside desperate poverty and crippling suffering is repeated globally oxfam states that the annual income of the world s richest 100 people is enough to end global poverty four times over worldwide there are 1 826 billionaires with a combined wealth in excess of usd 7 trillions starving in a world of plenty worldwide hunger is not the result of population of lack of food as oxfam states it s about power and its roots lie in inequalities in access to resources and opportunities as well as financial inequality and the economic injustice that feeds poverty there is roughly the same number of overweight or obese people in the world as the number suffering from hunger this highlights what many see as one of the underlying causes of hunger grotesque levels of inequality within nations and between countries inequality results from a fundamentally corrupt economic system in fact it is inherent in the system itself a system that has labelled everything a commodity including food shelter health care and education to be profited from until exhausted and everyone a consumer to be exploited into penury then discarded it is a system that drives compassion and the natural human qualities of sharing and empathy into the shadows it devalues community and champions individual success no matter the cost to other people or the environment it says you can feed yourself and your family only if you have money to do so if not we will sit in comfort and complacency and watch you and your children die the chasm between the rich and the rest is greater today than ever the statistics are staggering currently the richest 85 people in the world are worth more than the poorest 3 5 billion the lower half of the global population possesses just 1 per cent of global wealth while the richest 10 per cent own 86 per cent of all wealth the top 1 per cent account for 46 per cent of the total unless the current trend of rising inequality is checked oxfam forecasts that the combined wealth of the richest 1 per cent will overtake that of the other 99 per cent of people next year to redress the growing division between the grossly rich and the desperately poor the charity is calling for what it describes as a global new deal in order to reverse decades of increasing inequality it consists of a radical programme to deal with everything from closing tax havens which hold as much as usd 32 trillion or a third of all global wealth to dealing with weak employment laws and investing in not cutting public services it is time oxfam says that our leaders reformed the system so that it works in the interests of the whole of humanity rather than a global elite this means designing a just model with sharing at its heart so that the resources of the world including food and water are shared equitably among the people of the world creative solutions to end hunger and food waste there are various basic measures that have been shown to cut hunger sharply encouraging and investing in smallholder farmers instead of selling off their land to multinational corporations particularly women world food programme findings show that high rates of hunger are strongly linked to gender inequalities when women are supported whether as farmers or as food providers families eat and when mothers receive education on good feeding techniques and getting the right nutrients child malnutrition is reduced providing school meals has the combined effect of addressing hunger and keeping children in school thus helping families break the cycle of poverty that leads to hunger technology also has a part to play the world food programme reports that in syria the refugees from iraq get a voucher on a cell phone to spend in a local store the storekeepers love it the farmers love it it saves money this is a brilliant scheme that does away with money as does food for assets a project that offers food in payment for work to poor hungry communities including smallholder farmers add to this list raising the minimum wage of the lowest paid workers and importantly ending food wastage globally around a third of all food produced 1 3 billion tonnes is wasted in america the figure jumps to half in addition to wasting food all the resources needed to grow and distribute it are also squandered the key ones being energy and crucially water the united nations informs us that 250 km3 of water is wasted in growing these crops an amount that would meet all the world s water needs complacency among those of us in the west where there is an abundance of food is a major factor with masses of food in the shops we don t need to be careful with it is the common attitude there are a number of common sense recommendations for reducing food wastage all of which are easy to implement invest in food storage technology so that food keeps for longer force supermarkets to stock and sell imperfect vegetables meaning naturally not corporately shaped at lower prices donate food to those in need and revise the over zealous sell by dates redistributing sharing unwanted food rather than wasting it would help eliminate hunger duncan green oxfam uk s senior strategic adviser states in the guardian that on some estimates stopping the waste of food after harvest due to poor storage or transport infrastructure and then in our own kitchens could free up half of all food grown an economy based on sharing over and above these positive steps all of which would contribute to reducing hunger ending hunger totally is inextricably linked to abolishing the extreme levels of poverty that half the planet lives with this requires a creative reappraisal of the economic system and a collective will to bring about real and lasting change the current heartless market driven structure makes no concession to need and is conditioned totally by money as the un food and agriculture organisation states even when enough is produced there is no guarantee that a market economy will generate a distribution of income that provides enough for all to purchase the food needed the fact that food is burnt or left for rats to feast on because it s cheaper to destroy the produce than distribute it to those in need reveals the inhumane nature of the economic rules that fuel such shameful neglect sharing imaginatively utilised is the fundamental and common sense element that would end hunger and acute poverty and quickly the fact that hunger exists at all shows the urgency of redistributing income and assets to achieve a fairer world says duncan green that redistribution has not already taken place is truly something to be ashamed of it is time to design an economic system that allows for the required sharing of food water land and other natural resources as well as knowledge and skills this must be a just and humane model as advocated by the brandt commission that honours our collective commitment to article 25 of the universal declaration of human rights and holds as its primary aim the meeting of humanity s basic needs food shelter health care and education and it must not be driven by corporate profit greed and the obscene accumulation of personal wealth which is fuelling inequality and causing the premature deaths of hundreds of millions of the poorest most vulnerable people in the world

chairil abdini universitas indonesia south korea taiwan malaysia and indonesia all suffered from japanese occupation during the second world war but in the decades of peace that followed south korea and taiwan revived grew their economies and became rich their gdp per capita what everyone in the country earns per year if income is equally distributed are now on par with developed western countries we are familiar with south korean products from cars and electronics to skincare taiwan exports refined oil electronics and computers such as acer and asus malaysia however plateaued once it reached upper middle income a term the world bank uses to define countries with a per capita gdp higher than us 1 045 but lower than us 12 736 in the meantime indonesia is still struggling in the lower middle income level with gdp per capita below us 4 125 why do some countries grow faster than others innovative local companies play a key role the tale of four economies around two decades after the second world war in 1967 malaysia led the four economies in gdp per capita at us 317 taiwan s was us 281 south korea s us 161 and indonesia s us 54 within two years taiwan overtook malaysia and a decade later in 1977 it was korea s turn in 2003 korea s gdp per capita was us 14 209 90 times what it was in 1967 taiwan s gdp per capita was close with us 14 120 in 2003 observers dubbed the growth of these four along with japan hong kong thailand and singapore in the 1980s and 1990s as the asian miracle their gdp per capita grew twice as fast between 1965 and 1990 compared to more developed western countries such as those europe and north america don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free the gdp per capita increase in these countries was accompanied by poverty reduction and a narrowing of the gap between the rich and poor the 1997 asian financial crisis hit these economies hard korea saw its gdp per capita slump by 33 4 taiwan by 8 5 malaysia by 29 6 and indonesia by 56 4 bringing indonesia back to low income level but by 2017 the average income in korea had again grown to nearly us 30 000 taiwan s grew to us 24 000 malaysia and indonesia s were behind with us 9 952 and us 3 847 respectively why do some economies grow faster than others economists use gdp per capita as an indicator of a country s productivity rate the output it has produced over a certain period the higher the per capita gdp of an economy the higher the productivity of its citizens south korea and taiwan s high gdp reflects their high productivity rate compared to malaysia and indonesia three things determine a country s productivity labour capital and something known as total factor productivity tfp which represents efficiency and technology for example better management systems to reduce red tape could signal efficiency while the use of technology to automate tasks that would take up a lot of time if done manually technology according to the asian productivity organisation tfp contributed 14 to korea s economic growth between 1970 and 2016 and 24 for taiwan meanwhile tfp only contributed 5 to malaysia s growth and for indonesia the percentage is even lower 1 this means there s very little technological advancement in indonesia the small contribution of tfp to indonesia s economy closely ties to the country s low investment in research and development in 2017 indonesia spent less than 0 2 of its gdp on research and development meanwhile korea spent 4 55 of its gdp on research and development taiwan in 2016 spent 3 16 and malaysia around 1 3 how to increase total factor productivity a working paper for the international monetary fund showed that korea and taiwan s economic growth has relied on technological innovation by local companies in the 1960s south korea founded 35 state owned companies in the energy construction and banking sectors by the 1970s to improve the public enterprises performance south korea began privatising state owned companies providing loans and protection from market competition to family owned business groups called chaebol in korean meanwhile economist chen been lon argues the government and private enterprises have been instrumental in helping taiwan grow into today s economic powerhouse www shutterstock com in 1964 taiwan built a semiconductor lab at the national chiao tung university this lab was the training ground for many engineers who became the backbone of taiwan s semiconductor industry don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free in 1974 a state owned electronic research and services organization erso was established near national chiao tung university in 1980 erso created its first spin off company named united microelectronics umc with 40 capital investment coming from the government umc moved on to become taiwan s centre for acquiring chip technologies training local engineers and building the foundation of taiwan semiconductor industries support for domestic industries by the south korean and taiwanese government through cheap loans and market protections provided room for companies to increase the budget to develop technological innovation they also improved the quality of education providing high quality labour for companies that would need highly skilled workers in contrast to south korea and taiwan s strategy in which the government supported the development of domestic industries the imf paper noted malaysia relied on transfer technology from multinational companies multinational companies are reluctant to transfer their technologies to local companies leaving host countries stuck supplying raw materials multinational companies protect their intellectual property rights and product development they are also reluctant to train local hires lest they move to other companies this is the challenge indonesia and malaysia are facing as domestic industries are underdeveloped in both countries local companies have little to spare to fund research and development while south korea and taiwan have 15 and nine companies respectively listed in the fortune 500 list a ranking of the biggest companies in the world by revenue both indonesia and malaysia each have only one company in the list and they are the countries state oil and gas companies catching up strong evidence both

news pakistan will never back out of its friendship with china govt asad umar says china is pakistan s extremely close friend and partner and has stood by it in the most difficult times pakistan will never back out of its friendship with china federal minister for planning development and reforms asad umar said on saturday a day after us diplomat alice wells warned that cpec will further add to pakistan s debt burden a lot of conspiracies have taken place against cpec but relations between the two countries will never be frayed the minister said while addressing a press conference at the karachi press club pakistan will not be caught up in a fight between two other entities he added asad umar said pakistan is an important beneficiary of cpec in term of projects pertaining to energy and infrastructure while denouncing the statement of alice well that china alone is the beneficiary of cpec the minister said that cpec is much important to pakistan s long term economic development and that is why the present government has taken ownership of this bilateral project we have also taken it forward with special focus on industrialization agricultural growth and social security he said commenting on alice well s statement that pakistan will be swamped by china in debt he said besides being a huge investment portfolio cpec is bringing in commercial debt in pakistan which is only 1 4th of overall public debt but this commercial lending from china will be decreasing within three to four years once our own economy stabilizes our total public debt right now is 74bn of which the chinese debt amounts to 18bn even less than one fourth of the total debt and if i further break it down the cpec debt under this figure of public debt is 4 9bn not even 10pc of the total debt the minister noted as far as the money taken from china is concerned it was taken at such a time when our trade deficit was dangerously high and our reserves were falling we were unable to easily procure loans from other sources this was the hallmark of china s friendship with pakistan that in such a time of crisis it provided us loans from its commercial banks asad umar said adding that over the course of the next three years debt servicing will see about a third being spent on settling the commercial loans from china after three years this commercial borrowing will be substituted by long term multi lateral debt and so the portion of chinese debt servicing will witness a sharp decline he said that wells argument that the commercial loans are expensive and do not have a long enough payback period is incorrect the public debt obtained from china has a maturity period of 20 years and the interest is 2 34 which is cheap and if i include the grant element the interest value slides down to about 2 the minister explained the minister said pakistan is going to get technology transfer from china under cpec there is even debate within the us that china will be the future giant in global technology he said there is no doubt about the transfer of technology as a result of us investment but china is part of a technology war now and is a big source of technology moreover pakistan will go towards wherever greater chances for technological development lie he added wells said that cpec is not an aid but an investment and this is correct there is a small grant element contained within it but fundamentally it is an investment pakistan has always recognised that this is not aid and especially this government has always maintained that it wishes to move past the initial scope of the arrangement the minister said the aid that pakistan received in the past did not really contribute in real terms towards the country s progress and she was right to point out that we must stand on our own feet he added dismissing her allegations that pakistan s development will be limited under cpec umar said in the first phase the infrastructural development focused on roads and energy projects on this basis he added pakistan will see industrial development beginning in about two months time special economic zones will start opening she was right to say that not many jobs have been created because in the first phase when infrastructural development is the goal that happens but on the basis of that when industrial development takes off that will pave the way for jobs china is our extremely close friend and partner and has stood by pakistan in our most difficult times they call us their iron brother when any of us go to china we realise even more deeply the ties that bind us the minister said but this does not mean we are against the us i can assure alice wells that american companies were welcome are welcome and will continue to be welcome to invest in pakistan he added courtesy www dailytimes com pk

cybercrime is flourishing in venezuela as the country s deepening economic and political crisis drives thousands into the underground criminal world according to a report released thursday by intsights a global threat intelligence company intsights analysts discovered large scale and sophisticated efforts to steal personal information from people in latin america who work for a variety of companies such as banks and retailers and then either sell that information online or use it to collect even more data the hackers are based in venezuela and neighboring countries like colombia where many venezuelan refugees have settled these information gathering operations are particularly lucrative for venezuelans as they are sold for cryptocurrency such as bitcoin a welcome alternative to the country s own currency which has endured rapid inflation and they re not subtle about it specific information about the operations like who the hackers are where they are located and even hackers phone numbers are surprisingly easy to find according to charity wright an analyst at intsights normally experienced hackers operating in countries such as russia china and vietnam hide by taking on alternate identities and profiles to throw people off they don t seem too concerned about hiding wright said i think it s because they don t sense law enforcement will do anything venezuelan opposition activists demonstrate against president nicolas maduro in caracas on july 6 2017 federico parra afp via getty images file venezuela s hyperinflation has caused a deterioration of the national currency and in turn many venezuelans have turned to cryptocurrencies the international monetary fund says inflation of the venezuelan bolivar the country s currency is expected to hit a startling 200 000 percent this year a cup of coffee that cost 150 bolivars in november 2018 now costs 18 000 bolivars according to bloomberg venezuela was once one of the wealthiest countries in latin america with the world s largest oil reserves and vast gold deposits but decades of corruption and mismanagement under socialist rule have led its economy to ruin in the past year protests have turned deadly after crackdowns by the government of president nicolás maduro the country has also endured sizable blackouts venezuela based cybercrime efforts span a variety of common digital misdeeds including large scale email phishing efforts and malware campaigns sensitive information collected through successful hacks is then sold on various public websites and on the dark web the report indicates victims don t receive much cooperation from the government when they file complaints because of the economic and political turmoil in the country as a result local law enforcement is turning a blind eye censorship in venezuela has caused hackers to openly use social media the government blocks many websites such as cnn and el nacional a popular national newspaper even the walkie talkie app zello which was popular among venezuelans during the protests has been blocked people have turned to virtual private networks vpns which help sidestep internet censorship and the tor browser a free and open source software that enables anonymous communication but even vpns and tor have been banned by venezuela s state owned internet provider cantv venezuelans now rely heavily on social media apps such as instagram snapchat facebook and twitter as well as the messaging app whatsapp for information because of the censorship cybercriminals have also turned to social media apps to collaborate and find work wright said many of the venezuelan cybercriminals intsights found appeared to use their own photos on social media and accurate descriptions of where they live making it easy to find out who they are cybercurrency makes cybercrime easier wright said for a long time bitcoin was used by people that were into technology she said cryptocurrencies have become a widely used form of payment in venezuela according to wright the venezuelan government created its own digital currency dubbed the petro in february 2018 more than 4 million venezuelans have fled the country in recent years to escape low wages a collapsing health care system the absence of basic services and the lack of security the majority are settling in neighboring colombia with limited work opportunities many venezuelans have turned to cybercrime as an alternative for making money the venezuelan underground has risen to the surface with the anarchy and chaos of the maduro regime said tom kellermann head of cybersecurity strategy for cloud computer company vmware and a global fellow for cyberpolicy at the wilson center while the most prolific cybercriminal underground in south america is in brazil considered one of the top four most sophisticated in the world venezuela s hacking community has become more brazen because of the chaos that is currently ongoing in the country according to kellermann the report has a bleak outlook for the future the maduro regime s priorities do not include protecting infrastructure or global enterprises at the moment the report states it says that even if corporations went directly to venezuelan opposition leader juan guaído recognized as the legitimate leader by the u s and about 50 other nations there is little that his government can do to control the cybercrime emerging from venezuela
2 a more cautious optimism towards trade war seemingly optimism had begun to transform into complacency in global markets and last week s trade proved a small dose of reality traders were met with the cold hard facts that perhaps the us and china aren t quite so close to a trade deal as previously thought 1 stocks pullback last week on dose of reality global stock indices generally ended last week lower despite registering modest gains on friday trade negotiations remain the central concern with us president donald trump assuring on friday a phase one deal is very close fundamentally speaking friday s trade was all about international pmi data and the results were overall solid however the uk s set of pmi numbers proved brexit uncertainty still ails the british economy in policy news christine lagarde delivered one of her first speeches as ecb president and called for greater hope and more government stimulus the asx200 is expected to open 12 points higher today ahead of what s a relatively light data week trade headlines are still swaying markets with global indexes advancing to end last week based on president trump saying a deal with china was potentially very close it sets up the asx for gains this morning with futures at 7 45am aedt pointing to a rise of 12 points or 0 2 per cent at the open it s still a headline to headline proposition for markets right now with us president donald trump s assertion on friday night that a deal between his country and the chinese is very close supporting a slim rally in the s p500 but traders are clearly tempering their hopes for a deal this year the vix edged higher for the week and the put call ratio balanced out 3 global pmi s generally surprise to the upside the more essential issue for traders on friday was a raft of pmi data released across the globe and all in all the combined result built upon the view that business activity in the global economy is improving while clearly not out of the woods japanese european and us manufacturing pmi data exceeded economist forecasts sparking hope that the worst of the recent slowdown in the world s economy has bottomed it wasn t all bright news it must be said services pmi numbers were on balance a little weak suggesting that 6 12 months of weak manufacturing activity is now demonstrating its effects on the global services sector 4 uk pmi the weakest of the bunch there was something of an outlier to the positive pmi story on friday and that was the uk s version of the data the pound took a little spill after it was revealed that both services and manufacturing pmi contracted by more than forecast last month another little reality seemed to confront traders as a result of the poor data for all the hope engendered by the prospect of a conservative party victory in next month s election and therefore a smooth brexit the uncertainty engendered by years of political gridlock in the uk is still stifling economic activity the uk growth is probably a little on the soft side calling for eventual boe stimulus
with the impeachment proceedings of president trump maturing and impeachment on the horizon ronald reagan and his legacy are more important to the american right now than they have been in a generation as a reagan scholar who has spent weeks at the reagan library and museum and written a book on the reagan legacy i was pleased that the complex survived the recent fires as the flames engulfed the california landscape threatening to destroy the physical manifestation of the reagan legacy it seemed a sad yet fitting image for the state of the modern american conservative movement and republican party trump threatens to dismantle the policy platform that republicans have embraced since 1980 however imperfectly past republican administrations have embraced free trade humane immigration reform support for international organizations such as the united nations and nato and an american foreign policy of engagement across the globe trump is challenging each of these positions and in the process he is remaking the republican party in his image thanks to the hard work of firefighters and 500 goats the reagan library was saved it is unclear whether reagan conservatism can likewise be rescued republicans need to return to the reagan years not to forge new myths about the fortieth president but to relearn the lessons of the 1980s and to revisit some of his greatest achievements first like trump reagan believed in deregulation and tax cuts as a means to revitalize the economy combined with federal reserve chairman paul volcker s monetary policies they led to economic recovery and contributed to sustained economic growth over the next two decades unlike trump however reagan recognized that the budget deficits generated during his administration represented a major threat to america s fiscal well being even if he was unable to address them during his time in office where have all the fiscal hawks gone after all there is little to no talk about the 23 trillion debt among the presidential hopefuls including the republicans challenging trump president reagan achieved many policy victories while he was in office all of them required bipartisan support and reagan worked tirelessly to build coalitions for his policy prescriptions as reagan is quoted as saying in october 1987 the person who agrees with you 80 percent of the time is a friend and an ally not a 20 percent traitor to this end reagan worked with democratic house speaker tip o neill and the democrats to extend the solvency of social security to close loopholes in the tax code and to achieve immigration reform in 1986 along with enforcement mechanisms reagan s immigration act granted amnesty to almost three million undocumented immigrants while reagan wanted to stop illegal immigration he believed that immigrants were essential to america s identity and spoke of them in glowing terms during his final speech as president reagan argued that new waves of immigrants were vital to our future as a nation and insisted that if we ever close the door to new americans our leadership in the world would soon be lost while new immigrants give more than they receive and were often entrepreneurs reagan insisted that their greatest contribution was that they renew our pride and gratitude in the united states of america indeed many of reagan s greatest achievements were the product of working across both the political and ideological aisle reagan s signature tax cuts in 1981 were possible because of the support of the boll weevil democrats and the 1986 tax reform package was also bipartisan most importantly however it was reagan s willingness to negotiate with general secretary mikhail gorbachev the leader of the dreaded evil empire that eased superpower tensions and cleared the path for a peaceful end to the cold war reagan s greatest foreign policy achievement was the signing of the inf treaty in december 1987 the signing of the treaty marked the first time the two superpowers had agreed to dismantle some around 5 of their nuclear arsenals in signing the treaty however reagan had to go against many in his conservative base william f buckley released an edition of national review titled reagan s suicide pact in which the journal denounced the inf treaty likewise howard phillips the chairman of the conservative caucus took out a full page advertisement in the washington times the ad ran under the title appeasement is as unwise in 1988 as in 1938 below the headline there was a picture of ronald reagan directly under neville chamberlain across from their images gorbachev appeared directly under the image of adolf hitler phillips and the conservative caucus implored readers in all caps to help us defeat the reagan gorbachev inf treaty modern day republicans and conservatives can learn a great deal from visiting the reagan library and museum reagan s true legacy is that of a pragmatic conservative who was willing to compromise and work with his political and ideological opponents to govern effectively the gop needs reagan now more than ever despite liberal critiques reagan represents a more inclusive and optimistic form of conservatism a conservatism built not on hyper nationalism or protectionism but a conservatism grounded in free enterprise and meritocracy it isn t too late for the republican party once again to be the party of reagan dr marcus witcher is a scholar in residence in the history department and the arkansas center for research in economics acre at the university of central arkansas he specializes in political economic and intellectual history from 1920 to present dr witcher s book getting right with reagan the struggle for true conservatism 1980 2016 will be released

investors follow legendary investors for one reason to receive signals about potential investment opportunities however closely studying the investment patterns of these well known gurus could reveal much more than winning stocks and industries for example historical evidence suggests that the cash balance of berkshire hathaway nyse brk a nyse brk b is a leading indicator of upcoming market turbulence over the last 10 years the conglomerate s cash and short term investments have continued to grow and are currently at an all time high of 128 billion source company filings advertisement advertisement this analysis will shine some light on whether investors need to worry about an upcoming recession or a market downturn based on berkshire s cash balance buffett does not like cash from the above illustration an investor might get the impression that warren buffett trades portfolio is someone who loves holding on to excess cash which is not true on the contrary the oracle of omaha does not even consider cash as an investment he once said the one thing i will tell you is the worst investment you can have is cash everybody is talking about cash being king and all that sort of thing cash is going to become worthless over time but good businesses are going to become worth more over time advertisement advertisement the investment wizard seems to be holding a large pile of cash with a strategic objective as it s unusual for him to hold on to billions of dollars without making any investments this is something value investors should pay attention to buffett s strategy is to make big investments when there s fear in the market this means holding on to cash when others are being greedy berkshire hathaway with the guidance of buffett and charlie munger trades portfolio has made some of its best bets during times when the general investing public was overwhelmed by a fear of further losses for example according to regulatory filings the company invested 5 billion in goldman sachs gs in the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2008 despite the uncertainty surrounding the banking and finance sector this investment now pays more than 500 million in dividends per year for berkshire story continues in addition the company invested in general electric ge dow chemical dow and wrigley during the last recession these investments were worth billions in aggregate and were supported by the mammoth cash balance the company had accrued before the crisis the below graph depicts berkshire s trend of accumulating cash right before the last two recessions the dotcome bubble and the financial crisis in both these instances the cash balance declined drastically following the market downturn indicating the massive investments made by the company today the company is holding on to a historic amount of liquid assets and the s p 500 index has continued to soar over the last three years these are ominous signs for investors and buffett issued an early warning in his 2018 annual letter to shareholders advertisement advertisement charlie and i will continue our search for large equity investments or better yet a really major business acquisition that would absorb our liquid assets he wrote currently however we see nothing on the horizon even though months have passed by and the markets have delivered another strong year of performance this warning should not be taken lightly admittedly no investor or analyst would be able to predict when exactly a downturn would occur but buffett believes it s around the corner other important indicators confirm the overvalued status of markets the shiller price earnings ratio is one of the most widely used indicators to evaluate the overvalued or undervalued status of the s p 500 index this ratio sends a warning signal as well and has topped the highs it reached prior to the financial crisis the ratio reached an all time high of 44 19 in december 1999 just before the dotcom bubble burst the current level of 30 24 is well above the ratio seen before black tuesday black monday and the recession in 2008 advertisement advertisement buffett is optimistic about the long term performance of equities it s difficult to find a value investor who is more optimistic about the american economy than the oracle of omaha over the years on numerous occasions buffett has confirmed his belief that the american economy will grow in each decade in the foreseeable future in an article published in the new york times in 2008 during the financial crisis he reiterated this belief a simple rule dictates my buying be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful and most certainly fear is now widespread gripping even seasoned investors to be sure investors are right to be wary of highly leveraged entities or businesses in weak competitive positions but fears regarding the long term prosperity of the nation s many sound companies make no sense these businesses will indeed suffer earnings hiccups as they always have but most major companies will be setting new profit records 5 10 and 20 years from now if a recession hits the u s a prudent value investor would look to invest in bargains in a bid to secure attractive long term returns to be in a position to benefit from low stock prices however investors need to allocate a portion of their portfolios to cash this could turn out to be an important strategic decision that would help deliver stellar returns in a few years advertisement advertisement investors need not be alarmed but better be ready despite the warning signs issued by buffett the american economy is still running smoothly for now both the world bank and the international monetary fund believe an economic growth slowdown is likely but positive that a recession will not occur in the next couple of years this outlook provides a window for investors to prepare their portfolios for the next downturn by diversifying their investments across asset classes and defensive industries holding on to cash as a strategic move could also turn out to be a rewarding decision in any case the legendary investors have no doubt that the long term performance of equities will be stellar there s no need to panic but at the same time failing to make the necessary changes to steer away from overvalued sectors could result in significant losses for investors

after two years of essentially fruitless negotiations with pyongyang it seems justifiable to conclude that the era of north korea acquiring nuclear armed missiles has ended and given way to the era of north korea as a permanent de facto nuclear weapons state while negotiations will continue it is appropriate to raise the question of how this situation came about as a case study in international politics what north korea achieved is remarkable the ancient and influential greek historian thucydides is celebrated for the concise wisdom of his observation that the strong do what they will and the weak suffer what they must a summary of the neorealist view of international politics in this case the power gap between the strong united states and weak north korea was immense the u s economy was roughly 100 times the size of north korea s and the u s also boasted the world s most capable conventional military forces plus a nuclear arsenal that could have incinerated every north korean city yet this comparatively small country managed despite the superpower s awareness and opposition to acquire a capability that made itself exponentially more potentially dangerous to the superpower
the s p 500 index has posted a 365 gain since the bear market bottom in march 2009 and that has many investors and market historians expecting sharply lower returns ahead meanwhile a study by research affiliates indicates that investors should tilt from u s to international equities for the next decade according to a report in barron s research affiliates is the investment advisory firm founded by rob arnott known for developing smart beta investing strategies during the next decade they forecast an average annual inflation adjusted real return of 5 3 for the msci eafe index which captures developed market equities in europe australasia and the far east and a 7 3 average real return for emerging markets stocks by contrast they expect annual real returns of just 0 5 for the large cap s p 500 and 1 9 for the small cap russell 2000 index key takeaways the next decade is likely to see meager returns on u s stocks many foreign markets are much cheaper and have significant upside however foreign stocks have their own sets of risks significance for investors the russell 2000 has yet to regain its late august 2018 record high and currently trades about 9 lower prior to the russell s year end selloff in 2018 research affiliates expected it to perform about as poorly as the s p 500 going forward with interest rates now near historic lows research affiliates expects that the bloomberg barclays u s aggregate bond index will return a negative 0 3 per year while u s treasury inflation protected securities tips will return a mere 0 4 annually real estate will be a disappointing investment as well with reits delivering an annualized real return of just 1 most reit indexes are up by about 25 in 2019 posting gains similar to the s p 500 lisa shalett chief investment officer cio for morgan stanley wealth management also suggests that investors look abroad for better equity returns per another barron s report she notes that the msci europe total return index priced in euros has outperformed the s p 500 total return index during the past 12 months moreover in the u s stock valuations are high and earnings growth has diminished by contrast shalett observes that valuations abroad are much lower to the point where they are washed out anticipating that global economic growth may rebound partly due to easing by central banks she writes the pay off from this type of positioning could be large as non us markets are inherently more cyclical in their composition and thus more operationally leveraged to improvements in global growth other investment professionals have similar observations stocks are significantly cheaper in other parts of the world as bill stone co chief investment officer at wealth management firm avalon advisors in houston told the wall street journal based on current valuation levels which help play a role in determining equity returns over the next several years foreign markets appear more attractive than u s markets notes michael sheldon chief investment officer at rdm financial group hightower advisors in connecticut per the same journal report looking ahead foreign stocks come with their own sets of risks and caveats there are serious political and economic troubles even in the developed world for example the european union eu is contending with a new populist government in italy and brexit is still a much delayed work in process that continues to spawn uncertainties across the continent
karachi in a move to allay us concerns over china pakistan economic corridor cpec impact on pakistan s debt crisis the newly appointed federal minister for planning and development asad umar on saturday said the bilateral commercial debt from china would start declining in two to three years however he made it clear that pakistan would neither back out from the cpec and its time tested friends like china nor would it become a collateral damage of any conflict between major powers the minister expressed the resolve during a press conference at the karachi press club to counter the claims made by assistant secretary alice wells a day ago while addressing diplomats scholars and journalists at the wilson center a washington think tank she said the multi billion dollar cpec would take a toll on pakistan s economy at the time of repayments and dividend in the coming years mr umar explained that pakistan had already suffered collateral damage for nearly half a century only for others interest but it could not afford to have such policy anymore neither could any country push pakistan into any proxy war a major success of prime minister imran khan was the respect he had earned in the international community due to the balanced foreign policy that opened new avenues for the country he said asad umar vows pakistan will never become collateral damage of any proxy war the federal minister shared facts and evidence from the original plan of the cpec which is set to enter its next phase in response to a question about the future of the mega project particularly after the latest warning of the us regarding the project he said there is no doubt that there is an organised campaign against the cpec both from in and outside the country i can t say whether the us is behind that campaign or not what i can say is that we cannot step back from our friends especially from those who are time tested and helped us out at the time when we were in the deepest crisis of our history we are seeing a tense phase of the us china relations but we are not going to become part of any tussle we can no more be collateral of any conflict between any forces she mentioned about the debt servicing which is really a very big challenge for us the minister remarked but he explained we took loan from china for the cpec and some to meet the balance of payments crisis now we have signed the imf agreement and our multilateral and bilateral lending are restored mainly after restoration of multilateral lending for non projects by the adb and world bank you would see in two to three years our bilateral commercial debt from china would start declining in a speech described as unusually specific by the international media the top us diplomat for south asia had warned that cpec could push the country deeper into an already stifling debt burden fostering corruption and repatriating jobs and profits to china her warning came at a time when washington and islamabad are trying to rebuild their turbulent relationship but mr umar questioned the authenticity of the facts behind her concern about most of the points he called the information she shared with her audience was not true mr umar also referred to ms wells claim about the commercial loans from china that it had been offered to pakistan at an inflationary rate even they were not long term debt the federal minister called her both claims untrue citing figures of the agreement between the two sides this is not true the maturity of the public debt from china is 20 years this is called a long term debt secondly the average interest rate on these debts is only 2 34 per cent they are so much easy loans if we include the grant element in the number of sum we are receiving from china the interest rate further declines to two per cent he said the minister also questioned us assistant secretary s against the fact information when he highlighted her claim that the cpec project would restrict pakistan s industrial development as it would not move beyond infrastructure building let me say that this is not only incorrect but also her analysis is against the facts and ground realities he said our first phase of this project was infrastructure building and energy sector s development which has been completed now we are entering into a second phase which envisages nine special economic zones in all the provinces and the groundbreaking of the first one is scheduled to be held in next few days in rashkai area of khyber pakhtunkhwa the federal minister for planning and development announced ms wells had earlier challenged the notion that the cpec would create jobs in pakistan and claimed that cpec relied primarily on chinese workers and supplies even amid rising unemployment in pakistan he wondered over the source of her information and shared facts related to the project that negated her claim one needs to know that we were only in the first phase of the project he said the first phase was solely related to infrastructure investment everyone knows around the world that the investment over infrastructure is always a capital intensive which doesn t create jobs but it leads to industrialization which creates jobs we have infrastructure in place and now we are moving to second phase which would lead to industrialization and create hundreds of thousands of jobs published in

the announcement of a rise in fuel prices on nov 15 triggered days of protests and widespread vandalism across iran it is difficult to determine exactly when the unrest subsided but it is clear that the bulk of the actions took place within the first 48 hours by nov 18 various security officials were reporting the return of calm and order to their respective jurisdictions by nov 21 president hassan rouhani had declared the complete return of calm and security price gouging western media outlets report that gas prices in iran increased by as much as 300 percent while this is technically correct it is devoid of context and misleading even after the price hike gasoline prices in iran are among the lowest in the world prior to the increase the price for a liter of gas was 10 000 rials or less than nine u s cents per liter in other words a gallon of gas in iran prior to the price change cost about 35 cents about one eighth what it costs in the u s there were several problems with gas being so cheap one was that the price at the pump was less than the cost of refining the oil and the distribution of gas even assuming no cost for oil even though iran has large deposits extracting oil is not free therefore the government has now for decades been subsidizing gasoline most car owners are not wealthy of course still super cheap fuel represents a regressive form of subsidies those who do not own automobiles receive nothing while those with large luxury cars or gas guzzlers or those who drive the farthest receive the most super cheap gasoline also encourages excessive driving and casual unnecessary trips contributing to heavy traffic and air pollution iran s daily gas consumption is around 110 million liters among the highest in the world higher than germany france the uk another problematic aspect of super cheap gas prices is smuggling the government estimates that as much of one fifth of the gasoline is smuggled daily the price of gasoline in all neighboring countries pakistan afghanistan turkmenistan azerbaijan armenia turkey and iraq is significantly higher with a total of 3 662 miles of borders with its neighbors leave alone the gasoline smuggled by sea it is virtually impossible for iran to effectively stop the smuggling again this is not just the loss of gasoline but the subsidies spent on gasoline which directly benefit the smugglers the government decided to increase the price of gas to 15 000 rials per liter 52 cents per gallon for up to 60 liters 16 gallons per month for private vehicles that is an increase of 50 percent fuel purchased beyond the 60 liter monthly limit will now be sold at 30 000 rials per liter 1 05 per gallon even after this 300 percent increase which only applies to the amount of gas beyond the subsidized amount the price of gas in iran remains among the lowest in the world it is only 38 percent or a little over one third of u s gas prices even going forward it is highly likely that excessive consumption and smuggling of gas will still continue on a large scale although possibly at a somewhat reduced rate additionally high inflation the direct result of u s sanctions is likely to make gasoline still cheaper as a result of the expected decline in the value of the rial iran s currency without providing this context western media outlets predominantly portray the image of a greedy government engaging in price gouging mercilessly making its people suffer to line its own pockets whatever the extent of corruption and embezzlement among government officials and there are many documented cases of that subsidized super low gas prices have only enriched smugglers capitalist politicians and ideologues condemning iran for reducing the subsidies on gas are usually staunchly opposed to government subsidies on any commodities to them subsidies are a violation of the laws of the free market but when it comes to iran these devout free marketers all of a sudden go socialist outraged at the reduction of gas subsidies progressives on the other hand generally support subsidies and other means of easing the suffering of poor and working people under capitalism but it is not flat subsidies provided equally to all layers of society that they strive for and certainly not subsidies that disproportionately benefit the wealthy subsidies should benefit the lowest income sectors of society the iranian government has announced that the amount saved on the gas subsidies is intended to raise about 2 55 billion a year for extra subsidies to 18 million families struggling on low incomes in response to the possible dismissal of this announcement as mere propaganda it should be pointed out that the government already pays people cash subsidies on a monthly basis it deposits funds directly to the bank accounts of up to 70 percent of the population were protests large within hours western media labeled the unrest as mass protests messages of support for the protesters started pouring in u s secretary of state mike pompeo said to the people of iran the united states is with you even king salman of saudi arabia an obvious expert on democracy and human rights eventually got in on the act inviting iran to stop the chaos and destruction amnesty international announced that at least 106 people had been killed and that the actual number was probably much higher the available images of the street actions do not suggest anywhere near this level of casualties but amnesty claimed that its estimate was based on eyewitness reports the iranian government has dismissed amnesty s report as baseless allegations and fabricated figures citing the need to prevent the coordination of the activities of foreign agents the iranian government cut off iran s internet to external sites except for government institutions and universities access to sites within the country and bank and other business transactions requiring domestic internet access were maintained as of this writing nov 23 international internet access has been restored but not to mobile devices one reason for iran cutting off international internet access was likely to minimize the number of images that would be posted all over the internet and social media in the west the islamic republic does not want the dissemination of images portraying iran as a country in chaos conversely the united states israel and saudi arabia want nothing more than promoting precisely the image of a country on the verge of collapse on nov 22 pompeo called on iranian people to send us their videos photos and information documenting the regime s crackdown on protesters the u s will expose and sanction the abuses on the same day the u s imposed sanctions on iran s communications minister mohammad javad azari jahromi in punishment for blocking internet access despite the cutoff of foreign access to the internet plenty of images have made it outside the country the internet cutoff came some time after the beginning of the protests so a large number of video clips and photos already got out besides it is virtually impossible to block all means of communication it is not difficult to smuggle images on a simple thumb drive or on a laptop hard drive over thousands of miles of border nor is it impossible to send encrypted images through the government and university offices where internet access to the outside remained in the days to come surely many more videos and pictures will emerge pompeo will undoubtedly get his wish still we are unlikely to see previously unexposed images of mass protests and huge outpourings of people a clear picture is emerging of the character of the protests from what can already be seen actual protests appear to have been of modest sizes while there was an impressive campaign of destruction and sabotage according to the iranian government what started as peaceful protests by ordinary people was quickly taken over by paid agents bent on maximizing damage and destruction it is also likely that in some instances the fires and the destruction were the first or only act not the end result of genuine protests many of the widely circulated clips show dozens of people who can more accurately be described as spectators than protesters standing around while buildings and cars are burning down others show streets and freeways blocked with people getting out of their cars and looking around the few clips of people chanting and protesting show dozens or at most hundreds of demonstrators of course the term mass protest is loosely defined when it comes to u s protests every activist knows that neither the media nor the local or national governments characterize even protests of thousands as mass protests it is instructive that the participation of dozens or hundreds qualifies as mass protests when the actions take place in a country on the u s hit list the level of destruction strongly suggests a deliberate campaign of vandalism and destruction when people spontaneously demonstrate in the streets sometimes angry protesters do property damage as in breaking store windows turning over trash cans or burning tires but destruction of property appears to have been the primary objective not the byproduct of most of the street actions according to fars news agency the violence saw rioters setting fire to as many as 80 department stores across the country incurring a damage of 170 billion tomans more than 40 million the damage has wrecked between 50 to 100 percent of the facilities structures dozens possibly hundreds of gas stations around the country were set on fire in addition the rioters set police stations banks office buildings medical clinics cars motorcycles stores and people s residences on fire iran s security forces have reported arresting 100 leaders of the riot with some sources reporting much higher numbers on nov 17 tehran police reported arresting seven men riding in a pickup truck armed with incendiary material who had set five banks on fire in rapid succession in this instance the individuals arrested were not iranian but from a country east of iran officials report having arrested elements with ties to the mko a pro u s opposition force monarchists and people with criminal histories probably paid for these operations with the vast amounts of money that the united states and saudi arabia are willing to pay to bring about their long sought goal of regime change in iran there is little doubt that at least some of the acts of sabotage were carried out by paid agents vandalism and destruction appear to have been the bulk of what happened there were of course individuals protesting the rise in gasoline prices and even if these individuals were seemingly a small part of the overall picture in this instance there is no doubt a social base for those who wish to protest the rise in gas prices inflation in general and the very existence of the islamic republic broadly exposing the extreme overstatement and exaggeration of pro imperialist media about the width and breadth of the protests should not be confused with denying the possibility that protests can in the future be significant in size as they were during the right wing green movement in 2009 are people united against the islamic republic a common propaganda tactic of the capitalist class is to portray every protest no matter how large or small as representative of the entire population the narrative that emerges is the people versus the dictator whether it is venezuela nicaragua syria or iran in addition to overstating the strength of anti government protests a necessary component of this propaganda campaign is to provide little to no coverage of street actions that do not conform to their dominant narrative similarly in the last week alone there have been two sets of large scale demonstrations real mass protests in support of the islamic republic and against the campaign of destruction and sabotage and its u s sponsors but the average person following the news likely knows nothing about these protests participants in these marches the latest on nov 22 were clear in their message that economic hardships are the direct result and the stated purpose of the illegal u s sanctions on iran the vast majority of these demonstrators are from the working class and the poor the very sectors most suffering under the economic hardships caused by the sanctions u s support for the people u s officials shedding crocodile tears for the people of iran is particularly insulting in the words of assal rad a research fellow at the national iranian american council the trump administration could end its collective punishment by giving iranians the economic relief they were promised under the jcpoa lift sanctions and allow iran to sell its oil but of course it is not support for the iranian people that the u s is interested in instead the trump administration is attempting to starve the iranian people to create instability and overthrow the state as in the case of cuba the dprk and venezuela the u s imposes debilitating sanctions on countries it wants to overthrow then it cites the damage inflicted on the economies of the targeted countries as evidence that their governments are corrupt and incompetent iran is far from a socialist state but its capitalist economy with its large and strong state sector provides a significant obstacle to penetration by international corporate capital politically not only does tehran refuse to follow washington s dictates it is a strong force in the region against imperialist dominance there is a reason that successive u s administrations since the revolution of 1979 have pursued regime change in iran to them independence and national development must be crushed for that same reason revolutionaries and progressives in the u s should stand with iran s independence against u s imperialism workers and oppressed people in the u s have nothing to gain from imperialist adventures abroad the same capitalist ruling class that is oppressing people here is oppressing people around the globe revolutionaries and progressives should unite in demanding u s hands off iran

dr fiona hill the british born us public servant spoke this week at the trump impeachment hearings about being born in bishop auckland in the north of england saying this country offered me opportunities i would never have had in england i grew up poor with a very distinctive working class accent in england in the 1980s this would have impeded my professional advancement it wasn t meant to be like this john major spoke of the classless society and john prescott just before the 1997 election asserted that we re all middle class now yet earlier this year tony blair defending his premiership stated we made the uk more equal only to be corrected by the institute for fiscal studies who commented that labour had not read more safeguards are a myth in the banana republic boris johnson has created danny dorling academic and author of inequality and the 1 thinks things are getting worse and predicted that the uk is on a trajectory to become the most unequal of the richest twenty five nations of the world not only are the best off 1 getting richer there is growing inequality at the top with the ultra rich 0 1 leaving everyone else behind as the uk experienced a decade of stagnation for most people the richest 1 000 families saw their wealth double quantitative easing by the bank of england over inflated assets and provided a state backed bonanza inflating the portfolios of the super rich this is part of a wider phenomenon with the global top 5 capturing 44 of the increase in global wealth since the 1990s dorling thinks we should simmer with rage at this the class injustices that most angers me in the uk today are the extremes we now tolerate which my parents generation did not he said this is the return of benjamin disraeli s two nations you can today be born into a class and be more likely in future to die freezing on the streets as compared to your chances of going to the kind of university that will propel you forward selina todd of oxford university an expert on class in britain points to the negative impact of changes in the workforce where under capitalism most of us are obliged to work for a living and without strong trade unions and workers co operatives we re at the mercy of employers whims and desire for profit private education accounts for 7 of the school age population but that tiny minority have huge disproportionate power 42 of oxford university undergraduates are privately educated 37 of cambridge and durham 35 6 of st andrews and 33 6 of edinburgh this feeds into britain s elites 74 of judges 71 of barristers and 71 of senior military figures are privately educated the same is the case in areas less associated with the traditional establishment 60 of british winners of oscars 62 of bafta winners and 41 of uk medalists at the london olympics also went to fee paying schools the british political class at westminster have a disproportionate number of privately educated mps the total in the outgoing parliament was 29 of all mps varying from 44 conservative 30 lib dems 13 labour and 6 snp the number of scottish parliament politicians who were privately educated was 20 at the last election of boris johnson s cabinet 64 are privately educated and even worse johnson is the 20th uk prime minister out of 55 to be educated at eton david cameron having been the 19th nine prime ministers were educated at non fee paying schools including wilson heath callaghan thatcher major brown and may read more it s time westminster ditched unfair system of first past the post the pernicious impact of private education damages society as selina todd observes private education legitimates inequality it suggests that the elite who run the country are brighter than the rest of us by giving a small group of children a step up at an early age private education hides the bare fact that the boris johnsons of this world owe their place to their families wealth and greed class and inequality are aided by the continuation of deference which reinforces the entitlement culture of boris johnson and the royal family leading to prince andrew s long term friendship with sex abuser jeffrey epstein because he never thought he would be held accountable deference is legitimised by reactionary nostalgia and a selective view of the past step forward downton abbey the tv series and film released this year written by tory peer julian fellowes as the cultural critic stuart jeffries noted the franchise fits into the reactionary keep calm and carry on ethos that has permeated austerity britain urging political quietism on those suffering most jacob rees mogg s recent book the victorians twelve titans who forged britain eleven men and queen victoria describes the victorian era as characterised by moral certainty wise confidence and of course patriotism all of this has a particular english currency scotland wales and northern ireland are not immune to class divisions and the power of elites but a powerful vision of england of the countryside rural traditions and a romantic version of the past has become associated with the politics of reaction class does play a major part in scotland private education disfigures society we just tend to talk about it less university principals 57 and scottish judges 45 are two groups with high levels of private education while 24 of edinburgh secondary school pupils attend fee paying schools life expectancy is falling in the uk the gap between the glasgow suburb of lenzie and the east end area of calton a mere eight miles apart for a child born in 2013 is 28 years that is the sort of social apartheid we have come to associate with american towns and cities with chicago having a gap in life chances of 30 years and two towns in north carolina of 41 years british society is disfigured by treating working class lives as expendable the new series of the crown brought home how little progress has been made when it portrayed the tragedy of aberfan where a colliery spoil tip fell on the welsh town in october 1966 killing 144 people including 116 children this was avoidable and the dangers warned of with the ultimate responsibility laid at the door of the national coal board fast forward to the grenfell tower fire in june 2017 when 72 people died this was a result of terrible decisions the type of cladding put round the tower block to save money deregulation the housing policies of the tory run royal borough of kensington and chelsea and the decision on the night of the fire of london fire brigade to tell residents to remain in their flats subsequently two years of tory inaction on cladding and housing standards in england culminated in the recent bolton student accommodation fire which fortunately resulted in no fatalities is it possible that britain and scotland can change from this grim picture thirty years of post war labour government have with the exception of clement attlee made little dent on the citadels of power and privilege it is unlikely despite the radical plans of the labour manifesto launched last week that jeremy corbyn will get a mandate to implement far reaching change this leaves us with the challenge to act in scotland despite 20 years of the scottish parliament we have made little progress on social justice but have taken the decision to turn our backs on the most brutal westminster cuts and welfare policies that hurt the most vulnerable todd thinks action should start with private education and closing the tax loopholes enjoyed by elite private schools and using that money to improve the lives of all children leading to the integration of private schools into the state system creating a comprehensive free non selective education system scotland will end business tax relief for private schools from 2020 21 dorling believes we need to start at the top curtailing the excesses of the rich and starting with six of the best take the six mostly highly endowed public schools the six companies who pay their ceo the most the six richest colleges of both oxford and cambridge universities the six richest families in london the richest families of the uk all live in london and levy a tenth of their wealth every year in a windfall tax this is a major factor in this election privilege elite arrogance and the grotesque inequalities which disfigure the uk addressing this and putting it into reverse is going to require political leadership public pressure and taking on vested interests being prepared to do so will decide not only the future of society but ultimately of scotland and the uk

many cryptocurrencies have been launched in the past few years often to great fanfare and celebration only to fade and fail as the public and investors shun them according to coinopsy which tracks such failures there are some 1 085 dead coins at the time of writing that s a substantial number even next to the approximately 3 000 still in existence and senior industry figures expect many of those to fail too why do so many of these projects unravel you expect many initiatives to come and go in a fledgling market of course the 1990s dotcom bubble is the perfect example but at the same time cryptocurrency developers have traditionally spent too little time designing the business use case for their coins and tokens then only realising after the launch that their idea is yesterday s news time and again we see launches that copy a previously successful coin coin x is the new bitcoin for example yet the market already has bitcoin and it continues to be in demand as evidenced by the 18 millionth bitcoin being mined only last month we tend to overlook this problem with developers even while we rightly criticise regulators for not being able to keep up with the fast evolution of the crypto market despite efforts such as howey coin by us regulator the sec which was a fake new coin offering designed to teach investors about the risks of putting money into crypto another common error among developers is that many coins and tokens try to solve a problem that is either irrelevant or does not exist in the view of many venture capitalists that would include coins trying to promote loyalty or be a forward purchase of a product which has yet to be produced no doubt these kinds of developer errors will continue here are several other themes that we think will have a bearing on future crypto failures 1 big finance has arrived eleven years ago the pseudonymous satoshi nakamoto quietly revolutionised money with the release of his or her now famous white paper that outlined bitcoin in the early years after this vision took off many of those who launched altcoins and tokens were small teams of developers and leftfield entrepreneurs they had a clear mission to bring the world of traditional finance and central banks to its knees with decentralised units of exchange that were beyond anyone s control a few years on these bank killers have largely been assimilated by the big financial institutions they once sought to challenge wall street is steadily taking charge of the crypto action professionalising trading with the likes of derivatives and futures products we may now be entering a phase where only large institutions will be able to generate profit from cryptocurrency design it seems increasingly likely that the next revolutionary white paper will be generated by a global multi billion dollar firm an ironic full turn of events to say the least many other cryptocurrencies from more humble beginnings will fail in future simply because they don t have the resources to compete with these huge institutions they will be driven by sunk costs and the crypto dream to dominate the future of money but in many cases it won t be enough 2 the future is stable for a cryptocurrency to be successful two things need to happen there has to be a reason why people want to use it and they have to trust it people will generally trust a coin or token thanks to the underpinning blockchain technology the decentralised cryptographic ledger systems on which this industry is built this means that the basis upon which the market judges if a new launch will stand or fall is mainly its use case there are now altcoins in existence offering everything from new ways to fund web advertising to units of exchange in the gaming world but more generally in a world in which it is no longer enough to simply claim to have launched a better bitcoin the market s attention has pivoted towards stablecoins stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to avoid the wild volatility of cousins like bitcoin by being pegged or backed by assets like traditional currencies or precious metals they are designed to encourage people to use cryptocurrency for everyday buying and selling while also offering a stable store of value for traders on the many crypto exchanges that don t deal in traditional currencies examples include usd coin and tether both of which are equivalent to us 1 the fact that it takes considerable financial resources and infrastructure to make such coins operational is again likely to favour large institutions witness facebook s attempt to launch the libra stablecoin for instance 3 losses more foul than fair many investors have lost money through scams in the crypto world one recent notorious example is the alleged onecoin ponzi scam in which investors were promised guaranteed 300 returns for investing bitcoin or us dollars with a nevada based outfit the money was supposed to be ploughed into foreign exchange options and altcoins but was allegedly instead used to pay off other investors in the scheme fortune magazine recently speculated that onecoin may have generated losses in excess of the us 19 4 billion 15 billion racked up by bernie maddoff s ponzi victims in 2008 somewhat different was bitconnect an exchange in which investors could swap bitcoin for bitconnect coins which would be lent out with claimed returns of up to 120 per year after longstanding ponzi accusations the us authorities stepped in last year and the exchange abruptly closed bitconnect coins plunged 96 in value creating huge losses though they still exist and trade today an alternative problem is hackers raiding exchanges the most infamous example is the mt gox attack of 2014 in which over 850 000 bitcoins were stolen and never recovered more recently the binance exchange one of the world s largest has been hacked several times costing investors tens of millions of dollars one other alarming case was that of gerald cotten the 30 year old founder of canadian cryptocurrency exchange quadriga who died a year ago because nobody had access to his passwords the investments of 115 000 customers worth us 137m were unrecoverable when a court appointed auditor was eventually able to access his account it turned out the assets had all been sold months before cotten died we fully expect these sorts of problems to continue and this shouldn t be surprising we are talking about a toxic combination of anonymous technology that is largely unregulated poorly understood and cheap and easy to move around the world and many people willing to kiss frogs in their search for a lucrative prince
george halstead american renaissance september 2002 we read with increasing interest of the successes in europe of far right immigration control parties in austria belgium france denmark holland and even in britain how could we achieve similar results in the united states the most recent european nationalist gains are largely a reaction to increasing anger over third world immigration and muslim terrorism since we have these problems in america why aren t we seeing nationalist politics here americans are supposed to be politically savvy we send political consultants all over the world the events of september 11th clearly create an opening for politicians and parties smart enough to use them what are the techniques and strategies that would work for us there are three different ways to send a racial message to politicians build racial traditionalist blocs within the two main parties develop new kinds of political action committees to spread racialist ideas and support candidates who advance them build a racialist third party from one of the existing small conservative parties these approaches are not mutually exclusive and would have the greatest effect if they were all adopted at the same time it is all very well to pretend to be above politics to insist on ideological purity to spin out theories about the perfect nationalist state or to dream about some future racialist revolution but this is laziness and self indulgence political change follows well established rules and until racialists learn to apply those rules to achieve their goals they are nothing more than complainers and hobbyists within the parties some parties are obviously more useful for our movement than others but let us first examine what appear to be the least promising potential supporters liberals and democrats certainly the left is anti white and filled with activists many of them white who appear to look forward to the day when whites cease to exist still there is a remnant of white democrats and honest liberals who are uneasy about this they may try to bury their racial consciousness or may be unable to articulate why it is proper to have one some unfortunately may think they have no home for their pro white views because they don t like the political issues on the right this kind of thinking can change democratic support for a white nationalist could come from white union members for example while most of the afl cio union leadership like john sweeney peddle an anti white program the dues paying members are not buying it they oppose mass immigration and are often the people who suffer most from school integration and changing neighborhoods other potential supporters traditionally aligned with the left are hiding in the environmentalist movement which is overwhelmingly white like the unions rank and file environmentalists oppose immigration despite what their leaders say groups like sierrans for us population stabilization the carrying capacity network comprehensive us sustainable population and population environment balance oppose immigration because it drives up the population produces sprawl and congestion and strains our parks and natural resources they make no openly racialist arguments but our goals are the same and we should work together it is true that the democratic party has only limited potential for nationalist candidates however as the party dissolves into something like an ethnic spoils system for non whites a considerable number of white liberals may find themselves without a home already the democrats choose their convention delegates by racial quota this may help explain the stream of whites leaving the democrats for the green party the greens are almost exclusively white and no amount of outreach will change this only whites seem to care much about recycling overpopulation or saving the whales and the greens are not likely to offer better goodies to non whites then the democrats admittedly the number of white democrats and liberals with an incipient racial consciousness is small but racialists must learn that politics is about building coalitions sometimes you need to work with unlikely groups to defeat a common foe it is for example an odd coalition of conservative democrats and pro gun republicans that has stopped gun control as white racial consciousness spreads support and even promising candidates could emerge from unlikely quarters and this may prove to be more the rule than the exception white nationalists must therefore be prepared for unlikely alliances there is a lesson to be learned from the late charismatic and openly homosexual dutch nationalist pim fortuyn highly critical of islamic immigration into the netherlands fortuyn attracted a large following and was ultimately assassinated by an animal rights activist fortuyn appears to have thought third world immigration should stop not because the immigrants are non white but because they cannot assimilate to his lefty libertine way of thinking fortuyn once said before a television audience don t talk to me about racism i know more about moroccan boys than anyone at this table most racialists strongly disapprove of pederasty but fortuyn was an ally on the question that matters most keeping white countries white fortuyn s candidacy and the events of september 11th may cause some american homosexuals and potentially influential ones to reconsider their thinking on race some white feminists have also awakened to the dangers of multiculturalism which brings such things as female genital mutilation polygamy bride snatching and wide spread contempt for women even the liberal columnist bonnie erbe advocates a more cautious approach to immigration the very statistics on rape and wife beating feminists love to trot out can be turned to our advantage since the racial disproportions in these crimes are enormous our movement would gain greatly by teaching white women about the hugely lopsided problem of interracial rape and violence all these people feminists environmentalists even homosexuals are potential allies our movement should not tie itself to a single group or political party coalitions work when different groups concentrate on what they care about in common narrow mindedness and excessive purity must not stop us from building coalitions republicans clearly the republican party is the home of the largest number of potential supporters but this is only the most obvious reason why potential racialist candidates should run as republicans another reason is that if they run as democrats they are likely be ignored for example ralph hall is a strong conservative democratic congressman from texas but no one has ever heard of him he is not exactly a racial nationalist but he has a better voting record than any but the staunchest republicans the lefties and greens can ignore him because liberals and minorities will always control the democratic party regardless of how many ralph halls or even george wallaces win office mr hall will never get into the leadership and he won t change the democrats positions on things an even better example of the democrats ability to ignore outsiders is david duke in 1975 and again in 1979 mr duke ran unsuccessfully for the louisiana senate as a democrat and was ignored he caused a fuss only when he started running as a republican of course winning a seat as a republican in the state house in 1989 caused a huge fuss and could not have been ignored even if he had run as democrat on the other hand it is not impossible that a white racialist democrat may some day be elected perhaps from a conservative white district special interest groups and from a political point of view that is what we are should not put all their eggs in one basket we need all the allies we can get and should look for them in all quarters we should not despise conservatives because they have come only so far bear grudges or avoid tactical friendships with people with whom we disagree on other matters we must encourage and applaud people for the useful things they are willing to do or say rather than criticize them for the things they are not yet ready to do or say what would happen if a solid attractive white nationalist ran for federal office as a republican it would be like setting off a neutron bomb the media would swarm the bush people would scream he doesn t represent the party republicans are terrified of anyone who talks about immigration affirmative action welfare or crime in explicitly racial terms because the base of the republican party is overwhelmingly white and the gop will do anything to prevent a racial appeal to that white base when david duke ran as a republican party bosses urged voters to back his democrat opponent even lee atwater deputy campaign manager for ronald reagan in 1984 and campaign manager for george bush in 1988 caused an uproar when he ran ads criticizing then governor of massachusetts michael dukakis s prisoner furloughs that allowed black convict willie horton to get out and rape and murder a white couple atwater went out of his way to act friendly to blacks and talked up his interest in blues music but was still demonized though the resulting landslide victory in 1988 suggests racial appeals are effective of course a strategy of promoting racial issues that appeal to white voters would help the republican party tremendously despite the fears of its timid leaders as steve sailer has shown increasing the white vote by only a few percentage points would give the republican party landslide results a racially explicit appeal is like medicine a sick child refuses to take a racialist candidate without the baggage of a david duke has a chance in a rock solid district chicago s alan spitz ran for congress and even made an appeal for support at an ar conference but his multi ethnic chicago district is not the best kind the ideal district should be overwhelmingly white and largely immune from establishment pressures how could a racialist campaign succeed a small white state like wyoming or north dakota each with a population of approximately 500 000 might be capable of electing a racialist or nationalist republican to the senate this would certainly not be easy but running a senate campaign in wyoming or north dakota is a lot easier than running one in say new jersey it is almost like running a congressional campaign anywhere else because the numbers are small wyoming is 92 1 percent white in the 2000 senate election republican sen craig thomas spent 762 833 versus 4 000 spent by the democrat sen thomas received 152 622 votes and his opponent received 47 087 in short a us senate election was decided for under 1 million and by only 208 659 voters north dakota is 92 4 percent white the price of the 2000 senate race was higher but the total votes were still low sen byron dorgan d spent 2 312 543 for 176 470 votes his republican opponent spent 399 584 for 110 420 votes by contrast in the 2000 race for senate in new jersey democrat jon corzine spent 63 209 506 for 1 511 237 votes his republican challenger bob franks spent 6 389 936 for 1 420 267 votes admittedly the corzine expenditures from the candidates own fortune were abnormally high the 1996 campaign was more normal democrat bob torecelli spent 9 134 854 for 1 519 154 votes while his opponent dick zimmer spent 8 238 181 for 1 227 351 the value of electing a senator as opposed to a congressman from a smaller white state is that one senator can bring that whole body to a halt unlike in the house which does not have the filibuster presumably republicans and democrats could easily cobble together the 60 votes needed to shut off filibusters by this hypothetical hated senator from wyoming or north dakota but what if this republican man or woman like australia s pauline hanson came with no anti semitic or kkk baggage and were very hard hitting and eloquent on issues like immigration and affirmative action there might be a breakthrough both parties would have trouble containing there is a real fear in the establishment that racialist contagion could break out within the republican party in a way it never could in the democratic party what if this hypothetical senator raised issues that appealed to voters from democratic senator ben nelson s largely white home state of nebraska or democratic senator zell miller s home state of georgia or republican senator trent lott s white mississippi voters it would be harder for these senators to vote against some of the issues our hypothetical senator raised these senators would be under pressure back home which might force them to stand with an open racialist at least on some issues but even in the house of representatives a racial realist congressman could be an effective force republican congressman tom tancredo has proven to be a one man dynamo on immigration reform since coming to congress from colorado in 1998 mr tancredo has started the immigration reform caucus which has over 60 members mr tancredo is also the lead sponsor of the mass immigration reduction act or h r 2712 which abolishes dual citizenship and sets a five year moratorium on immigration after the moratorium the president would have to show that immigration would not damage the environment reduce wages or strain public facilities like schools and hospitals mr tancredo has gone toe to toe with the bush administration over immigration and has constantly opposed attempts to amnesty illegals the right man in congress can make a lot of trouble the districts and states that are part of the immigration reform caucus are the ones politically oriented ar readers should think about largely white these districts are probably immune from the daily effects of america s crazy racial policies high crime mass third world immigration bilingual multicultural education and affirmative action all these things happen to other people in other places their top issues are likely to be local education roads agriculture etc the war on terrorism may have changed this only slightly if a candidate ran on local issues in such a district while candidly acknowledging support for ending mass immigration and affirmative action he might not suffer the same outrage or scrutiny as someone running in manhattan people in these white districts wouldn t be sifting every speech for code words once in congress he could use his office to elevate racial issues just as mr tancredo has done with immigration coming from a largely white district he would not inspire the kind of voter backlash a politician in a multicultural district certainly would if anything a candidate from a safe district would be able to raise money from whites in districts that cannot field racialist politicians he would become a fundraising darling and could help other candidates jesse helms for example raises considerable amounts of money from outside his district and has supporters as far away as hawaii who is the ideal candidate he should be middle aged and mature not just out of college he should be married and have established himself in a career or business he should have no radical baggage and he should have spent 20 years or so in the district he should be a member of local civic groups like the rotary club lions club knights of columbus the american legion etc since they offer excellent community networks tip o neill always said politicians should join these groups but not be leaders because leaders get caught up in faction fights the ideal candidate would be wealthy wealthy people know other wealthy people who are potential donors he should be willing to spend a good chunk of his own money on the race and be able to spend half his time fundraising money of course is a problem but as the examples of campaign war chests in wyoming and north dakota show the problem is not insurmountable after the election the fun would begin imagine a us senator holding a press conference on the crisis of the american iq or reading ar articles live on c span into the congressional record even if only two or three racialists were elected to congress they could start a white congressional caucus just one or two would cause plenty of headaches for the beltway crowd most americans are simply unaware of the issues that concern ar readers so even if it started out small a racialist group would have tremendous impact republican leaders would try to get rid of these people probably by running liberal primary challengers against them however if there were a healthy alternative conservative third party the targeted republicans could threaten to bolt the gop such a threat might forestall a primary challenge altogether it would set up a difficult choice for the republican leadership who could either accept these mavericks in their party or risk seeing an emerging nationalist third party take away votes and politicians from their right party switching is nothing new and when the balance of the house or senate hangs by only a few seats a small group of republican congressman threatening to switch to a nationalist party would give party leaders a lot to think about if any sitting congressman or senator actually did switch to a nationalist third party it would give that party strong national recognition success builds on success and having even just a few national office holders gives a party credibility pressure groups any racial realist candidate would need outside groups for support money is always the biggest need and candidates need large blocs of identified voters to whom they can direct appeals racialist politicians would also need firm moral support to keep them from being swayed especially once they had tasted the pleasures of office this of course brings us to the intersection of politics and the ongoing culture wars a political action committee pac devoted to racial issues could fight the public relations battle while it helped good candidates in any party several current political action committees offer models for racial nationalists to consider bundling is a technique used by some of the most effective pacs and racial national activists could pool their money the same way until recently the most an individual could give to a political candidate per election was 1 000 a figure established in the early 1970s and long out of date because of inflation the recent increase to 2 000 still does not approach the increase in the costs of campaigning and even a pac can give no more than 5 000 in its own name these small amounts of money don t buy influence a candidate who has to raise several million dollars need not pay that much attention to a source that provides only a few thousand a bundler works as a middleman to raise money nationally for one specific issue and then drops large chunks of attention getting money into the campaigns of candidates who support the issue bundling does not increase the amount an individual can give a candidate the bundler has to be careful not to channel more than 2 000 from a particular donor to any candidate but any donor who gave say 10 000 could have his contribution split into separate bundles for five or more different candidates the ideological leverage of that money is greatly increased when the bundler gathers many contributions into a substantial sum and delivers it with a very specific message candidates send nice thank you letters to people who give 2 000 they do a lot more than that when they get 50 000 steven moore s club for growth is a good example of a conservative bundler that supports only strong supply siders its success is measured by the extent to which it is feared and loathed by establishment republican leaders which is considerable the club may bundle 100 000 from individual donors and drop it on a candidate it likes if that supply side republican makes it to office he will know who helped him get there and if he ever goes wobbly on a tax cut or some other issue important to the club of growth he will hear about it right away the club also gets involved in funding primary campaigns for promising candidates so anyone who double crosses the club knows he could face the unpleasantness of a hard fought primary the club describes itself this way we combine your contribution with those of other club members greatly magnifying the impact of your contribution in our first election in 2000 club members and our political committee spent 2 4 million to help get our kind of candidates elected since then our membership has tripled a lefty bundler is emily s list which stands for early money is like yeast it helps the dough rise this group www emilyslist org which funnels money to pro abortion rights democrats actually pioneered the concept of bundling we are huge says ellen r malcolm president and founder of the group we are the biggest fundraiser of hard money other than the parties in the country in 1999 2000 the group raised 18 million which it spent exclusively on pro abortion feminists emily s list doesn t just make campaign contributions it mobilizes 68 000 supporters does more polling than the democratic national committee runs tv ads for and against candidates staffs campaigns and provides strategic advice needless to say it is possible to run for congress or even for state house on national rather than regional issues and to try to raise money from the whole country rather than just your district it is possible but it is hard it is much easier if a candidate has a group doing the work for him emily s list doesn t waste time on wealthy donors who are not feminists and it doesn t waste time on candidates who are not feminists emily s list and the club for growth raise money from rich donors but bundling works with small donations too michael farris who was the republican nominee for lt governor of virginia in 1993 started the madison project in 1994 to support homeschooling donations of 5 10 and 25 go to the madison project which bundles them and drops substantial sums into the coffers of sympathetic candidates bundling can make a real difference candidates spend an enormous amount of time meeting with men s church breakfasts at league of women voters debates going to knights of columbus meetings seeking the endorsement of police unions analyzing poll results going over direct mail content mulling advertising buys walking door to door in the district pepping up volunteers at campaign headquarters and countless other things a hefty donation from a bundler means that much less time spent franticly raising money at the same time a bundler saves ideologically committed donors the bother of scouring the country for candidates to support donors can drop large checks into the bundler s account confident the money will go to the cause there may not be any candidates in the donor s own district who pay attention to the issues he cares about but if he is willing to go outside his district the bundler can help and by combining small donations can crack the ideological whip far more effectively than the scattered individuals from whom the money came originally in effect bundling is a way to inject national issues into any local race the national rifle association and the israel lobby have been doing it for years see below other bundlers are following with their own issues and racial issues are perfect for a national approach of this kind david duke raised a lot of money for his louisiana races from outside the state but did it in a clumsy catch as catch can way a pac bundler devoted to straight racial issues would make life much easier for future candidates aipac and nra non white lobbying groups are well known but there have been effective white ethnic lobbies too irish italian polish and especially jewish the most effective is the american israel public affairs committee aipac which rallies jewish support for israel it takes an openly ethnocentric nationalist approach and white nationalists should copy it aipac has an annual budget of 19 5 million a staff of 130 and 60 000 members it has very effective people both in washington and in the field to keep congressmen up to date and in line and a large part of its budget is spent on lobbying part of its effectiveness is due to its dedication to a single issue its website is geared towards activism including a campus section devoted to pro israel activities for college students the site includes links to regional offices in all 50 states aipac provides congress with dependable and up to date information on israel aipac members donate money to campaigns since aipac itself does not make endorsements or give money american nationalists could learn from studying the israel boosters after the israel lobby the national rifle association nra is probably the most successful promoter of a political cause the amount of money the nra raises and distributes in an election cycle about 18 million a year is small compared to the budgets of any federal agency teeming with liberal bureaucrats still the nra can rightly take credit for helping republicans win control of congress in 1994 by mobilizing against the democrats assault weapons ban and keeping al gore out of the white house by denying him the three crucial gun friendly states of tennessee arkansas and west virginia democrats have for now wisely dropped any big national push for gun control how does the nra wield such power in the face of unrelenting media hatred and with so many organizations opposed to it one answer lies in its single issue focus if the nra tried to deal with both guns and tax reform for example it could not accomplish as much gun owners who want a flat tax would fight those who want a national sales tax second they have identified the voters who agree with them on this single issue and can create something called voter intensity nra voters care much more about guns then the average voter does by concentrating their firepower on pro gun candidates the nra is an effective minority even if a majority of voters are vaguely against guns aipac and all other effective advocacy groups do the same thing the nra mobilizes its people by communicating directly with them through phone banks direct mail newsletters magazines paid tv infomercials etc this informs members and at the same time bypasses the media filter voters who have been identified and informed by the nra can resist the countervailing winds of the popular culture finally the nra runs its own public relations efforts directed at the wider public with slick spokesman like wayne lapierre charlton heston and tanya metaksa it also runs a program in schools called the eddie the eagle gunsafe program this helps soften and counter the media s relentlessly negative image immigration is probably the great untapped issue around which an nra like organization could mobilize whites european nationalists have tied immigration to crime and the rise of islam and have created a new dynamic in european politics there are other issues that might work for whites but are probably not as good one is crime but many whites have already moved out of non white areas to get away from it the whites for whom crime is still a real problem may be too poor to move or too few to have an impact on politics affirmative action could be another galvanizing issue but many see it as something that happens to other whites not them also there is already a national consensus building against it and it may not survive the next supreme court challenge education could be an issue since multiculturalism and bilingualism are part of the overall anti white agenda but the white middle class families who move to the suburbs are by and large content with their public schools if they aren t there are private schools what makes these issues tame compared to immigration is that conservatives have been railing against crime education bilingualism and affirmative action for years granted without much success conservatives do not acknowledge the specifically anti white character of these things but they oppose them even linda chavez and ward connerly battle affirmative action us english opposes bilingualism and promotes official english the heritage foundation and other conservative think tanks are happy to oppose affirmative action bilingualism crime and so forth these issues and groups are not controversial among beltway conservatives what these groups avoid is immigration notice how the conservative website townhall censors immigration columns by phyllis schlafly and paul craig roberts immigration is too hot for townhall to handle david horowitz has written a book with the cheeky title hating whitey but he is silent on third world immigration immigration is probably one of the few truly radioactive political issues left probably because it constitutes the greatest threat to whites as a group and is the most promising focus for raising white consciousness what would an immigration pac with a nice budget do for example it could use telemarketing to identify all the voters who see immigration as their number one issue it would be easy to do this in a state like alabama for example which has seven congressional districts in the 2000 presidential election there were 1 666 272 ballots cast in the state this voter list could be pared down by various factors like age race location primary vote etc and at 45 cents a call a telemarketer could identify all the voters who favor immigration control for a total cost of around 585 000 while that figure may seem high some of the costs could be defrayed if the calls also made a fundraising pitch everyone says he hates these calls but they work especially the political ones the public doesn t so much mind political surveys because it likes to have its views heard and fundraising calls work too this immigration voter list could be matched to mailing addresses and combined with direct mail which could identify potential donors the funds generated from the donor mailings could be used to mail to all the voters who are concerned about immigration the pac could find donors voters and activists it could raise money to support and oppose candidates it could commission research and briefing papers it could spend money to get out the vote and buy radio and tv ads it would do for immigration control what the nra does for guns third parties european parliamentary systems make it much easier to put dissenting views and candidates before the voters our winner takes all system largely shuts out third parties but a racialist third party would be a tool for getting our message heard rather than an attempt to replace one of the two major parties if just one or two candidates were elected to office from a third party it would be a great boost to nationalist issues note how the british national party in great britain received worldwide attention from a shocked establishment after winning just three local council seats at the same time whenever third parties of either the left or the right gain any real support the major parties co opt their ideas so at the very least a nationalist party could nudge the gop to the right in the united states political movements have historically succeeded by taking over existing political institutions instead of trying to invent new ones the democratic party was once lead by southern segregationists and is now lead by former 1960s radicals the republican party was once lead by eastern establishment patricians even american third parties historically succeed by having their ideas adopted by one of the major parties there are already quite a few conservative third parties in this country the reform party howard phillips s constitution party the christian party the constitutionalist party which seems to be an imitation of the constitution party and the southern party there is also the southern independence party which split from the southern party and even an independent american party which is an offshoot of george wallace s american independent party which party should nationalists try to adopt as a vehicle for their ideas many people think the reform party is the best candidate but it is not pat buchanan and his brigades tried a hostile takeover in 2000 and have little to show for it what remains of the reform party ultimately belongs to ross perot and not the people as he likes to claim the reform party like its leader lacks a coherent view of america and its problems and few party members thought in racial terms during mr perot s first run in 1992 their main complaints were the deficit and some vague notion of ending the bickering in washington in 1996 the party promoted a protectionist message without any view on affirmative action multiculturalism or immigration when mr buchanan tried to take over the party mr perot threw up one roadblock after another and tacitly approved the breakaway candidate john hagelin of the natural law party who advocates such things as transcendental meditation for prisoners in the end mr buchanan and mr hagelin fought each other up until election day for ballot space and the party fizzled the question shouldn t be whether nationalists can take over the reform party but how they can get the reform party s voters an american nationalist movement could attract reform party voters by adopting mr buchanan s america first rhetoric precisely because it strikes the kind of nationalist tone that resonates with them while at the same time terrifying the multi culti elites if nationalists try to use an existing party rather than start yet another mr phillips s constitution party cp appears to be the best choice anyone who still has hopes for the reform party might note that this spring many of the reform party leaders in california and maryland defected to the cp in the most recent elections the cp was on the ballot in 43 states and mr phillips s supporters managed to make him eligible as a write in candidate in six other states while this is short of ideal it is a much better political infrastructure than any other third party alternative on the right and often sympathetic third parties end up endorsing the cp candidate rather than fielding one of their own the american independence party does this the cp calls for a moratorium on immigration and strong protection of the borders it opposes affirmative action bilingual education and foreign aid and would abolish the department of education joseph sobran who spoke at the 1994 american renaissance conference is a former vice presidential candidate for the constitution party this is yet another indication of why the cp could be a good fit for those tired of the status quo it shows that the cp and howard phillips are open to controversy but what about the rest of the party s platform some people would object to its protectionism but what is most striking about it is its religious appeal this could be more than a minor inconvenience but it is also a challenge and potential model for action what could be done to make the cp a vehicle for real nationalism first it should not jettison the traditional values of the religious right but it could attract new support with a new set of nationalist issues or rather by emphasizing issues already in its platform there is sure to be a strong vote for a candidate who will run with racial nationalist issues otherwise pat buchanan s the death of the west would not have stayed on the bestseller list week after week would howard phillips fight against a new direction for his party or would he welcome a new dose of energy and commitment some racialists and some on the religious right may view each other warily but the circle can be squared with a little give and take the religious traditionalists should be reminded that the west s historic faith takes a rather different view of racial issues than today s politically correct churches likewise atheists and agnostics shouldn t be put off by explicit talk of traditional american values including spiritual ones both groups could find synergy by working together also a political movement that can get the imprimatur of america s traditional clergy or at least some of it will be more respectable in the eyes of the public than one that gets total condemnation jean marie le pen s national front has fused traditionalist catholics with pagan whites to build a movement that is stronger than each group alone for blacks too preachers in the pulpit and activists in the street make an effective combination not just for blacks themselves but for the way others see their movement racial activists do not have to agree with every sermon their ministers preach in order to enjoy the combined effectiveness of working together a fusion of racial cultural issues would attract much of the hard hat blue collar working class these are people who like to hunt and drink beer and don t think very much about abortion but don t like racial preferences or mexican neighbors or osama bin laden there are plenty of white women who secretly think the same way or will go along with a man who does some racialists might argue in favor of a single issue immigration reform party that had the combined support of vdare fair aicf numbers usa and all the grass roots immigration control groups but i do not think that would be effective with nothing to say on any other issue the media would immediately label it the new know nothing party also a single issue party gives candidates no basis on which to face the local issues of a race for county commissioner village trustee or school board the constitution party would have a more fleshed out platform which could be given a distinctly racialist nationalist flavor this is important because racialists often seem to fantasize about trying to go for the top offices it is at every level from school boards to state legislatures to the white house that nationalist office holders can be critical in repealing anti white policies at virtually every level there is something to tackle be it multicultural anti western curricula bilingualism lax criminal justice coddling of illegal immigrants etc good as it is the constitution party does need a new name it only confused people when it switched recently from us taxpayers party to constitution party what does a constitution party member stand for the aclu s constitution or robert bork s a better name would be the conservative party since people would know right away what it stood for something else the party needs is a high profile national candidate for years howard phillips tried to woo pat buchanan as his standard bearer mr buchanan stayed within the republican party and then went to the reform party because it had money the current constitution party doesn t have much money and could use a big infusion to give it oomph but it is more philosophically coherent than the reform party ever was unfortunately there is no one on the horizon who would make a credible nationalist presidential candidate perhaps journalist ann coulter could be the american answer to australia s firebrand pauline hanson though she meets none of the criteria set out earlier for the ideal candidate she may not address racial issues in the way ar readers would like but she is hated by exactly the same people who hate ar she is a best selling author syndicated columnist and has easy access to the airwaves so she wouldn t have any problem with name recognition at least but far more important than speculating about ideal candidates is building institutions to support them racialists nationalists and traditionalists must not wait for a leader to descend from on high and lead them to victory the hard work is building the institutions and once they are good enough the candidates will come what would be the effect of a candidate with high name recognition running as a candidate of a nationalist cp a useful analogy is the effect ralph nader had on the otherwise moribund green party some in the party may have preferred a different candidate but his name recognition is high he gets free media and just having him on the ticket put the green party on the map what would be the effect of a high profile run for the cp first it would energize grass roots party activists who would probably succeed in getting the party on ballots in the remaining seven states second it would help strengthen the infrastructure of the cp so that even after the big name nationalist left the stage it would still be in a position to act as a check on squishy republicans this is what mr nader has done and is doing for the left via the green party third it would mean republicans couldn t take conservatives for granted it doesn t seem to occur to the republicans in name only rinos that conservatives might sit out an election or vote only for local candidates and ignore the unacceptable names the party puts up at the head of the ticket if a nationalist candidate were to appear the rinos would panic the media would probably give the candidate a chance to get his message out if only to hurt mr bush and thereby help elect a democrat another reason to launch a political jihad as early as 2004 would be to build a new institution for conservatives nationalists and racialists if the movement could energize a new group of activists as barry goldwater s run in 1964 did it would reap many long term rewards it would bring issues to the public the establishment prefers to ignore it would develop a new team of battle hardened veterans who would contribute enormously to the movement and it would thwart the rinos who say we have nowhere else to go there can be great value in what some would dismiss as obstructionist campaigns sometimes there is no other way to bring crucial issues to the fore jean marie le pen was essentially running an obstructionist campaign against tweedle dum and tweedle dee candidates mr le pen s chances of winning the presidency were slim to none but his obstructionism jolted the system and ended the political career of the socialist lionel jospin many americans simply don t know what immigration is doing to their country and anything that stirs them from somnolence is valuable if there were rumblings of a serious nationalist campaign i suspect the bush team would ditch the idea of amnesty for illegals if exploited properly the amnesty proposal could be a real weakness for the president the public s support of racial profiling after september 11 and the establishment s waffling over it could provide another opening besides getting our ideas to the general public there would be much to be gained in terrifying the rinos not to mention the sheer fun of making a lot of trouble the marriage of racial and traditional conservative issues would make a very potent party of the right that was a constant challenge to conventional wisdom as time passes all the issues conservatives care about will emerge in unmistakably racial terms it is our job to make race explicit to make it increasingly clear that a vote for a conservative third party candidate is a clear challenge to the racial status quo weak as they are conservative third parties may already be hurting republicans in federal elections more than liberal third parties are hurting democrats in the july issue of chronicles greg kaza notes that in 2000 pat buchanan held the balance of power in five states florida iowa new mexico oregon and wisconsin he also writes that libertarians cost the gop several senate seats in the west and mentions congressional districts where democrats were elected because conservative third party candidates took votes from republicans he also lists several democratic members of congress who he says were elected because republicans ignored hard right issues jane harman of california elizabeth furse of oregon jay inslee of washington and john tierney of massachusetts local politics most white nationalists are not wealthy and most cannot run for office how can they help a nationalist political movement one step is to get involved in existing political parties within the republican party there are men s groups women s groups student groups and so on all of which have elected positions that can be taken over there is also a group called the national federation of republican assemblies nrfa which has chapters in several states and is geared toward pulling the republican party further to the right the nrfa does not now take stands on racial issues but there is no reason why that can t change in some states a person can be a member of both the republican party and cp where dual membership is not possible helping build the local cp organization may provide the best opportunity to advance the nationalist movement there are many leadership positions in the party structures themselves from entry level precinct captain to national committee chairman the average county organization for a political party has a chairman vice chairman treasurer and secretary all elected typically these organizations are begging for people to take these jobs the religious right began filling these positions because they were willing to tolerate long boring meetings and deal with a variety of personalities for the sake of their cause white nationalists must be prepared to do the same those who are unfamiliar with the nuts and bolts of politics will get an education in how the process works needless to say having sympathetic members within the organization means invaluable support for white nationalist candidates insiders help direct funds organize volunteers issue press releases and influence party members with news and updates party officials also help hammer out party platforms a lot of hard boring work goes into winning these positions but it can pay dividends over the long haul whenever insurgent movements take over existing institutions people s feathers get ruffled so it takes persistence and dedication a group like the council of conservative citizens ccc which deals bluntly with race could alert members to upcoming meetings of local parties ccc members and allies could run for party positions and begin the long march through the institutions the way the anti white left took over the democratic party we owe it taken together an alternative nationalist traditionalist third party a political bloc within the republican party and a political action committee along the lines of the nra or emily s list would educate voters get candidates elected and force debate on taboo issues if these groups worked in concert and managed to get just a few politicians elected to federal office it would dramatically change the terms of debate imagine a few politicians with the nerve to ask black and hispanic activists why their groups crime rates are so high and why they choose so many white victims imagine a group of politicians who didn t cave in to the multiculturalist demands for white guilt but instead gave ringing defenses of western civilization imagine national political figures who boldly took the view that the west is not just an idea but has an ethno cultural component that connects whites to their civilization imagine a few white politicians reminding people that group differences in iq explain group differences in outcome far better than any legacy of racism such nationalists might create a kind of racial perestroika of course today s liberal totalitarians would try to stop it just as the soviet communists did changes in the soviet union would not have occurred without soviet dissidents like sakharov solzhenitsyn and yeltsin and we have to play the same role we owe it to our history our families and our descendants to put these ideas into action others may find better bible passages but i think psalm 28 verse 9 can serve as a benediction to inspire both racial realists and religious traditionalists as they go forth to build a truly nationalist political movement o save your people and bless your heritage be their shepherd and carry them forever
