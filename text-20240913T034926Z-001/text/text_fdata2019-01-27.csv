analysts and bankers said there are mixed factors that determine the fate of interest rates the exchange rate the future of foreign exchange fx reserves and inflation in 2019 the analysts expectations which were polled by daily news egypt showed that interest rates will be stable until the second half h2 of 2019 then likely to decline by 2 4 the monetary policy committee mpc of the central bank of egypt cbe will hold eight meetings this year 14 february 28 march 23 may 11 july 22 august 26 september 14 november and 16 december in 2018 the mpc held eight meetings in the first two in february and march interest rates were cut by 2 to 16 75 for deposit 17 75 for lending and 17 25 for credit discount and main operations the key interest rates remained stable during the following six meetings that year analysts also forecast that inflation will be at 10 14 while some expect it will be up to 17 8 in december 2018 the cbe said it eyes inflation of 9 3 which puts it to 6 12 by the end of the last quarter of 2020 in may 2018 the cbe said it perceived an inflation of 13 3 10 16 in the last quarter of 2018 which was realised when the inflation at the end of that year settled at 12 and 8 3 for core inflation according to cbe the target was hit in may 2018 when headline annual inflation recorded an average of 15 1 in the fourth quarter q4 of the year analysts also believe that the exchange rate of the egyptian pound to the us dollar will remain stable in 2019 and will move in a very narrow range while others said the greenback may be changing hands at egp 17 25 19 until the end of the year according to the cbe in 2018 the exchange rate was stable at egp 17 65840 17 8534 for buying and egp 17 7838 17 9738 for selling the fate of the fx reserves analysts say depends on the fx resources that will enter egypt and in return the amount of repayments it will make to external debt and obligations the fx reserves at the cbe reached 37bn in the beginning of 2018 then climbed to its highest record in november 2018 hitting 44 513bn however the reserve ended 2018 with a 2bn decline when the cbe paid external debt instalments and external obligations to fall to 42 551bn interest rates to remain stable to the q3 of 2019 mohamed abdel aal a member of the board of directors of the suez canal bank and the arab sudanese bank said that the cbe will implement the same strict monetary policy to maintain the interest rates at the same level of 16 75 for deposit 17 75 for lending and 17 25 for core operations and discount abdel aal pointed out that the policy adopted by the cbe in 2018 has largely succeeded in achieving the target inflation that has already been set which is 13 3 at the end of 2018 it also helped put the cbe on the right track to 9 3 to the q4 of 2020 there are several reasons and factors calling on the cbe to continue to maintain a high interest rate within 2019 or at least to the beginning of the q3 according to abdel aal he explained that among these factors maintaining the attractiveness of the exchange rate so that the egyptian pound has a positive interest difference between it and other currencies especially the us dollar and the currencies of other emerging countries as well as to face any possible inflationary pressures due to the lifting of subsidies off of fuel the mechanism of liberalisation of the price of fuel is in its early stages on gasoline 95 which will be implemented in april 2019 but it will have a small effect on inflation he added that the cbe may also keep interest rates high to maintain a reasonable real return above the inflation rate for households deposits and savings and also to ensure that the monetary policy is successful in targeting the new inflation rate until the end of 2020 as well as to cope with high interest rates in other emerging economies moreover the cbe may also maintain high interest rates to counter rising interest rates on the us dollar and to maintain the attractiveness to investment flows from foreign investment funds and hedge funds in egypt s public debt instruments interest rates are expected to continue as they are until the beginning of the q3 of 2019 and for the cbe to ease its deflationary policy and turn into a gradual easing policy thus reducing the interest rate at the beginning of the q3 by 2 followed by another 2 cut in the q4 to stimulate economic activity abdel aal said fx reserves are 42 46bn as for fx reserves abdel aal predicted that the rate of fx inflow will be stable in 2018 where the suez canal achieved revenue increases by 15 hitting 5 7bn while remittances of egyptians working abroad recorded 26bn abdel aal expects that the reserves will reach 42 46bn in 2019 according to the imports size and other sovereign financing needs he added that these expectations come in light of the recovery of tourism revenues and the expectations of lower imports bill as a result of the decline in oil prices and prices of strategic goods and imported inputs of production as well as the expectation of egypt to receive new tranches of the international monetary fund imf loan in addition to wanting to cover eight months worth of imports inflation of 12 14 abdel aal expects an inflation rate between 12 and 14 in 2019 and for the mpc to reach its target for inflation at 9 3 in 2020 furthermore abdel aal said that the strict monetary policy of the cbe achieved its target by the end of 2018 then introduced a new one to be achieved in 2020 despite expectations that some inflationary pressures will occur in mid 2019 by removing fuel subsidies other opposite factors can offset these expected inflationary waves where we expect the price of domestic and imported basic commodities that affect inflation to decline abdel aal said exchange rate of egp 17 25 18 5 to the dollar abdel aal expects a stable exchange rate at egp 17 25 18 5 in 2019 according to abdel aal the pound is not expected to face pressure in 2019 as economic engines continue to perform well and fx reserves continue to rise in addition to a lack of increased imports bill the success of the float of the pound in 2016 and the attractiveness of the interest rates on the pound a year full of challenges and pressures on central banks tarek metwally former deputy managing director and member of the board of directors of blom bank egypt said that 2019 will be a challenging year at both the domestic and international levels increasing pressure on monetary policy makers and central banks he added that there is fear that current policies will lead to an inflationary recession it is therefore time for egypt to focus on increasing productivity which is the next step in the economic reforms to create more jobs and new markets reduce poverty rates and start the era of the fourth generation industrial revolution in addition to creating non conventional solutions to fight inflation other than the use of the weapon of high interest rates according to metwally talk about the future outlook for interest rates and the exchange rate of the pound against the dollar and inflation is difficult in light of the volatility of global markets especially emerging economies and the trade war between the major countries such as america and china on the one hand and between america and the european union on the other the us policy is hiking interest rates on the dollar in 2019 but at a slower pace which would impact the movement of funds and investments and stock markets globally he pointed out that there are internal factors that also affect any future expectations namely the continuation of the economic reform programme the liberalisation of energy and fuel prices the plan of reforming subsidies and transferring them to cash support as well as the persistence of high inflation rates during the previous two years and the public debt service that eats up the bulk of the revenue interest rate cut is more likely in h2 of the year metwally sees a cut in the interest rate in 2019 is viable especially in h2 of the year projecting the cut to be 2 3 as long as inflation fx rate and hard cash inflow continue improving as for the exchange rate which has come to have a major role in determining the interest rate trends next to inflation it should move to egp 17 5 19 in 2019 in light of the need to attract more money to invest in government debt instruments after the sharp decline which recently exceeded 8bn as well as in view of the modest indicators of foreign direct investment mostly directed to the oil and gas sector away from industrial agricultural and services sectors reaching single digit inflation is difficult as for inflation metwally believes it will move around 12 14 until the end of 2019 which will fall below the previous targets of single digit inflation in 2019 he pointed out that these expectations come in light of the continued real political will to implement the programme of economic reform in full and the required full liberalisation of energy and fuel prices taking into account external conditions moreover he expressed his reservations about the policies adopted in the fight against inflation which depends heavily on the interest rate which led to a stable high interest rate for over two years which in turn affected the state budget and debt service additionally he pointed out that this has caused us to turn in a vicious cycle between high inflation and fear of the exchange rate the attractiveness of the interest rate to attract foreign investment to government debt instruments thus increasing the burden of the budget and public debt and its service and the impact of what is happening in emerging markets ems we are in a circle waiting for all factors to improve this calls for new non conventional tools he stressed as for the fx reserves metwally believes that its arrival to 42bn and coverage of six months worth of imports in december 2018 is very good given the current circumstances he stressed the importance of increasing the reserves from real resources of fx not through borrowing noting that although borrowing was acceptable with the beginning of economic reform it is no longer acceptable now with external debt levels reaching a high level increasing its cost and pressure on the budget 2 drop in interest rates zakaria salah a banking expert predicted a 2 drop in interest rates in h2 of the year with regard to fx reserves salah believes the fall in reserves in december 2018 can be offset through the remaining tranches of the imf loan salah also predicts the stability of exchange rate in 2019 as imports are tightened and exports are hiking which would also improve the balance of payments according to salah a slight increase in the rate of inflation is expected as a result of the government s move to completely lift fuel subsidies crucial factors in determining interest rate expectations hany aboul fotouh a banking expert sees decisive factors in setting interest rate expectations in 2019 he explained that the first of these factors is to reduce the annual rate of basic inflation which fell from 33 in july 2017 to 7 9 in november 2018 as well as to strike a balance between encouraging investment and maintaining egypt s competitiveness in world debt markets furthermore he stressed that the impact of hot money outflow from the egyptian debt market is due to rising interest rates in ems as well as the effect of raising the interest rate on the dollar which cannot be ignored in conjunction with the reduction of interest rates on domestic debt instruments which may provide an incentive for foreign investors to transfer their investments to the dollar zone there is no doubt that there is a difficulty in the private sector to access bank financing at an appropriate cost as the price of lending exceeds 18 and therefore it should be considered by policy makers so as not to harm the local investor according to aboul fotouh as the government is the largest borrower from banks monetary policy makers must consider that the stability of interest rates at high levels is a major burden on the public budget because the government will direct a large part of its resources to repay the debt and its benefits indicated aboul fotouh fx reserve the cbe announced the decline of its fx reserves by about 1 963bn in december 2018 against the background of the payment of external obligations he noted that this was the first decline in two years adding that the reserve went through very difficult stages falling to 16 687bn in june 2014 then rising slowly to 44 513bn in november 2018 which is very high in accordance with international standards on fx reserves he pointed out that the rule of the central banks is usually to keep fx reserves covering at least three months of imports in foreign currency but in egypt the reserves cover eight months in addition external financial inflows such as direct investments and stock market investments require the state to have equal value for its hard cash commitments according to aboul fotouh the fate of the fx reserves during 2019 is linked to the cbe s policy of restructuring its components to be longer term as well as providing foreign currency commitments to national projects and paying off other liabilities furthermore he pointed out that in light of the improved performance of the egyptian economy and the growth of fx reserves the stability of the pound exchange rate against the dollar is expected during 2019 and could yet suffer a new limited depreciation by the end of the year inflation in egypt is expected to be under 10 at the end of 2019 as optimistic estimates indicate 9 inflation in the coming two years he said to achieve these expectations the government must play a strong and effective role in controlling markets and protecting consumers from harmful trade practices such as monopoly a fair and orderly competitive environment should also be created to help reduce prices and reduce inflation elaborated aboul fotouh no movement in corridor rates monette doss equity analyst banking macro at hc brokerage said that they expect no movement in corridor rates over 2019 so they expect the cbe to maintain overnight deposits and lending at 16 75 and 17 75 respectively throughout 2019 we expect the exchange rate to average egp 18 9 to the us dollar over 2019 implying that it will reach egp 19 8 usd by december 2019 hc also expects inflation to average 17 over 2019 we believe improved current account dynamics coupled with higher momentum in private investments should drive gdp growth egypt s current account will almost breakeven in fy 20 21e according to our estimates on tourism receipt reaching pre revolution levels stable growth of suez canal revenue and remittances channelled through the official banking sector their rebound has already been rejected in a dispute current account deficit at 5 9bn in fy 2017 18 compared to a deficit of 14 4bn a year earlier according to data released by the cbe hc added they also expect the recent massive oil and gas discoveries to result in shifting egypt to become a net energy exporter by fy 2020 21e and attract foreign direct investments fdis this should also be further aided by the government s current efforts to pave the way for a more favourable regulatory environment for production sharing agreements with foreign oil companies operating in egypt with planned government investments in renewable energy projects and the construction of new cities such as the new administrative capital and al alamein hc expect economic growth to reach 5 5 in fy 2018 19e in line with the imf estimates in the following years hc expects the private sector contribution to increase as the cbe reserves monetary easing and the government s partial asset sale programme gains traction perceived conflicts inflationary pressures delayed monetary easing and effects of potential egp depreciation should subside on tenant fundamentals in our opinion we expect renewed inflationary pressures by june 2019 as the government will undertake another round of subsidy cuts possibly raising energy prices by 40 50 after which we expect oil price indexation to be applied it added we forecast inflation will average 16 8 in fy 2018 19e on the anticipated moves as the economy absorbs the price shock we expect the cbe to resume monetary easing and cut policy rates by 250 bps in h2 of 2019 20e before making another similar rate cut in h1 of 2020 21e applying our inflation forecast to a real effective exchange rate reer model yields 9 egp depreciation by december 2019 despite pinpointed medium term challenges we believe the economic fundamentals remain intact and expect the government to achieve its budget deficit target of 8 6 of the gdp in fy 2018 19e respectively international oil price movements and on our estimates to narrow further to 6 4 the following year on our numbers domestic debt should decline to 80 of the gdp in fy 2018 19e from 84 last year due to successful fiscal consolidation also accounting for expected external debt repayment and planned issuance of new debt we expect external debt to decline to 33 of the gdp from 37 currently moreover carry trade is still an attractive schedule potential for further egp devaluation due to recent global monetary tightening egypt has seen total portfolio outflows of about 8 1bn since march from its treasuries market with total foreign holdings declining to 13 1bn in september 2018 hc added that these outflows were mainly funded by the banking sector which saw its net foreign asset position of 4 1bn in march shift to a net foreign liability position of 3 9bn in september this in our view coupled with imf reserve management guidelines limiting the cbe s ability to intervene in the interbank system supports our view of another upcoming round of egp devaluation despite recent global monetary tightening we see 1 year t bill rates stabilising at 19 in h2 of 2018 19e from an average 17 8 over the same period last year we have already seen yields cool off to 19 78 from a high of 19 88 because of increased liquidity in the pickup in corporate borrowing despite the potential of further egp devaluation we believe carry trade is still attractive at these levels given resilient fundamentals that said we expect some 3 1bn in foreign portfolio inflows in fy 2018 19e it concluded inflammatory shocks beltone believes inflationary pressures will remain subdued over h1 of 2019 it added that they do not see any triggers to inflammatory shocks at least over q1 of 2019 it noted that despite starting the automatic fuel price indexation mechanism for gasoline 95 prices are fixed till march we still expect an average increase of 20 6 in all petroleum products prices following the implementation of the mechanism on other products towards the end of q2 of 2019 where we expect a 2 5 3 5 addition to headline inflation we believe the low headline reading in december 2018 can accommodate inflation to remain within the 14 15 range following the move which implies lower inflationary pressures in h2 of 2019 than previously expected beltone said we reiterate our maintained interest rates call in fy 2018 19e yet there is room for a cut upon several checks the normalisation of headline inflation affirms the cbe s view of contained inflationary pressures and partnerships q4 of 2018 average 15 1 to the targeted zone at 13 3 beltone noted as inflation outlook will remain a hostage to the uncertain trajectory of oil prices and amidst the tight global and regional monetary policy it reiterates the view of stable interest rates in fy 2018 19e and a possible cut by end of 2019 depending on the spill over of the increase in energy prices meanwhile the new inflation low for the first time since the egp float may open the door for an earlier cut that will depend in our view on many factors i january inflation reading to confirm the downward trend even as food volatility dissipation ends ii foreign outflow from the fixed income in december to assess its magnitude which we expect to slow down in 2019 and iii depletion in banks nfas in december which we expect to remain within 1 2bn average depreciation rate eliminating the need to support the local currency we reiterate our view that treasury yields will remain persistently elevated above the pre interest rates cut disregarding interest rates policy direction for various other reasons it concluded

depreciation should subside on tenant fundamentals in our opinion we expect renewed inflationary pressures by june 2019 as the government will undertake another round of subsidy cuts possibly raising energy prices by 40 50 after which we expect oil price indexation to be applied it added we forecast inflation will average 16 8 in fy 2018 19e on the anticipated moves as the economy absorbs the price shock we expect the cbe to resume monetary easing and cut policy rates by 250 bps in h2 of 2019 20e before making another similar rate cut in h1 of 2020 21e applying our inflation forecast to a real effective exchange rate reer model yields 9 egp depreciation by december 2019 despite pinpointed medium term challenges we believe the economic fundamentals remain intact and expect the government to achieve its budget deficit target of 8 6 of the gdp in fy 2018 19e respectively international oil price movements and on our estimates to narrow further to 6 4 the following year on our numbers domestic debt should decline to 80 of the gdp in fy 2018 19e from 84 last year due to successful fiscal consolidation also accounting for expected external debt repayment and planned issuance of new debt we expect external debt to decline to 33 of the gdp from 37 currently moreover carry trade is still an attractive schedule potential for further egp devaluation due to recent global monetary tightening egypt has seen total portfolio outflows of about 8 1bn since march from its treasuries market with total foreign holdings declining to 13 1bn in september 2018 hc added that these outflows were mainly funded by the banking sector which saw its net foreign asset position of 4 1bn in march shift to a net foreign liability position of 3 9bn in september this in our view coupled with imf reserve management guidelines limiting the cbe s ability to intervene in the interbank system supports our view of another upcoming round of egp devaluation despite recent global monetary tightening we see 1 year t bill rates stabilising at 19 in h2 of 2018 19e from an average 17 8 over the same period last year we have already seen yields cool off to 19 78 from a high of 19 88 because of increased liquidity in the pickup in corporate borrowing despite the potential of further egp devaluation we believe carry trade is still attractive at these levels given resilient fundamentals that said we expect some 3 1bn in foreign portfolio inflows in fy 2018 19e it concluded inflammatory shocks beltone believes inflationary pressures will remain subdued over h1 of 2019 it added that they do not see any triggers to inflammatory shocks at least over q1 of 2019 it noted that despite starting the automatic fuel price indexation mechanism for gasoline 95 prices are fixed till march we still expect an average increase of 20 6 in all petroleum products prices following the implementation of the mechanism on other products towards the end of q2 of 2019 where we expect a 2 5 3 5 addition to headline inflation we believe the low headline reading in december 2018 can accommodate inflation to remain within the 14 15 range following the move which implies lower inflationary pressures in h2 of 2019 than previously expected beltone said we reiterate our maintained interest rates call in fy 2018 19e yet there is room for a cut upon several checks the normalisation of headline inflation affirms the cbe s view of contained inflationary pressures and partnerships q4 of 2018 average 15 1 to the targeted zone at 13 3 beltone noted as inflation outlook will remain a hostage to the uncertain trajectory of oil prices and amidst the tight global and regional monetary policy it reiterates the view of stable interest rates in fy 2018 19e and a possible cut by end of 2019 depending on the spill over of the increase in energy prices meanwhile the new inflation low for the first time since the egp float may open the door for an earlier cut that will depend in our view on many factors i january inflation reading to confirm the downward trend even as food volatility dissipation ends ii foreign outflow from the fixed income in december to assess its magnitude which we expect to slow down in 2019 and iii depletion in banks nfas in december which we expect to remain within 1 2bn average depreciation rate eliminating the need to support the local currency we reiterate our view that treasury yields will remain persistently elevated above the pre interest rates cut disregarding interest rates policy direction for various other reasons it concluded
cornelius dube one of the topical issues in zimbabwe today is that of currency reform various options are being debated with the main ones being full dollarisation continuing with the multi currency system or introducing a new currency some economists have suggested that the challenges the economy faces are not a currency issue but a productivity one however currency and productivity are slowly becoming a chicken and egg scenario government wants industry to produce and earn the country foreign currency while industry wants government to allocate them foreign currency to produce industry seems to have taken a model of importing to produce rather that finding innovative initiatives to produce raw materials locally while there is general consensus that currency reforms are inevitable it is mainly the direction that the policies should take that is open for debate dollarisation paradigm there is a general interpretation that market signals are pointing to the preference to revert back to full dollarisation this reading of the market is based on recent developments where most shops are now charging products in united states dollars or its equivalent to bond notes and rtgs as prescribed by the black market rates government policy seems to be suggesting that a new currency will only be introduced once certain fundamentals are in place however when government prescribed that motor vehicle duty and corporate tax be in foreign currency as well as an upward review in diesel and petrol prices the message sent to the market is that we are headed towards dollarisation thus revelations by finance and economic development minister prof mthuli ncube that the country will soon have its own currency caught the market by surprise but what are some of the challenges expected in the path towards either re dollarisation or de dollarisation zimbabwe adopted a multiple currency regime in 2009 in which the us dollar was the main anchor from january 2016 the country began to experience cash shortages low withdrawal limits were imposed on depositors triggering a panic the rbz then introduced bond notes in november 2016 the original reasoning behind the surrogate currency was that it was in response to the cash crisis before it was said to be just an incentive intended to boost exports but it can be argued that if zimbabwe is to re dollarise by de monetising the bond notes and getting rid of rtgs balances without addressing the variables that caused the net outflow position when the economy was under dollarisation then the same cash challenges that led to the introduction of bond notes might haunt us this can happen even if government exercises fiscal discipline thus while re dollarisation will eliminate inflation there are no indications that the regime can become sustainable in the face a high marginal propensity to import economists also call for the floating of the rtgs balances simultaneously with government relinquishing the foreign currency allocation role so as to let the market decide its true value currently the rtgs bond note is one of the strongest currencies in the region as the parallel market rate is trading against the us dollar at far below what the south african rand and the botswana pula are trading the rate has been relatively stable despite the current rise in prices while floating the rtgs will result in a new and probably stable rate it is important to appreciate that the high value that the rtgs currently has against the us dollar is only a result of government intervention in foreign currency allocation if government allows fuel cooking oil and pharmaceutical importers to trade their rtgs to get foreign currency the rate can shoot even 10 fold as the supply of rtgs balances chasing the hard currency increase rtgs balances are currently in excess of 9 billion and probably still rising and unleashing most of them into the foreign currency market could be disastrous including generating hyperinflation possibilities on the other hand there is fear that introduction of the local currency at the moment is not ideal as fundamentals are not yet in place however such fundamentals are rarely mentioned leaving some to believe that they are just fictitious possible meaning of fundamentals one critical fundamental is fiscal discipline where the central government is able to streamline its expenditure in relation to revenue however the excessive borrowing by government to sustain recurrent expenditure which resulted in net claims from the banking sector standing at over 9 billion in october 2018 will erode the value of the local currency this is because government would be borrowing from the same sources which the private sector would be trying to unlock productive funding the value of the local currency can only be preserved if the productive capacity of the economy is expanding such that there will be less demand for imports banks and security providers would also be forced to introduce innovative products to attract business when their biggest cash cow government exits the market this includes offering higher interest rates which would also make domestic securities more attractive to lure foreign investors this strengthens the local currency government has already identified the budget deficit as a priority area given that government was able to significantly increase its fiscal space through taxation in the form of the 2 percent tax on electronic payments and imposing excise duty on fuel there is less pressure on further borrowing to balloon the deficit the capacity to honour maturing treasury bills instead of rolling them over constantly has also been enhanced through fiscal discipline government is already making steps to make the environment conducive for a local currency the most important fundamental is the extent to which the economy is open for business this includes removing all the key obstacles towards the smooth running of businesses including high cost of doing business while reforms have been initiated in this area the pace is not as fast as one would have expected given the urgency the matter deserves for example the establishment of the zimbabwe investment and development agency zida is still pending meaning investors are still subject to cumbersome approval processes containing the growth of money supply is also another fundamental which needs to be demonstrated before a local currency is introduced an increase in money supply causes a country s currency to depreciate the increase in money supply which was observed over the years can be attributed to fiscal indiscipline in october 2018 broad money supply was in excess of 10 billion having increased by 31 percent compared to the stock of broad money as at october 2017 money supply needs to be contained for the new currency to become stable with fiscal consolidation being the main thrust of the current government the main driver of money supply growth is being contained thus the ground is being prepared for the introduction of the new currency a critical measure mostly used to assess whether conditions favour a local currency is the size of a country s foreign reserves reserves are important as a country can defend its exchange rate by running down reserves and increasing the availability of foreign currency in the market when the demand for foreign currency increases a rule of thumb usually used is that reserves should be sufficient to cover a quarter of the total annual imports this means that the ratio of reserves to imports should be at least equal to 0 25 or that the total reserves expressed in months of imports should at least be equal to three world bank indicators show that the closest that zimbabwe has ever come to having three months of import cover was in 2009 when total reserves expressed in months of imports was 2 33 the value has been on a free fall between 2009 and 2016 closing at 0 72 based on the rbz statistics for december 2017 the reserves in months of imports were at 0 64 or rather at 19 days of import cover it is not likely that zimbabwe will ever reach the rule of thumb threshold if a local currency has to wait for such a fundamental then we will wait for a very long time if not for ever given that producers also want the reserves to be run down so that they are allocated foreign currency to produce however many countries with their own currencies are also operating at very low reserves this also includes developed countries such as germany uk and the usa which all operate on less than two months of import cover there is also the fundamental of inflation inflation determines the return on investment as a high inflation country implies that the real interest rate is likely to be negative in other words an inflation which is as high 42 percent recorded in december 2018 would imply that interest rates need to be more than that for investors to earn a return introduction of a new currency can only work in an environment where inflation is contained preferably to single digit levels while the authorities still believe that they would have contained inflation by december 2019 the ratchet effect of inflation needs not be underestimated once prices have been increased it is difficult for them to be brought down even if they had risen because of speculation thus the manner in which inflation has been going up is not consistent with an environment where a local currency is imminent however fiscal discipline will also help contain inflationary pressure such that if speculation is the major driver of inflation it can easily stabilise but this would require government to engage in a strong disinflation regime with inflation targeting becoming central to monetary policy this implies that most of the fundamentals except reserves are generally attainable there appears to be some merits to quickly devise methods to work on these fundamentals rather than going back the route of the failed dollarisation even if the 9 billion worth of rtgs are floated for us dollars as part of re dollarisation they are too high with respect to the few available hard currency balances in circulation such that a high loss of value would be expected any measure that punishes depositors who lost everything under the previous dollarisation phase would be suicidal only a transition from rtgs to a stable local currency can offer some protection to depositors and help enhance confidence in the banking sector cornelius dube is an economist with more

economy watch how long will britain s recession last this is money editor andrew oxlade explains the basics of a financial crisis that descended from credit crunch to recession to debt crisis the latest the story so far and what to expect next updated as events dictate bookmark thisismoney co uk recession challenges ahead some of the worst news came from the construction sector which declined by 4 9 per cent in the quarter britain is officially back in recession after the recovery failed to gain any traction in 2011 when the economy grew by a paltry 0 9 per cent for the full year and 2012 has begun badly the economy shrank 0 4 per cent in the final quarter of 2011 and then another 0 3 per cent in the first quarter of 2012 that marks a technical recession something analysts had thought the uk would narrowly avoid it also means we re in the first double dip recession since the economic turmoil of 1975 double dip is where the economy goes back into a recession before it has had a chance to recover its previous high of economic output what is a recession the technical measure of recession is two quarters of the year back to back where the size of the economy shrinks as measured by gdp gross domestic product we remain a long way from that 2008 peak the economy saw below par 2 1 per cent expansion in 2010 following a 6 4 per cent plunge during the great recession of 2008 2009 we re now in the longest slump in more than a century the graph below shows how the economy has recovered after previous recessions this downturn has been worse than the seventies in terms of the trajectory of the economy and even more severe than the great depression of the 1930s when gdp recovered its previous high after nearly four years how the recovery from recession compares with those of the past so what can we expect for 2012 as a whole the median prediction from analysts is for growth of just 0 4 per cent for 2012 with the gloomiest forecasters predicting the economy will shrink by more than 1 per cent to get a feel for how weak this is the average annual gdp growth from 1990 to 2008 was 2 3 per cent and most people but not us had been expecting the usual post recession bounce back as happened after the eighties and nineties recessions so they d have been hoping for growth of 4 per cent or 5 per cent a year growth in the economy year by year the office for national statistics constantly revises figures on the economy s growth more than a decade after the event that s because the first estimate is based on only 40 per cent of the data these are the latest estimates june 2012 2011 0 8 2010 1 8 2009 4 0 2008 1 0 2007 3 6 2006 2 6 2005 2 8 2004 2 9 2003 3 8 2002 2 4 so what do the experts say the international monetary fund imf is fairly upbeat it upped its forecast for 2012 growth 17 april from 0 6 per cent to 0 8 per cent it cited the colossal efforts in february to avert eurozone meltdown by the european central bank when it extended cheap lending to banks to 1trillion the oecd correctly called the recent double dip in november 2011 it now predicts the economy to shrink 0 1 per cent over the whole of 2012 a markit survey called it badly wrong in early april suggesting the economy had grown 0 5 per cent in the first quarter but the oecd was far more accurate calling a 0 1 per cent decline this economic gloom is all of great concern to the treasury the coalition s plans for the future hang on being able to cut debt with a mixture of austerity cuts and economic growth a return to recession would derail its plans at the november mini budget the independent office of budget responsibility dramatically slashed its projection for 2012 growth from 2 5 per cent a prediction from march to 0 7 per cent and in march 2012 the obr forecast that the uk would not go back into recession and that the economy would grow 0 8 per cent over the year followed by 2 per cent growth in 2013 see the chart below the real fear is that austerity will combine with relatively high inflation both of which take money out of the pocket of consumers and hold back the economy this could degenerate into dreaded stagflation no economic growth combined with inflation the obr s official forecast for the economy made in march 2012 so where did all this start ignore official stats consumer debt is still firmly on the rise official figures shows consumer debt falling marginally but that doesn t take into account the amount simply written off by banks as repossessions and bankruptcies rise the campaign group save our savers sos points out that total consumer debt stood at 1 461bn in november 2008 and 1 452 billion in november 2011 but banks wrote off 26 7bn of consumer debt so excluding the bank write offs debt actually rose by 18 4bn credit card debt continues to run rampant says sos rising from 53 3billion to 56 5billion over that time even thought an extraordinary 13billion has been written off total credit card debt when write offs have been stripped out has exploded by 16 1bn so the clear picture is that debts are not only still rising but shifting across to financial companies and that if recent history is anything to go by could one day become state debt and the projection is that uk debt is set for another explosion the office of budget responsibility projects growth of nearly 50 from 1 5trillion today to 2 12trillion by 2015 britain s great recession started in the spring of 2008 and ended in the summer of 2009 this is based on the technical measure of recession see above the economy then raced out of recession faster than expected see the charts above and below but faltered again late in 2010 with the heavy snow of december blamed for much of it and slowed to a snail s pace in the first half of 2011 the government s tax rises vat was hiked in january and income tax went up for the richer middle classes in april have been made by austerity cuts are still kicking in the final negative factor and possibly the biggest is that consumers companies and the state are all locked in a race to straighten out their finances that means each of these will spend less and try to pay down debts a toxic combination for the economy in the short term although necessary for long term health in reality spending has slowed but debts are still rising see the box right the gloomy outlook was enough to persuade the bank of england to start printing money again in october 2011 its previous quantitative easing programme saw 200bn created for this purpose in 2009 and 2010 in october it said a further 75billion would be deployed aimed at getting banks to increase lending and more was added in february 2012 as we ve long predicted there s likely to be lots more qe as the economy limps along and deflation falling prices becomes a danger a concern stalking in the background is sta gflation this is where growth stalls but inflation remains dangerously high the outcome can be disastrous not only is real wealth eroded but it may mean hiking interest rates to control inflation with the nasty side effect of higher borrowing costs further damaging economic growth also how interest rates predictions have shifted how this recovery compares with those of the past the recovery in the economy follows the longest recession since british records began with a 6 4 fall in output the full year of 2009 saw the economy shrink 4 by the latest estimate the biggest calendar year fall since 1921 this chart from the national institute of economic and social research june 2012 shows how the economy s progress since the start of the recession has actually been significantly worse than the four years after the great depression that began in 1930 which incidentally was far milder in the uk than in the us this recovery from recession compared to those of the past the current double dip recession makes this a worst downturn than that of the great depression 1930s source niesr the shape of the recovery the shape of the recovery if it continues has been debated the chances of a v shaped recovery have always been remote despite odd spells of blind optimism among the other options are a w shaped recovery right as we explained in may 2009 or u shaped long slump then recovery or even l shaped long term slump with no recovery like japan over the past two decades which for the record i have long seen as the most likely prospect britain in 2020 how big is britain s debt problem at the start of the sovereign debt crisis the uk was one of the worst offenders for over spending it had one of the worst budget deficit s in the eu in the last fiscal year to april 2010 at more than 10 of gdp it was beat only by ireland 32 4 and greece 10 5 basically that means the british government spent more than it earned to the tune of 146bn according to the obr while that overspend is being reduced the uk s debts continue to grow britain owed 1 022 5bn in march a leap from 905bn a year earlier according to the ons the government needs to borrow more than 127bn in the current year lower than the 142 7bn the previous year debt mountain despite the better performance in december the level of debt as a proportion of gdp remains a daunting challenge for ministers imf debt league the international monetary fund offers some comparison of debt around the world using gross debt rather then net debt used above as a percentage of total annual economic output gdp the figures are estimates for 2011 published in april of that year the situation has since become notably worse now for the likes of greece the actual figures for 2009 are in brackets japan 234 217 greece 139 115 italy 120 116 ireland 102 66 us 99 84 france 87 78 portugal 87 76 britain 82 69 germany 77 74 and other countries with stable and more manageable debt mexico 46 45 switzerland 39 38 rwanda 23 21 iran 20 21 paraguay 16 18 kuwait 11 14 chile 7 6 see the full figures on the imf website that total debt figure as the chart shows already equates to 66 per cent of gdp the total size of all economic output up from 60 per cent a year earlier and that net debt figure does not even including bank bailouts and other financial interventions with those included the figure for the end of december was a whopping 2 305bn or 148 1 per cent of gdp down slightly from 150 7 a year earlier assuming the government claws back its bank investments britain s 66 per cent debt measure is favourable compared to say italy or greece where it is more than 150 per cent or japan at more than 200 per cent so no problem alas not because we re borrowing more than most other countries we ll soon be climbing the total debt league tables and testing the nerve of investors any signs that we might struggle to repay then international markets would charge much higher rates of interest to lend making it even harder to pay down debts the coalition s plans to tackle debts have so far been well received it also depends on how a country borrows money japan largely borrows from its own people savers rather than internationally but some economists regard a debt to gdp ratio of more than 90 per cent as the point of no return on the route to default and national bankruptcy the obr forecast in april 2011 was for uk debt to peak at 71 of gdp in 2013 14 there s also the not so small issue of britain s household consumer debt problem which in relative terms is the second worst in the developed world it is 1 5trillion and expected to grow to 2 2trillion by 2015 see the box above see these maps on the economist website for a quick comparison of our debt problem vs others the oecd also carries figures for public debt for euro zone countries also this ring of fire chart published in 2010 by bond fund giant pimco perfectly captures the problem basically you want to be in the top left corner being far to the right shows too much total debt and being too low down shows too much annual borrowing debts growing too fast this graph below published in march 2012 by britain s office for budget responsibility is also worth digesting it pretty much sums up why the obr was created by the coalition showing how spending as percentage of the economy soared far higher than government earnings tax in recent years the darker line shows spending while the lighter line captures total income tax how bad is britain s state and consumer debt problem could the uk face a japan style lost decade greek debt crisis could it happen here is britain s economy really in recovery a sneak preview of britain s wealth in 2020 reasons for optimism a weak pound made british products cheaper helping exporters a powerful stock market rally boosted confidence unemployment rises have been smaller than forecast markets have welcomed coalition efforts to tackle the deficit reasons for pessimism the government has embarked on savage public spending cuts that will dent demand the qe impact is unknown it could stoke inflat ion forcing rate rises to control it forcing rate rises to control it british house prices remain over valued western governments and consumers have built up colossal debts that could take more

he claimed the u s was already in recession nobel winning economist paul krugman wrongly declared august 2010 as the probable trough for the recession obviously all predictions should be taken with a pinch of salt correct forecasts get more coverage than failed ones and even when experts have a good track record there s no guarantee of a repeat all that said it would be unwise to disregard the views of the world s most successful investors more of which are included further below legendary investor warren buffett revealed he was buying shares in october 2008 at the worst stage of the banking crisis but in july he said more stimulus was needed he said there were signs of life in the economy in april 2010 he showed his confidence with a massive share buyback in september 2011 professor nouriel roubini a us economist feted for forecasting the credit crunch as early as 2006 remained extremely gloomy about economic prospects in 2009 expecting american unemployment to rise to 11 roubini warns on sucker s rally and in august he stepped up warnings of a double dip in october 2009 he warned the property market may yet undermine the recovery and warned again on the stock market rally a brief summary of the financial crisis problems with the repayment of subprime mortgages in the us triggered a tidal wave of concern about lending around the world in august 2007 this was the beginning of the credit crunch which can be measured with lib or british house prices began falling soon after and only stabilised in april onwards of 2009 northern rock ran into trouble in september 2007 and was finally nationalised in february 2008 in this first stage of the crisis consumers also felt a price squeeze commodity prices rose rapidly in 2007 and the first six months of 2008 driven by demand from booming china and india pushing up petrol food and other basic costs this surging inflation prevented central banks from cutting interest rates to help ease the credit crunch fears increased with the collapse of bear stearns in march 2008 but the financial crisis proper began in september with the collapse of lehman brothers that was followed in early october by a

recession the bank of england s new firepower was quantitative easing increasing the supply of money in the uk economy the bank created money and bought assets gilts from financial companies that made institutions more likely to buy other assets such as corporate bonds that makes it cheaper for companies to borrow on bond markets and shares in the form of rights issues that makes it cheaper for companies to raise money on equity markets it all combined to makes companies feel richer and less likely to sack workers it was also meant to encourage banks to lend more various other measures were launched aimed at encouraging lending a 37bn bailout was shared by rbs and hbos lloyds in october other money was lent to banks or used for debt insurance schemes a third bank bailout of 30bn for rbs and lloyds came in november 2009 estimates of the total taxpayer liability then including lending and insurance schemes for banks was put at nearly 1 5 trillion the government hopes to get its money back once the troubled banks return to health if not it will be paid for by higher future taxes the previous government also throw money at the recession with other temporary measures such as a s tamp

by michael brenner for vt populism has become synonymous with the word mob that is how it now is used by reporters editorial writers and commentators it is convenient for two types of persons to do so a those who find the contemporary world too complicated to interpret and b those who aim to cast in pejorative terms political cum social forces that threaten the status quo the economic governmental and intellectual status quo widespread ignorance of modern history is permissive of both tendencies here is a brief summary of the term s actual meaning genealogy and real world antecedents it s from wikipedia one click away historically academic definitions of populism vary and people have often used the term in loose and inconsistent ways to reference appeals to the people demagogy and catch all politics the term has also been used as a label for new parties whose classifications are unclear in recent years academic scholars have produced definitions that facilitate populist identification and comparison daniele albertazzi and duncan mcdonnell define populism as an ideology that pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of elites and dangerous others who are together depicted as depriving or attempting to deprive the sovereign people of their rights values prosperity identity and voice rather than viewing populism in terms of specific social bases economic programs issues or electorates as discussions of right wing populism have tended to do this type of definition is in line with the approaches of scholars such as ernesto laclau pierre andre taguieff yves meny and yves surel who have all sought to focus on populism per se rather than treating it simply as an appendage of other ideologies cas mudde says many observers have noted that populism is inherent to representative democracy after all do populists not juxtapose the pure people against the corrupt elite in the united states populist movements have high prestige in the history books for example farmers movements new deal reform movements and the civil rights movement that were often called populist by supporters and outsiders alike other early populist political parties in the united states included the greenback party the progressive party of 1912 led by theodore roosevelt the progressive party of 1924 led by robert m la follette sr and the share our wealth movement of huey long in 1933 35 most strikingly populism in thought and in concrete manifestations does not carry the heavy load of negative connotations with which it now is freighted its essence is the distillation of core democratic precepts sovereignty derives from the citizenry government officials acquire their legitimacy to exercise the stipulated powers of the state through a process of selection and approval of the citizenry the paramount purpose and responsibility of public authorities is to serve the interests of all members of society to whom they are accountable in other words government of the people by the people for the people to coin a phrase it is a commentary on how far we ve deviated from those principles that manifestations of complaint by a substantial fraction of the populace about the abuse of power leaders evasion of accountability and the unfair consequences of the failure to observe that secular creed should evoke surprise distress and defensive condemnation from those culpable of acting contrary to its precepts or gaining unjustified advantage from the abuse of public institutions before proceeding further with this examination of populism it is necessary to make clear that not all expressions of protest and complaint are inherently virtuous or themselves immune to destructive and undemocratic abuses populist protest can become a menace under certain conditions any social movement is liable to deformation humanitarian impulse cannot be taken for granted we should be relearning these elementary truths in the age of the orangutan for that is what is happening in the united states as well as in parts of europe sadly our learning curve is flat there are those whose new found concern for the plight of the common man in plutocratic america leads to an exaltation of prejudice and mindless indulgence of crude government bashing as if the united states circa 1830 embodied all republican virtue racism and xenophobia are diseases never fully eradicated from the american body politic to rationalize their recrudescence to downplay them is to risk fatal injury to gloss over the autocratic meme of the demagogue who has become their improbable agent releasing the hate and aggression in the twisted minds of those who have breached the restraints of the country s political super ego is irresponsible a deep sense of grievance well grounded or fantasy is one thing putting power in the hands of a mentally unbalanced bully is an act of delinquency the companion justification for this collective act of juvenile pique asserts that americans have good reason to reject a distant governing elite this proposition has three ancillary postulates of dubious validity the issue is elitism itself rather than whom the elite serves all populist rebellions draw from the same pool of discontent and there is actually such a thing as draining the swamp taken together these notions represent the poverty of political discourse in the country today as to the first the powerful forces transforming american society are the concentrated business in particular financial interests the military intelligence industrial complex and a political class obedient to those forces today the united states is manifestly structured as a plutocracy with an autonomous companion security sector only a minuscule number of public figures challenge them as to the second trump is an integral part of the power elite his transparent populist sloganeering was the con of a talented snake oil salesman it has only taken a few weeks for the mask to drop to pair trump with bernie sanders was always wrong now it is absurd mental shorthand for lazy minds despite some overlap in the source of aggrieved feelings e g job insecurity backers of one or the other always diverged in their basic orientation toward government and the public order none of those drawn to sanders were latent participants in a lynch mob or kristalnacht celebrations or would be black site capos nor did they live in dread of obama s gestapo coming in the dead of night to seize their life giving ak 47s and m 16s and environmental activists did not flock to the o s standard finally it is staple of american electoral politics to run on a platform that promises cleaning up washington or the state house look at the line from carter reagan clinton bush obama to everyone in 2016 it s part of the b s stream that keeps our turgid political campaigns moving in fact the national government grew substantially by every measure under reagan as for obama s prophetic message of renewal and transparency it was almost as much an outright fraud as trump s three card monte con job albeit far more suave he advertised himself as a vintage 1990 bordeaux and delivered a 2002 rhone wine as for the orangutan s pledge to clean up washington a public as gullible as america s now could credit a similar claim by the creature from the black lagoon in a way the exercise is part of a ritualized performance whereby the myths of our national culture are revived and rejuvenated in theatrical displays a reaffirmation of the american creed of rugged individualism and emotional catharsis at once after which we get back to business as usual that includes cashing checks from washington by ranchers farmers workers in houston s space industries in arizona and southern california cities that would be nearly uninhabitable in the absence of vast governmental projects that brought them water and electricity and everywhere by grateful recipients of social security or medicare reimbursements regardless of whether they re tea party militants or not even an aging ayn rand did not hesitate to take time off from writing her books of fantasy fiction to bank her social security payments and to keep up her medicare eligibility if trump were actually to disrupt the flow of those checks the masks of the passion play performance would be stripped away of course he will take pains to ensure that the distribution of the largesse to the big boys will continue to flow smoothly powerful establishment interests they fear only public authority that they cannot control they are quite happy to exploit it as an instrument to advance their pecuniary interests and as a trough for indulging their insatiable appetites to lump together all of this under the label populism is an exercise in intellectual escapism where it is not a blatant strategy to tar all those who challenge the entrenched narrative telling us that all this is a good and necessary arrangement to make the essential differentiations and to delineate the various movements now surfacing across the western world the first step is to identify some objective realities in summary fashion they can be stated in these terms globalization in its economic expressions has altered conditions within the developed world integration of markets coupled with the transnational organization of business and finance have made economic forces less susceptible to management by national governments that means that they are less accountable international organizations such as the imf and the bank for international settlements have limited direct authority to regulate or control moreover they are heavily influenced by private interests operating either directly on them or via the governments of the most influential member states a supranational organization like the european union or the european central bank do have stronger powers in principle however they have too have been coopted by private economic interests working hand in glove with officials and the leaders of national governments consider the handling of europe s debt crises this does not mean that national governments have been emasculated to the point of terminal impotency it does means that they are corrupted to the point of being non accountable to their democratic electorate and citizenry money is the main corrupting factor money that is politically fungible and whose influence is magnified by the careerism and selfishness that pervade public life in most western countries one glaring example is the tolerance for tax havens a number of eu countries and the u s as well as the cayman archipelago and the competition among countries to lure businesses to set up shop in their jurisdiction by offering a rich array of inducements this is not a technical problem rooted in globalization it is a political problem 1 technically it could be dealt with overnight were there the will globalization need not have taken the course it did as dean baker has explained and there was nothing inevitable about the patterns of trade that resulted in such an imbalance policy decisions not god nature or the invisible hand exposed american manufacturing workers to direct competition with low paid workers in the developing world this state of affairs has been encouraged by the dulling of competition among political parties these days differences of philosophy of economic strategy of messaging are so narrow that in all major countries we should view these putative rivals as factions or currents within one monolithic party the main culprits in this pernicious development are the parties of the so called left the social democrats in europe the democrats in the united states look at the united kingdom where for six years the conservatives their liberal democratic partners and labour were indistinguishable this did not represent a compromise but a sell out to the point where the locus of opinion among the three on key issues was somewhat to the right of margaret thatcher labour went so far as to buy into the long discredited voodoo economics whereby austerity was the sole possible cure for the chronically depressed post crash economy ramsey macdonald redux in germany the sdp coalition partners of angela merkel have pretty much adapted themselves to being a junior partner of a conservative government in exchange for the perks of ministerial office as to france the less said the better there president francois hollande has all but shuttered his party s franchise in appointing as his economics minister the former head of the medef france s counterpart to the business round table m emmanuel macron who is running for the presidency as an independent the former prime minister m manuel valls the socialist party s unofficial favorite now imperiled by results from the first round of the primary where he trailed benoit hamon representative of the ps fed up with me tooism wing and the front running conservative m francois fillon are so nearly identical in viewpoint as to make one wonder what that threesome would have been debating beyond paris policy on transgender bathrooms that is why marine le pen s front national has seemed almost sure to make it into the run off m fillon should win easily this contest of the clones defeat the fn and will impose his promised reactionary agenda of uprooting the country s network of social programs and returning the french economy to the glory days of the 1920s all in the name of 21st century reform fillon s guide path to the elysee has been interrupted by revelations that his wife penelope has over the past 15 years been tutoring his staff in welsh to more fully appreciate dylan thomas at the public expense of euros 500 000 in the event that the fillon campaign collapses under the weight of penelope gate macron may sneak through and then defeat le pen he rather than fillon would lead france backwards to the same proustian destination fillon s rise is emblematic of current european politics he vaulted into the lead by shifting his campaign message to stress the neuralgic triad of race migration terror unlike marine le pen who genuinely believes in her rhetoric fillon sees it as a tool to win power and to advance a drastic neo liberal project this approach is analogous to the tory s successful strategy across the channel the gold standard for this cynical strategy is donald trump s arousal of the mob to usher in a government run by a pack of carnivorous billionaires italy s matteo renzi head of a leftist coalition government was headed in the same direction his proposed constitutional reforms were a requisite for pushing through the necessary legislation recognized as such they were rejected in november s referendum by a 60 majority of voters who saw through the ploy predictably the world s press unanimously decried the result as another troubling sign of how populism was undermining western democracies if you resisted becoming a disposable pawn in a globalized economy run for others benefit you were declared a wreaker to borrow an old bolshevik term there is nothing mysterious or recondite about what is going on the neo liberal program as applied since 2008 is a uniform failure as measured by economic growth europe as a whole has suffered a lost decade half a dozen eu members have been brought to economic ruin with damage deeper and more enduring than that inflicted by the great depression of the 1930s but it is a success in further transferring wealth from the salaried classes to those in a position to extract economic rent via control of finance mainly and commerce secondarily that rent is extracted from workers whose organized resistance has been weakened by the attack on unions and from consumers cum tax payers via the exploitation of privatization of public assets preferential tax treatment and the neutering of government regulation the aim now is to extend and deepen the process the domination of the democratic electoral process by the lavish application of money and media control facilities the campaign by hamstringing any potential opposition these people observe each other and emulate each other phrasing maneuvers metaphors even gestures jump borders within weeks they admire one another in the way that skilled slight of hand artists admire a talented practitioner of the trade moreover they are on the lookout to see what one can get away with contradictions air brushing their own statements playing fast and loose with facts outright misrepresentations slandering of opponents abusing media relations the inventory of tricks is enlarged by exploiting a lazy and supine press rampant careerism and pervasive ignorance globalization s most enduring if not final legacy may well be the spread of political chicanery the consequence is that across the western world roughly 15 20 of the populace is effectively disenfranchised their docility until recently was taken for granted now our political elites express shock that they are bestirring themselves davos man is suffering heartburn history the post war civilizational compact that brought peace prosperity and stability to europe and north america was grounded on the principle that all citizens have a right to and deserve a share in prosperity as well as political rights leaders in effect pledged that mastery of the business cycle would and should allow for provisions that ensured a certain minimal well being for the mass of the populace social democracy christian democracy gaullism one nation toryism all accepted this conviction 2 success in routinization of economic growth with just a few minor hiccups created the wherewithal for giving tangible expression to that idea social peace in turn was a vital factor that facilitated the working of effective state macro economic management and a productive economy the model perfected in western europe became the reference point for those around the world aspiring to the good society competing with and gradually overtaking the american variant it now is being eradicated in a wave of reaction masquerading as reform the drastic rise in inequality of reward is the combined effect of neo liberalism s intellectual triumph and a global economic system organized in accordance with that inequality itself is now a factor dragging down their economies where weak demand is a principal cause of poor performance and austerity policies the counter productive response maldistribution of wealth is undermining the bedrock of democratic capitalist societies for while it is true that the post war compact did not predicate egalitarianism it did emphasize fairness fairness was interpreted differently from country to country leaning toward egalitarianism in scandinavia less so in france and southern europe with the united states the outlier much of all countries electoral politics centered on debates as to where the locus of fairness lay not in dispute was the idea that all should share in prosperity and that the state had a responsibility to use fiscal policy social legislation and regulation of the private sector to ensure that that consensus no longer exists populism is the belated reaction of everyone frustrated by the ever sharpening contrast between hopes and aspirations and darkening realities of what they might expect for themselves and their children meanwhile the folks at the top wait confidently and expectantly above the fray they have engineered ever ready to swoop down to strip the remains of social democracy by way of privatized public assets no bid contracts tax and regulatory havens commercially owned toll roads student loan monopolies rapacious buying up of foreclosed properties with federal incentives and myriad tax breaks opportunity is the new catchword especially so in the united states where it was avidly promoted by barack obama as well as by republicans it s a nice idea the american dream holds out the hope that anyone can be a success i e rise to the top by dint of individual effort to make the most of one s natural endowments it s the reification of the protestant ethic those who don t succeed are typed either as takers in the republican lexicon or the less fortunate in the democratic lexicon 3 in fact there never has been a close approximation of equal opportunity there always are all kinds of unevenly distributed advantages and drawbacks at work these days socio economic mobility has declined drastically to the point where it is less than in western europe the bigger issue though is the deployment of opportunity as a concept to mask ever widening inequality only a relatively small fraction of people in any society will be successes in the sense that it is used in america in other words those in the top ten percentile does that mean that the current distribution of national riches is acceptable that the greater equality of the 1950s and 1960s was an aberration even though gdp grew and productivity grew much faster than it has in recent decades that the calculated government policies that have driven the widening income gap are somehow part of the natural order of things these questions should frame the debate in a healthy democracy they do not now do so either in the united states or in europe there is another red herring that obscures the forces that have produced the present state of affairs and distorts the discussion of alternatives it is the idea that structural forces alone rather than public policies that are the reason for these income trends that is a convenient way for the beneficiaries to say forget about progressive reform it s all systemically determined get with it in truth there is globalization and there is globalization to a certain extent the integration of world economies will push down wage rates absent intervention but there are myriad ways to compensate for it noted below as for robotization this is a recurrent horror story that has waxed and waned in prominence since the 1950s technological changes do not come as revolutions they do not turn things upside down suddenly they are gradual we heard little on the topic in the period leading up to the 2007 08 financial crash the crash and ensuing massive loss of jobs had nothing to do with robotization the subsequent transformations in the condition of salaried workers too have little if anything to do with robotization the gig economy the explosion in the exploitive use of temps the off shoring of millions of manufacturing jobs to places like mexico thanks to nafta the cutting of pensions etc etc are the result of campaigns by business and investors abetted by government to grab a bigger share of national wealth if those who make the case that the effects we ve noted are inescapable were intellectually honest they would acknowledge that there are simple logical ways to ameliorate them one is to raise taxes on the financial and business sectors as well as the rich generally and apply the proceeds to public programs which would raise the standard of living of working people that means comprehensive health care bolstering social security child care facilities affordable nursing homes and assisted living higher education funding and student grants subsidized mass transportation serious drug treatment programs etc the second is to lower taxes on wage earners correspondingly third the strengthening of trade unions would have the direct effect of striking a healthier balance between labor in capital with the certain consequence of a rise in wages socialist utopian a drag on the economy in the u s the evidence is that these measures would boost the economy and bring national wealth distribution more in line with what it was 60 years ago the eisenhower golden age of all in the family and i love lucy so many claim to be nostalgic about iii terror immigration every significant social phenomenon is multi causal it is the west s misfortunate that its fragilities should be exposed by the combined stresses of economic insecurity and the threat of terrorist violence the latter has been magnified by the endless american instigated and led wars in the islamic world with the resulting waves of immigrants seeking shelter in western europe in the u s there are no waves of muslim immigrants but illegal latino immigrants have been summoned forth to fill the emotional ideological gap anxieties about one have reinforced anxieties about the other the brew is a potent one which has had the dual effect of intensifying free floating feelings of insecurity and creating a focal point for xenophobia and bigotry european politics have been roiled as a result the tangible manifestation has been to put wind in the sails of pre existing jingoist parties and new far right ones that is evident from britain to france to the netherlands to austria and even to scandinavia denmark above all each country has its own peculiarities and there are important differences among these parties in terms of bases of support focus and program italy s five star movement for example avoids all rhetoric implying racism in eastern europe parties that deserve the label neo fascist have surfaced in poland one has gained power in hungary the tendency is contained by a thinning membrane of legality and proper nationalism in the light of history it is understandable that the phenomenon should take on a more ominous coloration at the eastern end of the continent this is all a much discussed topic and limitations of time and space counsel against delving deeply into the subject when there is nothing noteworthy to add one thing should be said in this domain as on economic matters there is a failing of political will at the national level aggravated by the fragmentation of authority at the eu level division of powers and politics provides a convenient escape hatch for officials at both levels who find who find it irresistible to shift blame onto the other western democracies are now self evidently vulnerable to demagogic adventurers and movements with autocratic if not neo fascist overtones the only antidote is revival of a constructive and responsible populist political culture that observes the principles of government of the people by the people for the people that is the essential condition for strengthening democracies political super ego and thereby for neutralizing the forces of bigotry and xenophobia the need is compelling two questions remain do our political and economic elites have the prescience skill and resolve to accomplish so delicate a task one must be skeptical these are the very people who fostered and have benefitted from neo liberal globalization and its domestic concomitants enlightened far horizon thinking is not their forte only a major world crisis that threatens their control directly could shake their complacency in those circumstances it is populism rather than populism that likely would prevail witness the brexit and trump primal screams in relatively benign circumstances should it be undertaken at the national or the international level 4 the national state remains the locus of political action however constrained by transnational factors the neo liberal elites exercise complete control in brussels in frankfurt and in washington on 19th street ask the greeks the italians the portuguese and francois hollande about that yet action at the national level is reactive rather than initiating that favors populism over populism joseph stiglitz globalization its discontents norton 2003 stiglitz the great divide unequal societies and what we can do about them norton 2016 stiglitz the euro how a common currency threatens the future of europe norton 2016 the arduousness of the transformation that led to the europe enjoyed today can be easily forgotten the distress of the postwar years is brought back by tony judt in postwar a history of europe since 1945 new york penguin 2005 barack obama recites the catechism of the national creed we will have to move forward as we always have together as a people who believe that out of that after all is the story of america a story of progress however halting however incomplete however harshly challenged at each point on our journey the story of america is a story of progress i m proud to say that we have laid a new foundation for america a new future is ours to write and i m as confident as ever that it will be led by the united states of america and that our best days are still ahead a rigorous fine grained examination of this crucial issue is provided by adam tooze a general logic of crisis in the london review of books volume 39 number 1 5 january 2017 the plutocrats compulsive denigration of the poor the ill and the dispossessed is perhaps the most telling evidence of status obsession fed by insecurity that is at the core of their social personality they find it necessary to stigmatize the latter as at best failures at worst as moral degenerates drug addicts lazy parasites in part to highlight their superiority and in part to blur the human consequences of their rapacity americans have a craving to believe in their own virtue as well as to have others recognize it the perverse pride in beating the system cannot in and of itself compensate for the feeling that you re a bad guy a reputation as hard nosed or flinty is prized but a sob no blankfein again i have been doing the lord s work no one laughs in public so i m right about that plutocracy in the current american style is having pernicious effects that go beyond the dominant influence of the rich on the nation s economy and government it is setting precedents and modeling the unaccountability and irresponsibility that are pervading executive power throughout the society two successive presidential administrations and two decades of rogue behavior by corporate elites have set norms now evident in institutions as diverse as universities and think tanks the military and professional associations even private clubs the cumulative result is a widespread degrading of standards in the uses and abuses of power plutocracy also raises social tensions in society logically the main line of tension should be between the plutocrats and the rest or at least between them and all those with modest means but that is not the case in the united states while it is true that there were bitter words about the wall street moguls and their bailouts during the first year or so after the financial collapse it never became the main line of political division today outrage has abated and politics is all about austerity and debts rather than the distribution of wealth and the power that goes along with it the deep seated sense of anxiety and grievance that pervades the populace manifests itself in outbreaks of hostile competition among groups who are in fact themselves all victims of the plutocrats success in grabbing for themselves the lion s share of the country s wealth thereby leaving the rest of us to fight for the leftovers so it is private sector employees pitted against government employees because the latter have some health insurance some pension and some security relative to the former who have been shorn of all three it s parents worried about their kids education against teachers both against cash strapped local authorities municipalities vs states it s the small businessman against unions and health insurance requirements it s doctors against patients against administrators it is university administrators against faculty and against students faculty against students in competing for a much reduced appropriations it s all of those against boards of regents and state governors truth challenged economics economists claim their discipline is a science if so it is an odd one for the deeper you probe its foundations the shakier its superstructure looks modern day economics is built on two convenient dogmatic untruths the first is the rationality of markets that as modeled in the equilibrium market theory emt which has been dominant for a generation presumes a systemic logic that precludes sharp breaks or excesses the second interlocking premise is that humans are utility maximizing animals who act in accordance with a calculated self interest which ensures those stable rational markets both premises are at variance with observed reality this incongruity has not prevented professional economists almost unanimously to promote fanciful theories that became ensconced in the thinking and behavior of central banks the imf regulatory agencies and wall street as well as the aei so well ensconced that they survived the rude encounter with truth in the crisis of 2008 2009 that phenomenon reminds us that the age of dogmatic faith is not over it is the objects of faith that have changed the predilection for single dimensional constructs of mono causal explanations is incompatible with truth seeking there is no aspect of man in society that is otherwise neo liberal economists are sociological monophysites that is the heart of the matter they assert that humans and therefore society has only one unitary nature that of calculating narrowly self interested economic man observation of the world around us tells us that this is untrue man and society have multiple natures that is what makes them human neo liberal economists faith in their dubious premises leads them down a path that skirts reality that is manifest in a doctrinal approach to crucial economic phenomena central to interpretations of real world conditions and equally to policies they guide for a systematic unsparing critique of the doctrinally driven distortions of today s mainstream economics orthodoxy see james kwak economism bad economics and the rise of inequality pantheon 2017 reality based assessments of the united states economic predicaments should begin with a set of bedrock questions what is the country s actual wealth how is it distributed why is it distributed in this way what is the role of government in producing that distribution what are the consequences of that distribution what are the reasons for a possible reallocation of national resources how might it be done is that a desirable or undesirable goal how could it be done while maintaining a stable functioning of the economy some economic tools are useful to refine the answers much of the rest is ritual theoretical filigree for scholarly archives or mere distraction the united states does not pay for things of social value because it chooses not to not because it cannot afford them it has multiple antecedents society as a whole elected representatives government officials political parties all those powerful interests that distort the process in every facet to their own advantage the choices made in recent years include expending 1 trillion to 2 trillion to hunt spectral terrorists in the far corners of the globe to little effect it includes the 87 billion spent annually on our intelligence agencies it includes the huge tax breaks given by the bush administration concentrated on those in the upper 2 income bracket between 2002 and today that diverted approximately 2 7 trillion dollars out of the treasury into the pockets of the wealthy adding to the debt servicing of resulting deficits to paraphrase senator everett dirksen a trillion here a trillion there and soon you re talking about real money 7 8 trillion could pay for all the state municipal budget cuts the rebuilding of the country s infrastructure a serious energy program environmental clean up aid to the elderly as for health care we could pay for first rate coverage of every citizen at a cost one third lower than what we now spend were we to switch the kind of single payer system that works nearly everywhere else in the developed world freeing another trillion or so for other purposes this new economic order constitutes a counter revolution against the epochal transformations of the post war era almost every feature of the social compact forged then is either being rejected or called into question social equity containing disparities in wealth distribution ensconcing government as the legitimate and necessary guardian of the public good giving everyone a piece of the action as well as a piece of the pie valuing compromise and conciliation at the eu level
neoliberalism versus sovereignty the case of sri lanka part 1 tamara kunanayakam economist and international relations expert former ambassador permanent representative of sri lanka to the united nations at geneva former senior international civil servant at the united nations and ex chairperson rapporteur of intergovernmental working group on the right to development introduction a fundamental principle of international law incorporated in a wide range of international and regional instruments is permanent sovereignty over the nation s wealth and resources and all its economic activities as a basic constituent of the right of peoples to self determination and its corollary the duty of states to respect sovereign equality in their relations with other states it is a recognition that there can be no political independence without economic social and cultural independence free from all forms of interference or pressure direct or indirect of whatever sort and under whatever pretext 1 for independence to be complete any future attempt to restore foreign influence or domination must be prevented forever 2 this universal admission is the result of the historical struggle of colonised peoples for freedom particularly of africa and asia whose newly won independence had remained purely formal and fragile threatened by the resolve of rich capitalist countries to standardise and rationalise the global economy to ensure their monopoly and control over foreign markets the ongoing neoliberal reconfiguration of the state to facilitate global expansion of capital by imposing a single model of development and transferring decision making on all aspects of social relations to a handful of western oligarchs is inimical to the sovereignty and independence of nation states the agenda is supported by the neoconservative interests observed in modus operandi of the un human rights council led by us neoconservatives who promote direct unilateral preventive and pre emptive intervention including military in the internal affairs of sovereign states in examining the rapid progress of neoliberal reforms in sri lanka it is essential to bear in mind this complementarity and commonality between neoliberals and neoconservatives and their mutually reinforcing actions their common goal is to maintain us global hegemony and their common enemy is state sovereignty the principle upon which the multilateral system is based 3 they both champion a shift of governance to corporate controlled supranational institutions4 they claim are necessarily objective and apolitical although beyond the reach of domestic accountability they both foster elite cooperation globally through powerful often secretive groups 5 and both make claims to a moral universalism to justify external intervention refining and propagating language best described as orwellian doublespeak to promote their agenda the sovereignty of nations and peoples everywhere is at stake and sri lanka is no exception the present paper counters the neoliberal claim that the breaking down of nation states and sovereignty is a natural phenomenon that is progressive and inevitable and shows how its making and perpetuation is a continuing violation of national sovereignty and the inalienable rights of peoples and nations to determine their political economic social and cultural systems the paper begins by examining the making of the neoliberal global order by a conscious restructuring of the nation state and the fostering of elite cooperation internationally to ensure its reproduction through inter alia think tanks it will then examine some of neoliberalism s basic claims and reality and its impact on politics and society finally it will examine the case of sri lanka and attempt to disentangle the complex web of relations that exist between and among think tanks the mother of all think tanks the mont pelerin society mps global corporates the us administration and sri lanka s trans nationalised elite the section will focus on some of the lesser known but visible vehicles for intervention the institute for policy studies ips advocate institute and millennium challenge corporation mcc it will conclude with certain observations on fundamental principles of international law that provide a basis for alternatives to the hegemonic neoliberal model for the restoration of sovereignty neoliberal re engineering of state a political project an insidious radical and all encompassing transformation or re engineering of the nation state is taking place based on a market society and market rules involving the marketization of the entire scope of human relations through multiple political economic social and cultural processes it is not a natural self regulating inevitable and benevolent process but designed implemented and reproduced often through violent intervention by global corporations in alliance with a section of the local elite whose destiny and vision have become intertwined with theirs its name is neoliberalism the global expression of capital dominated by finance its principal project is globalisation the integration of the world into new globalised circuits of accumulation for profit maximization by transnational capital dominated by finance through use of state power it is associated with the us project to retain global hegemony if necessary by unilateral military intervention unlike classical liberalism it goes beyond the mere opening of markets its claim is global a single model for all imposing the market logic to all forms of human interaction economic as well as financial social political cultural ecological and even psychological neoliberalism cannot be separated from capitalism roberts describes it a new regimen of capitalism as political response of capital to the growing militancy of the labour force 6 and saad filho as the mode of existence of contemporary capitalism 7 to curtail the power of labour as such it emerged in reaction to the first generalised systemic crisis of world capitalism in 1973 1974 resulting from a falling rate of profit expressed in a crisis of overproduction a credit crisis in the us aggravated by escalating costs of its military interventions in korea taiwan and vietnam the collapse of the bretton woods system stagflation and an impending debt crisis in the south ever since it has been imposed globally often violently through state intervention and patronage of us hegemony the first neoliberal experiment designed and implemented by milton friedman s chicago boys was carried out in chile from 1973 to 1989 under the military dictatorship of general pinochet following the cia backed coup d état and assassination of the democratically elected president salvador allende it gained prominence only after the election of margaret thatcher in britain and ronald reagan in the united states in the global south it was imposed through external pressure ranging from imf world bank conditionalities unilateral threats and sanctions financing of civil society organisations promoting neoliberal values fomenting political unrest and regime change foreign aggression and military intervention contrary to neoliberal claims markets are not places where goods and services are freely bought and sold by producers and consumers but where large corporations dominate unhindered by regulation or countervailing social forces they rely on a strong state to create favourable conditions for the operation of transnational capital in fact neoliberalism is based on the systematic use of state power to impose a hegemonic project of decomposition of the rule of capital 8 non intervention is only the ideological guise as gramsci understood laissez faire too is a form of state regulation introduced and maintained by coercive means it is a deliberate policy conscious of its own ends and not the spontaneous automatic expression of economic facts 9 instead of being rolled back or made to disappear the state is reengineered to intervene on its own behalf the state is expected to intervene heavily to deregulate liberalise depoliticise privatise outsource flexibilise and marketise everything and implement fiscal and monetary austerity with a view to separating from the political realm all economic financial and other potentially profitable activities including social and cultural so that vital sectors are brought under the control of transnational capital and its economic interests prioritised over the common good insulating it from peoples choices crippling trade unions and depriving the state of capacity to act once deregulated the state is expected to reregulate to protect the private property thus acquired by global corporates to shield it from popular resistance and trade union action good governance and the associated rule of law is the obscure term for a new system of law and government involving legal political and institutional reform putting in place instruments of social control coercive and ideological to maintain a stable social order required by global capital thus limiting the ability of people and nation to make choices and state capacity to implement those choices and promote social justice or even to fulfil its international human rights and labour obligations implicit in the dogma of an autonomous free market as optimum for achieving human freedom and a collectivist state as a threat is the view that it is not society that determines the economic system but the economic system that determines how society is organised 10 this notion of a mystic entity beyond human control removes decision making from the lives of ordinary people and renders them passive objects not subjects of their own destiny it thus permits the imposition of an alien model of society on peoples and nations usurping their inalienable right to freely determine the political economic social and cultural system they choose to live in neoliberalism is essentially a political project designed to prevent the emergence of countervailing forces and permit transnational capital to override democratic processes

last year was tough for emerging markets as currencies and equity investment classes struggled to keep up with investment options in developed countries leading to the question should emerging market em assets make the cut for any portfolio in 2019 with a stronger us dollar and the us federal reserve normalising rates 2018 will be remembered as the year the indian rupee reached historic lows the argentinian peso fell 52 and the turkish lira shed 14 in a single day there was the massive rand selloff too for south africa the fiscal stimulus announced by president cyril ramaphosa only raised more questions on the pressure this will add to the economy s fiscal space and ultimately how it will impact rating agencies actions on the political front populism has become the new norm with right wing rhetoric fast replacing patriotism ems have had to adjust to the geopolitics that have evolved into a trade and aid skirmish between washington and beijing in emerging markets politics drives the economy says vestact portfolio manager michael treherne in the developed world the economy drives the politics geopolitics are always a risk for em markets i am optimistic that the us and china will resolve their issues resulting in a boost to global growth as for ems let us hope there are no more politicians behaving impulsively the financial predicaments in argentina and turkey raised the question of whether more buffers could have been in place to counter the fiscal and monetary woes could structural safeguards have prevented the turkish lira crisis the problem in both argentina and turkey were the politicians says treherne i m not sure you can set up buffers to counter poor policies contagion may spread but for now em indices remain in the crossfire of developed market policies a worst case scenario involving an escalation in the beijing washington trade war talk would decimate world markets unlike the version a decade ago when spillover risks were contained to their respective regions last week the international monetary fund further downgraded its 2019 growth forecast to 3 5 with south africa s growth outlook surprisingly revised from 0 8 to 1 4 consequently foreign trade and investment into major emerging markets is projected to reach at 1 trillion according to the institute for international finance i have seen a number of international money managers saying they are increasingly looking at ems as a place for investment which is good news for us says treherne i think the big factor in our fdi will be the outcome of our election who is appointed to the cabinet and then what the focus for government is settling the land issue quickly is also vital for having long term capital flow into south africa emerging markets brace for qe tapering as a monetary antidote to the 2008 financial crisis in the us fed chair ben bernanke rolled out a quantitative easing qe programme that saw easy money flood emerging markets but with easy money coming in many emerging markets that had been reforming their monetary systems hit the pause button channeling all efforts in attracting all the easy money they could accordingly em debt has grown exponentially over the past decade i think we were lucky bernanke was running the fed in 2008 says treherne he understood what not to do and how bad things were probably better than most thanks to him the fed acted quickly and we only had a great recession instead of another depression treherne also argues that corporate and household debt might be higher now than 10 years ago but this is directly proportionate to their net asset value for most the debt levels are not out of sync when looking at the rest of their balance sheet added to this interest rates are very low and expected to stay low for years to come in a low interest rate environment you can afford to have a bit more debt sitting on your balance sheet meanwhile investment fund trackers project stock and bond inflows at less than 40 billion in 2018 with a slight increase predicted this year but much of that is destined for china and south korea given their large weight in the msci index the question is how much of the 40 billion will south africa garner in an election year
by roger j kerr the nzd usd exchange rate tested both ends of its current trading range last week it dipped to a low of 0 6710 on 22 january as it followed the aud lower however recovering sharply on the marginally stronger than expected cpi number on 23 january and also a weaker usd towards the end of the week to close at the upper end at 0 6845 the kiwi dollar is now consolidating its gains around 0 6800 after the flash crash inspired albeit very brief depreciation to 0 6600 on the 3rd of january consensus forecasts for the cpi figures reduced late in the piece to a 0 0 result and when the data was released at 0 10 the fx market immediately bought the kiwi dollar up the nz dollar currency market had positioned itself extremely short sold kiwi going into the cpi announcement as the rumours built that a negative number would force the rbnz to cut the ocr however the deflation doom merchants were denied their day in the sun as domestic non tradable inflation yet again increased by more than the economic forecasters had anticipated rates rents construction costs and insurance premiums continue to increase nullifying the reduction in fuel prcies in the december quarter the speculators who had sold the kiwi ahead of the cpi release were hastily forced to buy their position back sending the kiwi up there was little evidence of imported electronic goods lifting in price due to the depreciation of the kiwi dollar to 0 6500 in the september quarter either importers were well hedged at the 0 7400 0 7300 level from earlier in 2018 or more likely extras were removed but base retail selling prices not increased while the inflation result was below the rbnz s own forecast they cannot afford to be complacent about the inflation outlook in 2019 and 2020 anecdotal evidence is that more business firms are seeking to increase their selling prices as the tight labour market is finally forcing the payment of higher wage increases to workers across many industries however this is not yet evident in official employment and wages data the probability of the kiwi dollar suffering a major sell off to the low 0 6000 s because of a rbnz cut to the ocr on a weaker growth and inflation outlook has decreased in the writer s view while the economic argument is that we are near the end of the economic cycle and the housing market is slowing up the reality is that there are many shortages and bottleknecks remaining in the economy and this is not an environment for falling consumer prices when supply is greater than demand prices will fall in the economy however we are a long way from that situation today the reverse is more true will any global growth slowdown hurt the kiwi dollar global investment and financial markets are assimilating a plethora of updated forecasts from the imf the oecd and numerous investment banks that world gdp growth will slow further in 2018 as the trade wars higher us interest rates and falling equity market values force business firms to pullback on expansion plans and output these forecasts already appear to be out of date in my opinion since january 1 st the causes of all the pessimism in late 2018 have changed dramatically some form of trade agreement on reducing import tariffs between china and the us is very much on the cards over coming weeks federal reserve boss jay powell has u turned on the interest rate outlook since early december and share markets continued to recover throughout the month of january weaker global growth does mean reducing commodity prices and that is always bad news for the aussie dollar and the kiwi dollar while the aud and nzd have been vulnerable to the weaker growth outlook over recent months today that vulnerability is reducing as sentiment improves the us federal government shutdown was causing some uncertainties however president trump has blinked and allowed a temporary measure to re open the government departments only in america the us dollar weakened from 1 1300 to 1 1400 against the euro on friday 25 january as the currency markets started to focus on the federal reserve s next statement wherein they are expected to endorse the more cautionary tone in powell s speech in early january expectations of further increases in us interest rates this year have really softened over recent weeks it is hard to see the us dollar strengthening in this environment sentiment hard against the aussie dollar but it holds its ground global banks such as hsbc and rabobank are calling the australian economy and thus the aussie dollar in a doom loop as they see falling real estate prices high household debt levels and the federal reserve going on hold all working to allow the rba to cut interest rates they are forecasting the aud usd exchange rate to depreciate further to 0 6600 by the end of this year economic forecasting house capital economics are even more bearish predicting the aud to drop to 0 6000 against the usd by the end of the year due to the rba slashing interest rates from 1 50 to 1 00 and iron ore prices falling away to us 55 and us 50 per tonne my view is that the aud depreciation from above 0 8000 in early 2018 to 0 7000 a few weeks ago has already priced in the negatives listed by the banks and capital economics fx markets always price future economic commodity price scenarios or risks up to 12 months in advance when the expected interest rate cuts or fall in iron ore prices do not happen the greater risk is that the aud appreciates to 0 7500 as all the downside has already been priced in even at the current rate of 0 7200 the aud is still over sold against the usd in my view the australian economy is currently receiving a real export market boost that is below the radar of the pessimists the aud has moved lower over recent months whereas their main metal and mining commodity prices have remain stable the mining sector is quietly far more profitable from the converted aud prices for these reasons i see the nzd aud cross

government has been warned against clandestine price controls being effected through its stranglehold on foreign currency allocation government has been warned against clandestine price controls being effected through its stranglehold on foreign currency allocation by mthandazo nyoni economic analysts said there were companies that were being forced to sell products at below cost after getting foreign currency from government the practice was not sustainable and would only widen the budget deficit analysts said recently delta corporation the country s largest beverages manufacturer announced a new pricing system pegged in united states dollars in a strategic move to keep itself afloat in the face of foreign currency shortages but government through the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz moved swiftly forcing the company to reverse the decision after assuring it that it would provide the forex required to fund its import requirements analysts who spoke to standardbusiness said by guaranteeing private companies like delta access to us dollars so that they could sell below cost of production the central bank was effectively subsidising private companies this they warned was not sustainable and would see more private companies stampeding for the same favour after government had assured delta of steady foreign currency allocation surface wilmar and olivine industries suspended operations citing a worsening foreign currency crisis olivine industries is jointly owned by the ministry of finance and economic development and the wilmar group which also owns surface wilmar the two could have anticipated that what happened to delta would also happen to them analysts said taxpayers money should be used to fund government activities involved in running the country not running businesses unfortunately socialist countries tend to have policies that claim government should run or at least regulate all businesses economist john robertson said in communist countries robertson said governments claim the right to control all businesses communism failed and socialist countries tend to remain poor he said robertson said private banks should play a leading role in promoting business but the banks needed the skills to determine which business people and which business ideas would work but even when the bankers are satisfied that the business proposals are good bankers still need security from business borrowers because they are lending money that belongs to depositors he said the best form of security is property backed by title deeds and by good laws that defend the property owners rights property owners are putting their properties at risk when they borrow against them so they work very hard to pay off their loans robertson said the money available should be bought on a foreign currency market that is run by the banks if there is not enough money available the banks should be able to borrow from foreign banks but only after satisfying everybody that enough analysis of the borrowers and their businesses has been done to show that they are sound and worthy of support he said if big developments can be shown likely to pay themselves off by making everybody in the country more efficient the government can borrow from other governments or from the world bank but such loans must be repaid zimbabwe s failure to repay loans has disqualified the country from access to new loans bulawayo based economic commentator reginald shoko said government cannot afford that arrangement subsidising private companies it s not a priority to allocate the scarce foreign exchange to delta the company must start exporting to fund its foreign currency needs rather than expecting foreign currency from a strained government why are we funding for people pleasures ahead of medicines and requirements by farmers and miners who are source of foreign currency shoko said the government should immediately stop the practice of subsidising private companies as that impacted negatively on the economy the practice tended to increase government s budget deficit and to promote nepotism and corruption industrialist busisa moyo who is also oil expressers association of zimbabwe chairperson said the best way to allocate foreign currency was allowing the willing buyer and willing seller market model to distribute the resource i see this as a short term intervention while the economy finds balance the best allocator of a scarce resource however is allowing a market model of willing buyer and willing seller to distribute the resource moyo said foreign currency is best placed in an interbank run market system or at least an auction system exporters have approached us to lodge their complaint that they are not receiving fair value for their forex and industry is complicit in dispossessing them of their property by accepting these allocations they argue that this is unconstitutional he said analysts said the rbz should play its roles which include among others protecting the value of the country s money by ensuring that there is never too much of it in circulation and by seeing to it that the banks manage it properly looking after the country s foreign currency reserves as well as printing and issuing the country s money robertson said when a government interferes with property rights and the banks cannot get the security needed to support lending government might have to force the central bank to lend to businesses in zimbabwe this is called command agriculture this lending would never have been needed if title deeds to farmland had not been rendered obsolete by government policies this move crippled the whole country and it is still in this crippled state today help is not coming from international sources because the country is seen to be suffering from a self inflicted disability he said we know that we could fix this by restoring the collateral value of our land but government wants us to remain on our crutches and in our wheelchairs look how disabled we are surely we deserve aid no we don t we just need to be empowered by property rights robertson said robertson said government should restore title deeds to land so that security for billions of dollars worth of lending would become accessible from the banks the banks could become as supportive as they should be and the reserve bank could concentrate on being a central bank not a government department the function of which is to make bad government policies work a little bit better he said
welcome to this week s market wrap podcast i m mike gleason coming up greg weldon of weldon financial joins us for a 2019 outlook i ll ask him if he thinks the recent stock market rally has legs and also for his forecast for gold this year and greg has some very interesting news regarding the yellow metal which to his surprise hardly anyone knows about don t miss another fantastic interview with greg weldon coming up after this week s market update gold and silver markets traded modestly lower through thursday s close as the u s senate failed to pass bills to re open the government all the metals are up on jan 25 however well now without further delay let s get right to this week s exclusive interview mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome in greg weldon ceo and president of weldon financial greg has over three decades of market research and trading experience specializing in the metals and commodity markets and his close connection with the metals led him to author a book back in 2006 titled gold trading boot camp where he accurately predicted the implosion of the u s credit market and urged people to buy gold when it was only 550 an ounce he is a regular presenter at financial conferences throughout the country and is a highly sought after guest on many popular financial shows and it s always great to have him on the money metals podcast greg good to have you back on happy new year thanks for the time today and welcome back greg weldon it s my pleasure mike please excuse my voice i ve been a little under the weather this week so i apologize mike gleason we ll make it work well thanks for joining us again since it looks to us like what s happening in the equity markets has a strong bearing on what s happening in the metals market let s start by getting your take on the direction of stocks equities had a miserable finish to last year and conversely metals finished 2018 by moving higher but since treasury secretary steven mnuchin put his call out to banks and the plunge protection team we ve seen stocks surging 2019 is off to one of the best starts for the equity markets ever do you think the rally in stocks has legs here or will we see some selling resume greg weldon well i think that this is a sell the rally mode here it will continue to be to me it s like well it s all good that the rally is taking place you basically took out the long termâ i look at the 52 week and the two year exponential moving averages on the weekly charts as a good gauge for the long term trends you have consistently taken out the two year moving average and closed back above it in the same week and this goes back over the last 10 years if you look at this market since the low in 2009 so it really recovered but i hardly see this as the beginning of a new bull leg to the upside for one thing you re barely 50 back to the highs it s not like you re at a new high here it s interesting to see on tv everyone talk about how this is the best beginning to a year ever and it s because you just had the worst fourth quarter in 10 years so you have to have perspective the question for me where is the growth going to come from where is the next trillion dollars of wealth creation what s going to generate that well is it trade if we get a trade deal with china is that going to be the next big thing that s going to drive this market to new highs absolutely not it may drive the market to new highs but that s not going to be sustainable because at the end of the day this is not stimulus we have about a 375 drop most recent month to around 350 something the bottom line is our annual trade deficit with china is less than 2 of gdp this is not an engine of growth this is merely a leveling of the playing field to become a more fair and open trade dynamic so i don t see that as stimulus the fact that the fed has kind of backed off from their hawkish pursuit of higher rates here also not stimulus and in fact i could make a strong case to suggest that the fed is still tightening without doing anything why do i say that because inflation has dropped so real interest rates have risen since really august since before the september hike you ve gone from a real fed funds effective rate of minus 100 basis to where it is now more than plus 50 the fed said they wanted to be neutral they re past neutral now i know it kind of sounds crazy to say a real fed funds rate of a half of 1 is tight but it is when you re draining money from the bond market and when you have this dynamic around inflation and the fed has got into a rate that is well above the effective fed funds rate if you look at the futures market for the federal funds rate for 2010 it s actually pricing in a rate cut now and that would be theoretically according to the future strip the next fed move there s a lot of inconsistencies here but at the end of the day until the fed actually starts talking about cutting interest rates and being stimulative they are not so trade deal is not an engine of growth the fed not hiking rates more is not stimulus so i don t see where the impetus is going to come from to drive this market to a serious new high mike gleason in recent months we ve been asking you about trade and tariffs so we ll continue there for a moment the last time we spoke you pointed out that while there are certainly some effects to the u s economy the tariffs are helping some firms and hurting others on net there may not be as large an impact as many people think it s a different story in china however you were seeing signs of inflation and a dramatic slowdown in growth there can you update our listeners as to what s happening on trade more in china and what will that mean for the u s if the chinese economy hits the skids greg weldon well there s two things to discuss here first the whole trump plan here their strategy i ve said this before and i think this is the best analogy you could possibly come up with you re talking about two leaders chinese and the u s that are dousing gasoline and standing there with lit matches now the u s is in a position of strength given that their match is longer than the chinese match and when you look at the data from china often misunderstood because nominal numbers are so high now in china in terms of retail sales and gdp growth and so on and so forth you re not going to have the same percentage gains it s just not mathematically feasible having said that you ve seen a shift in the most recent numbers that is rather dramatic where domestic final demand consumer final demand retail sales automobile sales have virtually collapsed this is a real problem and how are the chinese going to address this their inflation is dropping like a stone european inflation is dropping like a stone and we re not talking about europe yet but that s a big deal for me but sticking with china they re in real trouble here economically what are they going to do they haven t even cut rates yet and that to me is almost a symptom of they re afraid that they don t have that many bullets they have more bullets in a lot of places for sure but their real official policy rate is actually quite high now because of the decline in inflation so i would look for china to be the place for stimulus beyond just cutting the reserve requirements four times in the last 14 months i really thought you might get an official rate cut in this after this most recent round of data so why the pboc people s bank of china is waiting is kind of beyond me i don t quite understand it and the longer they wait the more trouble this is going to be and for sure at some point it ll have a more material impact on the u s economy mike gleason greg i know you re always focused on the consumer how much debt he has and you look at it as a good leading indicator for our overall economic health so i want to ask you about that and then also get your thoughts on how the government shutdown will be affecting the not inconsequential amount of the american workforce that is going without a paycheck right now due to the shutdown how do you envision that weighing on the consumer here greg greg weldon well first thing i ll say about that is why are the people in congress still getting paid when no one else is that s number one that s just infuriating as a citizen of the united states but having said that the consumer is stretched to the max and before the december rate hike the amount of money that the u s consumer is paying just to float their debt not to pay it down just to maintain it has exploded to a record high which shows you the problem of having such low rates that the second they go up a little bit it has an exponentially greater effect on the consumer you are now well above the 2007 highs in terms of the monthly nut that consumers have to pay out just to keep their debt from basically becoming delinquent you re at about 350 billion a month that is a huge number when you compare it to retail sales of 510 billion a month at some point this absolutely crowds out discretionary spending not only that according to the new york fed s household survey which is a treasure trove information you are seeing that people that are at the average income level of around 58 000 a year household family they re really struggling they re relying more on their credit cards to pay their monthly bills these things are not sustainable and the second the stock market wobbles you start to see the impact on the economy why because the consumer has done the exact same thing they did when we wrote the book in 2006 into 2007 where they borrowed against unrealized paper profits in an asset that they are convinced cannot go down in value back then it was their homes now it s their 401 k and the stock market and guess what the stock market can go down and when it does it is going to leave the consumer in a very very vulnerable state where you can really see some big pressure on retail sales and particularly in the discretionary area the question becomes when does this start to manifest in the data it s already started and how s the fed going to deal with this is a question they re going to have to the good thing with the fed is they were smart enough to and they told us this they ve been pretty brilliant actually in what they ve done they ve taken it a bridge too far with the december rate hike in my opinion but when you look at compare the fed to the ecb or the bank of japan they have some room to cut rates now and they told us before they started hiking we want to raise rates so when we have another recession we can cut rates and we don t have to change our position on the balance sheet and yet what happens the second the stock market wobbles everyone starts talking about stopping the shrinkage of the balance sheet that s insane it s not going to happen so once again i just don t see how we get from point a to point b without having a real sense of pain in the middle and that pain comes from the stock market so i m not convinced at all that this rally in the stock market has any serious sustainability to the upside mike gleason we ve just started a new year so we d be remiss if we didn t ask you for your outlook on metals what do you see is the key factors which will be driving gold and silver markets in the months ahead and what are you forecasting for the metals this year greg weldon well as you know we re bullish on metals the dollar has been somewhat problematic in the sense that it s not doing what we thought it would do which is be the relief valve for the fed since they can t cut rates they can t stop the shrinkage in their balance sheets i might anticipate there s some kind of move on the dollar at some point this year so they ve kind of have gold from breaking out through this 1 300 and really the key level in dollar terms of 1 375 1 377 having said that there has been a big change in the gold market that i haven t heard a hell of a lot of people talking about that is simply this gold is now rallying in virtually every paper currency in the world and to me this shows that the world is still understanding that they can t just keep papering over these issues they re not fixing anything all they do is throw more paper onto the bonfire i ve used this analogy many times all the way back in the end of 2015 early 2016 we first started getting bullish on gold again for the first time dating all the way back to the 2011 high and that is what you have since 1971 when u s went off the gold standard is this gigantic bonfire and that bonfire is credit if you want this thing to be sustained you have to keep throwing more wood or paper or kindling on this fire than you did previously if you had to spend three and a half to four trillion dollars when u s sovereign debt was nine trillion think of what you re going to have to do now when u s debt is headed towards 23 trillion do you think there s the political will let alone the stomach for a let s say seven or eight trillion dollar expansion to the fed balance sheet i don t think so i think you have issues around the math and i think you are headed towards the situation where people are really starting to worry that maybe they can t just keep applying this same remedy keep riding the white horse of money printing to the rescue and if they do and they will of course they will this is very bullish for gold from here because essentially you are now eroding the confidence in all paper currencies because of the huge increases in debt mike gleason yeah very well stated it s a big world out there there s lots of currencies and gold is measured against all of them and that s a very interesting point it is doing well against virtually every currency it s a good observation well greg as we begin to wrap up give us any final thoughts you have here today what are you going to be watching most closely or maybe what do you think people will be talking about say three to six months from now as we start to see how this new year is going to play out economically and in the markets give us your thoughts there as we close greg weldon i think three to six months from now we re actually going to be talking about europe because no one s talking about europe it s all trade it s all u s politics it s all china in the meantime europe is having a real implosion when you talk about germany where growth at the beginning of the year was 3 gdp growth was real gdp growth was north of 1 1 2 but the most recent data where gdp is 1 1 despite the fact that inflation has virtually plunged here in germany real gdp is now negative and that s a problem because what is the ecb supposed to do about it i just don t see how this reconciles well in europe at all so i think you really have to watch europe interesting to note by the way tooâ and i just did a report on this yesterdayâ if you look at what s happened where you have this absolute plunge in nominal gdp a deepening negative move in real gdp on the back of a falling inflation a falling ppi and cpi and every proponent to every single component this is problematic from the ecb s perspective what are they going to do what are they going to do they re going to buy more bonds again that s the kind of thing where this paper dynamic has become so absurd that people aren t going to buy into it this time and when you look at the german bond market with this recent real erosion in the macro data the two year schatz yield had barely moved and is actually rising why because it s 25 basis points below the minus 40 basis point official policy rate of the ecb the laws of physics apply at some point here with negative yields and i think you ve seen that kind of tipping point in germany in the meantime because the 10 year and more so the 30 year still have some positive nominal yield they have room to move lower so i m looking at yield curves flattening in europe much like we saw last year in the u s but i am really focused on europe and then of course always the u s consumer it is the driving force still of the global economy not as much as it used to be but still is the number one driving force i think the consumer is close to being tapped out it s close to being fatigued and saturated with debt i think these are two major issues and then let alone china let alone japan where the economic numbers are also now coming under pressure when you can t increase the rate of a cent in the boj s balance sheet by adding more it s almost already a straight up line so i think you have several issues i would say china obviously kind of number one for right now but i think for the next six months europe is actually a bigger risk point going forward and what i like about that is just look at gold and the price of euro the euro has gone nowhere by the way if you take the dollar index and adjust it by the price of gold it s actually breaking down so that s interesting because the gold market has disconnected from the dollar and you could take a whole number of currencies including the aussie dollar where gold right now has been or is now at a record high look at the russian ruble look at something as seemingly innocuous and unimportant as the pakistani rupee which has imploded over the last three months nobody s talking about it do we think pakistan is a place of stability where they have those kinds of currency dynamics without some other event starting to take place it s putting pressure on the indian rupee which was just recently at a new low gold in both of those currencies at record highs i can say the same thing about the iranian currency when you have the currencies of these types of countries just imploding let alone the situation of have in venezuela and argentina there is just increasingly more places where you have landmines that you are such at risk of stepping on to me this is where it really makes the case for gold but what it s always been in terms of the case for gold which is a store of protective value of your wealth to me that s the bottom line and the most bullish scenario that you can create for gold mike gleason we ll leave it there lots of black swans circling about it s going to be an interesting year for sure well great stuff as always greg we love getting your thoughts and always appreciate

this article we analyse the most important regulatory tools that latin american countries are developing with the aim of improving their economic and social conditions and ultimately consolidating latin america as a region open to business with favourable conditions for the development of high value investment projects one of the region s most important mechanisms for customs regulation is the free trade zone this is generally recognised as an area where foreign companies can import materials manufacture goods export products and benefit from special treatment regarding tax and customs colombia mexico and other latin american countries are focusing on this as the cornerstone of economic growth each of these countries while sharing the general principles of the free trade zone has developed certain particularities adjusted to its individual economy to make this special regime a much more attractive instrument for business development as stated each country has developed the instrument in a specific way and they may have different names for it for example colombia s free trade zones are comparable to the special economic zones of mexico and peru this instrument promotes foreign investment and develops economic and social policies enabling the growth of the national manufacturing and service industries it offers prerogatives to users via conditions that allow them to compete efficiently thus establishing regulations adapted to international regulatory trends these conditions include financial tax customs foreign trade and foreign exchange benefits each country has its own regulation regarding the benefits it offers however there are some common conditions for foreign investment such as the centralisation of export operations and consequently the elimination of certain expenses tax exemptions no vat reduced or lowered income tax and no tariffs the development of productive operations without vat or customs charges and legal stability regarding the benefits provided by the countries to the free trade zones in colombia the free trade zones regime has evolved rapidly since its creation in the mid 1950s it now has the largest number of free trade zones over 100 and the total investment made in the country through this mechanism is about us 16 billion the colombian free trade zone regime has different types of users and was created to foster the development of both the manufacturing and service industries it also allows companies to serve the local market the current population of colombia is almost 50 million something that is restricted in many free trade zone regimes developed in central america on the other hand free trade zones in peru were established in certain areas to promote development in these specific regions of the country currently there are only four special economic zones and the instrument is only just starting to develop this has also happened in brazil the government developed free trade zones in the north a region isolated from the rest of the country the objective was to promote the economic development of this area through the special regime of free trade zones at present the free trade zone of manaus has successfully helped in the development of the automotive electronics and chemical products industries argentina has nine free trade zones all of them promoting the storage commercialisation and industrialisation business industries the instrument is used to simplify the different processes and to promote trade and industrial activities in the country the use of free trade zones then aims towards the development of the region as well as the expansion of trade and industrial activities foreign trade is improved by free trade zones as they allow users to create a centralised operation reducing costs according to the benefits established in each country s regulations the operations are more efficient as users can consolidate exports from these zones control information from one trade centre and access markets through available free trade agreements through this mechanism countries can expect to increase export rates enable national industry to access new markets create more

this article is more than 5 years old 2019 bloomberg finance lp it s baaa aaack the chinese hard landing remember that one it started around 2010 and went until around 2015 until proponents threw in the towel with new tariffs on made in china goods and a government reluctant to stimulate the economy through deficit spending investors are getting anxious true more than a few investment firms believe china will weather this storm stimulus will kick again later this quarter and the second half of the year will be better morgan stanley analysts wrote in a note last week worth noting here china s shadow banking system a provincial form of funding pet projects with little economic viability has been clamped down upon by xi jinping because of that credit growth has declined dramatically in china that s one of the reasons for the slowdown in the growth rate even if china is still growing over 6 5 according to beijing 2019 bloomberg finance lp sentiment is weaker than what the growth rate indicates says weijian shan founder of asia s largest private equity firm pag with over 30 billion in assets under management if you look at the 6 6 growth rate in china you d say wow that s a pretty good number but business sentiment is weak despite that number business people are worried shenzhen listed stocks are down over 30 which is a better reflection of the private sector than shanghai so it doesn t look like an economy growing at 6 6 does it shan was separated from his family in his early teens and sent to communist labor and education camps where he spent the rest of his teens he wrote about his life in the book out of the gobi to many in the market no it does not look like china is growing at 6 6 bears put it at half that which is too low for a country that is coming to the grips with a demographic shift of more old people than working people 2018 bloomberg finance lp china stimulus includes the central bank intervening in the stock market last week the people s bank of china pboc announced its latest liquidity injection scheme china bears said it was a precursor to chinese qe the new scheme allows china s primary broker dealers to swap their holdings of perpetual bonds for central bank t bills and then use them as collateral to get cheap pboc credit this sounds like an economy facing as xi put it last week serious dangers the measure is designed to increase demand for chinese bank issued bonds making them riskless thanks to the pboc backstop that demand can be used to bolster capital and keep markets moving yeah this isn t your grandma s communist system bloomberg news three years ago china had the largest current account surplus in the world this year and next china is expected to run a slight deficit transforming china from the world s largest exporter of capital to a modest capital importer barclays capital economist mike gavin says in other words china goes from being a net lender to a net debtor it is this debt burden that moves the china hard landing doomsday clock closer to midnight pboc now has a trillion dollars less in foreign currency reserves than it did in 2015 around 3 trillion today even so a hard landing is a long way away it would require a massive misstep by the pboc which to date has proven to be quite mechanical and able to contain crises against this backdrop however investors believe the yuan weakness to cny7 0 to the dollar in the near future which is what bearish investors like george soros have been waiting for now for at least two years china less money to cut u s trade gap 2019 bloomberg finance lp china is approaching a negative current account in 2010 it had a current account surplus equal to roughly 10 of gdp today it s near zero next year barclays capital thinks it s below zero one of the reasons for that is because of china s maturing economy for starters more middle class people spending money abroad money is flowing out of china more than ever before the erosion of the chinese current account surplus reflects a desirable rebalancing of the economy that is likely to continue for some time to come says gavin from barclays 2018 bloomberg finance lp for those chomping on the bit for a hard landing in the chinese economy the good news is that china s ability to run large sustained current account deficits is constrained by market forces and the trade war chinese officials are coming to washington this week for the second round of talks during the ceasefire agreement reached in buenos aires back in november washington s rumor mill put leaked to the press that the chinese were considering zeroing out u s china trade gap by 2025 they were going to go on an american shopping spree but now that investors have had a few days to chew on those stories they are positive that china will not zero out the trade gap because china doesn t have the money let alone the market to do so it is very difficult to believe that china s current account balance would not worsen significantly if its u s trade surplus approached zero says gavin 2019 bloomberg finance lp moreover maintaining a current account deficit runs directly opposite to china s one belt one road initiative designed to export excess domestic savings and notorious chinese oversupply abroad china is in a pickle like it hasn t been since the first hedge funds started predicting a crash landing nearly 10 years ago as the hard landing outlook becomes more plausible today than it was even a year ago investors should treat any announcement this week in washington about china buying more made in the u s a with skepticism

what shaped the past week global markets global markets traded bearish this week amid further corporate earnings releases and sustained fears over slowing economic growth meanwhile the optimism over china u s trade relations from last week cooled as reports from the u s indicated a stalemate in negotiations wall street was closed on monday for martin luther king jr day while european markets closed lower thanks to weaker than expected financial results from ubs in what was likely a delayed reaction in asia markets were generally positive despite china reporting the slowest economic growth in 28 years when trading resumed on wall street on tuesday markets fell following the chinese data and lower growth estimates from the international monetary fund renewed fears of a global economic slowdown european and asian markets also declined in reaction to these economic news by midweek markets turned mixed with the dow jones industrial average inching up on the back of strong earnings from tech stocks while major indices in european and chinese markets closed mostly lower amidst ongoing concerns over u s china trade by week close markets began to recover amid anticipation of strong results from tech companies in europe even though fears over sino american trade lingered in u s and asian markets domestic economy the cbn has divulged plans to introduce new capital rules for the banking sector in the second quarter of the year in a mail correspondence with bloomberg the apex bank stated that the new requirements will have stricter definitions of capital and will introduce capital conservation and counter cyclical buffers in line with the basel iii global accords we believe the implementation of this new regulations could lead to banks raising fresh capital to prevent falling short of the required capital level we recall that the cbn migrated banks to the new ifrs 9 accounting standard last year to improve disclosures by adding provisions for existing loan losses as well as future losses nigerian banks have struggled with non performing loans npl with average npl as of h1 18 equal to 12 4 of total credit an improvement from 2017 when the average npl ratio was close to 15 according to the cbn we believe the risk guidelines and stronger capital standards will help shape more sustainable growth in the banking sector and reduce the risk of a financial crisis equities despite posting a negative close on monday driven by a decline in the oil gas sector the asi recorded a 136bps w w gain this week after recording green closes in four consecutive sessions overall the banking sector 715bps w w was the big winner thanks to investor interest across most tier i bank access 16 07 w w guaranty 798bps zenithbank 698bps w w and uba 548bps w w meanwhile the

buyside for most of the week as such t bill yields declined 52 w w on average trading sentiment in the bond market was also positive from week open till mid week as investor s focused on the monetary policy committee meeting where all policy levers were left unchanged and also awaited the release of the monthly bond auction calendar notably the dmo released the long awaited january bond auction circular by wednesday indicating an offer of n150 billion across the 5 year 7 year and 10 year maturities at next week s auction following this investor sentiment cooled off in the second half of the

dollar and depreciated n2 00 w w to settle at n362 50 in the parallel market what will shape markets in the coming week equity market while the strong gains from this week create a high chance for bargain hunting across select stocks we believe trading activities will remain tilted towards buying as more investors begin to take positions in beaten down stocks in anticipation of a dispersion in political clouds post elections fixed income market whilst we anticipate tepid trading in the t bills space due to liquidity constraints we foresee modest sell offs in the bond space as investors prepare to partake in the bond auction scheduled for wednesday currency we expect the naira to remain largely stable across the various windows of the currency space as the cbn maintains interventions

central bank of nigeria cbn voted unanimously to hold all policy rates at previous levels in line with consensus expectation the decision comes ahead of next month s general elections and amid continued marginal movements in inflation figures with the governor highlighting the positive m m trend in inflation the committee also highlighted some of the external economic factors which affected the nigerian economy in 2018 from volatility in the global financial market to the ongoing trade war between the u s and china brexit and the hiking of monetary rates by western economies internal and external factors key in 2019 highlighting some of the major internal factors that have affected nigeria the cbn governor godwin emefiele warned that the late passage and implementation of the 2018 budget along with softer oil prices had negatively impacted the economy towards the end of 2018 he added that the rise in inflation from 11 3 in november to 11 4 in december were indications of economic headwinds which would continue to extend into 2019 however the committee noted that an increase in monetary policy rate mpr at this juncture amid these growth inhibiting factors and a general election would be ill advised notably the committee highlighted the recent downward revision to nigeria s gdp growth forecast by the imf to 2 0 from 2 3 below the cbn s forecast gdp growth of 2 28 y y in the year vetiva 2 7 y y furthermore security challenges political risks associated with the upcoming elections and weaker food production were mentioned as potential headwinds to be faced in 2019

thin as policymakers focus on the upcoming political vote nonetheless we maintain our view of a policy rate hike at a later meeting this year given expected pressure on both inflation and the exchange

why the emerging market rally may run out of steam despite a strong start to the year what a difference a year makes at the start of last year s world economic forum in davos switzerland the international monetary fund hailed what it called the broadest synchronised global growth upsurge since 2010 yet this year s outlook which the imf presented on monday is decidedly downbeat warning of softening momentum and high uncertainty in the global economy stemming from a plethora of risks ranging from the trade war to the threat of a sharper deterioration in market sentiment one of the dangers highlighted by the imf is the possibility of a deeper than envisaged slowdown in china which could lead to a repeat of the turmoil in 2015 16 when fears about the world s second largest economy caused abrupt wide reaching sell offs in financial and commodity markets that place its trading partners commodity exporters and other emerging markets under pressure on the same day that the imf warned of the risk of another china induced sell off the publication of official gross domestic product data for the final quarter of last year showed that china s economy expanded at its weakest pace since 2009 dragging down the growth rate for the whole of 2018 to the lowest since 1990 the imf expects the economy to slow more sharply in the coming years decelerating to 6 2 per cent in 2019 and 2020 while investors have become more sensitive to slowing growth over the past several months china s economic woes have not prevented a rally in emerging markets from gaining traction since the end of october the benchmark msci emerging market index the main gauge of stocks in developing economies has risen more than 8 per cent with the bulk of the gains occurring this year investors have also been pouring money into emerging market debt and equity funds which suffered a long spell of outflows last year what is more dollar denominated bond sales in developing nations are enjoying their third best start to the year on record according to dealogic a data provider to be sure a confluence of factors has increased the attractiveness of emerging market assets the most important one is the dovish tilt in us monetary policy in response to concerns about the spillover effects of the slowdown in china and the euro zone on the us economy over the past month the odds of another interest rate increase by the federal reserve this year have fallen to nearly zero contributing to declines in the dollar and us treasury yields which are relieving some of the pressure on developing countries another reason for the growing appeal of emerging markets is significantly cheaper valuations the nearly 20 per cent fall in the msci emerging market index from its peak last january has helped push down the gauge s forward price to earnings ratio a popular valuation tool to 11 its lowest level since the 2015 16 china led sell off yet the underpinnings of the rally are fragile and suspect given the tensions between washington and beijing in their recent trade negotiations and the growing influence of china in determining market sentiment as i argued previously it is troubling that many investors have turned bullish on emerging markets despite the continued slowdown in china which accounts for one third of global growth and 30 per cent of the market capitalisation of the msci emerging market index while investors are banking on more aggressive stimulus measures if china s economy continues to deteriorate and the trade talks fail to produce a breakthrough acute tensions between the government s deleveraging drive and its efforts to rekindle growth are sufficient reason for caution while asia s economies which have the strongest trade and financial linkages with china are particularly vulnerable eastern europe is also at risk given the region s strong dependence on germany s export driven economy which narrowly averted a recession in the second half of last year partly because of weak demand in china still china vies with the fed in shaping sentiment towards emerging markets the us central bank s willingness to pause raising interest rates is fuelling a rally in so called risk assets benefiting developing economies yet investors could also be underestimating risks in us monetary policy america s economy is still quite buoyant providing scope for the fed to keep tightening policy by unwinding its balance sheet and possibly raising rates again if growth holds up however it is china not the united states that is at the epicentre of the global slowdown the imf s warnings about the world s second largest economy should not go unheeded source south china morning post
by tomas slangen velasco president macri has significantly transformed argentina since he inherited it from cristina fernandez de kirchner in november 2015 he has promoted opening argentina up to international markets and to foreign investment this year s host of the g 20 summit has plans to attract more than 100 billion usd in foreign investment however investors and voters are becoming concerned about macri s capacity to stabilise a historically unstable economy this has awoken past nightmares already represented in the books of latin american political history adjustment impoverishment popular resistance repression and social polarisation argentina is suffering from severe economic stagnation due to the astonishing devaluation of the peso by more than 50 since the start of the year triggered by president macri s opening up to the world with a deliberate devaluation of the peso towards the dollar policy which benefited the export sectors and elites key supporters of the cambiemos government to try and stop this downward trend the imf agreed in june to the delivery of a 50 billion dollar loan for the rescue of the argentinian economy in return argentina is committed to meeting the deficit reduction targets agreed to with the imf most notably decreasing the deficit to 0 from 4 of the gdp for 2019 the opposition and a huge part of the population have pushed back against this deal which they view as becoming a lackey of the imf cambiemos macri s party achieved power with a strong neoliberal agenda which reached it maximum expression on october 25th with the 2019 budget plan of increasing taxation and cutting government spending to contain the deficit and regain trust of international markets this decision reaffirmed the policies of social cuts that had already been implemented in 2018 as an imf requirement given the unpopularity of the measure the budget debate was tense after a 17 hour debate in a congress of 256 members 108 of whom are cambiemos the budget passed with 138 ayes 103 nays 8 abstentions and 7 non attendances after the debate in congress the much more divided senate only 25 out of 72 members are from cambiemos approved the plan on 15 november 2018 with 45 ayes and 24 nays social unrest and decrease of popularity it is clear that argentina is living difficult times and has difficult times ahead the 2018 budget foresaw an inflation of 15 7 and today s most optimistic calculations speak of 32 the peso should stabilize around 19 1 to the dollar but it has already broken the 40 peso barrier and gdp will not rise 3 2 as the government said last december but it will fall 1 at best macri s promises and optimism have been shattered along the way leaving him in a tough spot unable to uphold his word and forced to apply unpopular measures awaking the previously appeased population and transforming them into an irritated multitude no country in latin america is as difficult as argentina to implement unpopular reforms the polls show that the majority of the population believes that the situation is now worse than in 2015 and the president s popularity has plummeted over 35 with the 2019 elections around the corner on top of that macri s administration keeps receiving harsh criticism from important figures of argentinian politics jorge taiana former chancellor stated in a document presented on the 19th of november to the senate by the group mundo sur that the government has followed a policy for three years that in practice only served to please financial capital and multilateral credit agencies these allegations do not come on their own to many macri misinterpreted the world scenario weakened the international position of argentina indebted the country let the imf return to be the centre of its foreign policy boycotted all the political and economic agreements of regional integration such as mercosur unasur celac or parlasur and abandoned the national and regional claim on the falkland islands something that argentinians will neither forget nor forgive the g 20 was a great opportunity to clear all the smoke and present a strong and committed government which could address both the situation in the country and host a major international event however it has turned out to be a deeper failure the g 20 ended without a deal and it only exacerbated the differences between superpowers important matters such as the sovereignty of the falkland islands were not discussed macri s overtures of cooperation with mercosur and the eu were dismissed and in the words of respected jounrnalist alfredo zaiat it was ultimately a great theatre that macri used to ask for more oxygen from lagarde and trump his hope is that the imf dollars extend the grace period and allow him to be competitive in 2019 persistent risk macri s administration faces the new year with a difficult situation which might cost him his re election in october 2019 the damaged economy does not seem to be recovering anytime soon even after the harsh adjustments that his government applied and the massive parade for the g 20 summit this compels macri s administration to reach agreements with the peronist opposition a scenario that would damage further the president s re election aspirations in the midst of many skeptical questions from national press over the consequences of the g 20 summit for the economy of the country miguel braun secretary of economic policy argued that argentina has a short term need to get out of the financial turmoil we are starting to come out but we still cannot claim victory we have to remain very focused on complying with the program we have set for reducing the fiscal deficit and stabilizing the exchange rate and prices however argentina remains a risky country in which to invest this shows one thing even though the economic situation is not favourable for investors the main concern that buyers of argentine bonds have today is not economical but political many investors are still sceptical as the cambiemos administration is unlikely to remain in power for long and therefore the country risk remains high the g 20 was a crucial test for macri to show his ability to promote a united idea for all argentinians but it seems that the last breaths of hope for macri s 2018 will not be enough to change the mind of a bruised and tired country tomas slangen velasco holds an undergraduate in international relations from the blanquerna school of communications and international relations in barcelona the article was

china to step up economic stimulus in slowdown fight but room seen limited beijing china will take steps to spur growth amid a trade war with the united states but there is limited room for aggressive stimulus in an economy already laden with massive debts and a property market prone to credit driven spikes policy insiders said china s deepening economic slowdown has fanned market expectations of a big spending binge especially if the bruising tariff war with washington escalates intensifying pressure on chinese jobs threatening social stability such a move plans for which have repeatedly been denied by china s top leaders would come at a price however similar moves in the past have quickly juiced growth rates but also buried the world s no 2 economy under a mountain of debt the room for a strong stimulus is not big and there are very big risks because that will rely on a flood of cash and increased leverage in the economy said a policy insider declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter during the 2008 09 global financial crisis beijing rolled out a 4 trillion yuan 591 billion spending package to fight a downturn that cost 20 million jobs in a matters of months quickly reviving growth but also prompting a credit explosion the obsession of china s leaders with stability led to policy easing in 2012 and 2015 a year marked by a stock market crash a slide in the yuan and sharp capital outflows that further pushed up debt levels and inflated home prices authorities have taken a raft of pro growth measures in the past year in the form of cuts to the levels of cash banks must hold as reserves to spur lending tax cuts and efforts to accelerate infrastructure spending still growth in the world s second largest economy weakened to a 28 year low of 6 6 per cent in 2018 and is expected to slow further to 6 3 percent this year sources have told reuters that beijing was planning to lower its growth target to 6 6 5 per cent this year from around 6 5 percent in 2018 some chinese factories have felt the pinch from higher us tariffs but there are few signs of a sharp rise in unemployment due to a more resilient services sector and a shrinking pool of workers as a result of the country s demographic changes we should be vigilant about employment pressure but it s too early to talk about serious problems said a second policy insider debt risks the current slowdown was caused by china s deleveraging drive in early 2016 which focused on state firms and local governments before broadening to the financial sector a year later a crackdown on shadow lending pushed up borrowing costs and made it harder for small firms to get funds as the trade war increases headwinds beijing s policy focus has been shifted to supporting growth from reining in debt risks although top leaders remain worried about long term systemic risks that could derail the country s economic ascent president xi jinping said this week that china must be on guard against black swan risks meaning unforeseen events that have extreme consequences while fending off so called grey rhino events obvious threats that go ignored data from the bank for international settlements bis showed that china s debt to gross domestic product gdp ratio climbed to 253 percent at the end of june 2018 from 231 percent at end 2015 although the pace of increases is slowing fitch could cut china s a credit rating or stable outlook if beijing reverts to the kind of debt fuelled stimulus programmes it has used in the past the firm s top sovereign analyst said earlier this month further reductions in banks reserve requirement ratios rrr are expected in coming quarters but the central bank will not rush into cutting benchmark interest rates more aggressive easing could pressure the yuan aggravate high debt levels and even stoke property speculation given that elevated home prices have put strains on consumers if there is too much liquidity we should worry whether it may flow into unintended areas rather than the real economy said a policy adviser no quick boost to growth china is likely to lean more on fiscal pump priming to support the economy this year as the central government has been struggling to channel more credit into small and private firms that are vital for growth and jobs policy insiders said in december top leaders pledged to step up counter cyclical support for the economy and said fiscal policy would be more forceful and effective and monetary policy would be prudent with appropriate tightness and looseness details on the fiscal stimulus are expected to be unveiled during the annual parliamentary meeting in march analysts expect china to deliver tax and fee cuts of 2 trillion yuan in 2019 versus last year s 1 3 trillion yuan and let local governments issue 2 trillion yuan in off budget special bonds to fund key projects up from 1 35 trillion yuan but the economy may not get a quick boost as the raft of policy measures may take time to kick in and china s high debt levels and falling investment returns could slow down spending stimulus won t be very strong and its impact won t be big said one of the policy insiders the manufacturing sector faces all round oversupply while infrastructure investment is saturated in many places projects that have been launched won t make money new tax cuts including lowering the valued added tax vat

democratic presidential hopeful elizabeth warren has proposed a wealth tax on americans worth more than 50 million with could reportedly cost billionaires 85 billion a year the top 0 1 of american families the richest 1 in 1 000 now have nearly the same amount of wealth as the bottom 90 of american families combined meanwhile for everyone else opportunity is slipping away warren said in an email to supporters we need structural change to fix it warren s plan would require the top 75 000 households to pay an annual tax of 2 percent on each dollar of their net worth above 50 million it would rise to 3 percent on every dollar above 1 billion warren s proposed tax could cost american billionaires 85 billion a year according to a forbes analysis warren a massachusetts senator who recently established an exploratory committee for the 2020 democratic nomination said she would use the revenue to rebuild the middle class potentially by using the money to pay for child care or relieve student debt bloomberg reported the proposal underscores warren s economic populist message at the heart of her campaign to challenge president donald trump in 2020 a former harvard law professor she has written extensively about the shrinking middle class and made enemies on wall street for pinning the blame for rising income inequality on the wealthy and large corporations wealth taxes do more to relieve inequality than raising income taxes according to steve wamhoff the director of federal tax policy at the left leaning institute on taxation and economic policy new york democratic representative alexandria ocasio cortez s has proposed raising the top income tax rate to 70 percent sparking conversations within the democratic party about how high income levies should go new research also indicates that raising marginal income rates wouldn t do much to lessen inequality because much of the wealth among the richest americans stems from private business profit taxed at lower rates and appreciated assets that go untaxed until they re sold if you believe that inequality is a problem you have to start thinking outside the box wamhoff said we need to go beyond the ideas that are already on the table today still critics say that a wealth tax would be very hard to administer it would require taxpayers or the internal revenue service to calculate how much assets are worth each year including real estate and investments in private businesses that are notoriously hard to value imagine a large privately held company its value could change almost daily the conservative tax foundation said in a blog post thursday how would the tax handle these fluctuations meanwhile some billionaires who would be paying the tax characterized it as a step toward communism forbes reporetd the leftists are communist light for now rockstar energy drink founder russ weiner who is worth an estimated 4 5 billion wrote in an email to forbes they will continue to get more dangerous with their demands and actions it will never be enough warren s proposal is also likely to face challenges on its constitutionality bloomberg explained conservatives immediately pounced on it with the anti tax group americans for tax reform arguing that it would harm economic growth incentivize the investment of money overseas and fail to raise as much money as warren s allies project warren s plan and others that raise large amounts of revenue are offsets that would allow democrats to pursue expensive policy ideas such as large expansions to medicare reducing the cost of college tuition and cutting taxes for the middle class senator kamala harris another democratic presidential contender has proposed a 2 8 billion plan that would direct tax credits or payments to middle class and poor individuals increasing marginal rates wealth taxes and other ways to tax the wealthy are likely to play a central role in all the tax plans democratic candidates release in the coming weeks and it s just a question of which ideas resonate most with the party and voters said greg leiserson the director of tax policy and senior economist at the left leaning washington center for equitable growth all of these ideas are closely connected said leiserson the general rule is the more you do of one of these the less you can do with the others it won t be easy for the wealthy to reduce their income to avoid the tax because of reporting and enforcement guardrails included in the plan according to two university of california berkeley economists advising warren on the plan emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman high net worth individuals are audited at a much higher rate than every other income group the irs audited about 14 5 percent of returns reporting at least 10 million in income in 2017 nearly double the examination rate for any other income bracket but saez and zucman estimated that taxpayers might be able to reduce their reported net worth by 15 percent through a combination of tax evasion and tax avoidance material from bloomberg and reuters has been used in this report
by marshall auerback a market analyst and commentator produced by economy for all a project of the independent media institute when it comes to businesses in need of reform the saying size isn t everything should apply unfortunately this isn t the thinking in the realm of antitrust where size is seen as inextricably linked to questions of competitiveness political corruption the stifling of innovation and distortions of economic power at least that s the case made by professor tim wu in his new work the curse of bigness antitrust in the new gilded age reviewing the book new york times correspondent david leonhardt accepts wu s central premise the new corporate behemoths have been very good for their executives and largest shareholders and bad for almost everyone else sooner or later the companies tend to raise prices they hold down wages because where else are workers going to go they use their resources to sway government policy many of our economic ills like income stagnation and a decline in entrepreneurship stem partly from corporate gigantism if every corporate behemoth is seen as a problematic nail then a resort to the antitrust hammer is understandable but it is questionable whether or not the ills outlined above by wu and leonhardt are a product of economic gigantism per se a better reason why these pathologies exist is the following a sustained multi decade attack on unionization the concomitant growing imbalance between capital and labor the ascendancy of the doctrine of shareholder capitalism which has induced corporations to prioritize share price performance over r d and investment global labor arbitrage and the existence of america s pay to play system of politics entrenched and exacerbated by recent supreme court decisions such as citizens united to address these problems we need solutions that go well beyond breaking up a big corporation just because it happens to be big or simply embracing the neoliberal faith that letting markets be markets will do the job or for that matter relying on an archaic regulatory framework that sits uneasily with our 21st century version of capitalism while it is understandable why antitrust proponents such as wu evoke early examples of trust busters such as theodore roosevelt to garner support and provide historical legitimacy for their arguments it s hard to see how rules promulgated in the context of an early 20th century economy are germane to a 21st century global economy dominated by very different kinds of industries and market structures ironically a fitting lesson to be drawn from our nation s past is the one that today s antitrust enthusiasts generally ignore as the economists robert atkinson and michael lind illustrate one of the earliest trust busters president theodore roosevelt argued that the remedy for abuse was not mindlessly breaking up big firms but preventing specific abuses by means of a strong national regulation of interstate corporations likewise his cousin franklin delano roosevelt ultimately concluded that optimal outcomes were more likely to be achieved via prudent government oversight and using antitrust laws to police abuses not to break up every big company simply because it s big atkinson and lind expand these ideas in their book big is beautiful debunking the myth of small business on the size metric they make the following observation on virtually every meaningful indicator including wages productivity environmental protection exporting innovation employment diversity and tax compliance large firms as a group significantly outperform small firms echoing the roosevelts the authors argue that the remedy for abuse is not mindlessly breaking up big firms but preventing specific abuses by means of a strong national regulation of businesses regardless of size they also point out that the corollary namely that small is good is often wrong as well in spite of many americans long standing belief that small business is the main engine of job growth and economic opportunity in 2015 small enterprises were four times more likely to lay off their workers than large ones workers employed by large firms also earned more on average 54 percent more than workers at small companies companies with more than 500 employees offer 2 5 times more paid leave and insurance benefits and 3 9 times more in retirement benefits than workers at firms with fewer than 100 employees large firms are also more likely to be unionized and they employ a greater share of women and minorities than small firms do making big business an unlikely enemy of progressives even if small companies do not constitute the engine of growth are they not the main avatars of entrepreneurialism and american innovation while the image of steve jobs and steve wozniak beavering away in a garage to create apple has done much to legitimize this myth in reality as atkinson and lind document the tech revolution owes far more to teams of scientists and engineers working in well funded corporate labs than to college dropouts tinkering at home in support of this proposition the authors cite the study of professors anne marie knott and carl vieregger which shows that large firms not only invest more in r d than small firms they get more innovation output per dollar invested to the extent that american innovation and entrepreneurialism have dissipated in the last few decades the cause is less economic gigantism and more financialization especially post the establishment of sec rule 10b 18 which engendered an explosion in share buybacks until the rule was introduced companies buying back their own shares was considered a form of stock manipulation the impact of this rule cannot be overstated instead of spending needed dollars on r d or investment billions of dollars of corporate cash flow have been deployed toward stock repurchases to fatten executive compensation an additional contributing factor has been the diminishment of government involvement in the economy this is a salient consideration given the state s historic contributing role in transformational technologies from the internet to gps as venture capitalist william janeway has noted in his book doing capitalism in the innovation economy what about the notion that economic size has contributed to the problem of income stagnation and non existent wage growth here again the evidence suggests that other factors are more important in fact as the economists lance taylor and özlem ömer illustrate in a recent study the stagnant low wage sectors nursing homes fast food construction education and health business services transportation and warehousing maids are the least concentrated with the lowest profit margins concentration per se can t explain low wages in these industries companies in these sectors are usually the ones that complain the most about a 15 hour minimum wage or the unionization of their work forces claiming they don t have the economic resources to pay the kinds of wages and benefits often secured in union negotiated deals an inflation eroded minimum wage the absence of unions replacement of full time employees by contractors and mass low wage immigration are better explanations for wage stagnation and non enforcement of antitrust remedies is irrelevant to those causes wage and labor laws matter the decades long sustained attacks on unions have given corporations both large and small the power to break the traditional nexus between worker productivity and wage gains this development has generated a massive shift in income from labor to capitalover the past 35 years to avert this problem policy should therefore be fighting against worker exploitation irrespective of whether workers are employed by amazon or mom and pop sweatshops targeting based on size alone won t get rid of all of the abuses in fact amazon implicitly proved that big is not always bad and sometimes can be better recall how quickly the company recently introduced the 15 hour minimum wage in response to vast public pressure ideally a robust competing private power center i e organized labor means corporations in the most feral analysis have to fight a two front war how to get there from here is a problem the democrats might be spending more time thinking about assuming they can take their single minded focus away from the evils of economic gigantism for fragmented sweatshop industries where a big three tripartite model among government unions and big business doesn t apply governments can substitute unionized wage boards that were created in the early 20th century in the uk and copied in the united states new york governor andrew cuomo for example has used a state wage board to raise the fast food wage wage boards with tripartite government employer worker representation can be used by u s states in low wage sectors that can t be removed to another state or country construction health care nursing restaurants they should have power over hours and working conditions not just wages as far as high tech industries go the question of regulation vs breaking up may miss the main worries especially in regard to some of our newer 21st century behemoths such as google or facebook facebook for example may have some features of being a broadcaster which would suggest fcc style oversight but that is still a relatively small part of its business similarly it would be difficult to call google a broadcaster in the traditional sense of an fcc regulated company although it should be subject to the 21st century equivalent of fair broadcast rules whether the fcc is fully equipped to promulgate and enforce those rules is another question communications have changed a lot over the last half century and media have taken on a multiplicity of functions that were not in existence when the fcc was established using a horse and carriage model for an internet superhighway is problematic both facebook and google collect massive amounts of private data which makes them different from broadcasters sell heavily targeted advertising offer tech solutions to the larger social media world and provide forms of services search and personal networking the regulation would need to come to grips with the interrelationship of the four or the nature of the vertical integration creating eight mini facebooks doesn t seem like a good way to do this especially if the problem of how the company handles your data isn t adequately addressed rather the european union s general data protection regulation represents a good starting basis for a new regulatory framework because it regulates function regardless of size what about our pay to play political system doesn t corporate size play a role here yes but this is because companies scale up in size in order to maximize their abilities to pay to play as professor thomas ferguson asserts in his seminal work golden rule the investment theory of party competition and the logic of money driven political systems with enough money candidates can pole vault over the whole rotting structure of party politics in america the scale up however is a function of inadequate restrictions on private campaign finance ferguson s book demonstrates that powerful blocs of business elites large and small with durable largely economic interests are a constant feature of american politics smaller businesses do it as well they too have an incentive to scale up via a trade association to maximize the impact of their political investment change the incentives in pay to play and size becomes less of a polluting impact on the american polity the corollary also applies if the government were suddenly to embrace an antitrust agenda and aggressively break up the big corporate behemoths absent campaign finance reform he who has the gold would still rule more generally it is worth considering the whole underlying premise that market considerations on their own deliver optimal social outcomes consider that in times of grave national emergency such as war market mechanisms are generally subjugated to broader strategic objectives we didn t use the market to help us win world war ii during which the u s rationed raw materials established wage and price controls capped profits organized cartels of manufacturers set production targets and directed labor into war munitions civilians were exhorted to put their savings into wartime bonds and the economy was largely controlled by federal bureaucrats like simon kuznets and generals like brehon somervell and bill knudsen by no means am i suggesting a comparable scale of government involvement today i am simply questioning the optimistic premise underlying traditional market oriented antitrust remedies some national development government led industrial policy must play a role in shaping market mechanisms to broader public purpose above all else the implicit assumption of the antitrusters seems to be that america is not capitalist enough and that more market competition will raise wages and lower prices and reduce inequality they posit a minimal role for a state involvement even though the state has historically played a large role in national development innovation and entrepreneurialism the monomaniacal focus on antitrust ironically sounds more like something from the cato institute or the koch brothers rather than a progressive plan to improve the aggregate quality of life for the majority of americans antitrust is an instrument that has its place but simply placing faith in benign outcomes by letting markets be markets or assuming that big is bad are theological doctrines not real solutions
by tom luongo the u s backed a coup in venezuela that has failed and president trump was the architect of it this is a farce surrounding an intrigue contained within a tragedy what has happened in venezuela is tragic nicolas maduro is a comical figure straight out of central casting for a south american leader of a junta but it has been the u s s designs on venezuela s oil and gas reserves the largest proven in the world as of 2017 that is the real story behind this week s events for anyone still harboring doubts as to who trump truly is venezuela should end them trump s energy dominance policy is at the core of his foreign policy and he will do whatever it takes to secure that policy and deliver a long standing order to the u s and european oligarchy to gain control over venezuela energy dominance as alistair crooke succinctly put it last year at strategic culture the us were energy dominance to succeed simply would control the tap to the economic development or its lack thereof for rivals china and asia and the us could squeeze russia s revenues in this way too in short the us could put a tourniquet on china s and russia s economic development plans is this why jcpoa was revoked by president trump here then is the squaring of that circle more us power yet less empire trump s us aims for domination not through the globalists permanent infrastructure of the us defence umbrella but through the smart leveraging of the us dollar and financial clearing monopoly by ring fencing and holding tight us technology and by dominating the energy market which in turn represents the on off valve to economic growth for us rivals in this way trump can bring the troops home and yet america keeps its hegemony military conflict becomes a last resort most of trump s supporters refuse to admit this is the plan they still want to believe that national security advisor john bolton and secretary of state mike pompeo were thrust upon him by the nefarious deep state and that trump is a trapped hero in a cage yearning to breathe free and maga if we just support him a little more nonsense trump has been very clear about this policy for years we take over these places kill the bad people and pay for it all by stealing their natural resources in this case oil it is trump s 17th century view on trade writ large since this is a 17th century colonial mindset an independent venezuela even if it is run by an incompetent bus driver is something that cannot be allowed to stand anyone that refuses to trade that oil on u s controlled exchanges exchanges controlled by goldman sachs or in u s dollars is to be taken over and a puppet government installed c f iraq libya but only after your production is removed from the market so that we can sell ours this is geopolitics 101 folks nothing new under the sun does everyone not remember trump s cutting venezuela from the global monetary system through sanctions last year the socialism bogey the worst of the country s hyper inflation occurred after this sadly it was cheered on by libertarians and conservatives more interested in proving socialism is bad than seeing the bigger picture of how it was fomented by immoral u s policy under trump s guidance because no one f cks with the orange jesus man whoa maduro s attempts to rebuild venezuela s monetary system outside of the control of the u s s dominance of financial markets are a blueprint for resisting energy dominance whether maduro s petro cryptocurrency and sovereign bolivar succeed are irrelevant what s important is that he has gained the backing of both china and russia in support of the scheme they are all along with iran committed to an alternate path to trump s energy dominance they have to be because the u s will not stop locking down the world financial system around oil until stopped practically and trump has to continue on the path he s on if he believes in america s inherent greatness which he does and quash them with everything in his power so now he is taking on the weakest link venezuela a country softened up by chavez s idiocy and maduro s incompetence but it took the u s leaning on them through ruinous sanctions to destroy what was left and ensure the collapse of its oil industry so ours can thrive then we blame the venezuelan people for resisting our edicts and electing the wrong man we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us this is the john bolton blueprint for regime change demonize the leader of a country that opposes our imperial rule cut them off from the rest of the world through sanctions and political military pressure and wait for the society to collapse then back a regime change by a u s groomed puppet in this case the nobody who is juan guaidó sell it all the entire time as a failure of the other guy in charge for chavez and maduro the spectre of socialism is all it takes especially now with the democrats and the media championing our own female che alexandria ocasio cortez as the bogeyfem if that fails and it looks like it has then threaten to invade on humanitarian grounds the only way this works with a u s population weary of two straight decades of war is for things to get so bad our intervention makes us look like the savior of a blighted people the good guy blueprint guess what this is the exact groundwork bolton is laying for iran squeeze them until they pop and then back a coup by the mujahadeen al khaq mek who like guaidó have absolutely zero support within iran and would be the exact antithesis of what the iranian people would want in other words shah 2 0 and are both some flavor of communist just like maduro but don t tell the magapedes this it ll make them cry this is why we refused to work with venezuela and sanctioned them instead maybe the reason maduro wouldn t work with us is because he knew what the ultimate plan was but the real tragedy here is that trump has now embraced interventionist foreign policy completely he s like arnold s character in james cameron s true lies when his impossibly hot wife finds out who he truly is she asks him have you ever killed anyone and he quips like a little boy yeah but they were all bad this is how he s selling this betrayal of his base and maga because venezuela today iran tomorrow the steps to not maga go back to the crooke quote above shoring up the flow of how and in what currency oil is traded is one part this is why saudi arabia is doomed because to survive they need u s diplomatic and military backing and to maintain that they need to only accept dollars which is destroying their fiscal position the next part is have the u s produce the marginal barrel of oil giving us pricing leverage over russia the saudis and the rest of the arab world will take whatever we allow them to have the alternative is written in today s headlines demonization impoverishment regime change and seizure of natural resources that mean trump needs low interest rates for the capital intensive and to this point capital destructive fracking industry to maintain the fiction that we can outproduce the russians on a price per barrel basis venezuela with a currency which trades outside the swift system can and will produce oil at far lower prices than u s frackers in the permian basin can and it can drive domestic wealth generation again the last part is what he s selling to the maga crowd bringing the troops home but trump said this morning he doesn t rule out military intervention in venezuela to oust maduro from power what happened to no regime change and bringing the military empire to an end oj as long as all of the above works he will be able to substitute the troops overseas for control of the flow of energy except where the bad guys need to be killed of course the failure is complete look around you do you really think that s working china s petroyuan contract is a runaway success russia is selling so much oil there in yuan and converting it to gold it is now supporting global gold prices maduro has survived the coup to this point russia has made it clear they will assist maduro stay in power by flying a nuclear bomb carrying tu 160 bomber to caracas putin and maduro just signed a multi billion dollar exploration and production agreement no exxon mobil in sight folks iran is selling oil to india at 2017 rates still using rupees most of 2018 s increase was in anticipation of trump putting sanctions on so the fall from the peak is irrelevant simply front running trump s predictable policy turkey will still buy iranian oil at whatever rate they want nordstream 2 is under construction and exxon mobil and uniper just signed a big lng supply deal in germany since uniper is a part of the nordstream 2 consortium do you think sanctions are incoming now no and neither is energy dominance
venezuela is once again in a state of economic and political chaos juan guaido venezuela s charismatic opposition leader and head of the country s national assembly has declared himself venezuela s interim president directly challenging the legitimacy of president nicolas maduro who began his second term earlier in january in may 2018 maduro won a highly controversial election in which he suddenly moved the election date from december 2018 to may and banned numerous political rivals from participating in the election maduro has also been accused of buying votes and rigging the election in his favor much of the international community including president trump now say they believe the maduro regime is illegitimate and support guaido s plan to have new elections despite condemnation from dozens of world leaders and tens of thousands of protesters in venezuela maduro who continues to receive the support of the country s military leaders says he has no intention of backing down it s hard to imagine how this tragic situation can end without bloodshed are democrats celebrating the shutdown standoff as a win too early at the heart of venezuela s collapse is a laundry list of socialist policies that have decimated its economy including many that congressional democrats like rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y are calling for today venezuela which has the world s largest oil reserves was once latin america s wealthiest country but over time socialist leaders like hugo chavez and maduro implemented increasingly more government social welfare programs such as massive housing and infrastructure projects government run health care and subsidized grocery stores when oil prices were high venezuela s socialist government was able to fund and expand these programs but the good times didn t last forever oil prices eventually dropped driving the country deep into debt rather than cut back on government programs when tax revenues fell chavez and maduro printed money and accepted loans from countries around the world when inflation increased the venezuelan socialists raised interest rates issued punitive taxes and eventually confiscated property and established price controls democrats left wing economic policies would put us on the path to economic ruin as a result of these policies countless businesses closed and entrepreneurs fled the country taking their wealth with them but maduro s government refused to deviate from its socialist course spending piles of cash on programs it couldn t afford by the end of 2018 inflation had reached a stunning 80 000 percent although the u s economy is substantially stronger than venezuela s a growing number of congressional democrats are openly calling for many of the same costly proposals that have long been embraced by socialists like maduro for example sen bernie sanders i vt medicare for all health care plan would cost 32 trillion in just the first 10 years of the plan according to an analysis by the mercatus center sen elizabeth warren has called for the creation of a new office of drug manufacturing which would give the federal government power to manufacture generic drugs other democrats have called for price controls on drugs perhaps most notable is alexandria ocasio cortez s green new deal which is really nothing more than a massive socialist trojan horse the green new deal would put government in control either directly or indirectly of most of the energy industry and mandate everyone use renewable energy sources like wind and solar by 2030 the green new deal would destroy whole industries related to fossil fuels eliminating 3 4 million jobs in the process and it calls for communities rather than private businesses to control energy markets additionally the green new deal would impose other socialist policies like a federal jobs guarantee and a universal basic income program although not all these specific policies have been created in venezuela the overarching economic strategy is exactly the same both democrats and the socialists in venezuela believe the road to prosperity is paved with gigantic government run programs and miles of regulatory red tape and both the socialists in venezuela and the democratic socialists in the democratic party have the same strategy to pay for these expensive programs running up the national debt building new publicly owned banks another proposal in ocasio cortez s green new deal and printing money democrats believe the economic collapse in venezuela won t happen in the united states because our economy is too big to fail but history has proven repeatedly that even the wealthiest nations can collapse when their economies are mismanaged america s national debt has nearly reached 22 trillion and our annual deficits have been growing in recent years under the leadership of both democrats and republicans although we re not on the verge of seeing hyperinflation here in america in the immediate future we could be closer than many think click here to get the fox news app if the united states continues to borrow and print money a strategy the democrats are embracing the world will eventually lose faith in our currency which is now used in many of the most important international transactions that could lead to the creation of a new international currency which would trigger a collapse of our economy unlike anything we ve seen since the great depression and cause hyperinflation a major cause of the economic crisis in venezuela democrats left wing economic policies would put us on the path to economic ruin let s hope americans learn from venezuela s mistakes and reject democrats socialist vision for the united states click here to read more from justin haskins
when it comes to businesses in need of reform the saying size isn t everything should apply unfortunately this isn t the thinking in the realm of antitrust where size is seen as inextricably linked to questions of competitiveness political corruption the stifling of innovation and distortions of economic power at least that s the case made by professor tim wu in his new work the curse of bigness antitrust in the new gilded age reviewing the book new york times correspondent david leonhardt accepts wu s central premise the new corporate behemoths have been very good for their executives and largest shareholders and bad for almost everyone else sooner or later the companies tend to raise prices they hold down wages because where else are workers going to go they use their resources to sway government policy many of our economic ills like income stagnation and a decline in entrepreneurship stem partly from corporate gigantism if every corporate behemoth is seen as a problematic nail then a resort to the antitrust hammer is understandable but it is questionable whether or not the ills outlined above by wu and leonhardt are a product of economic gigantism per se a better reason why these pathologies exist is the following a sustained multi decade attack on unionization the concomitant growing imbalance between capital and labor the ascendancy of the doctrine of shareholder capitalism which has induced corporations to prioritize share price performance over r d and investment global labor arbitrage and the existence of america s pay to play system of politics entrenched and exacerbated by recent supreme court decisions such as citizens united to address these problems we need solutions that go well beyond breaking up a big corporation just because it happens to be big or simply embracing the neoliberal faith that letting markets be markets will do the job or for that matter relying on an archaic regulatory framework that sits uneasily with our 21st century version of capitalism while it is understandable why antitrust proponents such as wu evoke early examples of trust busters such as theodore roosevelt to garner support and provide historical legitimacy for their arguments it s hard to see how rules promulgated in the context of an early 20th century economy are germane to a 21st century global economy dominated by very different kinds of industries and market structures ironically a fitting lesson to be drawn from our nation s past is the one that today s antitrust enthusiasts generally ignore as the economists robert atkinson and michael lind illustrate one of the earliest trust busters president theodore roosevelt argued that the remedy for abuse was not mindlessly breaking up big firms but preventing specific abuses by means of a strong national regulation of interstate corporations likewise his cousin franklin delano roosevelt ultimately concluded that optimal outcomes were more likely to be achieved via prudent government oversight and using antitrust laws to police abuses not to break up every big company simply because it s big atkinson and lind expand these ideas in their book big is beautiful debunking the myth of small business on the size metric they make the following observation on virtually every meaningful indicator including wages productivity environmental protection exporting innovation employment diversity and tax compliance large firms as a group significantly outperform small firms echoing the roosevelts the authors argue that the remedy for abuse is not mindlessly breaking up big firms but preventing specific abuses by means of a strong national regulation of businesses regardless of size they also point out that the corollary namely that small is good is often wrong as well in spite of many americans long standing belief that small business is the main engine of job growth and economic opportunity in 2015 small enterprises were four times more likely to lay off their workers than large ones workers employed by large firms also earned more on average 54 percent more than workers at small companies companies with more than 500 employees offer 2 5 times more paid leave and insurance benefits and 3 9 times more in retirement benefits than workers at firms with fewer than 100 employees large firms are also more likely to be unionized and they employ a greater share of women and minorities than small firms do making big business an unlikely enemy of progressives even if small companies do not constitute the engine of growth are they not the main avatars of entrepreneurialism and american innovation while the image of steve jobs and steve wozniak beavering away in a garage to create apple has done much to legitimize this myth in reality as atkinson and lind document the tech revolution owes far more to teams of scientists and engineers working in well funded corporate labs than to college dropouts tinkering at home in support of this proposition the authors cite the study of professors anne marie knott and carl vieregger which shows that large firms not only invest more in r d than small firms they get more innovation output per dollar invested to the extent that american innovation and entrepreneurialism have dissipated in the last few decades the cause is less economic gigantism and more financialization especially post the establishment of sec rule 10b 18 which engendered an explosion in share buybacks until the rule was introduced companies buying back their own shares was considered a form of stock manipulation the impact of this rule cannot be overstated instead of spending needed dollars on r d or investment billions of dollars of corporate cash flow have been deployed toward stock repurchases to fatten executive compensation an additional contributing factor has been the diminishment of government involvement in the economy this is a salient consideration given the state s historic contributing role in transformational technologies from the internet to gps as venture capitalist william janeway has noted in his book doing capitalism in the innovation economy what about the notion that economic size has contributed to the problem of income stagnation and non existent wage growth here again the evidence suggests that other factors are more important in fact as the economists lance taylor and özlem ömer illustrate in a recent study the stagnant low wage sectors nursing homes fast food construction education and health business services transportation and warehousing maids are the least concentrated with the lowest profit margins concentration per se can t explain low wages in these industries companies in these sectors are usually the ones that complain the most about a 15 hour minimum wage or the unionization of their work forces claiming they don t have the economic resources to pay the kinds of wages and benefits often secured in union negotiated deals an inflation eroded minimum wage the absence of unions replacement of full time employees by contractors and mass low wage immigration are better explanations for wage stagnation and non enforcement of antitrust remedies is irrelevant to those causes wage and labor laws matter the decades long sustained attacks on unions have given corporations both large and small the power to break the traditional nexus between worker productivity and wage gains this development has generated a massive shift in income from labor to capital over the past 35 years to avert this problem policy should therefore be fighting against worker exploitation irrespective of whether workers are employed by amazon or mom and pop sweatshops targeting based on size alone won t get rid of all of the abuses in fact amazon implicitly proved that big is not always bad and sometimes can be better recall how quickly the company recently introduced the 15 hour minimum wage in response to vast public pressure ideally a robust competing private power center i e organized labor means corporations in the most feral analysis have to fight a two front war how to get there from here is a problem the democrats might be spending more time thinking about assuming they can take their single minded focus away from the evils of economic gigantism for fragmented sweatshop industries where a big three tripartite model among government unions and big business doesn t apply governments can substitute unionized wage boards that were created in the early 20th century in the uk and copied in the united states new york governor andrew cuomo for example has used a state wage board to raise the fast food wage wage boards with tripartite government employer worker representation can be used by u s states in low wage sectors that can t be removed to another state or country construction health care nursing restaurants they should have power over hours and working conditions not just wages as far as high tech industries go the question of regulation vs breaking up may miss the main worries especially in regard to some of our newer 21st century behemoths such as google or facebook facebook for example may have some features of being a broadcaster which would suggest fcc style oversight but that is still a relatively small part of its business similarly it would be difficult to call google a broadcaster in the traditional sense of an fcc regulated company although it should be subject to the 21st century equivalent of fair broadcast rules whether the fcc is fully equipped to promulgate and enforce those rules is another question communications have changed a lot over the last half century and media have taken on a multiplicity of functions that were not in existence when the fcc was established using a horse and carriage model for an internet superhighway is problematic both facebook and google collect massive amounts of private data which makes them different from broadcasters sell heavily targeted advertising offer tech solutions to the larger social media world and provide forms of services search and personal networking the regulation would need to come to grips with the interrelationship of the four or the nature of the vertical integration creating eight mini facebooks doesn t seem like a good way to do this especially if the problem of how the company handles your data isn t adequately addressed rather the european union s general data protection regulation represents a good starting basis for a new regulatory framework because it regulates function regardless of size what about our pay to play political system doesn t corporate size play a role here yes but this is because companies scale up in size in order to maximize their abilities to pay to play as professor thomas ferguson asserts in his seminal work golden rule the investment theory of party competition and the logic of money driven political systems with enough money candidates can pole vault over the whole rotting structure of party politics in america the scale up however is a function of inadequate restrictions on private campaign finance ferguson s book demonstrates that powerful blocs of business elites large andsmall with durable largely economic interests are a constant feature of american politics smaller businesses do it as well they too have an incentive to scale up via a trade association to maximize the impact of their political investment change the incentives in pay to play and size becomes less of a polluting impact on the american polity the corollary also applies if the government were suddenly to embrace an antitrust agenda and aggressively break up the big corporate behemoths absent campaign finance reform he who has the gold would still rule more generally it is worth considering the whole underlying premise that market considerations on their own deliver optimal social outcomes consider that in times of grave national emergency such as war market mechanisms are generally subjugated to broader strategic objectives we didn t use the market to help us win world war ii during which the u s rationed raw materials established wage and price controls capped profits organized cartels of manufacturers set production targets and directed labor into war munitions civilians were exhorted to put their savings into wartime bonds and the economy was largely controlled by federal bureaucrats like simon kuznets and generals like brehon somervell and bill knudsen by no means am i suggesting a comparable scale of government involvement today i am simply questioning the optimistic premise underlying traditional market oriented antitrust remedies some national development government led industrial policy must play a role in shaping market mechanisms to broader public purpose
on the campaign trail recently the promise of allowing the naira to float was heard it therefore became imperative that those who know should intervene now amongst my asaba people there is this saying that you must drive the black goat inside the house before it is dark otherwise you might experience some difficulties wanting to do so later if you like as we say shut the stable door before the horse bolts away this is the spirit which informed the present intervention when you float a currency to ensure that we are all on the same page you literally allow unfettered market forces to determine the value of the currency the question to ask upfront is whether there is any currency in the world the determination of its value is left entirely to market forces i shouldn t think so what matters is the degree of freedom the market enjoys in the determination of the rate of exchange most monetary authorities around the globe are usually on standby to perform open market operations as they buy and sell the currency for the purposes of the determination of targeted exchange rate to buttress this point we witnessed donald trump america recently issue threats to the chinese that they risk retaliation if china continues to manipulate the fundamentals of its economy with a view to gaining balance of trade advantage the value of the naira today is not fixed it is determined by a variant of floating methodology referred to as managed float and therefore talks of floating the naira with the claim that the way and manner the exchange rate has been determined is part of the country s problem is open to debate probably it is useful to put discussions in context by recalling the experience of the country over the years as it experimented with allowing market forces free reign in the determination of the rate of exchange the first major attempt in the history of this country to embrace market forces wholesale goes back to the introduction of structural adjustment program sap in 1986 at the behest of the international monetary fund imf during the babaginda regime news continues after this advertisement sap then was introduced aimed at a diversification of the economy through aggressive promotion of non oil exports to reduce the unwholesome dependence of the country on the extractive sector particularly oil for a dominant portion of foreign currency earning as well as to optimize the allocative efficiency of market forces one area where the impact of this program was immediately felt was on the determination of the rate of exchange it is on record that overnight the rate of exchange of the naira was depreciated from 22 to 86 naira to the dollar this action unleashed unimaginable level of distortion on the economy as price of products suddenly skyrocketed causing runaway inflation to compound the situation at the same time an official window was left open at the rate of exchange before the sap induced devaluation at 22 naira to the dollar for official transactions providing a rent seeking opportunity which most economic agents in proxy position to access foreign exchange at this rate thoroughly abused as round tripping became the order of the day what is more since this experience the value of the naira never appreciated again even if one should not make so much about the notional rate of exchange of a currency since what is paramount is the productivity within an economy sometimes memory is woefully short it is a matter for the records that in the life of this administration similar attempt was made to loosen controls following the persistent call that that is the preferred route to managing the value of the naira with the monetary authorities called all sorts of names including being clueless and incompetent the central bank then decided that it was going to allow the forces of demand and supply determine the rate of exchange and was going to standby to intervene if the trend is going out of hand what happened should be very fresh in our memory the value of the naira depreciated rapidly and was heading to 500 naira to the dollar compared to the extant 158 when the panic button was hit and the depreciation was halted where it is today if immediate and urgent steps were not taken then the rate of exchange could have gone out of control by now and literally the bottom by now must have fallen off this economy we must commend the central bank under this administration for the feat it recorded for this stability to be achieved since then the cbn took other measures that facilitated the stability we are currently enjoying including the accretion to our reserves one laudable ingenious approach was the opening of the exporter importer window which literally allowed exporters and importers to agree without interference the rate at which they were ready to transact with the banks only providing a platform as well as guaranteeing the transaction this window contributed in no small measure to the reduction of pressure on the country s reserves as it facilitated trade flows and therefore productivity another aspect of foreign exchange management today which has been decried is the question of multiple exchange rates in the economy but the reality is that for as long as we have various windows for accessing foreign exchange including bureau de change and the parallel market the rates at these different markets can never be the same but the rates at these other markets should not be of so much concern as they lack the volume to cause major distortions but certainly as soon as practicable we must move to unify the rates at the official market we have so far retained the problematic dual rates which our experience hitherto certainly informs us that that is not the way ahead the question of the 42 items now proposed to rise to 50 denied access to official foreign exchange by the cbn is another policy measure for which the cbn had received a lot of flak as in the thinking of free market economists it offends the fundamental tenets of free trade but as we observed earlier even america was recently at logger heads with china as it complained of the manipulative tendencies of the chinese to gain balance of trade advantage the central bank faced with the challenge of dwindling foreign exchange inflow could not have sat idly bye to witness the depletion of our reserves on frivolous importations these imports are frivolous to the extent that local capacity exist for their production and the authorities must be seen to rise to the challenge of protecting local production and jobs and also the balance on the reserves even some of these items are intermediate products as claimed by organized bodies it is beholden on them to convince the authorities as the task of moving this economy forward must be seen as a joint effort of all stakeholders it speaks volumes as to the resilience of the authorities at the cbn that they were able to ride the barrage of criticisms from particularly organized trade associations as the bank stood its ground on the policy as the tenure of the current governor of the central bank expires in june and the battle for a successor intensifies it is in order that we should sound a note of warning that the apparent stability we have now enjoyed must be jealously guarded protected and not be taken for granted we must also caution against the policy of devaluation as an economy without an export base this country is in urgent need of sustained growth and development which certainly is not supported by any measure by macroeconomic instability mindful of the fact that at the end of the day when the time of reckoning arrives that managers of the economy would be called to account for the fact of the extent of deterioration on macroeconomic fundamentals dr boniface chizea writes from lagos news continues after this advertisement
complete coverage of the local and national primary and general election including results analysis and voter resources to keep chicago voters informed the sun times editorial board sent the candidates running for 46th ward alderman a list of questions to find out their views on a range of issues facing the city and their ward jon robert mcdowell submitted the following responses the sun times does not edit candidate responses who is jon robert mcdowell he s running for 46th ward alderman his political civic background i have been involved in politics government and community service for the majority of my adult life i was raised in upstate new york by a very politically minded single mother who had rather strong opinions on the politics of the day in fact one of my first memories i was three was sitting with my mother while watching new york governor mario cuomo s 1984 democratic convention speech after college i began my political career as an intern for us congressman elliot engel of the bronx focusing on social welfare and environmental policies after dc i decided i wanted to work more with my community back home i signed on with an environmental development company that among many things worked to design implement and educate neighborhoods and individuals about how to utilize and maintain organic vegetable gardens for either public or personal use over the past decade here in chicago i have had the privilege of managing numerous state representative and aldermanic campaigns for progressive candidates challenging entrenched incumbents i was an elected steering committee member for the grassroots political organization northside democracy for america ndfa and was also the recipient of their volunteer of year award in 2014 his occupation project manager his education ba in united states history from the state university of new york at albany campaign website jonrobertfor46 com twitter jrfor46 facebook facebook com jrfor46 top priorities what are the top three priorities for your ward jon robert mcdowell the 46th ward faces many challenges not being addressed by the current administration we face challenges with poverty crime and homelessness increasing need for mental health services dramatic rises in property taxes over development increased congestion and the complete neglect of our neighborhood schools the first issue that will need to be addressed however is our massive debt crisis and poorly managed finances every year we watch as our taxes go up and our services get cut the growing burden caused by the pension and debt crisis is dragging our city and my ward to its knees without proper funding and ensuring we prioritize our tax dollars to support the community and not developers or corporations we will continue to struggle to improve the lives our families our neighbors and friends next we need to address the continued neglect that has been shown to our neighborhood schools schools that are equally and adequately funded teachers who are respected as professionals and curriculum that is progressive allows children the freedom to think grow and learn and finally we must start to seriously address the needs of the our homeless and mentally ill population who have been removed from their shelters and left to wander our ward with no support in site recent civic work please tell us what you have done in the last two years to serve the city your neighborhood or a civic organization please be specific jon robert mcdowell obviously over that time frame this campaign has taken a good portion of it however in addition to the work being done within the ward over the last two years i have continued to remain active with various grassroots organizations such as the ndfa supporting progressive candidates at all levels of government sun times 2019 chicago voting guide pensions chicago is on the hook for 42 billion in unfunded pension liabilities which works out to 35 000 for every household those pensions in the language of the illinois constitution shall not be diminished or impaired should the state constitution be amended to allow a reduction in pension benefits for current city employees or retirees how about reducing pension benefits for new employees please explain jon robert mcdowell no amending the state constitution to reduce the pension benefits for current and workers would not only disrespect and violate the trust in government it would also shift the financial burdens created by this to the residents that worked their lifetime believing they were being dealt with in good faith those pushing for pension reductions are the same people who have been mismanaging the pension fund for decades and i will not allow our public employees to pay the price for our legislature s failure to act responsibly along with the many of the proposals listed in the upcoming questions i also believe we as a city council need to start using our influence as the 3rd largest city in the nation and the single largest economic engine in our state to push for a bold progressive agenda that restores power to the majority of the people and not the 1 i believe it s time we stood for a 15 dollar minimum wage progressive tax reform and universal healthcare coverage all of which increase revenue and drive growth rather than punishing our public employees for their dedication to our city instead i believe it is time we also push our legislator to look to the federal government for assistance in meeting current pension requirements as it would appear at least in private sector pension funds that this issue has finally taken hold in congress with the new incoming democratic majority set to take control of the house in 2019 it is time we began to make our needs known while federal assistance is a hard and unfortunate choice it will be necessary to continue to ensure solvency revenue of the following often proposed sources of new revenue for chicago which of the following do you favor and why a chicago casino legalized and taxed recreational marijuana a lasalle street tax a commuter tax a property tax increase a municipal sales tax increase a real estate transfer tax increase video gambling jon robert mcdowell i support the legalization and taxation of recreational marijuana not only has it proven to be an excellent revenue source in other states across the country it also provides relief to a criminal justice system overburdened by unpopular and out of date laws i also support a finical transaction tax i do not support any further property tax increases or a municipal sales tax as that is a regressive tax that targets the working class what other sources of new revenue do you favor or oppose jon robert mcdowell i believe it is time looked to the green energy technology sector as the next phase in our city s financial growth and development with the impacts of climate change becoming more and more apparent every day the time is right for chicago to take the necessary steps to become a leader in this much needed area we should be incentivizing renewable energy companies to move or open here and we should be working with our public schools and city collages to develop science and engineering curriculum to train the future leaders of this industry this i truly believe is next modern day industrial revolution and the city that leads the way in clean renewable energy and its technology will one day lead the global economy chicago can be that city we have the strength the people and the will to make it a reality so i see no reason why we shouldn t tifs tax increment financing districts are a primary economic development tool for chicago in a tif district taxes from the growth of property values are set aside for 23 years to be used to support public projects and private development what changes do you favor if any in chicago s tif program jon robert mcdowell our community thrives when we are all working when we are able to shop within our neighborhood and when we have affordable housing tif was supposed to be the answer to that however like so many states before us cronyism gross mismanagement and quid pro quo have become common i believe it is time we made serious reforms to our tif s to ensure they are being used explicitly for their designed purpose it is time we create a specific and unalterable definition of what constitutes a blighted neighborhood so that no more money is erroneously filtered to wealthy areas tif recipients need to provide a community improvement plan that outlines the developmental benefits to a ward and we must remove loopholes that allow businesses from using tif funds to buy their way out of restrictions intended to maintain the character of our community finally we must demand full transparency from the city regarding the appropriation of all funds the taxpayers deserve a regular accounting of tax dollars spent versus revenue generated from all tif projects aldermanic power what will you do to rein in aldermanic prerogative jon robert mcdowell speaking frankly when discussing aldermanic prerogative what we are really asking about is affordable housing which everyone has a right to the issue is should affordable housing be built in your neighborhood to which the answer yes it should we are a community of diverse socioeconomic people we share a pride in our city and a belief that we all come together to make it a better place to live isolation and segregation build fear and fear creates prejudice i believe we are better than that affordable housing should be distributed equally across the city and if aldermanic prerogative is stopping that then its time has come to an end police reform the city of chicago has entered into a federally monitored consent decree to overhaul the training and practices of the chicago police department civil libertarians say it is long overdue but others say it is unnecessary and could make it tougher for the police to do their job what s your view jon robert mcdowell an overhaul of the training and practices of the chicago police department is long overdue the report from the u s justice department pretty much says it all poor training too quick to use excessive and often deadly force lax discipline and lack of consequences for excess attacks on blacks and latinos the result is an overwhelming lack of trust in our police force by all members in our communities however what the report also explicitly says is that our police force has in fact lost faith and trust in our community and it s leadership it is this very lack of trust it is this disconnect between the police and the people that should be at the heart of the reform we need to initiate if we are going to finally solve this important issue it is time we rebuilt the trust between our communities and the police when we empower and reward effective and law abiding officers through proper funding educational resources and multicultural encouragement we become our own protectors law enforcement must be part of the community invested in the result of their hard and difficult work i believe in creating greater beat integrity urging officers to build relationships within their community officers are charged with public safety and that can only be achieved if they re familiar with the community they serve and understand it s needs we must reward officers for community engagement and reduction in crime rates focusing on the protection of their neighborhood instead of generating revenue through superfluous ticketing finally all cpd officers should be given monthly paid time off to engage with the community and participate in neighborhood gatherings improvement projects or attend neighbored school functions during class it is time to bring the police back into the fold of our community and remind them that at the end of the day our goals are the same together we can ensure that no citizen ever feels unsafe in their homes on their streets or in their lives guns what should chicago do to reduce the number of illegal guns jon robert mcdowell the gun violence in our city is out of control and it is time we took serious measures to curb illegal guns from getting into the hands of criminals i am a strong supporter of background checks and stricter regulations on who can own a firearm i am adamantly opposed to concealed carry and believe guns have absolutely no place in schools schools what is the appropriate role of charter schools within the chicago public schools system jon robert mcdowell there is no appropriate role for charter schools within the chicago public school system our emphasis should be on focusing our resources on providing high quality fully funded public education charter schools are for profit entities with no proven track record of success they also lack the proper oversight our children and our families deserve by continuing to syphon funds and resources away from our public schools we are simply diminishing the wholesale quality of the education offered to the city s children there are wonderful innovative models for public education out there successful programs that give opportunity to all children with the support and involvement of the entire community this is where we should be looking not allowing large corporations to profit off of one of our most important public institutions should the chicago board of education be solely appointed by the mayor as is now the case or should chicago switch to an elected school board or some hybrid jon robert mcdowell the chicago school board must be removed from the influence of the mayor a fully elected school board reflects the voices of the residents whose children are being taught in their schools yes an elected board can be difficult to manage with many different ideas and concerns often in conflict with one another but it is with this debate and community involvement that innovation and progress can emerge the residents of chicago have the right to elect their representatives to the chicago school board affordable housing is there enough affordable housing in your ward please explain jon robert mcdowell the 46th ward is home to a large amount of affordable housing units compared to some other neighboring northside wards however is it enough no it is not and we are losing more and more of it every day the 46th has been overrun by tif development that have opted out of their housing requirements by paying the token fee to the city now we see our homeless population being displaced with no support in site we need to stop allowing developers from buying out of low cost housing requirements or at the very least raise the fee dramatically immigration chicago by ordinance is an official welcoming city this means the chicago police are generally prohibited from detaining undocumented immigrants on behalf of federal immigration authorities what s your position on this policy what more or less should be done with respect to undocumented immigrants who live in chicago jon robert mcdowell despite all the misnomers regarding undocumented immigration most people who come to chicago are not criminals and would very much like to step out of the city s shadows to achieve full citizenship and we as a nation of immigrants owe it to them to provide that pathway just as our families were before us we must remain a welcoming city and not fall victim to the falsehoods and lies that are affecting so much of the nation s discourse on the matter chicago is and should remain a leader in the fight against such blind prejudice ethics should the inspector general have the power to audit and review city council programs operations and committees why or why not jon robert mcdowell yes they should and they should be able to provide a full report to the public on all actions decisions or outcomes from any public entity the time of back room deals corruption needs to end in this city once and for all full transparency and accountability is the only way a government can function for the people it is intended to serve would you employ or have you employed staff in your office who have outside jobs or contracts with entities that do business with the city if so please explain jon robert mcdowell no i would not hire staff members who had outside jobs or contracts for the city role model is there a past or current alderman whom you model yourself after or would model yourself after or take inspiration from please explain jon robert mcdowell are there some good alderman with good ideas certainly yes absolutely are there any i would want to emulate no there are not i think it is time for change and i believe it is time for some honesty from our government i believe the people have a right to know the reality of their civic lives they have a right to know where their tax dollars are going or not going they have a right to know the state of their schools their public transportation system their police department i understand that those aren t easy conversations to have when you are a public representative but they are nonetheless absolutely necessary and as the oldest son of five raised by a single mother who worked double and triple shifts simply to keep a roof over our heads i learned early on how to have the difficult conversations that were necessary to make sure problems were solved quickly i learned that when a challenge arose you tackled it right then and there and i intend to bring that same fight and determination to our city council in 2019
file photo ghana s economy like that of other emerging countries is likely to reel under new external pressures as global economic growth is estimated to slow to 2 9 per cent this year the latest development stems from the trade tensions between the united states and china and the on going slowdown of china s economy global economic growth rate is said to slow to 2 9 per cent in 2019 from a downwardly revised 3 per cent in 2018 according to the world bank in its global economic prospects report released a fortnight ago the world bank said the outlook for the global economy has darkened as global financing conditions have tightened trade tensions have intensified and some large emerging market and developing economies have experienced significant financial market stress faced with these headwinds the recovery in emerging market and developing economies has lost momentum the report indicated indeed china recorded its slowest annual economic growth rate since 1990 to 6 6 per cent in 2018 many manufacturing firms in the world s second largest economy are reported to have cut production as export uncertainties grow following import tariffs imposed on china by the united states the imminent threat this poses to ghana s economy is the shortfall in its ghana s export revenues as china s economic growth has an effect on international commodity prices this comes at a crucial time as ghana recently rebased its economy expanding it by almost 25 per cent and is hoping to sustain its economic growth going forward having been on a losing streak in recent years oil prices on the world market picked up from the beginning of 2018 and traded between 65 and 75 per barrel until the last quarter of that year when prices of the commodity dipped to as low as 43 crude oil is one of china s biggest imports meanwhile ghana s benchmark crude oil price for 2019 as indicated in the 2019 budget statement has been pegged at us 66 76 per barrel although it is early in the year to be worried over oil revenue shortfall it will suffice to note that prices of the commodity is yet to rise beyond 54 three weeks into 2019 if this continues for a larger part of the year it could distort ghana s petroleum benchmark revenue it would be recalled that government in 2015 had to revise its oil revenue projection downwards from 80 originally contained in the 2015 budget statement to 57 on the back of plummeting world oil prices ghana is neither faring any better with regards to global prices of its other traditional export commodities gold price fell below 1 300 an ounce in mid 2018 and traded at an average of 1 220 for the remaining months of that year the commodity has held steady since the start of this year at 1 290 but slipped at the close of trading last week and is currently trading at 1 279 cocoa prices are slipping after beginning the year from 2 440 a tonne to currently trade at 2 249 another external development that threatens ghana s economic stability this year is the expected us federal reserve bank s interest rate hike officials of the fed bank have projected two hikes this year and although fewer than the four increases recorded in 2018 this year s have a potential of affecting foreign direct investment fdi inflows into ghana as well as put a strain on the local currency ghana s economic performance in 2019 following the rebasing of its economy last year would have to contend with the slowdown just as it does with its own domestic economic instability such as inflation and depreciation of the cedi

the united states and china are playing eurasia s 21st century great game from different but equally skewed maps while the us map appears to be outdated the chinese map portrays a reality that is imagined if the skewed realities of both china and the united states have one thing in common it is in strategist parag khanna s mind the fact that neither realizes that the great game s prize a new world order has already been determined we are living for the first time ever in a truly multipolar and multicivilizational order in which north america europe and asia each represents a major share of power mr khanna says in his just published book the future is asian while the united states sees the great game as an as yet open ended battle for influence in europe and asia and looks at russia as a european rather than a eurasian power china overestimates what its future position aided by its us 1 trillion infrastructure and energy driven belt and road initiative is likely to be the skewed perceptions of both the united states and china create spaces for multiple other powers like russia and various middle eastern states to carve out positions of their own china nonetheless alongside russia has one advantage in contrast to the united states it adopts the notion put forward by former portuguese europe minister bruno macias that the number of the world s continents is shrinking from seven to six increasingly europe and asia no longer see their common landmass as two separate continents and are gravitating towards what mr macias calls a supercontinent mr khanna implicitly acknowledges mr macias notion by concluding that contrary to perceived chinese expectations ultimately china s position will be not of an asian or global hegemon but rather of the eastern anchor of the asian and eurasian mega system china s perceived other advantage its economic and financial muscle in the juggling for position on the new supercontinent is also proving to be its achilles heel the belief that the driver of the belt and road is geopolitics rather than economics is bolstered by predictions that none of china s indian ocean port projects have much hope of financial success a financial times study last year concluded that 78 countries targeted by china for project development are among the world s most risky economies on a scale of one to seven the highest level of country risk belt and road countries ranked 5 2 a significantly higher risk than the 3 5 average for emerging markets they had a median rating by moody s the credit rating agency that was the equivalent of non investment junk investment grade the risk was reflected on the balance sheets of major chinese state owned companies that build operate and invest in many belt and road projects the study reported that china s top internationally active construction and engineering contractors were almost four times more highly leveraged than their non chinese competitors in a bid to avert a financial crisis the government has ordered state owned companies to reduce their debt burden in part by attributing greater importance to the viability of overseas projects the risk to china is not purely economic it is also geopolitical and reputational increasingly china is forced to focus short term less on the great game itself and more on countering the negative effect of a growing perception that china s projection of the belt and road as a mutually beneficial proposition is more fantasy than fact a growing number of countries like pakistan malaysia myanmar and nepal question the benefits of belt and road projects and are resisting china s often onerous commercial and funding terms ironically china s immediate rivals in efforts to maintain its status and ensure that it does not lose hard won ground are not the united states india or japan but its newly assertive geopolitically ambitious friends in the gulf saudi arabia and the united arab emirates as well as iran that is nowhere truer than in pakistan a belt and road crown jewel where saudi arabia and the uae have exploited to their advantage chinese irritation with pakistani demand s to shift the emphasis of the china pakistan economic corridor cpec from infrastructure and energy to agriculture job creation and the enabling of third party investment primarily from countries in the gulf chinese chagrin has been evident in china s hesitancy to respond to pakistani requests for help in averting a financial crisis filling the gap massive saudi and uae aid and investment to the tune of us 30 billion in balance of payment support deferred oil import payments and investment in the troubled pakistani province of balochistan that borders iran has helped the government of imran khan avoid asking the international monetary fund imf cap in hand to bail it out china fears that pakistan s mounting dependence on saudi arabia and the uae coupled with a us campaign intended to curb iran s regional projection potentially complicates the security of its massive us 45 billion plus investment that to a large extent targets balochistan the united states and saudi arabia see balochistan as a possible launching pad for possible efforts to destabilize the islamic republic by stirring unrest among its baloch population and other ethnic minorities increased saudi and uae influence in balochistan could moreover suck china into the escalating maelstrom of the two countries rivalry with iran ironically saudi and uae investment has at the same time shielded china from potentially embarrassing disclosure of the financial terms of cpec related projects that the imf was demanding as part of any bailout media reports said that pakistan had informally told the imf that it would be paying china us 40 billion over 20 years for us 26 5 billion in chinese funding of cpec related projects the impact of saudi arabia and the uae like much of the rest of the middle east goes far beyond balochistan it also puts its mark elsewhere on the eurasian supercontinent in the words of analyst galip dalay the middle east or west asia will for better or for worse shape each other the contemporary middle east is no longer the geopolitically us centric space that the europeans once knew europe can respond in several ways proceed with its largely ad hoc incoherent and crisis driven policies of recent years continue to be incorporated into someone else s game plan as with the french german involvement in the russian led astana peace process for syria or craft a more coherent policy towards the region with a strong emphasis on democratisation reform good governance inclusion and reconciliation if europe doesn t engage and invest in the transformation of the middle east regional developments will dramatically transform it whether through radicalism refugees terrorism xenophobia or populism interactions between europe and the middle east will be transformative for better or for worse mr dalay said the middle east is similarly crucial to the success of china s belt and road with iran and turkey representing key nodes that further the rise of eurasia through chinese funded rails that link the atlantic coast of europe to the people s republic the middle east s impact is one facet of a bigger game in which world and regional powers are competing for position in mr khanna s multipolar and multicivilizational order robert malley a former obama national security council official and head of the international crisis group argues that autocratic and authoritarian leaders are testing the limits of the great game as the power of western nations erodes and embattled concepts of multilateralism no longer serve to constrain them as the era of largely uncontested u s primacy fades the international order has been thrown into turmoil more leaders are tempted more often to test limits jostle for power and seek to bolster their influence or diminish that of their rivals by meddling in foreign conflicts having annexed parts of georgia and crimea and stoked separatist violence in ukraine s donbass region russia is now throwing its weight around in the sea of azov poisoning dissidents in the united kingdom and subverting western democracies with cyberwarfare china obstructs freedom of navigation in the south china sea and arbitrarily detains canadian citizens saudi arabia has pushed the envelope with the war in yemen the kidnapping of a lebanese prime minister and the gruesome murder of dissident journalist jamal khashoggi in its consulate in istanbul iran plots attacks against dissidents on european soil israel feels emboldened to undermine ever more systematically the foundations of a possible two state solution to the israeli palestinian conflict mr malley said by implication mr malley was suggesting that efforts to push the envelope were enabled by the us failure to recognize that europe and asia were becoming one supercontinent that failure was mirrored in the u s national security strategy published in 2017 by the white house and a study by rand corporation in 2018 designed to conceptualize current geopolitics as an era of intensifying international competition rather than recognizing an increasingly evident divergence of interests between the united states and europe the study suggested that the us would continue to have the opportunity if it chooses to lead a predominant coalition of value sharing democracies and other largely status quo states to help preserve stability the study appeared to downplay any divergence by reducing differences to identity fuelled nationalism that aims to recapture countries rightful place in world politics a reference to russia china iran and north korea as well as european nations grappling with the rise of nationalist populist and far right forces and a middle east that is shaping europe through highly emotive issues such as migration political violence and religious identity the us focus on russia as a european rather than a regional power with global ambitions also means that it underestimates moscow s play in the middle east despite its military intervention in syria russia national security scholar stephen blank argues that president vladimir putin s strategy in the region is rooted in the thinking of yevgeny primakov a middle east expert and linguist and former spymaster foreign minister and deputy prime minister who like mr khanna envisioned the emergence of a multi polar multi civilizational world with eurasia at its centre mr primakov saw the middle east as a key arena for countering the united states that would enable russia weakened by the demise of the soviet union and a subsequent economic crisis to regain its status as a global and regional power and ensure that it would be one pole in a multi polar world by identifying the region as a preferred battleground russia benefitted in the words of historian niall ferguson from the fact that its significant oil reserves made it the only power that has no vested interest in stability in the middle east mr blank argued that in order to reassert russia s greatness primakov and putin aimed ultimately at strategic denial denying washington sole possession of a dominant role in the middle east from where us influence could expand to the commonwealth of independent states cis a regional grouping of post soviet nations they believed that if russia succeeded it would force the united states to concede multi polarity and grant russia the recognition it deserves that in turn would allow mr putin to demonstrate to the russian elite his ability to restore russia to great power status syria offered russia the opportunity to display its military prowess without the united states challenging the move at the same time russia leveraged its political and economic clout to forge an alliance with turkey and partner with iran the approach constituted an effort to defang turkish and iranian influence in the caucasus and central asia similarly russia after brutally repressing religiously inspired chechen rebels in the 1990s was proving to be far defter than either china or the united states at promoting politically pacifist or apolitical islam in a complex game of playing all sides against the middle russian engagement runs the gamut from engaging with militants to cooperating with muslim autocrats to encouraging condemnation of the kind of islam adopted by partners such as saudi arabia said dmitri trenin director of the carnegie moscow center and a former russian military officer russia is not the soviet union it does not see the middle east as a region that it can dominate displacing the united states from the leading position in the middle east is way above russia s capacity and keeping the region in its sphere of influence is way above russia s resources russia has certainly benefited from waning u s interest in the middle east as absent an active america russia can act with more confidence and ease describing russia as a lonely power mr trenin went on to say that the difference between russia and the soviet union was that the soviet union was heavily engaged around the middle east in spending money on an ideological and geopolitical project the russian federation is active in the region trying to make money the soviet union was about an idea russia s idea is about russia itself in the great game s jostling for position mr trump s america first approach mirrors mr trenin s portrayal of russian policy that leaves china tied up in the contradictions of a policy that is packaged in assertions of lofty ideals but like the united states and russia is in effect first and foremost about the pursuit of chinese interests
the trump administration s announcement wednesday to recognize venezuelan national assembly leader juan guaidó as interim president of venezuela amid the current popular uprising against the anti democratic socialist maduro regime was an act of brilliant statecraft the move has been followed by an international coalition of other countries including canada and almost all south american countries meanwhile maduro has threatened to expel u s diplomats a power which he no longer has in the eyes of the u s and its allies between sham elections and ruining venezuela s once prosperous economy maduro embodies the worst qualities of a socialist dictator taking over from socialist revolutionary hugo chavez after his death in 2013 maduro continued the same legacy of intense bolivarian socialism as venezuela crisis deepens us embassy faces security crisis the chavez maduro socialist experiment has been an economic failure in almost every way since the chávez maduro regime took power and influenced its central bank to print money venezuela has achieved the world s highest inflation rate the international monetary fund estimates that inflation in the country has nearly reached 1 million percent a hyperinflation level seen in germany in 1923 and zimbabwe a decade ago when governments similarly used their central bank to print money to monetize significant levels of government debt many vendors in venezuela no longer accept bolivars the nation s currency which has correspondingly seen its value erased relative to other world currencies one u s dollar is now estimated to be worth approximately 2 5 million bolivars in the currency s black market by comparison the dollar was worth 2 5 bolivars in as recent as 2006 the economic growth picture in venezuela is similarly horrifying as the chávez maduro regime nationalized much of the country s economic sectors including oil agricultural finance industrials mining telecommunications and power the imf estimates that gdp is expected to have fallen by 18 percent in 2018 the third year of consecutive double digit negative growth tantamount to an economic depression rarely seen in history especially in modern times there was a time during the last century when venezuela rich in oil and other resources was the most prosperous south american country and a popular tourist destination for international travelers that now seems a distant memory in total real gdp per capita has fallen by 46 percent since 2013 meanwhile neighboring countries embracing democratic free market capitalism like colombia and panama are currently experiencing gdp growth from 2 percent to 4 percent rep ilhan omar faces backlash for claiming trump backs coup in venezuela the chavez maduro regime introduced price controls on food items and currency controls that prevented importers from using u s dollars which ultimately created massive shortages of food thousands of venezuelans now suffer from hunger and malnutrition many including children have died crime is also rampant in venezuela with little rule of law and massive state controlled corruption an estimated 870 000 venezuelan refugees have fled to neighboring colombia until now the world has largely sat by as the horrors of the chávez maduro regime have transpired click here to get the fox news app thanks to the u s led coalition endorsing juan guaidó as interim president venezuelans now have hope for a new leader who has promised to host free and fair elections embodying a return to democracy for the country venezuela s path back to a market based economy will be critical to restoring its prosperity president trump with the support of many in congress like senators marco rubio and rick scott has played a critical role in helping to move the country in that direction by creating hope for the restoration of economic and political freedom

tenaris looks to tap international growth tenaris s a nyse ts is a luxembourg based provider of steel pipe products to the upstream energy companies across the world tenaris will continue to rely on higher demand for octg in the u s unconventional shales in the coming quarters it is increasing its production in the bay city facility however tsâ s management has turned its focus on international energy growth particularly in the middle east to tap higher market share tenaris has negative net debt which is a big plus for a company of this size the uncertainties for ts remain the project deferrals in the offshore energy markets recent changes regarding a new trade policy with canada and tariff hikes for steel products tsâ s chief executiveâ s name being dragged into a matter of foreign trade practice dispute can potentially dampen investorsâ sentiment i expect tsâ s stock price to show a negative bias in the short run in the medium to long run tsâ s growth drivers are still strong in the past year tsâ s stock price has gone down by 33 and outperformed the vaneck vectors oil services etf oih which declined by nearly 42 during this period oih represents the oilfield equipment services or ofs industry what is driving tenaris demand for octg products in the united states and canada plummeted in 2015 and 2016 after the crude oil price crash since 2017 demand and sales of octg products recovered strongly as inventory levels returned to more normal levels by the end of q3 2018 tenaris supplied nearly 65 of octg in the u s and 90 in canada however the rapid increase in hydrocarbon production in the permian region led to pipeline takeaway capacity constraints which dampened the u s drilling activity in the past quarter in response to the energy market growth in north america ts is consolidating its rig direct strategy and enhancing its relationship with the major customers in the unconventional shale plays to cater to the expected rise in demand ts is ramping up octg production in its bay city facility it has restarted the process to provide additional finishing capacity as well as increased production at the hickman facility in q4 2018 ts delivered the second pipeline in the zohr field in egypt ts started delivering the export pipeline in zohr in early 2018 eni e is developing the offshore natural gas project here according to tsâ s estimates sales for eastern mediterranean pipelines will account for more than 10 of its annual sales volume for 2018 tenaris has recently won an award for a project in australia it also entered into natural gas projects in india and china during the quarter tsâ s success is also tied to a sustained offshore energy market recovery it has recently received an award to supply the casing on a rig direct basis in a multi year project this includes bluedock connector and wedge and dopeless premium connection technologies dopeless technology is a dry coating that saves e p operatorsâ costs and time while minimizing the impact on the environment the bluedock connector product range includes weld on connectors for large diameter casing this helps in tension compression and bending in welding and pipe manufacturing in q3 2018 all of tenarisâ geographic regions except europe witnessed revenue growth compared to q2 2018 the middle east africa led the pack with 16 6 quarter over quarter growth followed by asia pacific oceania 8 6 and north america 7 4 in the past year tsâ s revenue share from the middle east africa increased from 13 to 17 with its growing focus on the middle east market tsâ s strategy is likely to see sustained growth in the near term in that region while north america may slow down due to various industry headwinds future potential drivers in 2019 and after that the demand for octg products is expected to increase in the u s canada and in the international markets this will partially compensate for tsâ s lower sales for offshore pipelines among its international geographies argentina has presented an uncertain environment because of the political turmoil there despite that tsâ s management believes that argentinaâ s vaca muerta unconventional resource shale can be a significant driver drilling activity has started to make a recovery in vaca muerta gradually which should make an incremental contribution to tsâ s performance in that region so in q1 2019 tsâ s u s operation can see a marginal growth while its international operation may start to pick up however offshore project delays following the recent crude oil price weakness can once again pull back its growth potential regarding the outlook tsâ s management commented in the q3 earnings call we think that there could be also some upside in the u s that could also contribute to let s say reduce imbalance and then the rest of the world that the gradual increase may also support the same set in other countries all in all i think we should be able to basically stabilize at the level of sales in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter some risks and uncertainties investors may note that europe based hunting group otcpk hntif also offers premium connections octg equipment drilling tools and subsea equipment however as with hunting group offshore project delays completion activity slowdown in north america and permian capacity constraints can pull back tenarisâ upside in the near to medium term read more on hunting here the other uncertainty about tenarisâ business environment surrounds the new united states mexico canada agreement or usmca which could be replacing the north american free trade agreement or nafta the deal among other agreements seeks to cap automobile exports to the united states from canada the other factor to affect tsâ s outlook is the u s china trade war and its fallout on tariff structure in march 2018 the u s imposed section 232 under this rule a 25 tariff was levied on all steel imports and 10 on all aluminum imports into the u s the sanction impacts all carbon products including pipe fittings and flanges although it is not clear how much the effect will be in likelihood tenarisâ margin could be adversely affected by their impositions recent developments to drive ts recent acquisition in saudi arabia in january 2019 ts acquired 48 share of saudi steel pipe company for 141 million the company located in saudi arabia owns plants with 360 000 tons per year of welded steel pipe production capacity the acquisition will expand tsâ s presence in saudi arabia which has one of the largest markets of octg and line pipe products because of the regionâ s vast energy resources saudi steel pipe companyâ s products complement tsâ s co rental offerings ceoâ s alleged involvement in a graft matter in december 2018 an on going investigation on techint group also involved tenaris s chairman and ceo paolo rocca the allegations made in an on going investigation on techint involve unlawful payment made to argentine government officials the investigation was first disclosed on november 27 tsâ s board has instructed mr rocca to continue discharging his responsibilities while involvement in a legal matter concerning foreign trade practices is not uncommon for large corporations with multiple regional operations the chairman being dragged upfront could draw serious repercussion from the investing community however tsâ s stock price has remained relatively resilient 1 down from november 27 until now it outperformed oih 9 down during this period other investigation risks the italian and swiss authorities are investigating tsâ s alleged involvement in improper payments to some officers of petrobras pbr in a similar investigation the sec and doj are also inquiring into a matter tsâ s dividend tenaris pays 0 13 quarterly dividend per share which amounts to 2 2 forward dividend yield in the past five years its dividend has decreased marginally united states steel corporationâ s x dividend yield 0 97 is lower compared to ts net debt and cash flow position tsâ s net debt was negative as of september 30 as a result of cash cash equivalents balance exceeding total debt tsâ s net debt was negative 296 5 million as of september 30 which was a decline compared to a year ago when its net debt was negative 751 million being a net debt negative company is an attractive feature when energy price nosedives the companyâ s earnings dip and servicing of debt becomes difficult ts is better equipped to survive a downturn compared to many of its ofs industry peers tsâ s aggregate cash flow from operations was 371 million in the past three quarters until q3 while its capex was 274 million during the same period between cash equivalents and short term and long term investments the companyâ s liquidity stood at 1 2 billion as of september 30 ts had 703 million of short term borrowings as of september 30 given ample liquidity there is no near term repayment or financial risks however over the medium to long term ts may need to improve its cash flows to avoid borrowings from external sources to fund its dividend and capex programs what does tsâ s relative valuation say tenaris is currently trading at an ev to adjusted ebitda multiple of 9 9x based on sell side analystsâ ebitda estimates as pulled from thomson reuters tsâ s forward ev ebitda multiple is 8 1x this is lower than its average ev ebitda multiple of 15 1x from fy2013 to fy2018 tsâ s forward ev to ebitda multiple contraction versus its adjusted trailing twelve month ev ebitda is less steep than the industry peersâ average multiple compression as noted in the table above this is because analysts expect tsâ s ebitda to improve less sharply compared to the rise in the peersâ average in the next four quarters this would typically reflect in a lower current ev ebitda multiple compared to the peersâ average tsâ s ttm ev ebitda multiple is lower than its peersâ vallourec sa otcpk vlowy timkensteel corp tmst and x average of 19 4x for estimates i have used data provided by thomson reuters analystsâ rating on ts according to data provided by seeking alpha 15 sell side analysts rated ts a â buyâ in january including strong buys while 11 of the sell side analysts rated ts a â holdâ one of the sell side analysts rated ts a â sellâ the analystsâ consensus target price for ts is 35 0 which at tsâ s current price yields 48 returns whatâ s the take on ts tenaris will continue to remain invested in the north america growth story for the foreseeable future it also relies on higher demand for octg in the u s unconventional shales from the u s onshore and offshore project activities in this regard it is increasing its production in the bay city facility however tsâ s management has turned its focus on international energy growth that is undergoing in some regions around the world in january 2019 ts acquired shares of a saudi arabia based pipe company which would establish tsâ s base in one of the largest markets of octg and line pipe products tenaris has negative net debt which is a big plus for a company of this size the uncertainties for ts remain the project deferrals in the offshore energy markets and recent changes regarding a new trade policy with canada and tariff hikes for steel products while the effects are difficult to quantify at this point these can adversely affect tsâ s margin what can hurt investorsâ sentiments is the chairman and ceoâ s name being dragged into a potential legal matter involving unfair foreign trade practice while tsâ s stock price has managed to steer clear of any slide so far the unfolding of the matter into something more serious can also potentially weigh on its share price i do not expect tsâ s stock price to show upside potential in the short run i expect the u s market recovery and international markets to drive tenarisâ growth in the medium term

everyone agrees that to reform europe is a priority and there s only one logical way to do it as proposed by french president macron his plan is simply brilliant exactly what europe needs now but there are many reasons why it will not be adopted in spite of its brilliance and evident relevance it should come as no surprise that the author of this reform plan is french france has always been the country of logic since descartes days the sad thing is that logic is not a winner these days with nationalist populism reviving everywhere including in germany and italy and in most of central and eastern europe there are other reasons too militating against macron s plan germany s fixation on austerity italy s anti establishment government italy as i will show is the unexpected linchpin the country that could kill the dream of a united europe first let s examine macron s plan and then see why its chances for success are slim slim but not totally hopeless there is an on going revival on the left especially with the greens in germany and some inspiring figures like carlo calenda in italy macron s plan to reform europe making it a sustainability champion so what is macron s plan as bloomberg put it macron s goal is to make europe fit for a globalized world in a landmark speech at paris sorbonne university in september 2017 he outlined a six pillar plan he calls them keys to reform europe and make it sovereign united and democratic for the video of the full speech in english translation click here macron s six keys are security creation of a joint defense force able to act autonomously but in cooperation with nato with a common defense budget and common doctrine to act on establishment of a european intelligence academy a european public prosecutor s office against organized crime and terrorism a european civil protection agency to respond to natural disasters sovereignty to address the challenge of migration a common space needs to be built through a a european asylum office to speed up and harmonize procedures b a european border police that guarantees strict border management throughout europe and ensures the return of those who cannot stay c a broad training and integration program for refugees already in europe foreign policy increased overseas aid to address the migration issue at its source aid to be financed from a tax on financial transactions focused onto address the migration issue at its source aid to be financed from a ftt to be established following the model of either the existing french or uk tax a strategic partnership with africa to address the common challenges of tomorrow youth employment mobility the fight against climate change technological change this will require priority investments in the education health and energy sectors sustainable development energy policies to address the ecological transition climate change and environmental degradation it starts with setting a fair price on carbon high enough to ensure this transition and establishing a well functioning european energy marke t in practice a carbon tax levied at the borders of europe to defend european producers from unfair competition by countries that do not share the same environmental policies it also requires a a european industrial program to support clean vehicles and deploy common infrastructures so that it is possible to cross europe without damaging it b increased food safety and sovereignty and a revised european agricultural policy cap to better meet market price volatility and regional local needs support to innovation digital policies the digital revolution means europe must do everything to have these digital champions to attract scientific and entrepreneurial talents including a create a european agency for breakthrough innovation as the united states did with darpa at the time of the space conquest b define a regulatory framework to protect data and defend individual and business freedom from tech giants c review our tax systems to tax without complacency the companies which are implanted outside europe for the sole purpose of escaping the tax and to defend intellectual property the euro ambition a sustainable economic power in the areas of energy digital space and industry can only be built around the same currency the euro the challenge is to reduce youth unemployment thus saving future generations and making the eurozone competitive with china and the united states what this requires a major overhaul of the euro with a separate budget for the euro zone financed from the above mentioned digital and environmental taxes he ends his speech with calls to greater solidarity noting that too much has been done in the name of responsibility see how the greek debt was handled and not enough in the name of solidarity which is key to creating unity among the european peoples this requires greater efforts in several key areas harmonization of work and business rules it requires reform of secondment work and social contributions to be paid to the worker s country of origin convergence of taxes on business and of minimum salaries a greater push for cultural knowledge at both school and university level including the creation by 2024 of at least twenty european universities built on a network of universities from several european countries setting a path where each of their students will study abroad and take courses in at least two languages overcoming the democratic deficit of european institutions the founding fathers were wrong to move europe forward despite the peoples leaving obstacles in the way of unification the germans won t accept to mutualize debt across europe the french refuse to modify european treaties to overcome these obstacles the foundation for a united europe needs to be rebuilt with the participation of the peoples and not behind their back that should be the debate in the coming may 2019 elections for the european parliament hence the call for transnational lists in european elections that will allow europeans to vote for a coherent and common project let us not be afraid to have a european debate for the 2019 elections concludes macron the european union in 2024 will be gathered around two pillars in my eyes he says the first the values of democracy and the rule of law they are not negotiable they are not à la carte on values there can not be a two speed europe hungary and illiberal democracies in europe should take note the second pillar is the single market that remains the best guarantee of our power our prosperity our attractiveness the simplification work initiated three years ago by the current commission must be continued and amplified but what is needed is a a simpler more transparent less bureaucratic europe european institutions need to be streamlined the european commission should have 15 members not 28 and in future europe should open to the balkans and not close itself to the u k even after brexit a rousing speech that was arguably marred by shortcomings that critics were quick to latch on there was they said a lack of detail on the euro overhaul suggesting macron expected it would take a very long time to actuate or hard to get germany to agree to it and there was a bewildering laundry list of things to do big and small from the creation of a european intelligence agency to a carbon tax levied at the eu s borders and the creation of real european universities able to award european diplomas in short macron s plan in contrast to germany s obsession with austerity is expansive and designed to appeal to both the left and the greens calling for more public investment financed by the eurozone budget tax finance ftt protect eu citizens against social or trade dumping more overseas aid more action against global warming in his speech and on many subsequent occasions the latest being 24 january meeting with merkel macron has made it clear that he wants germany and france to lead the push for reform possibly as some fear setting aside smaller countries interests and dismissing italy or spain his proposal to reduce the european commission to 15 members from the current 28 soon to be 27 with brexit further fuels those fears unquestionably macron made a strategic mistake when he didn t try to rally a maximum number of countries behind his proposals yet it is an understandable mistake for decades the franco german special friendship has led europe forward on the road to a union on the migration issue he made his other strategic mistake accusing the new government of italy of not doing its part anymore macron has his own problems at home with the gilets jaunes though his handling of the situation starting a national debate with all the mayors of france seems to be giving good early results his popularity rating that had collapsed is beginning to inch up and in the latest poll he stands at 31 percent in the photo french president emmanuel macron stands near a yellow vest protester as he attends a meeting with local residents in bourg de peage near valence france on january 24 2019 source emmanuel foudrot afp then there are problems with france s historic allies let s examine each threat to europe in turn brexit and populism a return to the past eu institutions are battered by populists who want a europe of nations that demand was at the heart of brexit simply put they want to take back national sovereignty and the dream of a united europe be damned populists it is well known like to exploit people s emotions raising anger against immigrants and other hot button issues like too much meddling from european bureaucracy rather than appealing to their rational mind and proposing constructive solutions if populists have their way they can easily paralyze eu institutions turning the clock back to the system of requiring unanimity in every vote at the european council the eu s highest body since it brings together the 28 european leaders what is needed to move forward and have people agree on common rules is a qualified majority anything else won t work no european nation on its own is big and strong enough to resist the challenges of globalization with eu institutions paralyzed the world s two superpowers china and the united states will have carte blanche to do as they please china will take over africa it has already started the united states will drop nato as trump has repeatedly threatened germany s threat to europe the paralyzing power of rigid budgetary rules germany is doubling down on austerity while the new head of merkel s party the cdu is her like minded protégé annegret kramp karrenbauer other powerful politicians constrain merkel one is the new president of the bundestag the german parliament dr wolfgang schäuble merkel s former finance minister and the force behind germany s austerity policies the other is ralph brinkhaus the parliamentary group leader of the ruling cdu csu group in the bundestag and an austerity hawk when merkel and macron signed a treaty in aachen aix la chapelle on tuesday 22 january quite a few people were scared populists marine le pen first among them were quick to accuse macron of an act that borders on treason but is it really threatening france s sovereignty an examination of the 16 page treaty shows that this is not the case there is no mention of sovereignty in any part of the treaty it simply proposes to formalize a previously exceptional practice once a quarter a member of each government executive will participate in the council of ministers of the other state so is it anything more than just symbolic as the atlantic council put it in its blog the question is whether it carries much practical significance it is certainly not going to shake up the european order the cooperation is just a little closer but it doesn t cover new ground it s more of the same basically an enhanced updated replique of the elysées treaty signed 56 years ago between charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer the only new thing the aachen treaty ushers in is enhanced cooperation at the institutional and political level and that could translate into a stronger push in certain areas for example in the area of defense and creation of a european army but not in finance it is clear that macron avoided including his euro budget plan as the atlantic council notes the most important thing it does is give out a political message the new treaty arguably provides on a very soft basis a form of non coercive leadership within the european union as a statement of principles and values it counters both the populist or nationalist trends in italy hungary the czech republic and poland as well as those same trends beyond europe in the united states brazil and the philippines for instance the problem is that it is on a very soft basis macron surely would have liked something more solid issues dividing the two countries continue unaddressed most importantly what to do with the euro including austerity policies and migration the treaty is silent on these key issues it is silent because merkel s hands are tied by her own party schäuble and brinkhaus to build europe macron cannot count on germany so what about italy italy s threat to europe stabbing france in the back the only hope for macron would have been to forge a strong alliance with italy to face down germany and bring the austerity stalemate to an end it s not happening certainly there were errors on both sides the french government s decision to close its borders to migrants caused bottlenecks in northern italy cross border incursions by french police seeking to stop migrants in the alps have enraged the italians for years even before the new populist government led by luigi di maio 5 star movement and matteo salvini the extreme right lega came to power in the photo from left to right di maio salvini and conte source ansa but now italian french relations have further deteriorated with a series of diplomatic spats that have are becoming a regular feature in the news the disputes usually concern migration and salvini regularly attacks the french on that score they also concern disputes around energy usually over libyan oil resources and certain sensitive industries like shipbuilding the latest this week prime minister conte went to davos at the world economic forum and said if france wants to make its seat available on the un security council let s talk about it in the european context if we really want to give importance to this context an extraordinary statement that reveals an astounding ignorance of how the un works and what the political stakes are at the un security council likewise demonstrating an incredibly poor understanding of both history and the current situation deputy prime minister di maio attacked the french over its role in africa and its support for the currency the franc cfa in use in 14 francophone african countries he said france was exploiting africa causing poverty and fueling mass migration towards europe what he did was simply repeat without thinking the absurd attacks from african nationalist activists as shown in this video the french reaction was predictable the economy minister bruno le maire told france 24 in davos that the attacks were infantile minister for europe nathalie loiseau said she refuses to enter a stupidity contest with rome macron remained silent in italy the local press was quick to debunk conte s and di maio s arguments with the sole 24 ore noting that they were really part of the five star movement s anti europe ideology what di maio and conte are doing is launch in this way bashing france s pro european government their campaign for the may elections at the european parliament internal political motivations replace any vision the italian government might have had regarding its possible role in europe and in so doing italy has closed the door on a historic opportunity to ally itself with france and really weigh in and change the course of history in europe an opportunity lost that may never come back especially now that italy is once again sinking in recession that will make it difficult if not impossible for this government to fulfill its promises particularly regarding pension reform too costly and the new citizen s income a gift to the poor that could cost upwards of 10 billion a sum it won t be able to afford and that in any case will do nothing to jump start the economy very different policies are needed to do that policies focused on business and not on the poor it won t be the first time that populists don t deliver on the promises they make the only hope is that populists do not win as much as they hope at the coming european parliament elections editor s note the opinions expressed here by impakter com columnists are their own not those of impakter com

in the language of the illinois constitution shall not be diminished or impaired should the state constitution be amended to allow a reduction in pension benefits for current city employees or retirees how about reducing pension benefits for new employees please explain erika wozniak francis absolutely not a pension is a commitment that is depended upon by employees and retirees we cannot go back on promises made to those who dedicated their careers to civil service particularly as they cannot rely on social security retired public servants also make up a critical component of our middle class communities and destabilizing their retirements in this way would in effect destabilize entire local economies we must instead seek progressive revenue solutions to fund our pension deficit by ensuring the very wealthy and large corporations are paying their fair share in taxes revenue of the following often proposed sources of new revenue for chicago which of the following do you favor and why a chicago casino legalized and taxed recreational marijuana a lasalle street tax a commuter tax a property tax increase a municipal sales tax increase a real estate transfer tax increase video gambling erika wozniak francis i am most in favor of legalizing and taxing recreational marijuana and the lasalle street tax until there is a constitutional amendment to allow for progressive taxation it is essential that legislators work to implement the least regressive taxes available to fund our pensions and debts taxing marijuana and the lasalle street tax have the most promise to provide significant revenue without hurting working class chicagoans i recognize that chicago s debt and pension crisis requires that every option for raising revenue be explored but i will not support measures that continue to disproportionately harm vulnerable chicagoans what other sources of new revenue do you favor or oppose erika wozniak francis before we spend time and resources looking for additional sources of revenue a smarter measure is to maintain pressure on state legislators to pass a constitutional amendment to provide for a fair progressive state income tax it is the single most important step towards supporting a solvent and economically sustainable chicago tifs tax increment financing districts are a primary economic development tool for chicago in a tif district taxes from the growth of property values are set aside for 23 years to be used to support public projects and private development what changes do you favor if any in chicago s tif program erika wozniak francis i support the progressive reform caucus back to basics tif ordinance with the goal of limiting the use of tax increment finance dollars to redevelopment projects in blighted areas in which the property in question is vacant and or obsolete and in cases where the project would be unable to move forward without tif support currently tif dollars are often handed out to developers that could adequately finance the projects in question through private means i also support the garza cardenas tif surplus reform ordinance to ensure tif surplus funds are directed to cps when the system is considered to be in a state of financial distress aldermanic power what will you do to rein in aldermanic prerogative erika wozniak francis aldermanic prerogative has often been used to control development and zoning in wards to prevent construction of housing that is affordable in some cases that has been driven by racial or other bias to prevent that inappropriate use of aldermanic prerogative i support both the homes for all and the development for all ordinances which would work to provide more comprehensive affordable housing while also prohibiting aldermanic interference with the development of housing that is affordable police reform the city of chicago has entered into a federally monitored consent decree to overhaul the training and practices of the chicago police department civil libertarians say it is long overdue but others say it is unnecessary and could make it tougher for the police to do their job what s your view erika wozniak francis the city of chicago and the chicago police department have consistently failed to address the culture of abuse of power secrecy and discrimination that has plagued the cpd the consent decree was a consequence of the failure to make the necessary changes to education training and protocol necessary to address the institutional racism and discrimination that has eroded public trust in law enforcement i support the consent decree and will continue to fight for reform and change within all levels of law enforcement so that the relationship between the residents of chicago and those tasked with their protection can rebuild trust guns what should chicago do to reduce the number of illegal guns erika wozniak francis chicago cannot tackle the issue of illegal gun sales in a vacuum it is essential that we work with state and federal authorities to develop and implement effective gun control measures including extensive background checks waiting periods and a gun owner registry schools what is the appropriate role of charter schools within the chicago public schools system erika wozniak francis as a public school teacher i am firmly opposed to the operation and proliferation of charter schools i do support efforts of current charter school teachers to unionize should the chicago board of education be solely appointed by the mayor as is now the case or should chicago switch to an elected school board or some hybrid erika wozniak francis it is imperative that our school system join the other 99 of school boards in america in having an elected representative school board affordable housing is there enough affordable housing in your ward please explain erika wozniak francis homelessness is a serious issue in the 46th ward there are not enough options for those in need of economically diverse housing as mentioned above i support the housing for all and development for all ordinances it is essential that we require developers to provide a minimum percentage of affordable housing that is accessible and diverse in capacity immigration chicago by ordinance is an official welcoming city this means the chicago police are generally prohibited from detaining undocumented immigrants on behalf of federal immigration authorities what s your position on this policy what more or less should be done with respect to undocumented immigrants who live in chicago erika wozniak francis i support the welcoming cities ordinance but it must be expanded to remove the carve outs that continue to allow for cooperation between law enforcement and ice chicago calls itself a sanctuary city but in an age when the federal government is engaged in activity which targets immigrants and undocumented citizens we have not earned that title until we have taken all available legislative action to protect targeted communities ethics should the inspector general have the power to audit and review city council programs operations and committees why or why not erika wozniak francis yes an effective office of the inspector general is essential to an ethical government currently the chicago inspector general does not have full audit and subpoena powers over all aspects of the city council and it is indicative of the lack of transparency and accountability that is still prevalent in chicago politics if elected i will work to expand the duties and authority of the ig would you employ or have you employed staff in your office who have outside jobs or contracts with entities that do business with the city if so please explain erika wozniak francis no that would be a conflict of interest role model is there a past or current alderman whom you model yourself after or would model yourself after or take inspiration from please explain erika wozniak francis i take inspiration from susan sadlowski garza she is a the daughter of union activist edward sadlowski and union activism also goes back generations in my own family while being a school counselor at jane addams elementary school ald sadlowski garza went on to become the area vice president at the chicago teachers union i have also served 15 years as a delegate to the ctu sue personally told me that one reason she ran for alderman was because she wanted to have a bigger impact on children s lives this is also a primary reason why i am running for alderman there is not one teacher out of 50 alderman on the city council a teacher needs to have a seat at the table when it comes to making decisions about education and policy that will affect our families for generations to come
london chinese leaders do like their slogans and where foreign policy is concerned two have reflected beijing s thinking in recent times the first is the cautious principle of tao guang yang hui usually rendered in english as hide your light and bide your time which guided chinese policy for decades after deng xiaoping established it in the 1980s in late 2013 though president xi jinping coined a new slogan to define a more assertive muscular approach fen fa you wei or strive for achievement the drift toward a more assertive foreign policy under xi has been evident everywhere from china s declaration of an air defence identification zone over the east china sea in late 2013 to the creation of facts on the ground in the south china sea to the development of the belt and road initiative but recently there have been signs that china might be having second thoughts about its ability to keep striving for achievement xi s government seems clearly to have entered concession making mode in its relations with the united states and some prominent chinese academics have begun questioning whether china has been guilty of strategic overstretch for example yan xuetong a doyen of chinese foreign policy scholarship has recently argued that xi has gone too far and that china should limit its ambitions to a narrower regional sphere another beijing based expert shi yinhong calls for strategic retrenchment in chinese foreign policy an easy explanation for this chinese shift toward retrenchment is us president donald trump who has applied his own brand of assertiveness to the us china relationship with the apparent support of the entire american political class and much of europe s too confronted by pushback from the west china is unsurprisingly warier of pushing forward but china s current caution also owes much to the fragility of its economic performance as anyone who has recently travelled to beijing will tell you the sense of economic pessimism there has rarely been as tangible as it is now to a degree sagging chinese growth is a self induced problem since xi s declaration in 2017 that financial stability is a national security concern risk taking by local governments and the financial sector has generally been frowned upon because these actors have been the two main engines of china s growth in the past 10 years risk aversion among provincial officials and financiers has naturally sapped energy from the economy yet there is another under noticed source of china s economic fragility the capital account of its balance of payments since 2014 when china s foreign reserves began to fall from their 4 trillion peak to 3 trillion level today the authorities have been nervous about the damage excessive capital outflows might inflict on china s economic self confidence and global role in any emerging economy there is an important connection between the health of the capital account and that of the domestic economy if money is voting with its feet how can anyone expect domestic confidence to be strong furthermore the most important single driver of capital flows in and out of any emerging economy is the state of us monetary conditions loose us monetary policy in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis pushed capital toward china and other developing countries that is what helped reserves grow to 4 trillion in the first place the us federal reserve s fed quantitative easing made it profitable for chinese firms to borrow dollars and sent investors on a global quest for yield so money flowed to china conversely the progressive tightening of us monetary conditions over the past five years has undeniably helped to suck dollars away from china causing the country to lose reserves and self confidence this is partly because chinese companies tend to repay debt when the dollar is strengthening and the cost of servicing dollar liabilities goes up in addition foreign portfolio investors are less willing to buy chinese government bonds when the china us interest differential narrows as it has in recent months the main reason why reserves have not fallen below 3 trillion which would make chinese policymakers even more nervous is the network of controls on capital outflows introduced in late 2016 and early 2017 but the controls may not be completely watertight the history of capital flows tells us that when money wants to leave a country it will a fragile capital account and the economic self doubt it can create are hardly strong foundations for aggressive chinese foreign policy the next time trump feels like excoriating fed chairman jerome powell for tightening monetary policy too quickly he might pause to consider the role that higher us rates and a stronger dollar have played in taming china s self confidence a dovish fed is a gift to beijing david lubin is head of emerging markets economics at citi and an associate fellow at chatham house his book dance of the trillions developing countries and

when emmerson mnangagwa took over the leadership of zanu pf and became the head of state there was a perfectly choreographed plan to carve out his image as a reformer when emmerson mnangagwa took over the leadership of zanu pf and became the head of state there was a perfectly choreographed plan to carve out his image as a reformer by fidelity mhlanga he would be presented to us as a man with a tainted past but who had completely changed his ways and was willing to chart a different course from his predecessor and mentor for over half a century robert mugabe newspapers dedicated acres of space to tell us how pragmatic he was in his ways and that he had a sound understanding of how business works in his speeches he made all the right noises just exactly what the world wanted to hear from a new leader taking over a nation which had been condemned to the pits of hell for the three decades that it was under the despotic rule of mugabe mnangagwa waxed lyrical about how he would seek to reengage with the international community to help get zimbabwe back into the community of nations we will open up the economy we will fight corruption we will work with those we considered our foes we will compensate farmers whose land was appropriated by the state he said there was so much hope of new beginnings western envoys and those from the east tripped over each other to congratulate mnangagwa and as americans would say he had the whole world drinking his kool aid but today far less than a year since his election into office the re engagement drive has been thrown off rail and one can only wonder if mnangagwa was ever sincere about his pledges zimbabwe is once again in the news for the wrong reasons at the hands of the mnangagwa s dreaded security forces zimbabwe has degenerated into a typical failed state as armed soldiers go on a rampage killing raping and beating civilians the unfolding events followed similar horrors witnessed last august where six people were killed and hundreds assaulted and harassed by the security forces while government maintains that the world was opening to its open for business mantra the opposite is obtaining mnangagwa s administration has failed to inspire confidence among the international community and multilateral lenders who insist on tangible reforms before they can give economic support the commonwealth us government and the european union eu this week all condemned government s brutal crackdown on civilians while british parliamentarians proposed to throw out zimbabwe s request to re join the commonwealth zimbabwe desperately requires an urgent bailout to jump start its industry which is starved of capital and to address a currency crisis which has paralysed the economy the southern african country owes the world bank and the african development bank in the region of 2 billion and cannot access concessional lines of funding from any other international financial institution until it pays up these two by end of august 2018 the country s debt position stood at us 17 69 billion of which domestic debt accounted for 54 while external debt is 46 in contrast up north on the african continent ethiopia s abiy ahmed has instituted far reaching reforms that include pardoning of political prisoners including opposition leader andargachew tsege barely a year after assuming power in just a few months abiy has lifted the state of emergency ordered the release of thousands of prisoners allowed dissidents to return home and unblocked hundreds of websites and tv channels leader of the ruling ethiopian people s revolutionary democratic front coalition also terminated the state of war with eritrea by agreeing to give up disputed border territory in the process normalising relations with the long time enemy the 42 year old who took power following the surprise resignation of his predecessor haile mmariam dessalegn has so far reshuffled his cabinet fired a series of controversial and hitherto untouchable civil servants ethiopia will next year host the world economic forum a great opportunity for country branding tourism and investment promotion for the country former deputy assistant secretary of state for africa relations todd moss who served in the george w bush administration said the zimbabwe government needed to undertake major political reforms to extricate itself from the economic quagmire there is no solution to zimbabwe s economic crisis without solving the currency there is no solving the currency without a return of confidence there is no return of confidence without major political reforms moss said on microblogging twitter last week economist eddie cross told standard business that prospects of attracting foreign funding were dented by the instability of the past fortnight the short answer is no the first priority for foreign investors is political stability the second is policy consistency and the third is monetary policy and open markets at the present time zimbabwe offers none of the previous requirements and the events of the past 10 days have done nothing to alleviate these problems the instability in the past fortnight has made it much more difficult to raise foreign funding for any activity in zimbabwe lines of credit were already highly restrictive and they will only be more so now cross said steve hanke an american economist said there was no justification for the merciless brutalising of citizens at a time the country was enduring harsh economic conditions welcome to zimbabwe where there is no justification whatsoever of beating up citizens this is mnangagwa s zimbabwe to make matters worse i measure inflation for today at 219 per year zimbabwe s economy and citizens are suffering as they have for decades hanke said on twitter economist john robertson said investor confidence had reached its lowest and as such there was need to expedite the implementation of policy reforms to restore investor confidence confidence is certainly missing now but some good policy decisions that are carried through quickly could begin to restore confidence it will take time to become effective but that is why we should make an immediate start restore property rights repeal the indigenisation act stop the patronage handouts to senior political figures and stop the corruption they can do it if they want to robertson said not only is mnangagwa failing to tame the security forces interference in civilian matters but also he has displayed reluctance to walk the talk on the ease of doing business indigenisation law and repressive legislations such as the access to information and protection of privacy act and the public order and security act

cairo egypt has moved to lift subsidies on 95 octane petrol bringing it in line with international prices in a move to reform the country s fuel subsidy system we do not want the fuel subsidies to end up going to the rich said egyptian petroleum ministry spokesman hamdi abdel aziz we want the poor only to benefit from the subsidies egyptian prime minister mostafa madbouli earlier established a special panel to investigate fuel subsidies and tasked it with reviewing 95 octane petrol prices every three months egyptian petroleum minister tarek al mulla said changes to the price of petrol would be made by early april assuring the public that the increase on the current price would not exceed 10 this is the latest in a series of measures by egypt s financial planners to reduce the burden on the state budget from fuel subsidies cairo allocated approximately 5 billion for fuel subsidies in the 2018 19 budget which ends in june that was a 1 2 billion reduction from the subsidies in the 2017 18 budget nevertheless the subsidies create much pressure on the state budget which suffers a huge deficit this is why the decision to link the price of 95 octane petrol to international prices will remove considerable pressure on the state budget said mukhtar al sherif an economics professor at mansoura university the subsidies allocated to fuel should be channelled to more needy sectors such as the education and health sectors which benefit the poor more egypt sells three levels of petrol to motorists 95 octane 92 octane and 80 octane the 95 octane grade is the most expensive with 1 litre selling at 0 48 because of government subsidies this is almost 50 lower than fuel prices in the united states and europe egypt is among the countries including venezuela saudi arabia iran algeria and kuwait where the price of petrol is kept artificially low this reliance on subsidies analysts argue has proven debilitating to the national economy not just in terms of petrol but electricity and water prices as well egypt has been struggling to reduce its budget deficit keep production levels high and implement national infrastructure projects to attract investments the budget deficit for fiscal year 2017 18 was 9 8 the government hopes to reduce the deficit to 8 4 in the current fiscal year the panel formed by the prime minister includes representatives of the ministry of petroleum the ministry of finance and the state run egyptian general petroleum company indications are that the elimination of subsidies will only affect 95 octane which is primarily used by richer egyptians to fuel the most expensive cars the cut in 95 octane petrol subsidies is considered a test case to gauge public reaction for reductions that might affect for 92 octane and 80 octane petrol at some later time in june the government slashed subsidies on all petrol levels and diesel by 17 5 66 that was the third fuel subsidy cut since november 2016 when the economic reform programme started it included liberalisation of the egyptian pound the elimination of electricity water and fuel subsidies and the introduction of a value added tax these were all conditions to secure a 12 billion loan from the international monetary fund imf economists attribute the move to link the price of 95 octane petrol with international prices to conditions by the imf for egypt to eliminate fuel subsidies egypt is to receive its fifth tranche of the imf loan in the next few weeks central bank governor tarek amer said the 2 billion loan instalment had been scheduled for december but was postponed we re agreed on everything agreed with the mission on egypt s performance during this phase amer told bloomberg news the reform programme is on schedule and we are committed to completing it successfully we are committed to ensuring that the market is free and clears itself but at the same time we have reserves that help us to confront any speculators or disorderly market practices he added despite such reassurances egyptians who rely on fuel subsidies worry that they will be unable to afford fuel if egypt eliminates the system and links prices to the international market there is a need for linking salaries given local workers with international prices too said souad al deeb a consumer protection advocate almost everybody is suffering in silence in the hope that things will get better in the future

guaido as venezuela s official head of state in a swipe at leftist authoritarian president nicolas maduro whose political oppression and economic policies have created food shortages and a public health crisis before the administration made the decision to recognize the opposition the administration had more flexibility banks said now the stakes are a lot higher it has invested a tremendous amount of political capital other trump administration allies say it favors sanctioning oil because that would impose a crushing blow on maduro and perhaps deprive him of support from venezuela s powerful military which has so far stood by him european leaders are somewhat following the lead of the trump administration 26 january 2019 four european countries demanded fresh elections within eight days or they ll recognize venezuelan opposition leader juan guaido as president nicolas maduro is struggling to hold onto power in the crisis ridden country last night icg s mark armstrong put out the following as we are lectured every day about how unfair capitalism is and how we need a massive authoritarian government to confiscate assets the rich don t need and make sure everybody including tens of millions of illegal aliens can live in the dignified circumstances they deserve we re watching the final stages of the utopian socialist meltdown tear venezuela to shreds it didn t happen overnight a great many of those who ve been searching for morsels of nutrition from garbage heaps and those who ve fled to neighboring countries in the hope of survival probably supported the nationalization of the oil business the rubber business the large ranches and farms socialism is great for the lower classes until it s not it s also great for socialist leaders who live and rule in popularity and splendor while blowing through fortunes created by the productivity of others but it doesn t last governments squander and steal apparently it s real easy to spend what hasn t been earned until it s gone while the world s premier example of modern socialism venezuela is in utter and complete collapse economically socially and politically the news can barely be found the mainstream just isn t interested you ll have to look for it last summer president maduro admitted its socialist model failed venezuela s maduro admits socialist model has failed august 2 2018 venezuela s president nicolas maduro admitted that his socialist economic model has failed amid food and medicine shortages as well as a failing infrastructure highlighted by tuesday s power failure to 80 of caracas compounding matters is the imf s weimar topping hyperinflation forecast of 1 000 000 by year end and a gdp set to plummet 18 this year as the government continues to simply print money to in hopes of filling the void of what was once the country s economy the production models we ve tried so far have failed and the responsibility is ours mine and yours maduro told his ruling psuv party congress enough with the whining we need to produce with or without outside aggression with or without blockades we need to make venezuela an economic power no more whining i want solutions comrades no word on whether he took a bite of an empanada during his speech while his country starves on the maduro diet a phrase coined after venezuela s notorious food shortages gave rise to mass starvation across the country not even the donkeys are safe venezuela s industrial sector is operating at just 30 capacity as illustrated by the farming sector which now provides just a quarter of national consumption after providing 75 just a few years ago according to the national farmers federation this should all make for some interesting debate questions during the next us elections as democratic socialists have become the new face of the left just don t ask any questions about economics or logistics maduro said he will no longer blame the u s for his country s problems enough of whining maduro said you will not see me whining to myself i do not blame them anymore you do not see me whining in front of imperialism let them attacks us it is up to us whether to act with aggression or without aggression venezuela s economic decline began under former president hugo chavez a country that was once overflowing with revenue from its state run oil production saw those revenues sharply decline in the past decade as u s production increased and global prices fell under maduro the crisis worsened his government has nationalized cement and steel production and taken over operation of private businesses such as supermarket chains and others that provide basic services to its citizens but oil revenues still account for 96 percent of the country s revenues so as government fails to collect an adequate amount of money from its oil business it has failed to provide an adequate amount of services for its citizens due to hyperinflation the international monetary fund estimates venezuela s inflation rate will reach 1 million percent this year food shortages and high prices 93 percent of the population does not earn enough to buy food according to a 2017 study conducted in venezuela venezuelans have lost on average 20 pounds since the country s humanitarian crisis began in 2015 almost 1 million venezuelans have fled hunger and repression by migrating to neighboring colombia over the past two years another roughly 50 000 sought asylum in the united states roughly 800 venezuelan refugees cross the border into brazil every day venezuela s inflation rate is the highest ever recorded it even exceeded that of pre wwii germany yet in the usa we have seen a rise in people called democratic socialists the problems in venezuela have been known for some time venezuela is a woeful reminder that no country is so rich that it can t be driven into the ground by revolutionary socialism people are now literally starving about three quarters of the population lost weight last year in what once was the fourth richest country in the world on a per capita basis a country that has more oil reserves than saudi arabia is suffering shortages of basic supplies venezuela now totters on the brink of bankruptcy and civil war in the national catastrophe known as the bolivarian revolution runaway spending price controls nationalization of companies corruption and the end of the rule of law it s been a master class in how to destroy an economy the result is a sharp yearslong recession runaway inflation and unsustainable debt the suffering of ordinary people is staggering while the thieves and killers who are chavista officials have made off with hundreds of billions of dollars at this rate the economist calls the country s economic decline the steepest in modern latin american history there will be nothing left to steal any government in a democratic country that failed this spectacularly would have been relegated to the dustbin of history long ago maduro is getting around this problem by ending venezuela s democracy the goal of maduro s alleged constitutional reforms is to no longer have a constitution worthy of the name immediately after the vote his forces arrested two leading opposition figures in the dead of night video shows one of them antonio ledezma being taken away in his pajamas and another leopoldo lópez bundled into the back of a car it looks like what it truly was a pair of kidnappings denied the ordinary means of dissent via the press and elections the opposition has taken to the streets already more than 100 people have been killed in clashes over the past several months worse is yet to come 08 01 17 venezuela is crumbling and with it the left s idea of a perfect socialist system yet nicolás maduro refuses to realize this obvious fact and instead has resorted to political violence to silence his opposition as the economy crumbles the future of the oil industry venezuela once relied on has been called into question the devastation in venezuela has grown from a political crisis to both an economic and humanitarian one during a vote last month the venezuelan people were asked to select from a trusted list of allies in the governing party a group to rewrite the nation s constitution and maintain power in venezuela until their work is finished this would give maduro and his ruling party the authority to dissolve branches of government such as the legislature which is currently controlled by maduro s opposition party voters were not given the ability to reject the plan simply decide who they wanted on the council the list was so corrupt it included maduro s own wife while maduro boosted high voter turnout the election results have already been called into question opposition spokesman vicente bello criticized the lack of voter protection practices such as the fact that voters were not asked to give proper identification voters were only allowed to cast ballots in any of three different locations even a software company involved in setting up voting systems announced the turnout figure had been altered by at least one million votes while venezuela is clearly operating under an illegitimate democracy the situation only gets worse as maduro responds to opposition with force following the election two opposition leaders under house arrest antonio ledezma and leopoldo lópez posted videos to youtube urging venezuelans to protest the election results and called the newly formed council a fraud within days both individuals were imprisoned for making political statements the trump administration has quickly imposed additional sanctions on president maduro as a result trump hopes this encourages the release of all political prisoners held there but these two are not the only venezuelans suffering james kirchick explained in the la times that socialist economic policies price controls factory nationalizations government takeovers of food distribution and the like have real human costs eighty percent of venezuelan bakeries don t have flour eleven percent of children under 5 are malnourished infant mortality has increased by 30 percent and maternal mortality is up 66 percent more than 100 people have died in anti government demonstrations and thousands have been arrested economically venezuela cannot support its own people years of big government socialist policies have led to media crack downs over printing of money and a war on capitalism that the country can simply not win 08 03 17 venezuela has continued to fall apart and this has become more and more noticeable to many venezuela s oil wealth and geographic location had the potential for it to be one of the most prosperous countries in latin america despite drops in oil prices it still should be however various government policies have not served the people well and now government leaders are taking desperate measures to keep power eventually venezuela will one day align with the beast power that will arise in europe that too will not be good venezuela and the rest of the world needs the kingdom of god for the coming utopia watch also millennial utopia
when emmerson mnangagwa took over the leadership of zanu pf and became the head of state there was a perfectly choreographed plan to carve out his image as a reformer source what next for the reform agenda the standard january 27 2019 by kuda chideme fidelity mhlanga he would be presented to us as a man with a tainted past but who had completely changed his ways and was willing to chart a different course from his predecessor and mentor for over half a century robert mugabe newspapers dedicated acres of space to tell us how pragmatic he was in his ways and that he had a sound understanding of how business works in his speeches he made all the right noises just exactly what the world wanted to hear from a new leader taking over a nation which had been condemned to the pits of hell for the three decades that it was under the despotic rule of mugabe mnangagwa waxed lyrical about how he would seek to reengage with the international community to help get zimbabwe back into the community of nations we will open up the economy we will fight corruption we will work with those we considered our foes we will compensate farmers whose land was appropriated by the state he said there was so much hope of new beginnings western envoys and those from the east tripped over each other to congratulate mnangagwa and as americans would say he had the whole world drinking his kool aid but today far less than a year since his election into office the re engagement drive has been thrown off rail and one can only wonder if mnangagwa was ever sincere about his pledges zimbabwe is once again in the news for the wrong reasons at the hands of the mnangagwa s dreaded security forces zimbabwe has degenerated into a typical failed state as armed soldiers go on a rampage killing raping and beating civilians the unfolding events followed similar horrors witnessed last august where six people were killed and hundreds assaulted and harassed by the security forces while government maintains that the world was opening to its open for business mantra the opposite is obtaining mnangagwa s administration has failed to inspire confidence among the international community and multilateral lenders who insist on tangible reforms before they can give economic support the commonwealth us government and the european union eu this week all condemned government s brutal crackdown on civilians while british parliamentarians proposed to throw out zimbabwe s request to re join the commonwealth zimbabwe desperately requires an urgent bailout to jump start its industry which is starved of capital and to address a currency crisis which has paralysed the economy the southern african country owes the world bank and the african development bank in the region of 2 billion and cannot access concessional lines of funding from any other international financial institution until it pays up these two by end of august 2018 the country s debt position stood at us 17 69 billion of which domestic debt accounted for 54 while external debt is 46 in contrast up north on the african continent ethiopia s abiy ahmed has instituted far reaching reforms that include pardoning of political prisoners including opposition leader andargachew tsege barely a year after assuming power in just a few months abiy has lifted the state of emergency ordered the release of thousands of prisoners allowed dissidents to return home and unblocked hundreds of websites and tv channels leader of the ruling ethiopian people s revolutionary democratic front coalition also terminated the state of war with eritrea by agreeing to give up disputed border territory in the process normalising relations with the long time enemy the 42 year old who took power following the surprise resignation of his predecessor haile mmariam dessalegn has so far reshuffled his cabinet fired a series of controversial and hitherto untouchable civil servants ethiopia will next year host the world economic forum a great opportunity for country branding tourism and investment promotion for the country former deputy assistant secretary of state for africa relations todd moss who served in the george w bush administration said the zimbabwe government needed to undertake major political reforms to extricate itself from the economic quagmire there is no solution to zimbabwe s economic crisis without solving the currency there is no solving the currency without a return of confidence there is no return of confidence without major political reforms moss said on microblogging twitter last week economist eddie cross told standard business that prospects of attracting foreign funding were dented by the instability of the past fortnight the short answer is no the first priority for foreign investors is political stability the second is policy consistency and the third is monetary policy and open markets at the present time zimbabwe offers none of the previous requirements and the events of the past 10 days have done nothing to alleviate these problems the instability in the past fortnight has made it much more difficult to raise foreign funding for any activity in zimbabwe lines of credit were already highly restrictive and they will only be more so now cross said steve hanke an american economist said there was no justification for the merciless brutalising of citizens at a time the country was enduring harsh economic conditions welcome to zimbabwe where there is no justification whatsoever of beating up citizens this is mnangagwa s zimbabwe to make matters worse i measure inflation for today at 219 per year zimbabwe s economy and citizens are suffering as they have for decades hanke said on twitter economist john robertson said investor confidence had reached its lowest and as such there was need to expedite the implementation of policy reforms to restore investor confidence confidence is certainly missing now but some good policy decisions that are carried through quickly could begin to restore confidence it will take time to become effective but that is why we should make an immediate start restore property rights repeal the indigenisation act stop the patronage handouts to senior political figures and stop the corruption they can do it if they want to robertson said not only is mnangagwa failing to tame the security forces interference in civilian matters but also he has displayed reluctance to walk the talk on the ease of doing business indigenisation law and repressive legislations such as the access to information and protection of privacy act and the public order and security act
no fed hike this week but don t rule out more in 2019 economists washington the us federal reserve will hold its fire this week leaving interest rates untouched and letting markets calm down after a tumultuous end to 2018 how long will us central bank chief jerome powell and other policymakers remain patient about rate hikes coming off wall street s worst december since the great depression and amid mounting fears about the global economy fed policymakers are now unanimously hammering a single message they will be patient before pulling the trigger again fed chairman jerome powell is likely to stick to that script when he announces the federal open market committee s latest monetary policy decision on wednesday futures markets are wagering the central bank will actually stand pat for all of 2019 with a growing share betting the fed could even begin cutting interest rates as soon as next december maybe they should think again while a cold wind blew at the end of last year gathering conditions suggest the fed could feel compelled to raise the key lending rate as soon as the spring economists say i think the danger here now is that markets are now expecting nothing ian shepherdson of pantheon macroeconomics said in a presentation on monetary policy the fed could swing around on a dime once it becomes clear that the things that have scared them are no longer very scary the month long partial shutdown of the federal government the longest in history has been resolved with a provision agreement announced friday between the white house and congress but was already gnawing away at gdp had the closure which idled 800 000 federal workers continued through march it could have choked first quarter growth to zero chief white house economist kevin hassett said last week the fed also is flying blind to some extent because the shutdown halted the flow of economic data from the commerce department including crucial figures on housing trade consumption wages and inflation it could get some key reports next week as the government reopens while december saw blockbuster job creation and tame inflation it had a batch of very gloomy numbers too amid president donald trump s trade war with china the us manufacturing sector could be starting to crumble with the sector seeing its biggest one month drop in december since the global financial crisis the economy also saw weak orders for durable goods and disappointing income growth and a downward revision to third quarter growth included the biggest drop in exports in almost a decade meanwhile consumer sentiment which can help predict spending by ordinary americans hit a two year low add to this the contraction of the german and japanese economies and the slowest chinese growth in almost three decades not to mention wall street s nightmarish ride last month and investor dyspepsia becomes easy to understand pricing in zero hikes predicting recessions is very tricky and while a contraction seems unlikely economists say downside risks are mounting last month a recession probability indicator from the new york federal reserve bank put the odds of a downturn within a year at 11 5 the highest since the depths of the great recession in 2009 but fears of a us recession in 2019 may be overdone said kathy bostjancic chief us financial market economist at oxford economics the recent dip in consumer sentiment was to be expected given that the measures had been so high she noted oxford expects the fed raise rates twice this year with the first in may at the bank s third policy meeting of 2019 we don t think they re done tightening this cycle she said the fed needs to take some time to assess the landscape shepherdson agreed warning against counting on no fed moves this year pricing in zero is very dangerous he said business investment is likely to be sluggish this year but the labor market should tighten as unemployment continues to fall driving up wages that likely would pressure inflation while a host of other potential dangers to the economy either will be resolved or prove less threatening than they seemed the potential risks include the trade war with china and its slowing economy brexit the us housing market slump rising interest rates high corporate debt and a possible recession in manufacturing it s something of a mess in the first few months of the year but lift up your eyes and look to the horizon and not to the ground shepherdson said

the economic community of west african states ecowas plan to achieve single currency for the region by 2020 is no longer realistic said marcel okeke former chief economist group head research economic intelligence group zenith bank plc he spoke at the finance correspondents association of nigeria fican 2018 economic review and 2019 0utlook held in lagos at the weekend okeke who is now the lead consultant mascot consult limited said single currency for the region comes with some challenges and criteria that many of the members countries will not be able to meet news continues after this advertisement according to okeke the ecowas common currency has been on for many years and needs the member countries to attain key milestones for its successful takeoff it is not certain that it will happen in 2020 for instance a country like nigeria and other countries must not have inflation rates that are double digits they must not have exchange rates that move up and down so there must be stability in all those indicators across board as i stand with you many member countries have not attained this feat he said continuing he said there are pros and cons for its implementation you see some member countries of the euro zone are having serious economic problem which is robbing off on the rest of the members that is the type of challenge we might have in ecowas and i do not believe that the common currency plan will happen by years 2020 he added speaking on the banking system okeke said that banks do not operate in a vacuum but are product of the domestic economy where they do their business they are parts and parcel of the economy all these variables if the economy is doing well generally the banks will also be doing well on the other hand how well a bank does is also a function of creativity the truth is that even in an economy as bad as this some businesses are still doing well in the system and so a bank that is efficient no matter the odds in the system will keep on doing well he said continuing he said if you check and if one of us have one or two accounts or three you will notice that whatever you do with your phone there is a service charge those charges were not there years back it means those banks are becoming more creative and you cannot on the course of that decide to keep your money under your pillow in your house as long as you keep banking your money and they keep making those gains and adding them to their performance and balance sheet they will keep doing well according to okeke banks are also careful as to who to lend money to because of interest rates on loans the essence is that if the rates are high they will not be keen on lending to everyone that comes so that means that want to give money to borrowers with capacity to repay the loans in a nutshell those banks that have been doing well will keep doing well that means there will not be undue exposures to the banks i will say that the banks they are doing well to do well head or tail some of the banks are going into forced mergers and acquisitions but many other banks are still waxing stronger he stated speaking on the economy he said foreign exchange reserves in nigeria decreased to 41 99 billion in november from 42 13 billion in october of 2018 adding that the nigeria s external reserves inched up to 42 54 billion at the end of december the figures he said showed a decline by 5 25 billion compared with the 47 788 billion it was as at the end of june 2018 it stood at 43 28 billion as at january 21 2019 the combination of rising yields in advanced economies particularly in the united states coupled with growing concerns about the global economy due to the trade spat between the us and china have led to a reversal of capital flows in emerging markets elevated tensions in the political economy will further compound the concerns of foreign investors leading them to migrate to safe haven high quality assets in advanced economies he added speaking on inflation he said the annual inflation rate in nigeria fell to 11 26 per cent in october of 2018 from 11 28 percent in the previous month according to the national bureau of statistics nbs the headline index rose to 11 23 per cent year on year in august 2018 up from 11 14 recorded in july 2018 it has risen to 11 28 per cent in november and ended 2018 at 11 44 per cent the rise in the headline index is traceable to the persistent surge in food inflation index inflation rate stood at 15 37 per cent in january 2018 he stated news continues after this advertisement

public service management from depaul university campaign website mariafor49 org twitter mariafor49 facebook facebook com mariafor49 top priorities what are the top three priorities for your ward maria hadden my overarching goal is to promote community voice and transparency in government to better serve the people of chicago more specifically i want to work with my community to create an actionable plan to 1 foster development without displacement 2 champion our public schools to bring resources needed to help students thrive and 3 build a strong local economy supporting our local businesses recent civic work please tell us what you have done in the last two years to serve the city your neighborhood or a civic organization please be specific maria hadden over the past two years i have continued and expanded the work i have done to promote participatory budgeting and civic engagement in government in my neighborhood the city and across the country in chicago i ve been a leader in bring this inclusive government process from the 49th ward to other wards neighborhoods and high school classrooms in chicago through the pb chicago program outside of my professional work i have engaged with my community in a variety of ways i ve volunteered on the cook county commission on social innovation and served as the vice president of my co op board currently i serve on the boards of the byp100 action fund and voqal where i support fundraising efforts and engage with local organizations and members i worked with neighbors to raise 150 000 for a new health clinic at one of local elementary schools volunteered in community efforts to support immigrants being threatened by the current presidential administration organized community events in response to gun violence and sponsored and participated in a variety of our neighborhoods run festivals i m also a member of network 49 our ward s independent progressive political organization sun times 2019 chicago voting guide pensions chicago is on the hook for 42 billion in unfunded pension liabilities which works out to 35 000 for every household those pensions in the language of the illinois constitution shall not be diminished or impaired should the state constitution be amended to allow a reduction in pension benefits for current city employees or retirees how about reducing pension benefits for new employees please explain maria hadden absolutely not we made a commitment to these workers that we as a city have an obligation to keep backing down on those promises is not an option further we must maintain the same level of investment in current and future city employees the mismanagement of funds by prior city councils is not an excuse for not supporting working individuals we must be dedicated to generating new revenue streams so we can continue to invest in the people responsible for serving our communities public employees the 49th ward is home to many current and former public employees and i will fight on their behalf on this issue revenue of the following often proposed sources of new revenue for chicago which of the following do you favor and why a chicago casino legalized and taxed recreational marijuana a lasalle street tax a commuter tax a property tax increase a municipal sales tax increase a real estate transfer tax increase video gambling maria hadden we must promote progressive revenue streams that do not put the burden on working class families in chicago this looks like supporting the lasalle tax to increase money coming from the finance industry and lesson the burden individuals who generate goods and services this also includes legalizing and taxing recreational marijuana while the tax itself is not inherently progressive beginning to repair the damage that the war on drugs has caused on low income families especially brown and black families will be additional from this tax can be used for reinvestment in these communities the prospect of a casino video gambling and commuter taxes are not ideas i m excited about though i am willing to consider them given the scope of our revenue situation i would need to see comprehensive studies of how casinos impact the community members as well as the local economy increases in property taxes or sales taxes are also revenue sources that i would only consider if other more progressive revenue raising options were off the table both are regressive modes of taxation that will impact working families more than it effects wealthy individuals i would support a real estate transfer tax as was proposed by members of the progressive caucus what other sources of new revenue do you favor or oppose maria hadden i believe that in addition to the official roles related to the budget that city council serves aldermen also have a responsibility to use their power to lift up the voices of people in their community and advocate for them at all levels of government from conversations i ve had in the 49th ward i know individuals support a progressive income tax while this is only possible at the state level i will use my position to make sure their input is heard tifs tax increment financing districts are a primary economic development tool for chicago in a tif district taxes from the growth of property values are set aside for 23 years to be used to support public projects and private development what changes do you favor if any in chicago s tif program maria hadden tifs are used in most other places in our country without abuse or controversy however in chicago they are often mismanaged resulting in public funds going to subsidize developer costs for projects in areas that are not truly blighted we need to see a significant reform in how tif money is allocated before approving any new ones for example the back to basics tif ordinance would limit the use of tifs to redevelopment projects in areas that would truly be unable to move forward without tif support if a company or institution behind a project could afford it on their own they should not be getting a blank check from the city while this does not solve all problems and will need clear definitions of what does does not qualify committing to getting back to the main reason tifs exist to spur development in low income areas is a major step to fixing this problem another way we can reform the tif system is by allowing for the reallocation of dollars from tifs that have been filled to other development projects such as capital improvements in schools or building out our cities green infrastructure aldermanic power what will you do to rein in aldermanic prerogative maria hadden as with other areas i believe the community must be welcomed to take a leading role in decision making processes to ensure accountability and transparency i have spent the last decade fostering civic education and engagement around the city and around the county and i will bring those principles to city council so that the community can see and understand what is happening and hold me and my colleagues accountable police reform the city of chicago has entered into a federally monitored consent decree to overhaul the training and practices of the chicago police department civil libertarians say it is long overdue but others say it is unnecessary and could make it tougher for the police to do their job what s your view maria hadden i believe that the chicago police department is in desperate need of reform to increase accountability improve the ability of cpd to serve communities and build public trust while some important progressive ideas are included in the decree there is still a need to continue working with communities and experts to create meaningful change we need to start revamping training to include crisis intervention conflict de escalation and implicit bias to civilian oversight we need to make sure we are creating systems that protect and serve all chicagoans guns what should chicago do to reduce the number of illegal guns maria hadden people own guns to feel safe so while gun buyback programs offer great non confrontational opportunities to reduce the number of illegal guns for communities to fully participate in them we must reduce their perceived need to own them for protection to do so we must be investing in these communities if somebody has access to employment housing medical care and mental health services they are much more likely to feel secure and safe which reduces their perceived need to own an illegal gun by investing in schools job training affordable housing and other social services we can make this a reality we can not rely on the current practice of cpd being the only entity extracting guns from these individuals during altercations schools what is the appropriate role of charter schools within the chicago public schools system maria hadden our priority must be our neighborhood public schools in the 49th ward we have some incredible schools that the community has rallied behind to support despite being systematically underfunded the teachers staff and most importantly the students in my neighborhood and around the city deserve advocates on city council approving budgets that fully fund these schools this includes investing in capital improvements bringing in resources for special programming to boost enrollment and ensuring every school has a nurse and social worker on site everyday the people of the 49th ward have made this clear by voting overwhelmingly to support a freeze on charter expansion in the 2014 election i will make sure their voice is heard on city council while this is a major priority for me i understand that public charter schools also serve many students in our city and we need to make sure that their administrations are being held to the same standards to ensure all children have a chance to thrive should the chicago board of education be solely appointed by the mayor as is now the case or should chicago switch to an elected school board or some hybrid maria hadden during the large amount of time i spend going door to door when this issue comes up people agree we need to promote accountability and transparency in all aspects of city government so that communities know why decisions are being made one of the best ways to accomplish this level of public accountability in cps is to switch to an elected school board system if elected i will support legislation to establish this body affordable housing is there enough affordable housing in your ward please explain maria hadden the 49th ward is one of the few remaining affordable places to live on the northside of chicago however the ever expanding gap between wages and cost of living is an untenable situation and the city needs to act to address this issue while there have been a few recent success stories where our community has worked together to maintain affordable housing the status quo of reacting to every new proposal is not sustainable instead i want to work with my neighbors to develop a plan for what we want to see happen in the ward over the next 5 10 and even 50 years by being proactive and going to local developers and saying this is what we want need how can we work together to achieve this we can change this narrative to foster true development without displacement immigration chicago by ordinance is an official welcoming city this means the chicago police are generally prohibited from detaining undocumented immigrants on behalf of federal immigration authorities what s your position on this policy what more or less should be done with respect to undocumented immigrants who live in chicago maria hadden i fully support the welcoming city ordinance we must do everything in our power to protect and support undocumented immigrants who live in chicago i will fight alongside these individuals as well as with community organizations serving these individuals legal rights groups and other members of city council to strengthen how we build a city that works for for everybody specific to my ward i have seen some amazing community organizing around these issues already i look forward to lifting up the work of groups like protect rp in promoting a safe and accepting community for our undocumented neighbors ethics should the inspector general have the power to audit and review city council programs operations and committees why or why not maria hadden yes for too long the city of chicago has operated inefficiently and not transparently to the detriment of the people we serve just as departments need to be held accountable so do we i want to create a culture in the 49th ward where individuals are educated and empowered to hold me accountable to ensure i am fulfilling my promises and evolving over time to reflect the changing needs of my community in order to this residents need access to good trustworthy information would you employ or have you employed staff in your office who have outside jobs or contracts with entities that do business with the city if so please explain maria hadden no i am running as an independent progressive who will always put the concerns of my neighbors over the interests of outside interests and political insiders i will employ members of my community who will help me be as responsive as possible to all 49th ward residents to make sure everybody s concerns are heard and acted on this campaign is not accepting donations from developers or any entity that could compromise my ability to be the independent leader my community deserves role model is there a past or current alderman whom you model yourself after or would model yourself after or take inspiration from please explain maria hadden a past alderman i look up to and am thrilled to have the endorsement of is david orr as a former 49th ward alderman chicago mayor and cook county clerk david has been a leader in reforming government to work for everyday people living in my ward and around the city just as he did over forty years ago i am running as an independent candidate and just as he has done for the past 40 years i will work to improve the lives of people in the 49th ward and chicagoans across the city related also running for 49th ward alderman
by david haggith we are in the end time of an unprecedented era of financial expansion the greatest expansion of the world s money supply ever attempted expansion of the federal reserve s vast and unchecked powers far beyond what the fed could do before the financial crisis and super sizing expansion of banks that were already way too big to fail i am calling this time in which we are now unwinding this monetary expansion the great recovery rewind because i believe this attempt by the federal reserve and other central banks of the world to move us away from crisis banking is taking us right back into economic crisis that is why this was the top peril listed in my premier post 2019 economic headwinds look like storm of the century it is more potent in possible perils than all the trade tariffs in the world even the ceo of one of the fed s largest member banks says no one knows what devastating effects the fed s unwinding of its balance sheet will cause jp morgan chase s jamie dimon warned that the fed s unwind is a massive experiment as untried as the quantitative easing that is being unwound qe has never been done on this scale he said we cannot possibly know all of the effects of its reversal financial times jamie dimon the chairman and ceo of jpmorgan chase is one of many prominent figures in finance who warn that this reversal of direction could send stock prices plummeting and derail the u s economic expansion i don t want to scare the public but we ve never had qe we ve never had the reversal regulations are different monetary transmission is different governments have borrowed too much debt and people can panic when things change earlier this year noted bond fund manager bill gross expressed his own concerns about the effect of this unwinding last year former fed chairman alan greenspan warned of a massive bond market bubble that will be deflated in the process former u s treasury secretary lawrence summers says tightening involves real dangers and needs to be carried out with great care according to peter bockvar the chief investment officer cio of bleakley advisory group i believe the market is headed for a brick wall the deeper quantitative tightening gets ray dalio founder of hedge fund bridgewater associates observes that quantitative tightening is bound to produce effects entirely opposite to those from quantitative easing namely higher interest rates wider credit spreads and very volatile market conditions investopedia sounds like now even the fed prez himself uses language that casts the great recovery rewind as experimentation we are looking carefully at that and the truth is we don t know with any precision fed chairman jerome powell told reporters on wednesday really no one does you can t run experiments with one effect and not the other we re just going to have to be watching and learning and frankly we don t have to know today bloomberg that s reassuring however unprecedented the great recovery rewind is some outcomes can already be readily extrapolated and they are playing out as i thought they would the withering economic effects of the great recovery rewind rising reserve risks you may recall the fed pumped up its member bank reserves to make us all more secure in case of runs on banks as we almost saw during the financial crisis of 2007 2009 now as you ll see below the reserves in the accounts of member banks have been bleeding out faster than red ink in the last days of a failing ponzi scheme for those banks to drain their reserves the fed has to reduce its reserve requirements so the fed has to be involved in this great reserve flush it may be allowing this on the basis that it believes the world is more financially secure now so it thinks the concern about runs on banks is long gone but we all know from the last financial crisis that the world can become financially insecure in a small window of time while the scars from an economic crash can endure a lifetime this photo dated october 24th 1929 shows a view of people rushing to a saving bank in millbury massachusetts as the stock market on wall street crashed sparking a run on banks that spread across the country compounding us government debt one of the side effects of the fed sucking money out of the global monetary system is that the fed used to roll over its holdings in us treasuries by purchasing more at an incredibly low interest rate for the us government the government is now forced to sell a lot more treasuries in auctions to its primary dealers member banks in the federal reserve system without the fed backstopping that by sucking them all up that presses the government to either pay higher interest on its treasuries to attract new buyers or raise less money with each 1 000 bond it issues say sell a 1 000 bond for 945 instead of 950 either results in higher yields on government bonds see bond primer what is the difference between bond yield bond interest and bond price that accelerates the government debt vortex interest impact here s another side effect that justifies calling this time the great recovery rewind because government bonds are foundational in the credit market higher yields on government bonds result in higher interest on all kinds of things including home mortgages and auto loans on large items people shop payments so those items are now less affordable therefore housing collapse 2 0 and carmageddon rising interest is already taking us into another housing crisis and carmageddon i ve been writing about these as the first major industries that will get the impact of the fed s great recovery rewind my next article will show how deeply into a new housing crisis we have already fallen and we ve all heard about the number of automobile factories closing in the us i think there is an insidious way rising mortgage interest is taking down the housing market besides just making houses more expensive while mortgage applications are down by almost half due to rising interest an even more interesting development is that the percentage of applications that are getting approved is also down by about half with total applications being down you d think banks would be inclined toward approving a higher percentage of the apps they get so why are they approving a lower percentage from an already much smaller stack of applicants losing half of your applicants and then cutting the percentage of those that get accepted in half is a 75 drop in approved loans see business insider s americans stopped buying homes in 2018 mortgage lenders are getting crushed and an economic storm could be brewing here is what i think is happening banks don t usually issue loans to carry them until they are paid off they issue them to resell them to other banks and investors in terms of the loan resale market loans are somewhat like bonds in the same way that the bond you hold falls in resale value price when bond interest on other bonds is rising fixed interest loans a bank issues today will be worth less when it resells them in a month if interest rates are rising quickly who ll want to buy that loan when they can buy one that pays higher interest even if a bank plans to carry the loan itself it might think it makes more sense to wait another month or two to loan out its money at an eighth of a percent more interest for the next thirty years than to loan it out now if it is certain rates will rise that much in a short time or it might just want to use its money to buy and hold those risk free government bonds now that interest is getting interesting again a full rewind back into the housing market collapse that began in 2007 could be readily foreseen as an obvious effect of the fed s tightening because 1 tightening after a period of sloppy easing triggered the last collapse and 2 one of the reasons the fed gave for buying government treasuries was to reduce mortgage interest and other long term interest specifically to prop the housing market back up and stimulate the economy this is why i ve repeatedly maintained that when the props are pulled we ll fall back into the same recession it took total denial to believe doing the opposite would not have the opposite effect we have seen the opposite effect happening with long term interest ever since the fed began its balance sheet unwind falling back into the same pit by winding back what we did to get out of the pit is why i call this the great recovery rewind hence my prediction a couple years ago of a major stock market upset last january as began in the last week of january with a much worse one in the fall of 2018 when the fed would hit full recovery rewind speed o k i also said something big would happen in the summer with stocks and not much did except the defaanging of the high tech market that drove the bull market for a decade that s why i was so certain of the timing of these stock market s major plunges turns and of the summer start of a repeat crisis in housing and automobiles that certainly materialized stock drop this brings us to another inevitable side effect of the federal reserve s great recovery rewind loss of stock values think about it another one of the main reasons the fed eventually admitted for hoovering up government bonds was to save us from the 50 crash in stock values that happened between 2007 and 2009 it did this by taking interest so low on bonds that it pushed investors into riskier assets in order to make money in the process this created money in bank reserve accounts that banks could use to buy those riskier assets that worked naturally reversing that flow would raise bond interest and correspondingly suck money back from stocks by providing safer assets that are starting to provide a profitable return again how could it not we witnessed that throughout 2018 seeing each major increase in the fed s great recovery rewind speed immediately cause greater damage to stocks that is why i ve always maintained the fed cannot unwind without crashing its fake recovery fake in that it s not really a recovery if the patient has to stay on artificial life support forever it s just prolonged dying it s only true recovery when a patient becomes capable of living on his or her own another effect of all this of course has been the flattening of the yield curve which typically presages a recession as i wrote about in two recent articles titled does inverted yield curve indicate recession and what is an inverted yield curve and what does it mean we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us how could the federal reserve not see its great recovery rewinding when the fed merely suggested it would begin tapering its purchase of bonds quantitative easing in 2013 it created what became known as the taper tantrum a full scale financial panic that i remember well because the fed made this surprise announcement the day after my wife and i decided not to lock in the interest rate on our pending home purchase over the weekend we saw our new interest rate rocket upward so we locked in as fast as we could on monday and have forever paid a little more because of what felt like the fastest rise in mortgage rates even known to humankind stock prices plummeted then too as the 10 year treasury note soared a full 100 basis points to 3 yields the taper tantrum cost a lot of people a lot of money and that was just an announcement many months out that the fed would slowly begin to buy fewer additional treasuries not that it would start rolling back the actual number it already held the fed was very careful this time to telegraph its unwound intentions more slowly and sedately so far the fed s great recovery rewind has certainly not been as dull as watching paint dry as fed chair janet yellen assured us would be the case the crisis in stocks grew so severe so quickly last fall when the fed finally kicked its rewind up to it full projected speed that the federal reserve has already voiced possible capitulation to the market s fear by stating it is taking its balance sheet unwind off of autopilot after all fed chair jerome powell pivoted and said the fed will be monitoring the stock market with a more patient approach in the fed s deliberate raising of interest targets he s even hinted the fed may slow or pause its balance sheet unwind that contradicted his own auto pilot statement in the fall when the fed rose to full rewind velocity such an abrupt about face makes it clear the great recovery rewind sure ain t paint drying while flattening of the yield curve happens before recessions the recessions don t occur until right after the fed reverses policy and starts lowering interest rates again due to the problems a flat yield curve creates with talk already of reducing rewind velocity a move back to easing may not be far ahead i think the fed actually sees the recession coming but can never say so because its mere change of a pronoun reverberates throughout markets what would happen if it ever said it sees a recession developing why else would the fed start easing if it didn t see trouble coming by the time the fed returns to easing a recession is already foaming at the mouth so either they see it coming but lie and say they don t as ben burn the banky famously said in the summer of 2008 or they are blind in the area of their supposed expertise my reservations about reserves if the fed continues to tell banks they must hold a certain ratio in reserves to loans as the most liquid form of protection against runs then liquidity is going to tighten up if reserves fall and interest rates are going to rise due to shorter supply of loans that could also explain why banks are not approving as many loans because reserves are falling it appears that the federal reserve s member banks are buying up us treasuries with their reserves and holding them rather than reselling them because their excess reserves are depleting rapidly remember my comment above about how banks may not be issuing as many loans if treasuries with rising rates are looking attractive because they are seen as completely safe it also appears the fed is telling banks they have to maintain that ratio one reason why people may have underestimated bank demand for cash to meet the new rules is that fed supervisors have been quietly telling banks they need more of it according to william nelson chief economist at the clearing house association a banking industry group bloomberg the fed s great recovery rewind is reducing bank reserves as follows by shrinking its balance sheet the fed reduces the amount of reserves in the financial system therefore lowering the amount of money banks have to lend to consumers and businesses fxcm in a premium post that accompanies this post i contacted the federal reserve and got a direct explanation of how the unwind actually draws down member bank reserves i was never satisfied with the answer that they are just evaporating the money and they are not even without that complex explanation you can see how the balance sheet unwind is playing out in the following graphs from the federal reserve with the top graph showing the fed s own holdings and the bottom graph showing the reserves of all its member banks that are held in federal reserve banks first the federal reserve stopped quantitative easing flat part of the black and blue lines in the top graph which meant the fed stopped buying government treasuries black line and mortgage backed securities blue line from its member banks which it had been doing by creating deposits in the banks reserve accounts that they could lend against then you can see how as the fed began unwinding its balance sheet were the black and blue lines in the top graph begin to fall bank reserves red line plunged more finally you can see how bank reserves red line in the bottom graph have declined by almost half already during this time although janet yellen recently reminded us that correlation is not causation i can tell you that my correspondence with a fed economist in the premium post says there is direct correlation to what is happening in bank reserves what i cannot prove is motive but i believe the fed encouraged banks to start reducing their balance sheets in order to provide liquidity to the stock market and other markets during its tapering from qe and now during its final runoff of bonds the member banks may even be holding government treasuries to protect the government from rising interest rates just as the fed did the consumption of bank reserves looks to me like a massive buffer for the government and the economy as trillions flow out of bank reserve accounts and into sopping up treasuries the fed s largest member banks are the primary dealers for fed treasuries which they buy in auctions they transfer money from their reserves to the government treasury when they buy those treasuries now that the federal reserve is no longer buying those treasuries back from banks by creating new money in the bank s reserves their reserves are dropping whether it is because the banks are choosing to hold the treasuries for the interest or because they cannot resell them all or because they are putting the money they make from selling treasuries to other uses the bottom line is their reserves are plummeting in step with the federal reserve s great recovery rewind the fed has told me it deletes money from the government s bank account as treasuries mature because the fed is the government s banker so the fed loses its treasury asset in the roll off but it also wipes out an equal liability in the government s reserve account as its payment from the government thus both sides of the fed s balance sheet come down the same amount in order for the sheet to balance deposit money is considered a liability by banks because they have to give that money back upon demand that however would not deplete the nation s money supply except that the government has to replenish its bank account or build it up in advance of the fed writing it down which it does by selling new treasuries to the fed s member banks that are the government s treasury dealers those banks transfer money from their reserves to the government s account at the fed to pay for their treasuries i suspect the member banks purchases of the new treasuries the government has to issue to replenish its funds have been the mitigating factor that has kept government bond interest from soaring during the roll off by providing a market as ready and large as the fed itself however if they buy and hold the treasuries it depletes their reserves which means they have less money to loan against in the general marketplace that would be how money exits the monetary system alternately they may buy and resell the treasuries but not put the money from their treasury sales back into their reserve accounts because they now have better investments than the interest the fed pays them on their excess reserves excess reserves meaning those that are above what their liquidity coverage ratio is requiring of them either way the money from all those treasury sales the government is making is not going back into the the member banks reserve accounts if the banks don t soak up those treasuries by holding them as their own assets they resell them on the open market that would likely drive the government s financing costs up in order to find enough buyers that can happen in the form of higher interest on the open market or a lower bond price as described above that would feed back through the system to what the primary dealer banks will expect in government auctions in order to assure a retail profit on the treasuries while i don t have all the facts about what banks are doing internally it is obvious from the graphs above that the monetary is tightening up in direct correspondence with the termination of qe and its unwinding we know banks are approving a smaller percentage of a smaller pile of loan applications and we know their reserves have plummeted which means they have less money to loan against and could easily explain why they are approving far fewer loans we are seeing declines in housing prices declines in the auto industry leading to closing factories increases in the government debt due to rising interest in addition to the increases that happened due to declining revenue and the increases that are due to rising spending the rise in interest that is happening due the fed s great recovery rewind will also mean a decrease in stock buybacks just as the extra cash from the trump tax cuts repatriation a one time occurrence in 2018 is used up so that corporations have to return funding buybacks with credit if they re going to do them stock buybacks have been one of the leading drivers in the stock market s climb over the past decade so all of this is a complex and toxic brew of chemical reactions some have opined that the federal reserve s great recovery rewind will not be as potent as its initial easing because it created new money at the rate of 80 billion a month and is only backing out of that at the rate of 50 billion a month however it could actually become more intense consider that the fed was creating 80 billion a year when the economy was shrinking and needed a push so it was pushing against the drainage now the fed is subtracting 50 billion a year just as the economy has started shrinking again and still needs a push so the unwind pulling things down with the drain the fed is also tightening as global trade is tightening and as tariffs are going up making things more expensive to consumers it s also doing something that makes a lot of people feel unsettled rather than something that makes them feel happier no one is likely to enjoy unwinding as much as they enjoyed economic stimulus the fed is unwinding in an unforgiving environment that might be more reactive to withdrawal than a stifled economy is to stimulus for premier post patrons who want to drill deeper into the great recovery rewind here is some deeper content that explains how the great recovery rewind works how it impacts interest rates and how it may be monetizing the us government debt liked it take a second to support

in the early hours of thursday 10th january 2019 corneille nangaa head of the democratic republic of congo s electoral management body ceni announced the opposition party candidate mr felix tshilombo tshisekedi winner of the december 30th 2018 presidential election tshisekedi of the union for democracy and social progress party udps defeated his two other major rivals martin fayulu and emmanuel ramazani shadary the announcement of the election results came after a long wait orchestrated by delays in the collation of results from different parts of the country tshisekedi received over 7 million representing 38 57 percent of the 18 million vote cast while fayulu and shadary got 6 4 and 4 4 million votes cast respectively the jubilation that accompanied the announcement was a clear demonstration of how congolese had yearned for free and fair election with over 5 billion dollars expended in the conduct of this election the congolese and indeed the international community have genuine reasons to celebrate however the new president mr felix tshisekedi his party men supporters and fellow citizens must know that it is not yet uhuru as there are daunting tasks ahead which must urgently be addressed if the people are to represent the dividends of democracy but what exactly are these tasks and how can the new president overcome the tasks ahead how can the international community and development partners help in the promotion of development and democratic consolidation in a post joseph kabila congo how and what exactly will congolese citizens at home and in diaspora contribute towards the task of nation building under president felix tshisekedi president felix tshisekedi must understand that the task of development and democratic consolidation in drc requires a collective effort of all and sundry irrespective of party or ethnic affiliations consequently he should endeavour to extend a hand of fellowship to all those who lost in the just concluded election the two major political rivals martin fayulu and emmmanuel ramazani shadary must be persuaded and made to see the need for unity and political stability in congo beyond party affairs over the years the democratic republic of congo has witnessed outbreaks of devastating conflicts in different parts of the country the conflicts take the forms of communal ethnic political and economic dimensions protracted conflicts continue to undermine and even reserve the paltry democratic and development gains recorded in regions like kasai lumumbashi and northern kivu current reports show that over 2 3 million persons are internally displaced in the drc while the united nations has 21 000 men on peacekeeping mission in the country these internally displaced persons are facing enormous challenges such as insecurity psychological pain sexual assaults hunger many children in idp camps lack access to education and suffer from malnutrition president tshisekedi must endeavour to restore lost hopes in the minds of many congolese who have suffered from the debilitating consequences of conflicts in this regard the new president should take the bull by the horns and initiate rapid pragmatic and sustainable conflict management strategies that will address urgently the root causes of the protracted conflicts in drc more importantly the new government of tshisekedi must intensify efforts to urgently address the rising cases of hunger and poverty the current situation whereby over seventy per cent of congolese lack access to quality accessible and affordable food is unacceptable the new president and his cabinet should strive towards the modernization of agriculture through the use of new technologies and trained extension workers rural farmers should be empowered and trained on contemporary farming techniques that will result in high agricultural productivity as a corollary to agricultural transformation the provision of basic infrastructure such as electricity pipe borne water good road networks clinics and schools must be prioritized if liberal democracy is to make sense to the common man in a post kabila drc combating the challenge of human poverty in contemporary drc is equally a herculean task before the new government of felix tshisekedi the 2016 united nations human development index hdi ranked drc as the 176th least developed country out of 186 countries the figure further shows that about eighty per cent of congolese are living on less than one united states dollar per day this dismal performance is lamentable considering the fact that drc is one of the most natural resource endowed countries in the world with mineral resources valued at over 24 trillion united states dollars corruption is unarguably one of the major threats to the development of drc and by extension other african countries corruption manifests in almost the same form across africa it involves the abuse of public trust for personal or group interest the new president of drc

trade talks between china and the united states resume this week but there is little chance of a consensus being reached as the two sides remain far apart and any significant concessions by china would ultimately be counterproductive meanwhile it was revealed the plunge in a chinese real estate stock was due to a margin call on stock used as collateral by the largest shareholder but more importantly there are quite a few mainland enterprises facing a financial crunch or their major shareholders with financial problems therefore price falls such as these will continue pop up because of share cuts of course the central government can ease the market s debt and liquidity pressure through monetary policy and other means but what is most confusing that china s economic growth is still regarded as the best among world s major economies when one analyses official figures if this is so china should be attracting more capital into its domestic market but why do we keeping hearing about a lot of rich chinese who want to transfer their money abroad is it because overseas investment is more attractive or because the rich feel their money is not secure in china large enterprises and rich people in the united states are making huge investments overseas and setting up production factories across emerging markets in asia with the goal of reducing production costs rather than fully transferring their assets even though taxes in the united states are hefty and complicated making these companies open accounts in some offshore areas to avoid taxes they have no intention of moving all their wealth out of the united states they are not to giving up their nationality either but some of china s richest seems to have a different view on how to allocate assets though the a shares market attracted a large amount of foreign investment last year it failed to stem the flow of money from china to overseas markets and this trend has caused the problem that much of china s local government revenues are far lower than government spending of course it has a lot to do with china s infrastructure spending to keep a level over 6 percent of economic growth but it also has much to do with china s richest not wanting to keep their assets in the country it was recently reported that four chinese businessmen had over us 17 billion hk 132 billion of wealth transferred to family trusts in the hope that this would protect their fortunes as china s toughens its tax regime and while the united states has 160 million taxpayers accounting for 51 percent of its total population the number of chinese taxpayers account for about a mere 5 per cent of the population what concept is that if china s rich only want to benefit when economic growth is good without giving back anything to society china s economy will be very weak but it is not easy to reverse this situation because on political cultural and other factors and this is why it is so difficult to comprehensively reform china s economic structure that is also a key factor as to whether china s economy will have a hard landing in the next five years andrew wong is an independent commentator
wheat the wheat market experienced buying interest to kick off the holiday shortened week the big market mover was rumors of china potentially purchasing 7 million metric tons of u s wheat keep in mind that 8 million metric tons is just under 300 million bushels or three fourths of the total u s spring wheat crop the current cold snap gripping the u s and fears of winterkill across the southern plains also provided underlying support the second big piece of information from the three day weekend was that russian wheat prices increased and their internal milling margins have narrowed due to declining supplies from the rapid export pace russian wheat prices are at four year highs there was a report that the russian ag ministry decided to regulate grain prices by using rail subsidies from the interior of the country last month trade had taken the rail subsidy news as a means to increase exports but this seems to make more sense if millers are not getting the supply in any event it does confirm the months long thought that u s exports will likely pick up in the second half of the year as russian exports should start to taper off weekly export inspections were in line with expectations at 517 000 metric tons but one of the primary takeaways was that egypt did take u s wheat which is a positive a private analyst thinks that the u s department of agriculture will need to revise australian wheat exports lower by 1 million metric tons due to their high internal prices another private analyst thinks u s winter wheat acreage needs to be reduced between 500 000 to 1 million acres due to the wet fall the market still awaits a lot of information including export sales for the past month and actual planted winter wheat acres from this fall we also are awaiting in state winter crop ratings from kansas oklahoma colorado and texas which could give the market some direction the u s drought monitor shows no concerns for the major winter wheat growing areas compared to last year at this time so it s likely that ratings will be high to start off the year advertisement most eyes are on the chicago march contract and the critical 5 245 mark which is viewed as a major technical hurdle the market experienced one close above that level this week but failed to get a second close above that level for the week ending jan 24 march contracts for minneapolis wheat were up 2 cents at 5 7625 up 3 75 cents at 5 215 for chicago wheat and up 5 5 cents at 5 115 for kansas city wheat corn corn futures continue to trade in a narrow range as the market awaits news from china us negotiations jan 30 31 the market also awaits the release of the january crop report which has been delayed with the government shutdown demand news and south american weather were two things that gave the market some direction this week demand news continues to be supportive it was reported that chinese corn imports were up nearly 25 percent from last year the highest since 2015 china imported 420 000 metric tons of corn in december weekly u s export inspections were a solid 1 108 million metric tons 43 6 million bushels which was slightly above trade expectations cumulative exports of 810 1 million bushels are running 61 percent ahead of a year ago s pace taiwan purchased 65 000 metric tons of corn from argentina for 210 50 per metric ton u s and brazil prices were 212 19 supply news remains focused on south american weather early week forecasts were calling for continued dryness in central and southern brazil and increased chances for precipitation in argentina which was more price friendly however revised forecasts on jan 24 showed increased chances for rain in the drier regions of brazil and less chances of rain in argentina s saturated areas this gave the market a more negative tone on the jan 24 close brazil s first corn harvest is just starting harvest is 4 percent complete which is right at the last average of the last two years brazil second corn crop planting is underway showing 12 percent planted compared to 2 percent last year and 8 percent in 2017 argentina corn planting is 91 percent compared to 88 percent for the five year average ethanol production for the week ending jan 18 was 7 217 million barrels this is down 1 9 percent from last week and down 2 92 percent from last year ethanol production for the last 10 week period is down 2 5 percent from last year s pace it is becoming increasingly apparent that the 5 6 billion bushel corn for ethanol number will need to be revised downward in upcoming usda reports a 2 5 percent reduction would equate to roughly 300 million bushels ethanol stocks as of jan 18 were 23 501 million barrels this is up 0 64 percent from last week and up 1 26 percent versus last year ethanol stocks remain historically high despite declining production u s gasoline demand last week of 8 868 million barrels per day was up 2 percent from the same week last year and was the only weekly increase in the past eight weeks advertisement crude oil stocks increased 7 97 million barrels to 445 03 million bushels while trade was expecting no increase gasoline stocks rose to 259 62 million gallons which was 2 million higher than trade expectations despite this crude oil futures were 1 percent higher in jan 24 trade soybeans soybeans are still looking for a direction as they traded on both sides of unchanged during the holiday shortened trading week rumors continue to fly regarding us china trade talks soybean futures were under pressure early in the week after the white house announced that it rejected an offer for two chinese vice ministers to travel to the u s this week for preparatory trade talks president donald trump rejected the offer because of a lack of progress on two key issues forced technology transfers and potentially far reaching structural reforms to china s economy this is not expected to affect the jan 30 31 talks when the big guns from both sides are expected to face off one thing to keep an eye on is beijing threatening the u s if it proceeds with plan to extradite huawei s cfo for violating the iran trade embargo central brazil weekend rains fell short of expectations leaving one third of brazil in dry conditions only 6 percent of brazil s soybeans are harvested as of this weekend so actual yields are still scarce but the ones that have been reported have been below expectations private analyst cordonnier lowered his brazil production estimate 1 million metric tons to 115 million metric tons with a lower bias weather forecasts for the next week are starting to switch more favorable for south american weather rain is expected to cover a larger area in brazil minus mato grosso and heavy rains are shifting further south in argentina a lack of usda reports and news is wearing on traders as they would rather trade hard data rather than rumors this is the main reason for the choppy but range bound trade current support for the march contract is 8 77 resistance is 9 1825 and then the five month high of 9 4175 march soybeans are up 0 75 cents for the week ending jan 24 canola for the week ending jan 24 march canola futures were up 2 80

the tourism sector in egypt suffered a downturn since the 2011 revolution and the sector in egypt suffered a devastating blow especially when a russian passenger plane crashed in sinai in late october 2015 and all its passengers were killed notably following the plane crash russia imposed a travel ban on egypt while the uk suspended all flights to sharm el sheikh amid concerns over the airport s security measures banning travel to sinai meanwhile since 2018 the sector began to revive again regaining its position once more as egypt is a country strategically located on both the mediterranean and red seas with incredible gorgeous sandy beaches astonishing landscapes a warm winter climate and undoubtedly the world s largest collection of historical sites temples pyramids and artefacts thus earlier minister of tourism rania al mashat said earlier that the number of tourists to egypt increased by 40 during the first nine months of 2018 9m18 compared to the same period last year furthermore an overwhelming majority of tourism experts are projecting that 2019 is the year of opportunities for the tourism sector thus daily news egypt dne was eager to learn from the minister of tourism rania al mashat about the ministry s upcoming plans notably the minister stated during the 2019 world economic forum s annual meeting in davos that 2018 was one of the strongest years for egypt s tourism asserting that the ministry aims to further boost the sector during 2019 al mashat told dne that the ministry s vision is based on reaching a sustainable tourism sector through implementing structural reforms which will strengthen the sector s competitiveness and are with international standards my ultimate objective as the minister of tourism is to eventually have at least one individual from each egyptian household working either directly or indirectly in the tourism sector she added in terms of the government s plans which aim to develop the tourism sector the minister noted that there is a structural reform programme which includes different pillars such as institutional reforms legislative reforms promotion and marketing activities infrastructural and

capacity of 89 993 hotel rooms to a total of 238 114 rooms by completing the ongoing construction of 55 121 rooms in touristic areas as well as fostering the construction of additional 183 000 rooms subject to the supervision of the ministry s tourism development authority tda she further elaborated in addition to enhancing the existing infrastructure in the tda s touristic areas to include 168 water desalination stations with capacity of 222 516 cubic metres per day 226 sewage treatment stations 508 electric generators and stations with a capacity of 380 2mw 478km of road network as well as technical and financial support for urban touristic destinations in governorates which are excluded from the tda s jurisdiction in order to create new job opportunities moreover al mashat pointed out that the ministry is planning to set a strategy for sustainable tourism development to extend until 2030 which aims to diversify egypt s tourism product increase the number of tourists nights in the country as well as create direct and indirect employment with the community s integration discussing egypt s touristic base the minister declared that the ministry aims to diversify the revenue streams and increase the sector s resilience by attracting new markets she explained that this could be achieved through increasing promotional efforts in new source markets including asia particularly china east europe especially ukraine and latin america this could be carried out through organising workshops with arab states particularly countries of the gulf cooperation council in order to determine the most effective promotion tools in addition to participating in national and international conferences to promote egypt as an attractive and an all year long touristic destination she revealed that during the period from january to october 2018 european tourists represented 61 of the total number of tourists who visited egypt during that period while tourists from the middle east represented 21 68 africa only 7 15 asia with 5 62 and america with 3 94 while other countries represented only 0 61 furthermore the minister stated we are also seeking to launch a people to people p2p campaign which will portray egypt not only as a prime touristic destination but will also shed light on the diversity of the egyptian people by showcasing egyptians who master various disciplines to include art sports music and culinary activities the p2p intends to shift tourists perception on the one hand and encourages community engagement on the other hand al mashat explained she ensured that sustainable tourism is not just about places but is also about the people and communities living in those locations the ministry is also looking forward toward promoting the opening of the grand egyptian museum one of the largest museums in the world moreover al mashat stated that the ministry seeks also to adopt modern digital and competitive promotion approaches through branding by destination creating an identity for each of egypt s tourism destinations in addition to launching new campaigns in order to showcase egypt s contemporary dimension she also assured that utilising the ministry s presence at international travel exhibitions in order to employ its full promotional potential while focusing on quality not quantity is very important our goal is to improve and elevate the skillset of the tourism sector s workforce through different procedures such as cooperating with the private sector technical and vocational education training reaching out to donors and supporting civil society organisations in order to conduct training courses to improve employee skills and also through rehabilitating and restructuring the ministry s training centres she declared moreover al mashat continued this is in addition to building a pool of accredited trainers and specialists in the various tourism fields developing and updating the training programmes according to the latest international standards and establishing a unified accreditation system in order to ensure a streamlined standard of qualification for the entire workforce which will be issued by the ministry likewise the minster explained that her ministry also plans to ensure that the quantity of the workforce and its quality meet the labour market s needs by implementing a plan to enhance the graduates of hotel and tourism faculties qualifications in order to meet the sector s requirements over and above al mashat stated that the sector will also be enhanced through developing specialised technical training programmes for graduates and job seekers in various tourism fields setting criteria for job admissions in cooperation with the responsible chamber conducting comprehensive assessments of the ministry s staff training needs as well as developing programmes in order to enhance the employees soft skills moreover we seek to redefine our partnerships with the various intergovernmental organisations and foreign developmental agencies in order to work toward achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs through identifying crosscutting areas regarding the sdgs and tourism and by identifying national partner ministries to cooperate with on various sustainable tourism projects in addition to pinpointing international partners to collaborate with implementing sustainable tourism projects as well as establish a sustainable tourism unit within the ministry she noted similarly al mashat stated that the government seeks to integrate the local community and enhance their development especially those who live around egyptian cultural heritage sites in collaboration with international donors through implementing a usaid project on sustainable investment in tourism in egypt which aims to link cultural heritage assets to tourism developmental activities and to improve the skills of workers in collaboration with the ministry of antiquities this is in addition to building connections between cultural heritage sites and the surrounding communities in order to provide incentives for the local inhabitants to protect and preserve the sites moreover the project aims to protect and restore cultural heritage sites from damage caused by ground water intrusion and to produce sustainable site management plans for cultural heritage sites in collaboration with the ministry of antiquities she further explained the ministry wants to ensure that existing international grants are utilised effectively in order to meet the ministry s vision through monitoring all the grants provided to the ministry by the various donors reviewing all the bilateral agreements to ensure their effective utilisation and through exploring cooperation opportunities with new donors to make use of foreign expertise she elaborated plus al mashat revealed our plan also includes liaising and supervising the hajj and umrah in order to ensure the successful completion of each season commenting on the private equity fund the minster explained that it aims to restructure financially impaired hotels and other tourism establishments through establishing a hotel development fund in order to provide them with capital which enables the ministry to conduct the necessary investments the ministry is also coordinating with experts in order to

organization please be specific andrew rowlas as chair of the west ridge community organizations i initiated the re establishment of the warren park advisory council i worked with the learn committee to get anew library facility for our community i am working on engaging local artists and others to form a pan cultural community arts center sun times 2019 chicago voting guide pensions chicago is on the hook for 42 billion in unfunded pension liabilities which works out to 35 000 for every household those pensions in the language of the illinois constitution shall not be diminished or impaired should the state constitution be amended to allow a reduction in pension benefits for current city employees or retirees how about reducing pension benefits for new employees please explain andrew rowlas politicians have not fulfilled their duties to assure that these obligations are made they have kicked the can down the road and we can t do this anymore there are revenue sources which the state has not sought and this is a political decision illinois has the fifth largest economy in the u s and the twentieth largest economy in the world i do not favor amending the state constitution to address this problem revenue of the following often proposed sources of new revenue for chicago which of the following do you favor and why a chicago casino legalized and taxed recreational marijuana a lasalle street tax a commuter tax a property tax increase a municipal sales tax increase a real estate transfer tax increase video gambling andrew rowlas i favor the lssalle street transaction tax as a source of new revenues the average transaction on the mercantile exchange is about 220 000 00 adding a dollar to each the seller and the buyer is a miniscule amount but taking into consideration the volume of sales can amount to millions of dollars in new revenues what other sources of new revenue do you favor or oppose andrew rowlas i favor adding a 1 extra sales tax on houses that sell for 750 000 00 and more this extra revenue can be used to subsidize affordable housing and housing for homeless i also favor the implementation of a graduated income tax for the state and like nyc a smaller version for household incomes above a set amount e g 250 000 00 too many of our sources of revenue for the city are regressive and fall unfairly upon the working and middle class families tifs tax increment financing districts are a primary economic development tool for chicago in a tif district taxes from the growth of property values are set aside for 23 years to be used to support public projects and private development what changes do you favor if any in chicago s tif program andrew rowlas tifs should be used solely for the purpose which they were originally designed helping blighted neighborhoods develop sustaining businesses and services to help the people in these neighborhoods tifs have become a political liability and reform will be difficult because of the benefits which politicians have been able to extract from them aldermanic power what will you do to rein in aldermanic prerogative andrew rowlas first i would limit aldermanic terms in office to three terms i would also limit the chairmanship of committees to one term for each alderman i would not limit the scope of the i g to investigate aldermanic practices when there is cause for concern i think regarding zoning and development issues that each ward should have inclusionary zoning committees that look at short and long term needs of the common good to determine such policies police reform the city of chicago has entered into a federally monitored consent decree to overhaul the training and practices of the chicago police department civil libertarians say it is long overdue but others say it is unnecessary and could make it tougher for the police to do their job what s your view andrew rowlas i favor this consent decree i favor the cpac plan for police reviews though the gapa plan is good too i believe that mutual trust between the police and the community needs to be re established and this is a good starting place guns what should chicago do to reduce the number of illegal guns andrew rowlas i am not sure illegal guns are being bought outside of chicago and illinois and brought in i need to study this issue more on another issue of gun use i favor background checks licensing procedures that require gun safety and usage tests as a driver i have to do this and outlawing guns that have military capabilities other than for hunting or safety schools what is the appropriate role of charter schools within the chicago public schools system andrew rowlas i am against charter schools they have taken needed resources away from public schools and have become an excuse to blame public schools as poor performers one argument used to favor charter schools is that they can be innovators this is a poor excuse because we need to find ways for public school educators to be encouraged and rewarded to be more innovative should the chicago board of education be solely appointed by the mayor as is now the case or should chicago switch to an elected school board or some hybrid andrew rowlas chicago should have a fully elected representative school board cps is the only school system in the illinois which does not have this in place affordable housing is there enough affordable housing in your ward please explain andrew rowlas i believe that there is not enough affordable housing in my ward when i was gathering signatures for my petition many persons mentioned this as a concern of theirs this is not an issue only for low income families as i heard from middle income families this concern as well people are worried about gentrification and how this could possibly drive up the costs of their own housing unduly immigration chicago by ordinance is an official welcoming city this means the chicago police are generally prohibited from detaining undocumented immigrants on behalf of federal immigration authorities what s your position on this policy what more or less should be done with respect to undocumented immigrants who live in chicago andrew rowlas i agree with this policy especially in today s political climate which scapegoats immigrants our economy depends upon immigrants who more than contribute to our society we could help undocumented immigrants better by providing them with necessary legal and social support programs to become citizens ethics should the inspector general have the power to audit and review city council programs operations and committees why or why not andrew rowlas i favor giving the i a this power an independent inspector general can serve a great purpose in re establishing ethics and proper behavior in our city government there needs to oversight to assure the public that the chicago way of doing business can be transparent accountable and responsible would you employ or have you employed staff in your office who have outside jobs or contracts with entities that do business with the city if so please explain andrew rowlas i have no office staff at this time i would not want there to be conflicts of interests in doing the people s business and promoting the common good role model is there a past or current alderman whom you model yourself after or would model yourself after or take inspiration from please explain andrew rowlas i really like two current aldermen john arena and scott wauguespack these two gentlemen are accessible to their constituents work overtime

violent crime through youth engagement and 3 the need to fill our empty commercial spaces through an inclusive economic development strategy recent civic work please tell us what you have done in the last two years to serve the city your neighborhood or a civic organization please be specific marianne lalonde my primary involvement in the neighborhood is serving as president of the lakeside area neighbors association our mission to is ensure our community remains safe inclusive and welcoming to all who live work and play in our area we support local organizations through volunteerism and fellowship between neighbors both within our block club and in other block clubs through planning neighborhood social events we also participate in civic processes including voting on the 46th ward zoning and development committee in my role as president i already listen to and address neighbors concerns about overflowing trash cans pet waste parking and other issues much like how an alderman must attend to the day to day needs of community members i am dedicated to serving the homeless population in our ward and am a member of the associate s board at sarah s circle a women s homeless shelter in addition to volunteering at the interim housing facility i serve on the events and fundraising committee last year sarah circle s main fundraiser winter walk raised over 100 000 to help homeless women in chicago as a member of the clarendon park advisory council i recognize parks as an asset that every member of our community can enjoy regardless of their economic status as a council we promote ways for the community to better utilize the chicago park district s programs and facilities provide communication to the chicago park district on matters relating to their parks and assist in locating alternate funding sources to enhance park facilities our current major project is securing a plan and funding for the renovation of the clarendon park community center i served on the committee to save uplift high school because i refused to see another school lost in from the community we recently saw stewart school a historic elementary school in our community closed and sold to luxury developers uplift high school is the most predominantly african american high school on the north side and remains at risk of closure due to declining enrollment as a member of the committee i helped select new administration testified at the board of education to preserve ap coursework and helped win a sustainable community schools grant i now serve on the uplift high school sustainable community schools leadership team implementing goals associated with the grant proposal i am also a member of the north lake shore drive study task force the task force is redesigning lake shore drive from oak street beach to the hollywood terminus and current plans include elimination of the wilson on off ramp in the 46th ward for the last year i have been fighting to retain the ramp this summer i collected 1200 signatures to include a question on the november election ballot to inform and poll members of the community on the planned closure over 94 of the votes collected were in favor of keeping the ramp sun times 2019 chicago voting guide pensions chicago is on the hook for 42 billion in unfunded pension liabilities which works out to 35 000 for every household those pensions in the language of the illinois constitution shall not be diminished or impaired should the state constitution be amended to allow a reduction in pension benefits for current city employees or retirees how about reducing pension benefits for new employees please explain marianne lalonde i am against an amendment to make a reduction in our workers pensions unfunded pension liability didn t happen overnight it happened over the past several decades due to poor leadership we can t sacrifice the promise of retirement security for dedicated public servants who make our city work as a city we need to prioritize addressing the unfunded liability of public pension funds but a review of whether tier 2 pensions are fair and provide adequate retirement income should be part of the process revenue of the following often proposed sources of new revenue for chicago which of the following do you favor and why a chicago casino legalized and taxed recreational marijuana a lasalle street tax a commuter tax a property tax increase a municipal sales tax increase a real estate transfer tax increase video gambling marianne lalonde our city s collective debt must be addressed through increased revenue overall in order to fulfill the pension promises we have made to those who make our city work including public service workers like firefighters and teachers we should first explore novel and non traditional revenue sources including marijuana legalization and taxation the legalization of video gambling and a lasalle street tax before relying on traditional sources of revenue including property taxes property tax increases are driving families out of their homes and we must work to advocate for additional vouchers that protect the working class families and senior citizens from losing their homes i support a real estate transfer tax on commercial but not owner occupied residential property i m opposed to increasing the municipal sales tax as well as a commuter tax with declining population in the city we rely on commuters to provide additional city revenue and we should not make it more challenging for them to travel into the city a casino is not an ethical revenue stream it represents a city betting against its own citizens what other sources of new revenue do you favor or oppose marianne lalonde the best revenue sources are ones that are progressive meaning they are based on ability to pay with the biggest burden falling on those who can best afford it for chicago that requires changes in state law i support the move towards a progressive state income tax i also believe that the federal government which already has a progressive income tax should increase its revenue sharing with cities tifs tax increment financing districts are a primary economic development tool for chicago in a tif district taxes from the growth of property values are set aside for 23 years to be used to support public projects and private development what changes do you favor if any in chicago s tif program marianne lalonde i fully support the chicago city council s progressive caucus s move to take a more active role in controlling tif funds tif should only be used in areas that are blighted vacant and or obsolete and areas where the project could not move forward financially but for the requested tif subsidy i also believe that tifs should be prioritized for projects that serve the entire community for example public schools and parks versus private developments here s an example of how tif was misused in the 46th ward one of the greatest assets in uptown is clarendon park clarendon park brings neighbors from all different backgrounds together from the clarendon garfield model railroad club to kuumba lynx a hip hop after school program to community gardeners at the center of our park is a beautiful historic community center from 1916 that has unfortunately fallen into disrepair this community asset should be given the attention and resources it deserves instead tif money from this area adjacent to the second highest poverty census tract on the north side was used to subsidize a luxury high rise 811 uptown across the street the developers used some of the tif money to pay into the low income housing trust fund so they wouldn t have to include as much affordable housing on site in their development this developer took property tax revenue meant to benefit low income families and literally used it to make sure low income families wouldn t have a place in the new residences he was building this kind of displacement divides our neighborhood into 2 segments that coexist not a cohesive community aldermanic power what will you do to rein in aldermanic prerogative marianne lalonde the right balance for aldermanic prerogative is ensuring that residents concerns can still be communicated and addressed in alignment with city wide priorities i support legislation that will limit the power of aldermanic prerogative to be used to block affordable housing construction police reform the city of chicago has entered into a federally monitored consent decree to overhaul the training and practices of the chicago police department civil libertarians say it is long overdue but others say it is unnecessary and could make it tougher for the police to do their job what s your view marianne lalonde the chicago police department needs real reforms all chicagoans regardless of race gender sexual orientation or mental health status have the right to feel safe and protected by a police force that is accountable for its actions and representative of the communities it serves at its most basic reform means changing a culture of silence and tolerating the abuse of civil liberties i do not believe that micro managing the police department will succeed in changing the culture but i do believe that the city council and independent bodies must set the standards under which police operate guns what should chicago do to reduce the number of illegal guns marianne lalonde at the city level we should require gun owners to own a title and insurance for their guns ultimately we need increased national gun violence legislation including registration and tracking of guns our actions as a city and state will always have limited impacts as long as gun purchases in neighboring states are less restrictive schools what is the appropriate role of charter schools within the chicago public schools system marianne lalonde funding for public schools should always be prioritized over that of charter schools the best research seems to indicate that when there are only a few charter schools they tend to perform better than traditional charter schools mostly because of selection bias as you increase the number of charter schools on average they perform no better than traditional public schools however the charter schools do take away resources from traditional neighborhood schools and tend to spend less in the classroom we see that in chicago we have so many charter schools about 40 of our high schools are charter schools that we don t see much of a difference on average in outcomes charter schools are used as a convenient gimmick to avoid real education reform and i think it is time to stop the experiment should the chicago board of education be solely appointed by the mayor as is now the case or should chicago switch to an elected school board or some hybrid marianne lalonde i support an elected representative school board for two decades education policy has been dictated by the mayor with little to no input from parents and the community the result is a system that is dominated by for profit entities whether it s charter school management companies or private contractors who do not hesitate to offer kickbacks in exchange for lucrative contracts it s time to give the people a voice in education policy affordable housing is there enough affordable housing in your ward please explain marianne lalonde there is not a sufficient amount of affordable housing city wide which includes the 46th ward we have the opportunity to serve as a leader and role model in the field of affordable housing and demonstrate to other wards in the city the benefits of a truly mixed income and mixed race community as a ward it is imperative to preserve each existing affordable housing unit to promote the prosperity and dignity of residents by ensuring current units are well maintained and to create a development plan that keeps current residents in the ward for new developers this means incorporating on site affordable housing units into their properties rather than opting out by paying into the low income housing trust fund it is also important that larger multi bedroom affordable housing units be created that will give neighbors the opportunity to invest in our ward long term through raising their families in the 46th ward and supporting 46th ward public schools immigration chicago by ordinance is an official welcoming city this means the chicago police are generally prohibited from detaining undocumented immigrants on behalf of federal immigration authorities what s your position on this policy what more or less should be done with respect to undocumented immigrants who live in chicago marianne lalonde as the daughter of an immigrant and someone who aspires to represent a community of immigrants it is of the utmost importance to me that we remain a welcoming city chicago s laws should apply to all residents of the city regardless of documentation status ethics should the inspector general have the power to audit and review city council programs operations and committees why or why not marianne lalonde yes we need a strong principled authority to review city operations and ensure they are ethically done would you employ or have you employed staff in your office who have outside jobs or contracts with entities that do business with the city if so please explain marianne lalonde i would not employ staff who have outside jobs or contracts with entities that do business in the city role model is there a past or current alderman whom you model yourself after or would model yourself after or take inspiration from please explain marianne lalonde there are 3 past and present aldermen i take inspiration from 1 current 47th ward alderman ameya pawar 2 former 44th ward alderman dick simpson and 3 former 16th ward alderman anna langford the first african american woman to ever serve on chicago city council i hope as alderman i work like ald pawar to make active and productive changes in his two terms he passed 10 major pieces of city legislation including the tif accountability and earned sick time ordinances i hope to have the agility and political know how of ald simpson who was not only able to win his first election against a well financed opponent but also to persuade long time politicians to support progressive reforms he introduced such as ending salary discrimination in the city budget for women doing the same jobs as men finally i want to act with the empathy and inclusiveness of ald langford a civil rights crusader and intra council mediator who was instrumental in persuading harold washington to run for mayor
published sunday 27 january 2019 print disqus the extraordinary power of the political arena we live in interesting times baltimore new york boca raton and back home to puerto rico to be absolutely certain about something one must know everything or nothing about it henry kissinger former us secretary of state this month i ve discussed some possible pathways for 2019 but beyond that for the past year or so i have been talking about what i think may unfold over the next decade the term i often use is the great reset but in my mind it s more than just resetting global debt i think a number of equally important trends all extraordinarily eventful some amazingly positive and some frustratingly negative when taken all together which we ll have to like it or not will produce an era unlike anything previously seen in human history i call it the age of transformation we can point back in history to events similar to each of the individual trends we can even argue some of them happened relatively simultaneously key word relatively the pace of this transformation will be breathtaking for all of these changes to happen in roughly a decade will be unprecedented this is going to be an extraordinarily and i use that word precisely difficult period for those relying on historical precedent in their investment planning you often see the phrase past performance is not indicative of future results and we need to re examine what that means normally we use it to say that the past returns of a particular investment may not resemble future returns it s become part of the legal jargon usually ignored i think we need to parse this further we should be saying that the circumstances which produced the past performance may not be duplicated in the future in other words this time may be different i have been pounding the drums for some time to say those circumstances are not only not going to be repeated in the next decade they re going to be profoundly and deeply different which means we are going to get different results than most people expect i want to be very clear here i m not being doom and gloom when i say we will get different returns than history suggests i mean we will need to look at the world differently to get the results we want investment business as usual is not going to cut it good and maybe even solid returns will be possible but not with the old paradigms i believe we will enter recession within the next two years ray dalio says we will be in a recession in 2020 mark yusko argues the us will be in recession by the end of 2019 mark and ray are smarter than i am my crystal ball is a little bit cloudier as to exact timing in any case it makes little difference to our portfolios whether recession strikes in 2019 or 2020 the benchmarks will drop between 40 and 50 some more some less to the extent that you are exposed to stocks and other financial markets your portfolio is going to take a hit the extraordinary power of the political arena for a long time politics have had a short term significance to the market but the long term driving factor was a growing semi free semi capitalistic economy further for almost 40 years the federal reserve beginning with volcker provided an era of extraordinarily low rates and easy money it let governments and businesses worldwide grow their debts alarmingly fast as i ve demonstrated in other letters global debt could easily reach 500 trillion in a few years investors and businesses act like that is normal and can continue at some point we will have a recession exacerbated by extraordinarily high corporate debt just like subprime mortgage debt triggered the last recession corporate debt will trigger the next one i am sure there will be congressional hearings and global angst and new rules will be instituted to limit future corporate debt at the same time ignoring and indeed increasing government debt sigh this corporate debt will precipitate a liquidity crisis and create havoc in all sorts of unrelated markets investors will learn once again that all asset classes are globally correlated in a crisis there will be few places to hide but then the recession will end as all recessions do and recovery begin because that is what happens after recessions except it will be different this time recovery from the great recession was the slowest on record the next recovery will be even slower i have written about that citing lacy hunt and others debt that is not self funding is future consumption brought forward we are currently enjoying consumption and growth that cannot happen in the future debt then is a drag on future growth and the amount of debt the world now has will be a monster drag on future growth note the distinction between debt for current consumption and debt for future production there is an enormous difference recessions always bring higher unemployment on top of technology driven job losses this will exacerbate the current political tensions humans want scapegoats many will blame markets and capitalism when we have neither free markets or true capitalism the progressive left s siren song guaranteed basic income free college free everything etc will begin to play everywhere if you haven t already heard of the economically illiterate insanity called modern monetary theory or mmt you will it says we don t need to worry about government debt we should simply monetize it create and spend whatever we need for the common good they produce fancy equations and rationales but monetization is the bottom line it essentially what alexandria ocasio cortez and others in her world espouse they talk about raising taxes on the rich but there s simply not enough money to do what they propose even if you take everything the rich have the arithmetic doesn t add up so they will have to increase the debt and eventually monetize it which is exactly what japan has done and seemingly succeeded it is that experiment that we in the us are eventually going to try past performance is not indicative of future results with a vengeance except that we know exactly what happened in other countries that tried this our experiment will yield a new witches brew of problems and opportunities which we can t yet predict buy and hold investing will be perilous active management is once again going to be paramount us government debt will easily reach 30 trillion within three years after the next recession once we begin that next economic experiment there will relatively shortly be another recession markets will have an even greater distress situation and the debt will quickly expand to 40 trillion pensions and government deficits will be completely upside down and then the real fun will begin quantitative easing on a scale that makes the bernanke years look like an elementary school picnic we will simply have no choice now the world will not come to an end markets and most though not all businesses will figure out how to survive new businesses will keep launching new technologies will thrive we will continue to need food shelter transportation communication and all the things we think of as normal we will all need medical attention but the potential for living longer perhaps far longer will bring investment opportunities everywhere the challenge will be finding them and getting access in short economic activity will still be going on this will all happen while technology eats jobs faster than it creates them it was all well and good when we went from 80 of the workforce on farms to 1 today but that happened over several generations and centuries we are going to see that kind of upheaval in many industries in half a generation can you say frustrated workers people wishing that they can have their jobs protected wanting the government to do something i think the political arena will become more important to markets in the coming decade than it has ever been that is not to say we can t figure it out but if you are looking at past historical performance to guide your portfolio you are unlikely to be happy with the outcome we are getting ready to enter an era unlike anything in our own experience or in our history books analogies surely history and economic and political history will be ever more important george box a british statistician was the first to say that all models are wrong but some are useful let me adapt that to say that all models based on history are wrong but some are useful and those based on a proper reading of history will be very useful indeed hat tip for the quote at the beginning and this one seth klarman see below we live in interesting times it is said that a chinese curse is may you live in interesting times for better or worse we live in interesting times for most of us it won t be violent which is what usually accompanied historical interesting times so for that we can be grateful but it will be emotionally wrenching seth klarman of baupost group in boston one of the world s greatest value investors right up there with warren buffett writes an annual letter i ve always found it must reading when i can get my hands on it klarman s latest letter is beginning to make the rounds and it is certainly circulating in davos as it takes a more dire and political tone than his normal musings he certainly illustrates my point that we live in interesting times if someone can get me an introduction to seth so that i can arrange a meeting i would be extraordinarily grateful i am going to finish with some selected quotes from klarman s letter leaving out some of the more incendiary remarks even though they are no less true i ve posted the full 21 page letter for over my shoulder members you can join here if you aren t one you need to read it here s seth social frictions remain a challenge for democracies around the world and we wonder when investors might take more notice of this the recent yellow vest marches in france which subsequently spread to belgium holland and canada began as a petition against fuel tax hikes and grew through social media into a mass protest movement led by suburban commuters small business owners and truck drivers the demonstrations which appear to have broken out spontaneously throughout the country became widespread and even violent while the french government is clearly concerned in december it reversed the planned tax increases while announcing a higher minimum wage the financial markets have taken the unrest largely in stride as the french 10 year note at year end yielded a meager 70 basis points social and economic advancement in america today seems increasingly dependent on demography and geography the economic advantages enjoyed by college graduates continues to grow unsurprisingly income growth in most major metropolitan areas surpasses gains in rural areas of the country economic inequality continued to worsen in 2018 and for many real wages have not increased in decades it seems clear that economic anxiety contributed to the election of donald trump in 2016 the divide between americans has been exacerbated by the echo chambers of modern day media and the internet many have written of how in only about four decades an america of three broadcast networks has become an america of hundreds of cable channels a few decades ago we had less connectivity but more connection david brooks and others write regularly about the challenges of increased loneliness and isolation a person today can have a thousand facebook friends and few if any actual friends amid all this turmoil should investors simply hunker down and keep their focus on markets that might be a challenge by way of illustration on december 18 on the fedex earnings call ceo frederick smith noted that most of the issues that we re dealing with today are induced by bad political choices i mean making a bad decision about a new tax creating a tremendously difficult situation with brexit the immigration crisis in germany the mercantilism and state owned enterprise initiatives in china the tariffs that the united states put in unilaterally so you just go down the list and they re all things that have created macroeconomic slowdowns these days americans do not seem to agree on much of anything some of it is today s politics deep state or dedicated civil servants witch hunt or legitimate investigation into crimes fake news or free press alternative facts or facts accomplished adversary or lock her up and some of it goes beyond politics into the realms of scientific inquiry and american values climate change or climate hoax refugees seeking sanctuary or caravan of foreign invaders does this matter we think it does it s hard for our leaders to guide us when we don t agree on our values or even on how we decide what is true worse our enemies including but not limited to russia s autocratic government are using social media and internet postings to confuse us and divide us further they know which hot buttons to push moreover our willful disbelief of facts truth and science increases the chance that we will fail to recognize or take seriously growing threats in 1993 senator daniel patrick moynihan who famously said that everyone is entitled to his own opinion but not to his own facts observed that america was defining deviancy down his point was that behavior that had once been seen as deviant was now considered acceptable to paraphrase moynihan today we may instead be defining reality down this post truth moment is quite dangerous imagine an incident that threatens national security will americans see eye to eye on the seriousness of the threat if our leaders are truth challenged will americans believe the official explanation of the threat and the wisdom of the proposed response should they we would argue vehemently that democracy and the liberties and protections it provides is not just of importance to individual citizens but also to businesses and markets in a democracy businesses have the benefit of equal treatment under the law including unbiased regulation we would also argue that social cohesion is essential for those who have capital to invest businesses need a long term horizon to plan and social unrest makes planning more difficult it can t be business as usual amidst constant protests riots shutdowns and escalating social tensions it is not hard to imagine worsening social unrest among a generation that is falling behind economically and feels betrayed by a massive national debt that was incurred without any obvious benefit to them if things get bad enough we could see taxes once again raised to confiscatory levels we should all be rooting for and acting to support social cohesion and a renewal of the american dream john here again george soros this week said that we are in a cold war with china that threatens to turn into a hot war while soros and i agree on little politically i did find my head nodding at times in his latest cnbc interview then luke gromen of forest for the trees wrote about change in the geopolitical climate which is not his usual beat i have become a fan of his writing saying us national security may be more important than risk asset performance for the first time in decades gromen foresees quoting his summary potential rule change us national security may be more important than risk asset performance for the 1st time in 35 years but risk assets don t seem to realize this yet if we are moving back to a cold war world where us policy is driven more by the national security establishment than the wall street treasury establishment as has been the case for the past 30 years then it would seem the odds are good that the chart on the front page of the attached pdf would mean revert implying as much as a 30 60 drop in corporate profits as a of gdp just to return to the levels that prevailed during the last cold war before cheap chinese labor at least temporarily disappearing fed largesse elevated us corporate profitability to all time high s of gdp if a new cold war is indeed breaking out it would in turn seem to have severe implications for the global us corporate debt equity markets it is highly unlikely that any of this money was borrowed assuming a 30 60 drop in us corporate profits as a of gdp was even remotely possible on many metrics ig hy leveraged loans us equities v row valuations are quite stretched already there are record levels of leverage in the us corporate debt market the rules appear to be changing for national security reasons in a manner quite unfriendly to corporate margins i am in washington dc for a personal meeting with andrew marshall whom i mentioned two weeks ago on that occasion he had to go to the emergency room forgivable since he is 97 years old but he was up and his usual vigorous self today there were also two us defense strategy mavens in the room the topic turned to china it soon became troubling at least to me andy noted that he had been warning the us government about china s real intentions since the 1980s again he was appointed by nixon to run the defense department s futurist think tank he retired three years ago at 94 every president reappointed him he is the most significant figure in us geopolitical strategy that you have never heard of because he never wanted anyone to know who he was chinese leaders read everything he wrote his pictures are on their walls literally i can t stress enough how important and influential he is i asked about some of the china analysis i ve seen these experts confirmed everything that i had read and then doubled down the geopolitical risks are serious we in the west simply don t understand the chinese mindset or their intentions even though they write strategic papers every other year detailing exactly what they are thinking and doing there should be no surprises but we ignore these writings as political noise and then try to exploit the vast and real potential of chinese markets yet it may not work out the way we hope i will have to write on this in a later letter but the point is that we do indeed live in interesting times we simply can t expect the old investment paradigms to meet the challenges of the future past performance is indeed not indicative of future results i can t close this letter without pointing out we will cover all these topics at the upcoming strategic investment conference in dallas may 13 16 we will be dealing with china global debt geopolitics the upcoming elections markets new technologies social upheaval and much more we will be talking about specific investment opportunities and how to structure your affairs this will be my 16th strategic investment conference from the very beginning i have created a conference that i want to attend i invite speakers thought leaders from whom i want to learn this is the most extraordinary lineup of speakers that i have ever been able to assemble including former president george w bush howard marks felix zulauf carmen reinhart jim mellon bill white simon hunt lakshman achuthan david rosenberg george friedman lacy hunt mark yusko liz ann sonders grant williams and more there will be speakers you have never heard of that will blow you away i can guarantee that my rolodex has gotten pretty extensive over the years conferences have become my personal art form i design them in building blocks to develop themes that help you plan your own personal future protect and participate is the model i think we need to embrace protect what we have participate in the future s potential we do live in interesting times it is tempting to hunker down buy gold and just try to survive i reject that strategy life is so much more intricate complex and full of powerful opportunities it is meant to be lived sitting with andy marshall this afternoon 30 years my senior inspired me i want to communicate that inspiration to you i want to inspire you to live and grow and prosper my absolute best way to do that is at the strategic investment conference experiencing these ideas in person is exponentially more powerful than reading about them i hope you can join me as we work our way into the future uncertain absolutely daunting and full of potential dangers assuredly will we need wisdom and guidance and compatriots in our journey more than ever but it will be exhilarating and challenging and full of opportunities i hope to see you in dallas click here to learn more about the strategic investment conference baltimore new york boca raton and back home to puerto rico as i write this i m on my way to baltimore to see 300 year old mice or ones that have aged the equivalent of 300 human years oh dear gods how the world is going to change we will look back in the late 2030s and wonder why we all worried so much and this is just one of a dozen different experiments that i personally know about there must be hundreds of others what might humanity achieve if we could only get governments out of the way i only say that semi humorously then i am off to new york where i have meetings sunday night and monday before i fly on tuesday to finally see shane again in boca raton there i will be speaking at a conference and meeting with my friends doug kass and michael lewitt who live in the area i will be on stage with grant williams and martin barnes old friends and comrades where we will be expected to espouse wisdom and knowledge but frankly we will just be having the usual intellectually stimulating and aggressive in your face fun and conference attendees will get to listen to us that s the best kind of panel it seems strange to say i m going back home to puerto rico but in less than two months and at age 69 for me and a number that i will not mention for shane it has become home home is where the heart is texas will always be my home then but for now puerto rico is where i want to have my closet and with that i will hit the send button as often happens i fully intended this to be a short letter but it just never turns out that way one day i am actually going to have a truly short letter you should keep reading just in the anticipation of it and with that humorous note let me wish you a great week and more than a few occasions to be with friends your optimistic and

january 26 2019 by ivan danilov ivan danilov is a famous russian economist and influential blogger source featured image reuters manaure quintero translated by scott the crisis in venezuela has once again brought into question why the russian state as well as state owned companies invest money and issue loans to some countries many journalists and experts have already rushed with pleasure to calculate alleged financial losses of the russian side forgetting both that caracas has not yet fallen and pro american usurper has not won yet and that russia is not the ussr and is not engaged in charity it is particularly instructive to compare two strains of american propaganda one aimed at the russian audience through the american ngos and the media lured leaders of public opinion and the other aimed at the venezuelan audience through lured venezuelan politicians the message the money of the russian budget and rosneft went to useless support of the venezuelan regime and will never be returned targets the russian audience and the message russia robbed venezuela with the help of bonded loans and contracts taking control of a significant part of venezuelan oil targets the venezuelan audience it is easy to see that according to the laws of logic in one case the american propaganda should lie because it is impossible to be a stupid benefactor and ruthless moneylender at the same time however in reality the situation is even more interesting american propaganda lies in both cases russia and russian state owned companies are not geopolitical shylock and they are not geopolitical mother teresa either moscow really helped and will continue to help caracas while always sensibly combining idealism with pragmatism let s start with the fact that russia is not the main creditor of the venezuelan economy and not even the second most important if we take the western the most unflattering for russia estimates from the bloomberg business information agency it turns out that the leader in investments and loans is china with 70 billion dollars but the honorable second place belongs to very influential and very respectable banks and investment funds mainly from the us and the uk according to the most conservative estimates quoted in the reuters material they lent to the governments of chavez and maduro as well as the venezuelan state oil company pdvsa to the amount of about 50 billion among venezuela s creditors there are such giants of the financial world as the american investment conglomerate blackrock the largest investment fund in the world assets under management 6 789 trillion dollars and the most influential american bank goldman sachs which is known for its extraordinary opportunities of political lobbying in the us and the european union by the way the venezuelan opposition has repeatedly said that it will not pay the debts of the anti people regime especially the opposition does not want to pay the goldman sachs bank which literally saved maduro in 2017 so paradoxically several very large and influential american financial companies are rooting for maduro because they are unlikely to want to run into a write off in the name of democracy for at least 50 billion for comparison the highest estimate of the total amount of loans and investments made by russian structures in venezuela is 17 billion and this amount does not take into account some important aspects first venezuela has long been paying off russian and chinese creditors with oil and shares in venezuela s oil fields and this has been generating serious revenues for venezuelan creditors for many years secondly russian loans it is worth noting that a similar scheme is used by the us china the uk and eu countries around the world are often tied to the supply of russian goods and services that is the money has already turned into salaries for example for domestic gunsmiths so to speak about losses of 17 billion is at least inaccurate and more than premature unfortunately in the russian information field there are often sounding statements that the venezuelan government is not to blame for anything that economic difficulties are a myth or that economic difficulties primarily hyperinflation are 100 the result of american sanctions that s not so no american sanctions can explain the fact that the venezuelan gold reserve has been in london for many years at the disposal of the bank of england which according to the latest information refuses to return it at all and in the current crisis situation this gold may well become the budget of the pro american junta no sanctions can explain the fact that the key venezuelan assets bringing the country s main foreign exchange revenue for example an oil refinery and a network of citgo gas stations are located in the usa and in all the years of confrontation with america the official caracas did not bother to sell them and buy something similar in any other friendly to venezuela country no sanctions can explain an absolutely insane policy of monetary stimulation of the economy which has led to the fact that inflation in venezuela has long been measured in tens or hundreds of thousands of percent per annum undermining the economy and the standard of living of the population so that even toilet paper becomes a luxury product it is time for caracas as well as some russian economists to realize that it is impossible to solve economic and social problems by printing and distributing money according to the central bank of venezuela for october 2018 which refers to trading economics inflation in venezuela was more than 1 300 000 a level when the national currency turns into a wrapper which can only be use to heat up a house during the next power outage the fact that venezuelans massively support maduro despite the fact that prices increase by at least a few tens of percent every day for several years a real miracle again hyperinflation cannot be attributed to sanctions or falling oil prices it is enough to look at the country on which american sanctions american intervention and civil war hit much harder syria according to the cia at the peak of the war in 2016 the assad administration managed to keep inflation at only 43 9 and in 2017 it was brought down to 25 5 that is inflation is falling and the economy is gradually returning to normal this example clearly shows the difference in financial discipline and this comparison is clearly not in favor of caracas we are now witnessing a rather acute political crisis but for venezuela such crises are unfortunately almost routine suffice is to recall actively supported by the us riots in 2014 and 2017 during which the legitimate government in caracas also kept literally in the balance if the administration of maduro this time too will be able to keep the situation it may even bring positive results at least in terms of changing the economic policy of the venezuelan leadership which just a few months ago although venezuela has been in a difficult economic crisis for many years asked the russian leadership to develop a plan for the normalization of the venezuelan economy if the legitimate government retains power and if the russian plan is adopted for implementation venezuela will have a good chance to get out of the crisis and dramatically reduce its risks in the future this will be good for venezuela itself and for all its economic partners
cyrus moulton cyrus moulton telegram com worcester the economy is booming unemployment is low and a silver tsunami of baby boomers the wealthiest generation in u s history are beginning to retire and make decisions about their long term health care it seems like it would be a good time to be in the nursing home business but in reality senior care advocates workers and even residents say the industry is in a financial crisis in massachusetts according to the massachusetts senior care association an advocacy organization for skilled nursing facilities 20 nursing homes closed in the last year and more than half of the 401 nursing facility providers in the state are operating in the red it s pretty clear that most nursing homes are struggling said sandra mahoney administrator at christopher house christopher house posted a slight deficit in 2018 after making a slight profit in 2017 according to the nonprofit s tax returns ms mahoney said she has been a nursing home administrator for just over 20 years this climate is the most challenging she said steven raso principal of landmark management solutions an owner operator and manager of four skilled nursing centers including st francis rehabilitation and nursing center in worcester agreed with ms mahoney massachusetts is the state you go to for the best higher education the best acute care needs the best biomedical jobs said mr raso he said st francis is operating at the industry average a 2 percent loss this year but if you want to grow old here camillo quitadamo is one of the 40 000 nursing facility residents daily in the state who is growing old here he can spot a dedicated nursing home worker the 91 year old resident of christopher house in worcester observed it s the interest they take in you he added a lot of them refer to me as papa you ve got some real nice people here they treat you like family certified nursing assistant hawa williams also spoke of the family setting at christopher house in fact her mother and sister also work at the nursing home i love it here the interaction with the patients ms williams 34 said i come to work and it s like you re home but workers like ms williams are often hard to find and mr quitadamo notices it s a shame they can t get them more help mr quitadamo continued if you could pay them just a little bit more there wouldn t be so much change the ones that don t care don t stay although mr quitadamo stressed he is very satisfied now he said he worries this lack of help could eventually affect his care it s too bad we can t get help it s not just here it s all nursing homes mr quitadamo said my story is really if we could get more help things would go a heck of a lot better legislators are starting to pay attention everyone knows someone who is in a nursing home or will be in a nursing home at some point said state senate president emerita harriette chandler who filed legislation last week to help nursing homes if these closures continue we are going to have a very serious emergency not a problem an emergency on our hands and as a result of this emergency advocates say people like mr quitadamo and ms williams will suffer the residents suffer the staff suffers and the staff are mostly minority and female and i don t have a magic wand to fix this said robert oriol chief executive officer of oriol health care oriol health care which mr oriol said posted a moderate loss last year owns and operates holden rehabilitation and skilled nursing center in holden and oakdale rehabilitation and skilled nursing in west boylston we try to make smart choices and think we do and we are going to survive and put residents first nursing home economics 101 nursing home economics is complicated but to try to simplify things nursing homes traditionally rely on two separate services with separate revenue streams the traditional long term nursing home care is typically used by patients who are more likely to be older to have dementia or other cognitive impairments and to be totally dependent on assistance for activities of daily living such as bathing eating and more for these patients the nursing home is their residence and they either pay privately or more typically depend on medicaid known in massachusetts as masshealth to pay for their care nursing homes and facilities also serve short term patients seeking rehabilitative services this generally younger healthier patient returns home after a brief stay and generally pays with medicare or a health maintenance organization the problem advocates say is medicaid reimbursement rates which are based on 2007 costs don t fully cover the cost of daily care the typical medicaid participating nursing facility will see an annual 900 000 in uncompensated care according to the msca the medicaid shortfall in massachusetts is among the highest in the nation but the state has a 1 billion surplus according to gov charlie baker when you finally have money you pay the bills said mr raso the state has been ducking paying the long term care industry for the last 10 years now that they have a significant surplus it s time to pay this bill historically short term and private paying individuals offset the shortfall in medicaid payments however the balance between medicaid and other payment sources has shifted in recent years in 2011 an average of 66 percent of nursing home patients statewide depended on medicaid while 15 percent paid with medicare 14 percent paid privately and 5 percent paid from other sources according to the msca in 2017 the organization said an average of 69 percent of nursing home patients statewide depended on medicaid while 13 percent paid with medicare 13 percent paid privately and 5 percent paid from other sources that shift may not seem that dramatic but it is coupled with an almost 25 percent cumulative reduction in short term skilled nursing facility stays in that time which has led to a 300 million decline in revenue since 2011 according to the msca before the impact of the affordable care act enacted in 2010 the average short term stay was 21 to 23 days according to the msca but among other factors accountable care organizations have been trying to control the number of days in rehabilitation post aca the average stay is less than 14 days the organization said moreover nursing homes are financially penalized if they don t have 94 percent occupancy the industry median is an occupancy of 90 percent according to the msca prior to the 20 closures occupancy was at 85 percent the organization said finally the rise in other treatment options such as home care and assisted living suggest trends of nursing homes increasingly serving masshealth patients will continue a lot of folks when they need our care they have exhausted private resources said ms mahoney the result is that already slim operating margins are crunched further said advocates between 2014 and 2017 profit margins peaked in 2015 at 1 percent for the average nursing home in the state according to the msca in 2017 the average facility posted a 1 6 percent loss and the more masshealth patients the lower the profit margins according to the msca for facilities with 50 percent or more masshealth patients profits peaked at 5 percent in 2015 in 2017 they were at 2 1 percent the average facility with 75 percent or more masshealth patients came closest to making a profit in 2015 by only losing 7 percent in 2017 those facilities lost an average of 3 2 percent this medicaid shortfall has been going on for years said matt salmon chairman of the board of the msca and also ceo of salmon health and retirement a family owned senior care provider with local facilities in worcester northbridge and northboro the company as a whole was profitable in 2018 although its nursing homes operated in the red mr salmon reported it has been in an acute stage for the last two or three years and will be worse if we don t change things we ve predicted a colossal collapse coming in massachusetts and it s here now care and its costs so what does this colossal collapse look like one impact is on staffing nursing homes spend three quarters of every dollar on staff wages and benefits for the 77 000 total employees in the sector according to the msca eleven cents is spent on general expenses operating expenses 8 cents is spent on the physical plant and 6 cents is spent on administration most of our costs are human costs said ms mahoney the impact of minimum wage and trying to remain competitive for nurses and certified nursing assistants is costly nursing homes are also competing for workers particularly cnas who provide the direct care with other health care providers not constrained as much by medicaid reimbursements cnas at a nursing home where 68 percent of residents depend on medicaid earn an average of 14 33 an hour according to the msca comparatively a home health aide who has an average of 42 percent of his or her patients on medicaid can earn an average of 16 45 an hour a hospital with an average of 20 percent of patients on medicaid can pay a cna 17 20 per hour so nursing homes increasingly compete with other entry level employers for workers we can t get staff because we re competing with dunkin donuts said mr raso noting that dunkin can pay 16 an hour feeding an elderly person who may be demented and combative is much more difficult than pouring coffee and the pay structure should respectively correlate to that level of difficulty as a result there were 630 unfilled positions representing 14 3 percent of direct care nursing jobs in worcester county in 2018 according to the msca we re not letting them go unfilled we can t fill them said mr salmon ms mahoney said it takes two to three times longer than normal to fill jobs in every department at christopher house and a minimum wage increase of 1 which is an effective 9 percent increase will further depress profits said mr raso if we re already at 2 percent it will take us to 3 percent and the industry will hit the rocks said mr raso you re going to see more buildings close but perhaps most importantly nursing home advocates worry this is starting to affect care in fact 21 percent of nursing homes in massachusetts have or have considered closing admissions because of a staffing shortage according to the msca the number of deficiency free facilities deficiencies include everything from expired milk in the fridge to serious patient care issues has also dropped in the last three years a high of 32 percent of nursing facilities were deficiency free in 2013 13 percent were deficiency free in 2017 according to the msca so many open positions rely on temporary nurses said msca president tara m gregorio but she notes temporary workers often don t know patients and the staff you can see poor outcomes sometimes in fact nursing facilities that care for more medicaid patients have lower quality ratings more deficiencies and less staff than facilities with low numbers of medicaid patients according to the msca nursing facilities with less than 50 percent of residents on medicaid received an average of 4 4 stars on the centers for medicare and medicaid services five star quality rating system in 2017 and had an average of 3 2 deficiencies facilities with more than 75 percent of medicaid patients received an average of 2 9 stars on the rating system and had an average of 7 2 deficiencies the statewide average ranking is 3 4 stars with six deficiencies the facilities with less dependency on medicaid also had more staff so nursing homes like christopher house have had to get creative hiring new graduates rather than experienced cnas emphasizing the family atmosphere that appeals so much to ms williams and mr quitadamo and hosting student clinicals to make a job offer as seamless as possible nursing homes are also looking to legislators for help ms chandler has filed legislation proposing to create a 13 member emergency nursing home task force to make policy recommendations to ensure the financial stability of the nursing homes in the state i feel we re at a crisis level said tim foley executive vice president of 1199 service employees international union which represents approximately 3 000 nursing home workers and is promoting the legislation we need to come together and come up with solutions as we integrate nursing home systems into our health care delivery system the union and the industry have to work together to come up with solutions to this crisis ms chandler has also filed an act relative to stabilizing the commonwealth s nursing facilities legislation proposing to increase medicaid reimbursement rates for nursing homes by updating them to reflect 2017 costs the legislation also proposes updating the medicaid reimbursement to reflect annual inflation and establishing a grant program to financially assist entry level nursing home workers trying to advance their careers boy is it needed said ms chandler we really need to invest in our nursing home facilities to support our seniors and as i get older i see this in very personal terms ms gregorio and mr salmon estimate updating rates using 2017 costs will cost 75 million half of which would be reimbursed by the federal government adjusting the medicaid reimbursement to reflect annual inflation of 2 percent would cost an estimated 34 million they said finally the organization also seeks to adjust the occupancy penalty so that it reflects the median occupancy of 90 percent in nursing homes rather than 94 percent that would cost approximately 85 million mr foley was optimistic the legislation would be enacted noting that similar legislation for a task force nearly made it over the finish line last year he also praised mr baker s 2020 budget which allocates 38 3 million for increasing wages to retain and recruit workers in the industry our workers are the most caring people in the world mr foley said they want to provide good quality care and want to make sure families loved ones are taken care of in their senior years we know the best solutions to improving care in nursing homes hospitals and home care is in workers back at christopher house on thursday however legislation and political advocacy were not on mr quitadamo s mind he was visiting with his favorite cna sheila spellman his go to for helping him get out of bed and shaving in the morning we have a beautiful system between us no arguing mr quitadamo said smiling and ms spellman said she couldn t think of any other job she would rather do than help her patients it s my way of sharing who i am to other people ms spellman said he takes the place of my late dad he reminds me a lot of my dad 1 according to the massachusetts senior care association 20 nursing homes closed in the last year and more than half of the 401 nursing facility providers in the state are operating in the red 2 the problem advocates say is medicaid reimbursement rates which are based on 2007 costs don t fully cover the cost of daily care 3 historically short term and private paying individuals offset the shortfall in medicaid payments 4 in 2011 an average of 66 percent of nursing home patients statewide depended on medicaid while 15 percent paid with medicare 14 percent paid privately and 5 percent paid from other sources according to the msca 4 before the impact of the affordable care act enacted in 2010 the average short term stay was 21 to 23 days according to the msca 5 post aca the average stay is less than 14 days the organization said five facts
how is hit predictor a thing i mean i guess there is an algorithm for everything nowadays not algorithm crowd sourcing of course it makes sense on some level for the closer you are to x y and z with your song the more likely you are to succeed just put it all into a multivariate regression i guess by the early 2000s record men routinely used advance testing to measure the hit potential of prospective singles one of the leading testing services hit predictor was created by guy zapoleon together with rick bisceglia and doug ford whether or not hit predictor really worked it was accurate enough that some labels came to rely heavily on zapoleon s method of testing songs the labels interest in hit predictor made the company so valuable that clear channel eventually bought it and began using zapoleon s system in its own internal research as well john seabrook the song machine
wall street s weekly winning streak came to an end but friday saw gains across the board credit richard drew markets didn t react much to news that president donald trump and congressional leaders reached a deal to reopen the federal government for three weeks while talks continue over trump s demands for money to build a wall along the us border with mexico traders took a brighter view on the economy and us companies continued to report solid results for the fourth quarter energy and consumer focused companies as well as basic materials makers all did better than the broader market those industries and stocks tend to benefit the most when economic growth improves stocks closed higher on wall street friday recovering a chunk of their losses from earlier in the week technology and industrial companies jumped trump announced the agreement to break the 35 day impasse as delays at airports and widespread disruptions brought new urgency to efforts to end the partial shutdown trump almost immediately threatened another shutdown or emergency action if he does not get a fair deal the s p 500 surged 10 per cent during the shutdown which started when the stock market was at its low point in december some experts feel that the standoff won t have a lasting effect on the market or the economy with government employees resuming their spending as soon as they are repaid for their work in january but kristina hooper chief global market strategist for invesco said the magnitude of the shutdown might have major effects on consumers confidence if the government can t work together in times where there are no real crises imagine what would happen in an environment where there was a real crisis she said it s hard to envisage congress and the executive branch putting their differences aside and working together she added that the government s dysfunction might contribute to the u s credit being downgraded and if that happens investors are likely to flee the stock market and pour money into the bond market that s what they did when the country s credit rating was cut in 2011
complete coverage of the local and national primary and general election including results analysis and voter resources to keep chicago voters informed the sun times editorial board sent the candidates running for 40th ward alderman a list of questions to find out their views on a range of issues facing the city and their ward maggie o keefe submitted the following responses the sun times does not edit candidate responses who is maggie o keefe she s running for 40th ward alderman her political civic background as a passionate voting rights advocate i have organized deputy voter registrar trainings for over 500 people in cook county hosted voter drives at over three dozen high schools street festivals and events and registered thousands of new voters in the chicagoland area in the last two years my company and i have consulted multiple campaigns in the previous election cycle including ameya pawar for governor fritz kaegi for cook county assessor and three winning races for judge additionally i was the acting interim political director for the 47th ward democrats for the 2018 primary election i am also an active board member on the gross park advisory council her occupation i am the founder and president of maggie the marketer a digital marketing company i founded my company four years ago with no capital investment with the goal to create part time employment that paid a generous hourly wage to support people working in the gig economy her education columbia college 2011 her campaign website maggie2019 com facebook maggiejokeefe top priorities what are the top three priorities for your ward maggie o keefe 1 increase active community and civic engagement a truly sustainable community is one empowered by active engagement by neighbors and not by promising to personally solve city wide issues that no single person can fix the current 40th ward alderman has been in office for 35 years in that time he s built a career plunging the city into debt and keeping the community uninformed and uninspired i m running as a real public servant one that will serve as both her neighbors organizer and their voice in city council 2 equity in education for equal opportunity our local public schools have been improving thanks to the hard work of parents and students in the ward but increasing property taxes and rising housing costs threatens this progress too often families are pitted against other families in a fight for resources since february i ve talked with principals parents and staff at our public schools all across the ward and what i hear from them is our current way of funding public education is unsustainable each child enrolled in chicago public schools deserves equitable funding no matter where they live the school day does not end when the bell rings and it s essential that we make after school programming available for all especially our ward s working families currently programming in the 40th ward does not have a sliding scale for families who can not afford to pay 300 a month per child nor does our current programming offer extended hours the future of chicago public schools relies on an elected school board which 40th ward residents overwhelmingly support as alderman i will work with the new mayor in making this a priority and work with our state legislators in springfield 3 community safety cohesive communities are safer communities our local government and representatives must provide the resources to truly keep our neighborhoods connected healthy and safe since february 2018 our campaign has met with constituents business owners and nonprofit community leaders to get feedback and incorporate their ideas into our 40th ward community safety plan which will modernize our public safety networks and be driven by neighbors and local businesses our priority goal will be to create new online block clubs where residents can report safety issues and infrastructure needs and recruit block club captains who will provide reports to the 40th ward office and better track progress recent civic work please tell us what you have done in the last two years to serve the city your neighborhood or a civic organization please be specific maggie o keefe like many americans the 2016 election was a call to action for me low voter turnout in marginalized communities motivated me to become a deputy voter registrar and while i entered the workforce during the recession that didn t stop me from founding my own company or getting active in my community or from finding my passion to protect our parks and our city s natural resources in my role at gross park advisory council we recently raised over 2 500 for upcoming events in 2019 and since february 2018 the maggie 2019 campaign has organized several civic events throughout the 40th ward including raising over 20k in clothing donations for children and expectant mothers arranging multicultural and political playdates for 40th ward families at libraries and schools organizing curb raking and sewer cleaning to prevent neighbors blocks from flooding and hosting environmental sustainability events in the community including with new mwrd commissioner cam davis sun times 2019 chicago voting guide pensions chicago is on the hook for 42 billion in unfunded pension liabilities which works out to 35 000 for every household those pensions in the language of the illinois constitution shall not be diminished or impaired should the state constitution be amended to allow a reduction in pension benefits for current city employees or retirees how about reducing pension benefits for new employees please explain maggie o keefe as i enter into city council working towards fully funding our pensions will be a top priority cutting worker benefits is not going to solve the pension crisis and try as legislators might i don t think that an amendment to do so will pass in illinois city council members will need to get innovative to create additional revenue streams to fully fund our pension system while remaining accountable for the debts owed revenue of the following often proposed sources of new revenue for chicago which of the following do you favor and why a chicago casino legalized and taxed recreational marijuana a lasalle street tax a commuter tax a property tax increase a municipal sales tax increase a real estate transfer tax increase video gambling maggie o keefe i am 100 for legalizing marijuana and taxing it accordingly as soon as possible here in the state of illinois though it must come tied with conviction expungement which is not only fair but will also create less stress on chicago taxpayers and our overcrowded cook county prison system i also support the proposed real estate transfer and lasalle street taxes these industries can pay their share like the rest of us instead of continuing to balance our budgets on taxes and tickets aimed at low income chicagoans and small businesses now is our chance to create a more equitable tax system in our city what other sources of new revenue do you favor or oppose maggie o keefe i think the most important way we can increase our revenue base is to reverse the ongoing population decline in our city by properly investing our own resources back into our neighborhoods i fully support the proposed public bank that can help loan funds to expand small businesses increase affordable housing options fix decaying infrastructure and refinance student loans to help chicagoans stay in the city while attracting new residents to move here while i support making sure that every person who paid into a pension receives what they were promised a chicago casino would require oversight to avoid public corruption this would need to be a multi year process to get it right and i don t see instituting gambling and profiting from others losses as a positive or particularly innovative strategy to achieve a sustainable future for all chicagoans tifs tax increment financing districts are a primary economic development tool for chicago in a tif district taxes from the growth of property values are set aside for 23 years to be used to support public projects and private development what changes do you favor if any in chicago s tif program maggie o keefe the term blight has been over and misused to expand districts covered by this funding especially in our downtown tif districts i support the proposed back to basics tif reform ordinance put forth by the progressive caucus it s a great start to making a more sustainable and trustworthy system we need to make this a more transparent process informing homeowners that they live within tif districts and how their property taxes are being spent is of utmost importance aldermanic power what will you do to rein in aldermanic prerogative maggie o keefe the too close relationship between aldermen and their donors who want to influence ward development and city decisions is the main reason why aldermanic prerogative erodes public trust in my campaign i ve pledged not to take donations from developers architects real estate lawyers contractors and others who seek to do business with the city alderman o connor is a prime case study in the harms of abusing aldermanic prerogative one of the biggest things i hear when knocking on doors is how neighbors want to have more transparency and community driven development in the 40th ward in addition to the creation of new community groups our proposed network of block captains will help us create a fair and equitable zoning system in our neighborhoods we will also work together to bring participatory asset mapping to the ward something we should focus on doing across our city to better determine real infrastructure and economic development needs within each neighborhood police reform the city of chicago has entered into a federally monitored consent decree to overhaul the training and practices of the chicago police department civil libertarians say it is long overdue but others say it is unnecessary and could make it tougher for the police to do their job what s your view maggie o keefe i fully support the proposed consent decree and believe it will be beneficial to both the chicago police department and the chicago communities they serve i also support the focus on better mental health services for police officers to help alleviate the stresses of the job with additional training on interacting with individuals undergoing mental health and other crises knowing that the safety of chicago is a shared responsibility is another reason why our campaign has worked with constituents businesses and nonprofits to create the 40th ward community safety plan in order to capitalize on new and existing resources to better connect and protect our neighborhoods guns what should chicago do to reduce the number of illegal guns maggie o keefe violence is a symptom of disinvestment and disengagement from our local government illegal guns have become more available and easily accessible than quality education after school programming and job opportunities the chicago city council needs to provide adequate resources for our communities hit the hardest with gang violence lack of jobs and disproportionate disinvestment of economic development i fully support counteracting violence by implementing universal pre k funding our schools and afterschool programming investing into communities that have been historically divested from and increasing job training and placement in green energy careers schools what is the appropriate role of charter schools within the chicago public schools system maggie o keefe the original role of charter schools was to provide education that our currently underfunded neighborhood schools were failing to provide however the way charter schools are set up to receive the benefits and funding as de facto public schools are not working for all students nor is there transparency in how they are using their funding and if charter schools are not providing a better quality education then why are they continually singled out for special treatment the overwhelming majority of community members in the 40th ward are strongly opposed to new charter schools and i stand with them in their opposition our focus moving forward ought to be to provide resources to our existing neighborhood public schools should the chicago board of education be solely appointed by the mayor as is now the case or should chicago switch to an elected school board or some hybrid maggie o keefe chicago deserves an elected school board it should be on the same cycle as the regular chicago municipal elections affordable housing is there enough affordable housing in your ward please explain maggie o keefe no and it is one of the greatest challenges for working families and seniors trying to stay in the community they helped build the 40th ward has the potential to be a welcoming place with housing that represents all incomes due to decades of misrepresentation lack of community input and contributions from major developers within our ward we have seen the rise of single family homes and a shortage of multi units that support affordable housing for all for our ward to continue to grow as a community that truly welcomes all people regardless of their income this must change immediately i also support the development for all ordinance which would eliminate in lieu of fees and require developers to include 30 affordable units on site i would also work with the progressive caucus to create new policies that support a consistent supply of affordable family sized units available to families immigration chicago by ordinance is an official welcoming city this means the chicago police are generally prohibited from detaining undocumented immigrants on behalf of federal immigration authorities what s your position on this policy what more or less should be done with respect to undocumented immigrants who live in chicago maggie o keefe officially we are a welcoming city but we are not following the ordinance and there are many loopholes for example cpd officers are still permitted to cooperate at their discretion with immigration and customs enforcement on raids and enforcement that s why so many immigrants fear that cooperating with law enforcement could lead to deportation for their family members which keeps communities across chicago less safe we must work to close these loopholes in the ordinance and continue to stand up to the trump administration s cruel immigration policies ethics should the inspector general have the power to audit and review city council programs operations and committees why or why not maggie o keefe yes while part of this relies upon an inspector general who retains the public trust i support increased oversight and regular audits of all aldermanic offices city council programs operations and committees if city officials have nothing to hide then they have nothing to be afraid of would you employ or have you employed staff in your office who have outside jobs or contracts with entities that do business with the city if so please explain maggie o keefe no and i will lead by example i will have one and only one job to be a true public servant to the 40th ward like our current alderman has shown holding another job especially one where decisions are made that can influence one s own business is a recipe for public corruption and i will not stand for it role model is there a past or current alderman whom you model yourself after or would model yourself after or take inspiration from please explain maggie o keefe there are many progressive aldermen that i admire in this current city council but i think it would do a disservice to say that i want to model myself or my community s leadership on one single person there s too much focus on me and not enough on we in politics so much of our city council s problems stem from aldermen refusing to honestly engage with their constituents and organize them into meaningful action as 40th ward alderman i would serve as my neighbors organizer and be their voice in city council
my experience in germany as a foreign student with a masters degree from a german university kester audu could have stayed put in the european country like many of his contemporaries are wont to do but he chose to return home albeit under a programme jointly implemented by the centre for international migration cim giz and the federal employment agency of germany he speaks with dorcas egede on the attraction and challenges of living and studying abroad and why he chose to return unlike many young nigerians who travel abroad to escape the hardship in their country kester audu a graduate of industrial chemistry from the federal university of technology akure ondo state took the decision to go do his masters degree in germany more out of curiosity and to see what obtains on the other side of life and so to germany he headed after his compulsory one year national youth service corps nysc true to his expectation he did see what obtains on the other side of life starting from the minute he stepped foot on the airport in frankfurt audu realised the reason for the strong pull on young people to go abroad i ve never been so burdened for nigeria as the first time i stepped foot in frankfurt airport that was my first time of actually travelling outside africa i was amazed that human beings could build what i saw there and for me it became like a challenge that if humans could build the kind of airport i saw in frankfurt it means we re sleeping in africa he said having been admitted into brandenburg technical university btu cottbus germany to study environment and resource management audu soon discovered that achieving academic excellence abroad wasn t so much a herculean task as in nigeria i was able to finish my programme in a record time of about 14 months one thing that helped me achieve that was the kind of training i had received in my nigeria school unlike back home here your lectures are flexible you have teachers who interact with you on a personal note you have enough time to do research works and of course lots of text books at your disposal the challenges audu decided on the diary of an international student because of what happens to us africans when we travel abroad many people feel that once they cross the border they automatically make it in life but then how realistic is this expectation considering the challenges international students face while audu admits that international students grapple with economic challenges amidst other challenges he strongly believes that the challenges they face are more social than economic most times the challenges foreign students face abroad is more social for instance by the time you leave here to europe or america for your masters degree you re already gone past the age of students in a masters degree class because you ve spent a lot of time working to save up to travel anyway age is just in the numbers as they say but of course you know that at that age there are also a lot of things that begin to impact on what you want to do now you re probably married and have kids or aged parents who probably cleared their life s savings to make your dream to study abroad come true maybe you even loaned the money to study abroad whatever the case audu says these things add up in no small way to the burden of international students your counterparts in europe america and even china don t face that kind of pressure and these impact on your quality of life and global competitiveness in the long run another social challenge which audu observed foreign students face is in association when you travel abroad the first set of people you meet shape your mentality they shape how you see the society he was fortunate to meet people who nudged him towards starting early to achieve his set goals however not every international student is as fortunate as audu some of them have first contacts who wrongly colour their impression when you meet a black person on the way you definitely want to associate so those people come to you and begin to tell you things about the society things like it s hard you will need to get your residency you will need to get your citizenship you have to marry a white you have to birth a child in the society what now happens is that instead of our students looking to acquire the knowledge skills and network to make them relevant they begin a rat race for survival this is why you can have a phd student who has been doing his program for about five or six years a masters students who has finished one masters program and after three years goes back to do another one not because he s truly seeking for knowledge but because he wants to extend his stay in the society strategy is key audu is therefore of the opinion that those who seek to go abroad either for work or study or as permanent residents must have a strategy many people travel without a plan so when they get there they get stuck and it takes a lot of time meaningful years of their lives before they find some kind of headway i was able to do some kind of humanitarian work in berlin attended a lot of conferences where i met people to improve my network i acquired some very good skills set and became knowledgeable in the issue of sustainability that helps me look at the problem as a whole and not just in part like many of us do that is why we have researchers who have had breakthroughs in their researches but don t have the skill to communicate these breakthroughs to policy makers they don t even understand how policy makers think to be able to adopt that research and use it for the benefit of the society he also thinks the excitement and expectation of people going abroad has to be put in check yes the environment is better off if you want to compare it to what we have in africa but it s not a walk in the park migration malady asked what he thinks is responsible for the inordinate desire of young people to go abroad despite sad tales of migrants drowning in the mediterranean and slavery in libya audu said first of all the issue of migration is not just in part drowning in the mediterranean sea is only part of the story let me tell you some facts about migration that can put this in perspective currently in the world there are 258million migrants in 2000 we had about 173m and in 2018 alone it has risen to 258m according to audu one out of any 30 persons is a migrant 48 of migrants are women and out of this 258m 50m are children he said that one fact about migration that most international media don t talk about is that most migrants move through safe and legal means continuing he added migration should be an engine for economic growth and entrepreneurship anywhere in 2017 alone migrants spent approximately 450m in remittances to developed countries now this is three times the amount spent globally on development aid noting that a huge sum of migrants earnings are pumped into their host countries economies audu said migrants spend 85 of their earnings in their host countries so it s the other 15 that they try to send back home audu said people migrate because they are looking for better opportunities he however strongly believes that if nigerians had access to basic amenities to make them comfortable in their country they won t need to go anywhere it was shocking to me when i got to germany and realized that many people there see africa as a country they don t know much about us what does that tell you it s possible for child to be born in germany and hasn t visited more than four or five countries what this portends is that where people find opportunities fulfilment and full expression of their liberties and rights they may not have any cause to leave those places so when you see young people on this side of africa who maybe because they cannot afford to go through legal means like going to school and stuff like that want to go abroad by all means just know that they must have perceived their socio economic conditions as very bad i say perceived because it s not like going through the illegal means is cheap many of them have savings but they just feel that the return on their investment will be higher if they find themselves on other shores audu attributes this belief to misinformation the media what we see in the movies many people don t know that there are beggars on the streets of new york or that there are homeless people in europe movies will not actually show you all that but the fine cars and houses and the colourful ambience one sided narrative but audu believes that the migration story is not told in a balanced manner it is told in such a way that makes it look as if migrants cost their host countries a fortune but they fail to talk about how robust their economies become because of migrants if you re telling us about the remittances to developing countries also tell us what goes out to developed countries because of migrants activities for instance the german policy requires that the student who wants to study there would have to have at least 8 000 euros opened in a german account so imagine you have 500 students who leave nigeria to study in germany multiply 500 by 8 000 euros you know how much that is into their economy what the international community is doing for me another thing that strengthened my resolve to return home which is something for which i really give credit to the german government is that as part of their plans towards solving some of these migration issues they created a platform such that after you ve studied and trained in germany if you choose to go back home wherever you find yourself or whatever you want to do they will give you certain kind of support for some period of time now imagine if other countries adopted that kind of strategy those of us who chose to return on the platform provided by the german government were few at first but now the network has grown and we are close to 30 already the united nations is talking about what they call the global pact for safe orderly and regular migration that is the new agenda of the un and it has clear objectives to make migration safe and regular to address the concerns the of the government and to reinforce national sovereignties to recognise the vulnerabilities faced by migrants who travel through these irregular means to make known the benefits of migrants to their host countries what our government can do to solve migration problems audu says the government can do a lot with our growing population we have to create jobs the government has to engage the teeming youthful population and we have to throw open the manufacturing space we can t make jokes about manufacturing nigeria is one of the biggest markets for automobiles yet how many cars do we manufacture the manufacturing sector is a sector that can absorb people in numbers we have to develop vocational skills our graduates are not even well groomed for the labour market so vocational skill isn t something we should take lightly another thing we must take seriously is agriculture soon the world will begin to look to africa for food security we have the land the weather the human capital so what the government needs to do is take care of basic things such as power job creation etc and once people are engaged they begin to find fulfilment at least they have the ability to feed and shelter themselves just the basic necessities of life the health sector must be revamped if someone is sick he should be able to have a health insurance that helps him this is why people don t want to return home because those basic things are catered for abroad this is why a nigerian will do anything to be the citizen of another country this is why you have a lot of elites and the middle class wanting to have their children abroad once those things are fixed i m telling you you won t have people thronging abroad the way they do according the young man the government needs to brace up they need to set up policies that make things work they need to strengthen ties with our diasporas and tap into that network they need to strengthen policies health care policies set up educational policies that achieve four important things namely 1 make us know more about ourselves our family background history of our country and continent many of us don t even know where we are from 2 help us study our environment economically politically socially geographically 3 help us identify our problems and 4 we have to develop an educational system that will help individuals to solve these problems that have been identified because that is one thing we are lacking we know the problems but many lack those critical problem solving skills
fears of an imminent recession which caused major turbulence in financial markets at the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019 have eased a bit that s the good news the bad news is what that episode exposed for much of 2018 it appeared that the world economy was finally getting out of the rut it had been stuck in for the decade since the global financial crisis but it now looks as if the era of persistently low growth low inflation and low interest rates isn t over after all in the past week alone the european central bank said that economic risks had moved to the downside and the bank of japan cut its projections for inflation the federal reserve will hold a policy meeting tuesday and wednesday and is likely to leave its interest rate target unchanged its leaders could also discuss their broader strategy for making monetary policy which may include keeping more of their giant portfolio of bonds accumulated during its years of stimulus efforts than analysts had once expected
people s palace beijing 12th december 2018 past 16 00 the emperor of xxi century china makes his entrance to meet a group of former heads of state from asia africa latin america and europe we stood on prearranged spots for the official photo after which we proceeded to an adjacent room for the meeting we had been asked pls do not take photos during the meeting a very reasonable request would elderly leaders behave like tourists click their digital devices in a solemn setting much to my surprise i counted three former presidents who didn t resist the temptation to pull their cell phones and began filming i use the expression emperor xi jinping without for a moment meaning it to be pejorative the chinese president is certainly not elected via way of an american style election campaign but he is carefully scrutinised selected and accountable to his peers in the communist party central committee with calm and charm president xi talked from prepared notes ad libbing time to time and making eye contact with his attentive audience he elaborated on the 40 years of progress since den xiaoping opened up the country and freed the people from an inefficient state controlled economy and on the new silk road and the international bank of infrastructure two very ambitious initiatives aiming at connecting asia and europe using the old land silk road and new maritime silk road one has to admit this requires vision audacity political courage and iron will displaying diplomatic finesse of a true statesman president xi did not once criticise or even mention the us by name while emphasising china s strong adherence to international cooperation and multilateralism adding with apparent genuine modesty that china is still a developing country even though it is the second world s economy xi jinping exudes self confidence is very measured and refined in gestures and words president trump blusters and bluffs talks obscenities insults other world leaders allies and neighbours reneges international treaties launches punitive trade wars against historical partners like canada france germany uk japan etc undermines traditional us alliances nato and the eu adds fuel to the firestorms of european nationalism xi jinping governs over 1 400 000 000 people and manages the second world s largest economy that dwarfs the combined economies of chinas past invaders colonisers and looters the western democracies that today preach china about democracy and human rights in a not too distant past notices of no dogs and chinese allowed were plastered by the british on fancy restaurants clubs and many other public places across china in response to china s refusal to buy opium produced in india by the british britain unleashed the opium wars of 1839 1842 and of 1839 1832 studies by reputable economists show that in 1820 china s economy was the largest in the world and in this was the case for centuries up to the second opium war causing chinese share of the global gdp to drop by half tens of millions of extremely poor chinese migrated and built railways and roads toiling in slave like conditions building western empires but chinese did not suffer only in the hands of westerners as recently as 90 s chinese were murdered with impunity in indonesia display of chinese characters on front shops were not allowed and chinese new year celebrations were banned all this changed in any given day legions of chinese tourists recycle millions of us dollars in hotels restaurants souvenir shops and duty free stores across the world xi jinping does preside over the oldest world s continuous territorial domain home of a 5 000 year old civilisation the majestic great wall and the very recent landing on the unseen side of the moon two facts and worlds apart in time and space dramatically illustrate the great man made achievements of an extraordinary people millions of factory workers churn out cheap products flooding markets in asia africa and latin america they know there are several billion people earning between 1 and 5 a day who cannot afford to buy expensive shoes clothing backpacks pencils bicycles for their children even lesser affluent americans and europeans buy cheap chinese goods or fake brands the cold war concocted by the usa and the ussr was fought on the ground via their respective proxies fools in the third world took sides some opting to be us vassals while others sealed their fate with the soviets having chosen the idiocy of a workers paradise that never was in the process millions of innocent people were killed in prisons labor camps and wars in congo somalia angola mozambique nicaragua el salvador guatemala vietnam cambodia laos indonesia etc when in 1990 the berlin wall came down and the cold war ended many a naive people believed that a new age of principles would be ushered in and all would live for ever after in peace and harmony nuclear arsenals would be dismantled arms industries become obsolete merchants of death cease their immoral transactions american capitalism and western liberalism having triumphed over communist dogmas and gulags human rights would be respected the world over and a wave of democracy would swept away tyrants of left and right the euphoria was short lived the two main nuclear powers continued rivals and enemies as ever the american liberal president obama sudden winner of a nobel peace prize for crafting eloquent speeches and promises actually launched a sweeping modernisation of us nuclear forces obama promised much to the palestinians raised their expectations and delivered zero in eight years israel continues to dictate us middle east policies arabs found common cause with israel and donald trump against iran presumably the greatest menace to the world arab solidarity with the palestinian cause continues to be a mere lip service china and russia never pretended to adhere to the principles and values of human rights at least as articulated by the liberal west that focusses almost exclusively on civil and political rights while consigning economic and social rights to a mere footnote though russia is today far better for many russians it has not been able to transform an economy overly dependent on energy commodities like oil and gas into manufacturer and exporter of high quality goods china did experience a brief contagion of the freedoms sweeping eastern europe in the 90 s it maintained the one party system recovered macao and hongkong and launched an ambitious modernisation program that catapulted china from impoverished third world status to second largest economy of the world i visited china for the first time more than 40 years ago mao tse tung mao zedong was barely alive and died that year on 9th september premier zhou en lay mao s loyal right hand died in january 1976 a month earlier in december 1975 i had landed for the first time in the fabled new york city to plead the cause of timor leste to the un security council i was 26 years old had never being to a major city and had never seen snow before i didn t like the cold and detested the snow as i had to struggle not to fall whenever i walked the few hundred meters from then cheap decaying tudor hotel to the un visiting china as an official guest i was installed at beijing hotel from my window i would look down at the street below and saw tens of thousands of people moving on bicycles or on foot men and women wearing the dull mao uniform i counted the number of the national black sedans of senior party officials literally the only vehicles moving in beijing at age 26 i was a novice on china and on world issues but i could feel in january 1976 that a chapter of post 1949 china was coming to an end the great leap forward an ill conceived rapid industrialisation launched by mao 1957 1960 coupled with unfavourable weather resulted in the death of millions of rural peoples this was followed by the cultural revolution madness 1966 1976 that victimised countless innocent people and tore apart families among the victims were important chinese leaders like den xiaoping the reversal of fortunes could not have been more dramatic from the chinese gulag emerged the great reformer father of modern china deng xiaoping who took over the top leadership of the state in 1978 1989 deng xiaoping s genius was his decisive break with mao era economic orthodoxies and the bold decision to open up the country to foreign investment the china of 1976 that i knew was catapulted from abject poverty to world power status in four decades den xiaoping coined a phrase that still defines chinese economic system socialism with chinese characteristics whatever the correct academic label attached to the experiment the facts are 700 million chinese were freed from extreme poverty and 400 million now belong to the middle income group officially there are still 30 million poor chinese 10 million will graduate this year from extreme poverty in any given day millions of chinese are recycling the us dollar in hotels bars restaurants duty free shops across the globe they are buying passports or permanent residence in europe and australia and purchasing land farms factories ports high tech industries no one asks this question if china is a malignant dictatorship if millions of chinese tourists freely travel around the world tens of thousands of chinese students who are enrolled and bring in millions of dollars to starving western universities why we don t see stampedes seeking asylum in the west they all the return home the temptation of the west is no greater than attachment to their own country and the relative freedom and prosperity they are enjoying now china does face complex challenges residues of american and british imperialism and the cold war besides the issue of north korea and its nuclear ambitions at china s doorsteps there are the issues of taiwan and south china sea and sensitive relations with other claiming states china is obviously as interested in a denuclearised north korea as the us or japan and knows how to deal with the north koreans better than anyone and are doing it their way with economic inducements investments trade and multibillion cash payouts vital to the regime and its immense standing army if north korea ever denuclearises it will be primarily thanks to china and to president moon of south korea president trump may enjoy photo opportunities with kim jong un but the north korean regime and its vast powerful military are more trustful of and dependent on china than on any us president north koreans and chinese know that president trump is as unpredictable as unreliable and will be consumed by multiple legal and political problems in the next two years it is very unlikely that we will see a denuclearised north korea during trump s presidency one issue that unifies all chinese is taiwan a residue of the chinese civil war that ended in 1949 with the defeat of the kuomintang kmt forces who fled to the island and from there claimed to be the legitimate government of all of china taiwan is no more entitled to independence from mainland china than hawaii or alaska are entitled to separation from the us chinese sovereignty on taiwan is indisputable and enjoys universal recognition but beijing knows that there is no discernible alternative to a protracted process of peaceful reunification the us could help in this reunification process if it were to refrain from selling sophisticated weapons to taiwan the same time chinese conduct in hongkong influences perceptions and attitudes amongst taiwanese in regards reunification so it is in china s interest to carefully manage developments in hk avoiding making every dissident or every lonely pro independence dreamer a martyr the vast majority of hk chinese are not in favour of independence and all know too well how the territory s financial wealth is at the whim of beijing as long ad beijing tolerates on south china sea i do not see how china could successfully argue its claims under international law other claimants do not appear ready either to compromise on their sovereign entitlement in the meantime the us uk and australia should refrain from introducing naval and aerial elements that have zero deterrence value and will only surely escalate tensions and risk conflict it is laughable that the uk the chinese remember the british opium wars paralysed by brexit demagogues and liars would send a warship to south china sea as a presumed deterrence of course australia had to show its provincial minded loyalty to the crown and sent off a vessel or two to join the british little flotilla by staying out of the area the us and its allies might have a better chance to play a facilitation role encouraging claimant states to work towards a temporary long term regional regime governing the area without prejudicing their respective sovereign claims the chinese leadership with a long historical memory is not oblivious to the challenges and strategic fragilities they face on multiple fronts a rising india with a young population being one such challenge will china and india be able to forge a balanced strategic partnership or will they remain as it has been the case for decades mutually suspicious and rivals neither can afford nor can asia and the world afford to have china and india as strategic rivals and enemies leaders of the two asian giants owe it to their own peoples and to the world that they forge a partnership that ensures peace and prosperity for all the us should seek stable relationships as equals with both china and india abandon the discredited containment strategy of the past a mere fancy wishful thinking in 1976 i saw an impoverished china a profoundly traumatised people what a difference 40 years have made for china for the the world desirous to win friends and allies in asia china is investing real effort good will and dollars in this endeavour but to succeed it cannot be the elephant in a china shop and the way it conducts itself in south china sea is a major test the bi polar world of the cold war period centred on two asymmetric powers the usa economic and nuclear superpower and russia whose super power status was based solely on the number of its nuclear warheads not on economic and financial strength today s bi polar world clearly oscillates between two economic superpowers the us and the world s new economic superpower china but there is another global power lurking nearby in three decades from now we might have a tri polar world oscillating between washington beijing and delhi

the consequences of venezuela s economic humanitarian and political crisis have been dramatic an economy in free fall food shortages medical emergencies millions of people displaced the crisis reached a turning point wednesday when opposition leader juan guaidó declared himself interim president the united states and other countries recognized his new role even as president nicolás maduro refused to step down these charts help explain how the country got here collapse of oil economy venezuela is home to the largest proven oil reserves in the world but in recent years widespread mismanagement of its oil wealth caused a sharp decline in its petroleum production and exports deeply damaging the country s economy as venezuela descended into political turmoil just a few years after hugo chávez took office in 1999 he fired thousands of employees at the state run oil company petróleos de venezuela after a controversial strike that essentially rid the company of its experts in oil production and replaced them with people who were loyal to him then in the mid 2000s when oil prices were high chávez pumped the country s oil revenue into social welfare programs including setting domestic gasoline prices so low that consumption soared the plan was unsustainable when global oil prices tumbled from more than 100 a barrel in 2014 to less than 30 at the beginning of 2016 the country s economic woes deepened this is when you saw the economic mismanagement of the last several years combined with a really dramatic drop of oil prices just really start to hurt venezuela s economy said sarah ladislaw director of the energy and national security program at the center for strategic and international studies advertisement over the past six years venezuela s gross domestic product has been halved according to new projections released by the international monetary fund in january as venezuela s economic situation worsened investors stepped back concerned that the government wouldn t be able to repay its debts that decline we ve been watching the last three years was really by virtue of the fact people have not reinvested in new production in venezuela in a long time ladislaw said hyperinflation inflation in venezuela has gone hand in hand with regular people s inability to purchase basic goods as prices soared food and medicine became out of reach for many venezuelans who felt they had no option but to flee last year maduro implemented a new plan to erase five zeros off the country s currency his attempt to confront the rising inflation problem advertisement before maduro s announcement on friday for instance a kilo of peaches or 2 2 pounds cost about 1 1 million bolívares the post s anthony faiola and rachelle krygier wrote in august by tuesday prices had almost doubled surging to 2 1 million old bolívares or 21 new ones late last year the international monetary fund estimated that the country s inflation rate would reach 1 37 million percent by the end of 2018 for 2019 the imf s prediction suggests inflation could reach 10 million percent not all economists agree on the imf s numbers steve hanke a professor at johns hopkins university who measures hyperinflation which occurs when the monthly inflation rate reaches 50 percent told the post s matt o brien in july that you cannot forecast the course and duration of hyperinflations and said that the imf s attempts are irresponsible share this article share in forbes hanke wrote that venezuela s annual hyperinflation reached 80 000 percent in 2018 calling it devastating but not as extreme as the imf s forecasts medical setbacks venezuela once made significant progress in reducing its infant mortality rate and pledged to do even more but research published thursday in the lancet global health journal estimated that the mortality rate for infants in venezuela grew from 15 deaths per 1 000 live births in 2008 to 21 1 in 2016 the study s lead researcher jenny garcía told the post that venezuela lost 18 years of progress advertisement she and her colleagues blame the decline on cuts to health care funding and they expect that as new data emerges for 2017 and 2018 the rate will only continue to rise as venezuela has struggled with the reemergence of diseases such as diphtheria which they had once controlled the model they used was conservative garcia said adding that she is confident that it s going to be worse than what we are showing fleeing population all of these factors contributed to venezuelans decisions to leave the country causing one of the largest migration crises in the region s history the brunt of the burden fell on nearby countries colombia deployed troops to their border after hundreds of thousands of venezuelans had crossed into the country by

telegram gazette worcester ma jan 27 worcester the economy is booming unemployment is low and a silver tsunami of baby boomers the wealthiest generation in u s history are beginning to retire and make decisions about their long term health care it seems like it would be a good time to be in the nursing home business but in reality senior care advocates workers and even residents say the industry is in a financial crisis in massachusetts according to the massachusetts senior care association an advocacy organization for skilled nursing facilities 20 nursing homes closed in the last year and more than half of the 401 nursing facility providers in the state are operating in the red it s pretty clear that most nursing homes are struggling said sandra mahoney administrator at christopher house christopher house posted a slight deficit in 2018 after making a slight profit in 2017 according to the nonprofit s tax returns ms mahoney said she has been a nursing home administrator for just over 20 years this climate is the most challenging she said steven raso principal of landmark management solutions an owner operator and manager of four skilled nursing centers including st francis rehabilitation and nursing center in worcester agreed with ms mahoney massachusetts is the state you go to for the best higher education the best acute care needs the best biomedical jobs said mr raso he said st francis is operating at the industry average a 2 percent loss this year but if you want to grow old here camillo quitadamo is one of the 40 000 nursing facility residents daily in the state who is growing old here he can spot a dedicated nursing home worker the 91 year old resident of christopher house in worcester observed it s the interest they take in you he added a lot of them refer to me as papa you ve got some real nice people here they treat you like family certified nursing assistant hawa williams also spoke of the family setting at christopher house in fact her mother and sister also work at the nursing home i love it here the interaction with the patients ms williams 34 said i come to work and it s like you re home but workers like ms williams are often hard to find and mr quitadamo notices it s a shame they can t get them more help mr quitadamo continued if you could pay them just a little bit more there wouldn t be so much change the ones that don t care don t stay although mr quitadamo stressed he is very satisfied now he said he worries this lack of help could eventually affect his care it s too bad we can t get help it s not just here it s all nursing homes mr quitadamo said my story is really if we could get more help things would go a heck of a lot better legislators are starting to pay attention everyone knows someone who is in a nursing home or will be in a nursing home at some point said state senate president emerita harriette chandler who filed legislation last week to help nursing homes if these closures continue we are going to have a very serious emergency not a problem an emergency on our hands and as a result of this emergency advocates say people like mr quitadamo and ms williams will suffer the residents suffer the staff suffers and the staff are mostly minority and female and i don t have a magic wand to fix this said robert oriol chief executive officer of oriol health care oriol health care which mr oriol said posted a moderate loss last year owns and operates holden rehabilitation and skilled nursing center in holden and oakdale rehabilitation and skilled nursing in west boylston we try to make smart choices and think we do and we are going to survive and put residents first nursing home economics 101 nursing home economics is complicated but to try to simplify things nursing homes traditionally rely on two separate services with separate revenue streams the traditional long term nursing home care is typically used by patients who are more likely to be older to have dementia or other cognitive impairments and to be totally dependent on assistance for activities of daily living such as bathing eating and more for these patients the nursing home is their residence and they either pay privately or more typically depend on medicaid known in massachusetts as masshealth to pay for their care nursing homes and facilities also serve short term patients seeking rehabilitative services this generally younger healthier patient returns home after a brief stay and generally pays with medicare or a health maintenance organization the problem advocates say is medicaid reimbursement rates which are based on 2007 costs don t fully cover the cost of daily care the typical medicaid participating nursing facility will see an annual 900 000 in uncompensated care according to the msca the medicaid shortfall in massachusetts is among the highest in the nation but the state has a 1 billion surplus according to gov charlie baker when you finally have money you pay the bills said mr raso the state has been ducking paying the long term care industry for the last 10 years now that they have a significant surplus it s time to pay this bill historically short term and private paying individuals offset the shortfall in medicaid payments however the balance between medicaid and other payment sources has shifted in recent years in 2011 an average of 66 percent of nursing home patients statewide depended on medicaid while 15 percent paid with medicare 14 percent paid privately and 5 percent paid from other sources according to the msca in 2017 the organization said an average of 69 percent of nursing home patients statewide depended on medicaid while 13 percent paid with medicare 13 percent paid privately and 5 percent paid from other sources that shift may not seem that dramatic but it is coupled with an almost 25 percent cumulative reduction in short term skilled nursing facility stays in that time which has led to a 300 million decline in revenue since 2011 according to the msca before the impact of the affordable care act enacted in 2010 the average short term stay was 21 to 23 days according to the msca but among other factors accountable care organizations have been trying to control the number of days in rehabilitation post aca the average stay is less than 14 days the organization said moreover nursing homes are financially penalized if they don t have 94 percent occupancy the industry median is an occupancy of 90 percent according to the msca prior to the 20 closures occupancy was at 85 percent the organization said finally the rise in other treatment options such as home care and assisted living suggest trends of nursing homes increasingly serving masshealth patients will continue a lot of folks when they need our care they have exhausted private resources said ms mahoney the result is that already slim operating margins are crunched further said advocates between 2014 and 2017 profit margins peaked in 2015 at 1 percent for the average nursing home in the state according to the msca in 2017 the average facility posted a 1 6 percent loss and the more masshealth patients the lower the profit margins according to the msca for facilities with 50 percent or more masshealth patients profits peaked at 5 percent in 2015 in 2017 they were at 2 1 percent the average facility with 75 percent or more masshealth patients came closest to making a profit in 2015 by only losing 7 percent in 2017 those facilities lost an average of 3 2 percent this medicaid shortfall has been going on for years said matt salmon chairman of the board of the msca and also ceo of salmon health and retirement a family owned senior care provider with local facilities in worcester northbridge and northboro the company as a whole was profitable in 2018 although its nursing homes operated in the red mr salmon reported it has been in an acute stage for the last two or three years and will be worse if we don t change things we ve predicted a colossal collapse coming in massachusetts and it s here now care and its costs so what does this colossal collapse look like one impact is on staffing nursing homes spend three quarters of every dollar on staff wages and benefits for the 77 000 total employees in the sector according to the msca eleven cents is spent on general expenses operating expenses 8 cents is spent on the physical plant and 6 cents is spent on administration most of our costs are human costs said ms mahoney the impact of minimum wage and trying to remain competitive for nurses and certified nursing assistants is costly nursing homes are also competing for workers particularly cnas who provide the direct care with other health care providers not constrained as much by medicaid reimbursements cnas at a nursing home where 68 percent of residents depend on medicaid earn an average of 14 33 an hour according to the msca comparatively a home health aide who has an average of 42 percent of his or her patients on medicaid can earn an average of 16 45 an hour a hospital with an average of 20 percent of patients on medicaid can pay a cna 17 20 per hour so nursing homes increasingly compete with other entry level employers for workers we can t get staff because we re competing with dunkin donuts said mr raso noting that dunkin can pay 16 an hour feeding an elderly person who may be demented and combative is much more difficult than pouring coffee and the pay structure should respectively correlate to that level of difficulty as a result there were 630 unfilled positions representing 14 3 percent of direct care nursing jobs in worcester county in 2018 according to the msca we re not letting them go unfilled we can t fill them said mr salmon ms mahoney said it takes two to three times longer than normal to fill jobs in every department at christopher house and a minimum wage increase of 1 which is an effective 9 percent increase will further depress profits said mr raso if we re already at 2 percent it will take us to 3 percent and the industry will hit the rocks said mr raso you re going to see more buildings close but perhaps most importantly nursing home advocates worry this is starting to affect care in fact 21 percent of nursing homes in massachusetts have or have considered closing admissions because of a staffing shortage according to the msca the number of deficiency free facilities deficiencies include everything from expired milk in the fridge to serious patient care issues has also dropped in the last three years a high of 32 percent of nursing facilities were deficiency free in 2013 13 percent were deficiency free in 2017 according to the msca so many open positions rely on temporary nurses said msca president tara m gregorio but she notes temporary workers often don t know patients and the staff you can see poor outcomes sometimes in fact nursing facilities that care for more medicaid patients have lower quality ratings more deficiencies and less staff than facilities with low numbers of medicaid patients according to the msca nursing facilities with less than 50 percent of residents on medicaid received an average of 4 4 stars on the centers for medicare and medicaid services five star quality rating system in 2017 and had an average of 3 2 deficiencies facilities with more than 75 percent of medicaid patients received an average of 2 9 stars on the rating system and had an average of 7 2 deficiencies the statewide average ranking is 3 4 stars with six deficiencies the facilities with less dependency on medicaid also had more staff so nursing homes like christopher house have had to get creative hiring new graduates rather than experienced cnas emphasizing the family atmosphere that appeals so much to ms williams and mr quitadamo and hosting student clinicals to make a job offer as seamless as possible nursing homes are also looking to legislators for help ms chandler has filed legislation proposing to create a 13 member emergency nursing home task force to make policy recommendations to ensure the financial stability of the nursing homes in the state i feel we re at a crisis level said tim foley executive vice president of 1199 service employees international union which represents approximately 3 000 nursing home workers and is promoting the legislation we need to come together and come up with solutions as we integrate nursing home systems into our health care delivery system the union and the industry have to work together to come up with solutions to this crisis ms chandler has also filed an act relative to stabilizing the commonwealth s nursing facilities legislation proposing to increase medicaid reimbursement rates for nursing homes by updating them to reflect 2017 costs the legislation also proposes updating the medicaid reimbursement to reflect annual inflation and establishing a grant program to financially assist entry level nursing home workers trying to advance their careers boy is it needed said ms chandler we really need to invest in our nursing home facilities to support our seniors and as i get older i see this in very personal terms ms gregorio and mr salmon estimate updating rates using 2017 costs will cost 75 million half of which would be reimbursed by the federal government adjusting the medicaid reimbursement to reflect annual inflation of 2 percent would cost an estimated 34 million they said finally the organization also seeks to adjust the occupancy penalty so that it reflects the median occupancy of 90 percent in nursing homes rather than 94 percent that would cost approximately 85 million mr foley was optimistic the legislation would be enacted noting that similar legislation for a task force nearly made it over the finish line last year he also praised mr baker s 2020 budget which allocates 38 3 million for increasing wages to retain and recruit workers in the industry our workers are the most caring people in the world mr foley said they want to provide good quality care and want to make sure families loved ones are taken care of in their senior years we know the best solutions to improving care in nursing homes hospitals and home care is in workers back at christopher house on thursday however legislation and political advocacy were not on mr quitadamo s mind he was visiting with his favorite cna sheila spellman his go to for helping him get out of bed and shaving in the morning we have a beautiful system between us no arguing mr quitadamo said smiling and ms spellman said she couldn t think of any other job she would rather do than help her patients it s my way of sharing who i am to other people ms spellman said he takes the place of my late dad he reminds me a lot of my dad ___ c 2019 telegram gazette worcester mass visit telegram gazette worcester mass at www telegram com distributed by tribune content agency llc
the tourism sector in egypt suffered a downturn since the 2011 revolution and the sector in egypt suffered a devastating blow especially when a russian passenger plane crashed in sinai in late october 2015 and all its passengers were killed notably following the plane crash russia imposed a travel ban on egypt while the uk suspended all flights to sharm el sheikh amid concerns over the airport s security measures banning travel to sinai meanwhile since 2018 the sector began to revive again regaining its position once more as egypt is a country strategically located on both the mediterranean and red seas with incredible gorgeous sandy beaches astonishing landscapes a warm winter climate and undoubtedly the world s largest collection of historical sites temples pyramids and artefacts thus earlier minister of tourism rania al mashat said earlier that the number of tourists to egypt increased by 40 during the first nine months of 2018 9m18 compared to the same period last year furthermore an overwhelming majority of tourism experts are projecting that 2019 is the year of opportunities for the tourism sector thus daily news egypt dne was eager to learn from the minister of tourism rania al mashat about the ministry s upcoming plans notably the minister stated during the 2019 world economic forum s annual meeting in davos that 2018 was one of the strongest years for egypt s tourism asserting that the ministry aims to further boost the sector during 2019 al mashat told dne that the ministry s vision is based on reaching a sustainable tourism sector through implementing structural reforms which will strengthen the sector s competitiveness and are with international standards my ultimate objective as the minister of tourism is to eventually have at least one individual from each egyptian household working either directly or indirectly in the tourism sector she added in terms of the government s plans which aim to develop the tourism sector the minister noted that there is a structural reform programme which includes different pillars such as institutional reforms legislative reforms promotion and marketing activities infrastructural and tourism development as well as the global trends programme al mashat revealed we are also looking forward to complete developmental projects in 67 touristic areas through expanding egypt s current capacity of 89 993 hotel rooms to a total of 238 114 rooms by completing the ongoing construction of 55 121 rooms in touristic areas as well as fostering the construction of additional 183 000 rooms subject to the supervision of the ministry s tourism development authority tda she further elaborated in addition to enhancing the existing infrastructure in the tda s touristic areas to include 168 water desalination stations with capacity of 222 516 cubic metres per day 226 sewage treatment stations 508 electric generators and stations with a capacity of 380 2mw 478km of road network as well as technical and financial support for urban touristic destinations in governorates which are excluded from the tda s jurisdiction in order to create new job opportunities moreover al mashat pointed out that the ministry is planning to set a strategy for sustainable tourism development to extend until 2030 which aims to diversify egypt s tourism product increase the number of tourists nights in the country as well as create direct and indirect employment with the community s integration discussing egypt s touristic base the minister declared that the ministry aims to diversify the revenue streams and increase the sector s resilience by attracting new markets she explained that this could be achieved through increasing promotional efforts in new source markets including asia particularly china east europe especially ukraine and latin america this could be carried out through organising workshops with arab states particularly countries of the gulf cooperation council in order to determine the most effective promotion tools in addition to participating in national and international conferences to promote egypt as an attractive and an all year long touristic destination she revealed that during the period from january to october 2018 european tourists represented 61 of the total number of tourists who visited egypt during that period while tourists from the middle east represented 21 68 africa only 7 15 asia with 5 62 and america with 3 94 while other countries represented only 0 61 furthermore the minister stated we are also seeking to launch a people to people p2p campaign which will portray egypt not only as a prime touristic destination but will also shed light on the diversity of the egyptian people by showcasing egyptians who master various disciplines to include art sports music and culinary activities the p2p intends to shift tourists perception on the one hand and encourages community engagement on the other hand al mashat explained she ensured that sustainable tourism is not just about places but is also about the people and communities living in those locations the ministry is also looking forward toward promoting the opening of the grand egyptian museum one of the largest museums in the world moreover al mashat stated that the ministry seeks also to adopt modern digital and competitive promotion approaches through branding by destination creating an identity for each of egypt s tourism destinations in addition to launching new campaigns in order to showcase egypt s contemporary dimension she also assured that utilising the ministry s presence at international travel exhibitions in order to employ its full promotional potential while focusing on quality not quantity is very important our goal is to improve and elevate the skillset of the tourism sector s workforce through different procedures such as cooperating with the private sector technical and vocational education training reaching out to donors and supporting civil society organisations in order to conduct training courses to improve employee skills and also through rehabilitating and restructuring the ministry s training centres she declared moreover al mashat continued this is in addition to building a pool of accredited trainers and specialists in the various tourism fields developing and updating the training programmes according to the latest international standards and establishing a unified accreditation system in order to ensure a streamlined standard of qualification for the entire workforce which will be issued by the ministry likewise the minster explained that her ministry also plans to ensure that the quantity of the workforce and its quality meet the labour market s needs by implementing a plan to enhance the graduates of hotel and tourism faculties qualifications in order to meet the sector s requirements over and above al mashat stated that the sector will also be enhanced through developing specialised technical training programmes for graduates and job seekers in various tourism fields setting criteria for job admissions in cooperation with the responsible chamber conducting comprehensive assessments of the ministry s staff training needs as well as developing programmes in order to enhance the employees soft skills moreover we seek to redefine our partnerships with the various intergovernmental organisations and foreign developmental agencies in order to work toward achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs through identifying crosscutting areas regarding the sdgs and tourism and by identifying national partner ministries to cooperate with on various sustainable tourism projects in addition to pinpointing international partners to collaborate with implementing sustainable tourism projects as well as establish a sustainable tourism unit within the ministry she noted similarly al mashat stated that the government seeks to integrate the local community and enhance their development especially those who live around egyptian cultural heritage sites in collaboration with international donors through implementing a usaid project on sustainable investment in tourism in egypt which aims to link cultural heritage assets to tourism developmental activities and to improve the skills of workers in collaboration with the ministry of antiquities this is in addition to building connections between cultural heritage sites and the surrounding communities in order to provide incentives for the local inhabitants to protect and preserve the sites moreover the project aims to protect and restore cultural heritage sites from damage caused by ground water intrusion and to produce sustainable site management plans for cultural heritage sites in collaboration with the ministry of antiquities she further explained the ministry wants to ensure that existing international grants are utilised effectively in order to meet the ministry s vision through monitoring all the grants provided to the ministry by the various donors reviewing all the bilateral agreements to ensure their effective utilisation and through exploring cooperation opportunities with new donors to make use of foreign expertise she elaborated plus al mashat revealed our plan also includes liaising and supervising the hajj and umrah in order to ensure the successful completion of each season commenting on the private equity fund the minster explained that it aims to restructure financially impaired hotels and other tourism establishments through establishing a hotel development fund in order to provide them with capital which enables the ministry to conduct the necessary investments the ministry is also coordinating with experts in order to manage the fund and with egyptian banks with the purpose of restructuring the debt incurred from the tourism sector s establishments

if the government is able to fine tune its economic policies and adopt counter cyclical measures china can still achieve a robust pace of economic growth this year as long as trade friction risks remain under control the so called middle income trap challenge led to a slowdown in china s growth after 2010 gdp per capita rose from us 3600 in 2007 to almost us 10 000 in 2018 having lost the low cost advantage china must build new industries through innovation and industrial upgrading to support the next phase of its economic development moderation of growth will likely continue until this battle between old and new industries ends the sudden weakening of growth momentum in 2018 is mainly attributable to two new developments one is the government s three economic policy battles cleaning up the environment controlling systemic financial risks and alleviating poverty that were launched in early 2018 all are necessary to improve the quality of economic growth but the first two slowed growth down directly to clean up the environment the government abruptly shut down many high pollution production facilities especially in northern china to reduce financial risks regulatory authorities took measures to control shadow banking transactions this led to a reduction of total social financing and economic activities cooled quickly unexpectedly these policies hit the private sector hard although policymakers did not specifically target private enterprises they typically have lower environmental standards and receive more funding through shadow banking this created disproportionate difficulties for the private sector prompting nation wide debate about its position in the chinese economy the government responded by reversing policy towards the private sector and reiterating its importance in the chinese economy some officials also spoke about competitive neutrality but it remains uncertain how this could be implemented effectively the trade friction with the united states is as yet having limited direct impact on china s trade activities but it is affecting investor confidence and probably delaying planned business investment whether the trade war s full effect estimated at 0 5 1 5 per cent of gdp will materialise depends on how long it drags on and how serious it becomes the economy weakened visibly during the fourth quarter of 2018 but the keqiang index a composite measure of freight credit and power consumption still indicated decent economic growth albeit slower though not significantly than that officially reported more importantly while the manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi dropped below 50 in december 2018 the non manufacturing pmi confirmed robust expansion this is consistent with the general theme of a battle between old and new industries with the government now fine tuning its environmental and financial policies their drag on economic momentum is likely already easing it is also expected that china and the united states will reach some partial agreement on trade friction during the second quarter of 2019 at latest although a full resolution is unlikely in the near future the two governments are probably making deals on balancing bilateral trade imbalances opening up china s services sector and improving protection of intellectual property rights after the global financial crisis chinese policymakers formed a consensus that china should not rely on aggressive fiscal or monetary policy expansions as it did in 2009 but when the economy suffers a downturn the government should still take some counter cyclical measures albeit of a more modest magnitude today the chinese government has limited room to take counter cyclical policies expected policy hikes by the us federal reserve bank in 2019 constrain the people s bank of china s ability to adopt monetary policy easing given limited exchange rate flexibility large liabilities by local governments and affiliated local government investment vehicles limit scope for further fiscal policy expansion and high leverage ratios cap credit and financing growth the government must create greater policy room to strengthen monetary policy independence the people s bank of china should consider either increasing exchange rate flexibility or tightening management of cross border capital flows some policymakers are worried this could increase fiscal risks if the fiscal deficit exceeds 3 per cent of gdp but in reality consolidated government debts are still about 50 per cent of gdp a 3 per cent fiscal deficit should not become a hard constraint for the government high leverage ratios are now perceived as the most serious financial risk in china but as most borrowing is done by state owned enterprises and local government investment vehicles both of which are associated with the government it is unlikely china will experience a so called minsky moment the most effective way of deleveraging would be to shut down zombie firms but this is not easy given social and economic constraints the government could consider setting up a special vehicle to take over some of the borrowing to cut off inefficient financial flows and take more time to deal with stocks this would create room for both financial institutions and the corporate sector to re leverage and grow more than 20 years ago when chinese banks had around 40 per cent bad loan ratios the government established four asset management companies which purchased about 1 4 trillion rmb us 206 billion worth of bad loans from the banks at face value this relieved the banks of their debt burden and enabled the start of a new round of restructuring there s a case for contemplating a return to these measures to ease the burden of the structural adjustment that china has to undertake now yiping huang is professor and deputy dean of the national school of development at peking university

it was a venezuelan juan pablo pérez alfonso one of the founding fathers of opec who described oil as the devil s excrement and his country s dismal recent history proves his point venezuela holds what are generally reckoned to be the world s largest proved oil reserves but mismanagement has sent its economy into freefall and the anger that has been building for years broke out into political chaos this week as opposition leader juan guaidó declared himself interim president nicolás maduro who was this month sworn in as president for a second term after winning a rigged election in may has shown no sign of being ready to step aside and so far he still has the backing of the army the us and canada along with brazil colombia and several other latin american countries recognised mr guaidó as venezuela s interim president prompting mr maduro to say he was breaking off all diplomatic and political relations with the us which he accused of trying to foment a coup the ft s andean correspondent gideon long wrote a useful guide to what to watch for as the crisis unfolds the white house has been considering new sanctions on venezuela s oil industry to increase the pressure on mr maduro but at the time of writing had not taken any action some analysts suggested mr maduro s regime was likely to collapse even without any more of a push from the us venezuela both exports oil to the us and imports ultra light oil to dilute its heavy crude the trump administration could decide to disrupt either or both of those flows although there would be some costs for american companies if it did so the prospect that some us refiners might have to look elsewhere in the world for different and possibly more expensive sources of heavy crude sent their share prices lower the prospect of possible further disruption to venezuela s oil exports has not so far had much impact on global crude prices however on friday brent was trading at about 61 a barrel very close to where it began the week a critical part of the explanation for venezuela s decline lies in the damage done to pdvsa its national oil company when the arab countries nationalised their oil industries in the 1960s and 1970s they managed to retain many of their skills and capabilities after hugo chávez predecessor and mentor of mr maduro was elected president in 1998 there was an exodus of experienced oil workers as pdvsa was packed with political and military appointments and descended into mismanagement and incompetence as the ft s jonathan wheatley put it venezuela s crude production fell to 1 1m barrels a day in december just a third of its level in the mid 2000s it is worth noting that although the decline in oil prices since 2014 has not helped venezuela the depth of its economic slump has not been shared by other petro states over the past 10 years saudi arabia and angola to take two examples of economies that are heavily dependent on oil revenues have outperformed venezuela enormously in terms of economic growth the future of oil in a world shaped by the us shale revolution and the threat of climate change was one of the topics under discussion at the world economic forum annual meeting at davos the panellists included mohammad barkindo secretary general of opec vicki hollub chief executive of occidental petroleum and john hess her counterpart at hess the mood of the discussion seemed convivial mr hess said people should recognise that opec members play a very important role in stabilising the market for oil while mr barkindo observed that the actions of opec and its allies in cutting production since 2016 had helped to rescue the us oil industry separately but also at davos kirill dmitriev chief executive of the government owned russian direct investment fund expressed a similar spirit of peaceful coexistence acknowledging that dreams of crushing the us shale industry were futile for us shale production to go down you need oil prices at 40 per barrel and below that is not healthy for the russian economy he said both ms hollub and mr hess emphasised the new capital discipline of the us shale industry and suggested us oil production growth would slow from last year s breakneck pace ms hollub said not as much money is going to be pouring into the permian basin their comments aligned with a story i wrote about how the flows of capital that have enabled shale companies to pay for their drilling programmes have recently dried up at least for the time being the energy information administration this week published its 2019 annual energy outlook projecting possible future scenarios for the us out to 2050 s p global platts focused on the outlook for oil highlighting the eia s projection based on unchanged policies that record breaking us oil production is expected to continue for decades driven largely by the permian basin however the eia showed different scenarios as possible outcomes ranging from a high output case with us production going over 20m barrels a day by 2040 to a low case with a peak at just under 13m b d that could be only five years away the fact that the eia s projections have often underestimated the growth of us oil production has encouraged expectations that the high output scenario may turn out to be closer to the truth rystad energy meanwhile suggested that us oil production including lighter liquids as well as crude could be more than that of russia and saudi arabia combined by 2025 the eia also forecast that wind and solar power would be the fastest growing sources of new electricity generation in the us for at least the next two years the longer term projections imply a slowdown in the pace of growth in the 2020s but the eia also has a record of underestimating the growth of renewables and many analysts think wind and solar in the us will also end up outpacing the eia forecasts the discussion of climate change at davos by executives who had arrived there by private jet was too obvious an open goal for environmental campaigners to miss it air charter services estimated that there would be almost 1 500 flights by private jets moving in and out of local airfields over the six days around the meeting the wef rejected that figure suggesting there would be only 270 flights during the first three days of the meeting 14 per cent fewer than last year the energy density advantage of oil based fuels over batteries means that aviation will be one of the toughest sectors to move away from hydrocarbons if world oil consumption does go into a declining trend at some point jet fuel is one of the products that is likely to remain in use the longest rocky mountain institute warned in a report this week that the global aviation industry needed a radical new plan to achieve its climate goals because its emissions are growing faster than earlier forecasts suggested and long term solutions are nowhere in sight there is a research and development effort going into electric aircraft however and boeing this week said it had recently held a first test flight for its all electric autonomous passenger air vehicle it was wrote the verge a significant step toward a future in which autonomous electric flying taxis zip from skyscraper to skyscraper a record breaking heatwave has been scorching australia straining the country s power supplies in the state of victoria customers have been hit by rolling blackouts as the heatwave caused unanticipated levels of demand for electricity as the australian energy market operator worked to keep the lights on it ordered alcoa s aluminium smelter in victoria to cut its power usage for about 100 minutes under the system s emergency process lily d ambrosio victoria s energy minister identified shutdowns and reduced output at several of the state s coal and gas fired power plants as critical factors in causing the blackouts the aemo warned that australia s ageing coal plants could be expected to break down more often in the future the question of how to replace that failing capacity is fiercely debated the authorities have been urging customers to limit their demand wherever possible to help keep the grid stable but pauline hanson a senator for queensland who has been described as the donald trump of australia had a different idea on twitter she urged people to go out and start up everything go and start your washing machine ironing vacuum cleaning air conditioning whatever to send a clear message to those out there that the country needed more coal fired power plants meanwhile renewable energy is booming in australia renewable generation on the grid in australia s national electricity market grew from 13 4 per cent in december 2017 to 17 6 per cent in december last year including rooftop solar the renewable share last month was 21 4 per cent of electricity supplied to consumers the estimated number of people killed in the gasoline pipeline explosion in central mexico last week has risen to 107 the explosion is believed to have happened after the pipe was deliberately punctured drawing hundreds of people hoping to collect fuel people talk a lot about the energy transition away from fossil fuels but rarely reflect on how rare it is for the world to give up using a source of energy i wrote about some of the implications of that history with a big debt to richard newell and daniel raimi

greta thunberg the 16 year old swedish climate activist arrived at the world economic forum in davos and was scathing about the transport choices of some of her fellow attendees she has inspired a wave of school strikes and protests around the world including a march with an estimated 35 000 children in brussels on thursday chart of the week this comes from a fascinating report for the oxford institute for energy studies which looks at how expectations of an energy transition away from fossil fuels might be influencing large investors risk preferences the authors say the message from this chart derived from a survey of 26 institutional investors is that expectations of such a transition have started to affect views of required hurdle rates for oil gas and coal projects investors are demanding a higher hurdle rate in order to invest in long cycle oil and coal projects they write there is plenty of room for debate about what their findings really mean but it is an original and important piece of work beyond that headline result the report by bassam fattouh rahmatallah poudineh and rob west also has plenty of other thought provoking insights and is well worth reading in full

london cnn as britain s political impasse sharpens ahead of its march 29 withdrawal date from the european union an idea has gained traction among some brexiteers that britain should become a low tax low regulation and low public spending paradise in the same mold of the tiny southeast asian city state of singapore singapore s admirers include britain s most vociferous of brexiteers like boris johnson michael gove conservative mp owen paterson and entrepreneur james dyson the singapore model was lauded by foreign secretary jeremy hunt on his recent visit to the island nation which is smaller in size than new york city britain can draw encouragement from how singapore s separation from the peninsula did not make it more insular but more open he said during a news conference even some remainers are advocating for it former advertising guru martin sorrell told sky news at davos this week that singapore s independence was not dissimilar to some of the things you hear around brexit took singapore to a level that people never anticipated and made it extremely successful on a much smaller scale 5 million people as opposed to 60 million people in britain but the lessons are there he added at face value it is easy to see why singapore was among the world s poorest nations in 1965 when it became independent of malaysia although it has limited natural resources the country has become one of the world s most advanced ranking higher in 2017 than the uk for gdp per capita at 57 714 versus 39 720 according to the world bank and ranking near or at the top of global indexes for health efficiency education and competitiveness to name but a few the buildings of foreign multinationals loom high on singapore s skyline roslan rahman afp afp getty images state spending while flattered by the new found attention singaporean policy makers seem baffled by the comparisons between two countries with wholly different demographics population size histories and regional locations the top tax rate for earners in the uk is 45 compared to 22 in singapore slashing tax be it corporate or personal in britain will incur a number of knock on effects to its state spending model explained singapore s prime minister lee hsien loong in an interview with bloomberg s editor in chief at the new economy forum in november britain has developed a system of state welfare of government role in the system where the government accounts for 40 to 45 percent of the gdp he said the singapore government accounts for 16 of the gdp maybe 17 so to say that you re going to be like singapore are you going to give up two thirds of your government spending state pensions and national health geography and singapore s successes go much deeper than just a low tax rate for foreign multinationals whose buildings loom high on the country s skyline the tax rate is one very small plank in a giant raft of attractive things about the country singaporean author and economist contributor sudhir thomas vadaketh told cnn singapore straddles one of the busiest commercial shipping routes in the world its geographical location is what drew british colonialists to it in the 19th century two centuries on it has become a major global maritime and financial hub and an integral part of the asian supply chain while the uk is also an important hub itself what it lacks is singapore s strategic advantage of drawing in companies and investment due to its strong rule of law in an otherwise unstable region there are not many places in southeast asia that can offer that much stability and a well educated working population vadaketh said looking towards its neighbors has played a major part of singapore s success kishore mahbubani singapore s former ambassador to the un and professor of public policy at the national university of singapore told cnn the country is one of the founding members of asean which is now a trading bloc of 10 member states and no singaporean government would contemplate because that would be suicidal he said the asean ecosystem is very important for singapore s economy and to leave a peaceful and prosperous neighborhood is not what you want to do the uk meanwhile will find it hard to compete against the eu which even amid the current populist surge is arguably the world s most stable and largest economic bloc small arm small state singapore s small population size of about 3 5 million singaporean citizens has led to a reliance on about 1 6 million foreign nationals equating to close to 36 of the 5 6 million strong population something the british government will struggle to sell to the 17 4 million people nearly 52 of those who voted to leave the eu many of whom cited immigration concerns as their motivation nor is singapore some small state nirvana its government has taken a highly interventionist approach to its economy investing deeply in its nascent industries much of singapore s land is nationalized and more than 80 of the population lives in well built state subsidized public housing that has ethnic quotas which are rigidly enforced something that will be hard to swallow in democratic polities it has a level of intrusiveness that doesn t come comfortably to the liberal mind singapore s deputy prime minister tharman shanmugaratnam told the bbc in 2015 but some say the high level of social cohesion in singapore has come at a price for freedom of expression human rights watch has accused the government of curtailing political speech launching defamation suits enforcing draconian limits on public protest and prosecuting critics of singapore s judiciary under the country s broad contempt of court law that approach has raised the hackles of britain s opposition singapore is a country where basic freedoms of peaceful assembly free speech and even sexuality are not respected but criminalized and where the rule of law routinely means the brutal use of the cane emily thornberry the shadow foreign secretary told the times of london the singaporean government rejected this criticism in a statement to cnn we fully respect the fundamental human rights enshrined in the un charter and the universal declaration of human rights a spokesman for singapore s ministry of foreign affairs said those rights are achieved through our laws and judicial process which are internationally respected singapore s constitution guarantees the right to freedom of speech and expression but the spokesman said the right has constitutional restrictions given that singapore is a multi racial and multi religious society an individual s freedom of speech must be exercised with mutual respect and accord with the need to preserve a harmonious society singapore s authoritarian lite system has allowed its ruling party to stay in power since independence and see through long term policies rather than the short termism seen in democratic countries why did the ibms of the world come here very early on vadaketh said part of the reason is we offered them lots of transparency and tax incentives but we also gave them clarity vadaketh added singapore said hey we are not going to have a change in government in five years some nationalists are not going to come in and steal your assets but at the same time one could argue that the government has prevented reasonable and rational discourse in the public arena which makes it not conducive for the kinds of jobs and industries they are trying to promote here from basic start ups to pharmaceutical research and development he said that aside companies are looking to singapore as the technological center of gravity shifts to asia this week dyson s eponymous business which makes vacuum cleaners and hair dryers announced the relocation of its headquarters to singapore for all the talk of britain becoming the singapore of the west the proponents of that dream are choosing the real singapore instead

complete coverage of the local and national primary and general election including results analysis and voter resources to keep chicago voters informed the sun times editorial board sent the 47th ward aldermanic candidates a list of questions to find out their views on a range of issues facing the city and their ward kimball ladien md submitted the following responses the sun times does not edit candidate responses who is kimball ladien he s running for 47th ward alderman his political civic background in 1968 my first antiwar poem know other way was banned by the lane tech prep in many ways i have spent the last 50 years focused on ways to reduce violence in society ranging from child abuse and domestic violence to gangs and corruption to even war itself in 1972 i received a 99 percentile on the science section of the mcats along with numerous other high scores see bio and cv with these test results in hand i cashed in by spending the next 10 years studying the neuroanatomical neurophysiological neuropharmacological electrophysiological and behavioral correlates of brain information processing not only is the brain the one tool that makes all of the other tools understanding human behavior from the genetic to synaptic to macroeconomic levels was fundamental if these problems were ever to be solved who is hari zeldon during this time i made approximately 3000 year ate lots of potatoes and lived in an electric blanket during the winter when i finally did go to rush medical college i won multiple awards for my work including being one of 15 semi finalists in an hhs competition in preventive medicine for my paper on workfare interventions in the welfare system this was my first formal paper concerning my work on safe haven which has continued now for over 30 years other awards were related to my brain research i will always be also proud that for my first official act as a physician and a medical director i cut in half my salary precisely so that i could devote myself full time to implementing my safe haven programs which i have always done pro bono i have always tried to live a simple life helping others in 1993 i became medical director at st mary s hospital precisely to implement safe haven through out kankakee and surrounding counties in il prior to accepting this position i had already received letters of support for my safe haven programs ranging from then governor jim edgar through then senator carol mosley braun and many in between these letters along with similar ones from all of the major political and business leaders in kankakee and surrounding counties are included as an appendix to my original 1993 safe haven book but as described in safe haven s epilogue the then ceo with a few calls was able to kill over 15 years of work on safe haven dead in its tracks the ceo s rationale was we don t want to be known as the black hospital such is the nature of arrogance stupidity and systematic abusers of power asss fighting asss has been a theme of my work over all of these many years i returned to chicago to become the chair of psychiatry at grant hospital for many years until the hospital closed and my beloved wife sylvia developed leukemia secondary to over radiation both sjh and nw have still criminally refused to release sylvia s cumulative radiation dose crd for 7 years while there is much more to this story suffice it to say that after 19 months of living together in hospital rooms within days of starting then experimental monoclonal antibodies mabs sylvia s blast cells were gone and her vital signs were stable off of pressor meds despite this saint joseph administration and its lawyers sjail deliberately ignored sylvia s multiple advance directives to be full code turned up an unneeded morphine drip and literally watched for seven days as sylvia slowly drowned to death on her own secretions when she could have easily been saved with the most basic standard of care interventions of protecting her airway and breathing the a and b of abc it s like putting down a dog one of sylvia s doctors explained but sylvia was never a dog i tell all who will listen and many who will not that sylvia was not killed by her iatrogenic leukemia sylvia was killed by arrogance stupidity and systematic abuse of power asss but then so too have millions of others over the ages been needlessly killed as well in addition to publishing the 25th anniversary edition of safe haven i have also in 2018 completed its final chapters which i call the chicago project the four goals of which are a gang free drug free full employment economy in america by 2020 safe haven building the cyber city state country world of the future if prevent and super epic building and implementing geip clean renewable energy saving 2 3 trillion year and peace on earth by 2030 starting with the peace paradigm for isis iran and north korea in 2018 just as landing a man on the moon by the end of the decade was a noble goal of a previous generation we can set the four goals of the chicago project as absolutely doable objectives that can help unite not just the country but the world in the process this is what leadership is all about and just as with penicillin what can work in chicago can equally well work in detroit new york and los angeles now and in buenos aires mogadishu and new delhi later safe haven thus reinforces and enhances all of president trump s other job creating initiatives from infrastructure repair to bringing manufacturing jobs back to america and in the process we move from entitlements rights without responsibilities to true empowerment rights with responsibilities at every level of society similarly the 2 3t yr of savings from geip can not only help people in america and around the world using geip as leverage as part of the peace paradigm we can not only stop terrorism in 2019 but truly achieve genuine peace on earth by 2030 as well all of these proposals are strong medicine but can work well if only used wisely simply put just as with good science and good preventive medicine we can and must move beyond politics as usual to truly good government not just in the united states but around the world if we are to fix the system and fight arrogance stupidity and systematic abuse of power asss at all levels of society from crime and corruption through terrorism and even war itself again for the good of the nation and the world i will gladly give you and president trump the simple equation underlying geip in return for your agreements to help support the chicago project on a bipartisan basis to help bring the country together while sylvia would never want to the taj mahal as a legacy she very much would appreciate sharing genuine peace with all of god s children with geip powered desalinization plants we can literally turn deserts into gardens in the middle east and far beyond with safe haven we can offer people jobs and hope instead of funerals and despair we can all stop the carnage now not just in america but around the world and in the process if we can fight asss and build a true win win system for all profound good will have been done as i ended my safe haven book almost 25 years ago alone we can accomplish little working together we can change the world let these be goals truly worthy of us all so it shall be

for your ward kimball ladien two questions for all candidates for mayor and alderperson reduce crime cut taxes improve academic outcomes top 5 worldwide for entire city if the only thing we do in 2019 is to implement the afterschool programs for our children and job programs for all individuals on probation and parole we can easily reach the initial goal of reducing gang crime and murders 50 and help make chicago a model for the country on the way towards achieving a gang free drug free full employment economy in america by the year 2020 that saves lives and billions of tax dollars significantly improving education and business outcomes while dramatically reducing crime in the process this would be a true win win for all americans question 1 implementing safe haven afterschool and job programs before 2 26 19 if i can show you precisely how to implement these afterschool and job programs to save lives and millions of tax dollars in 2019 will you agree to all stand together and demand that rahm implement these afterschool programs for our children now global energy independence program geip clean renewable energy that saves 2 3 t yr geip is based upon a very simple equation that can provide a clean and renewable energy source that on a global scale can save 2 3 trillion year of the 5 7 trillion spent annually primarily on carbon based energy sources geip is proposed to be gifted to the people of america and the world with the understanding that the first demonstration site for these programs will be in illinois illinois could thus be saving literally billions of dollars annually while helping the environment businesses and the great hard working tax payers and citizens of illinois while being a model for the country and world question 2 sharing and implementing geip on a bipartisan basis universal healthcare and education if i share geip with cardinal cupich chief judge tim evans or some similar individual will you each agree to call on not only rahm but gov rauner and gov elect jb pritzker to help implement these programs on a bipartisan basisasap again saving lives and billions of tax dollars in the process recent civic work please tell us what you have done in the last two years to serve the city your neighborhood or a civic organization please be specific kimball ladien since sylvia s murder on 2 4 12 i have reached out to all of the major politicians on the state county and city level seeking support for my bipartisan contract for illinois to reduce gangs drugs dropouts abuse and joblessness saving lives and billions of tax dollars in the process when i first discussed these proposals with chief justice timothy evans he suggested and i wholeheartedly agreed that we should start with the children i have attached two protocols sent to chief justice evans concerning alternative sentencing for both children and adults also in 2018 i completed the 25th anniversary edition of safe haven along with its sequel the chicago project i have listed my two questions for all mayoral and aldermanic candidates to answer finally my 12 step bipartisan contract for chicago illinois outlines specifically how we can help to make chicago a model for the country on the way towards achieving a gang free drug free full employment economy in america by 2020 sun times 2019 chicago voting guide pensions chicago is on the hook for 42 billion in unfunded pension liabilities which works out to 35 000 for every household those pensions in the language of the illinois constitution shall not be diminished or impaired should the state constitution be amended to allow a reduction in pension benefits for current city employees or retirees how about reducing pension benefits for new employees please explain kimball ladien safe haven a penny of prevention is worth a dollar of cure the above statements is not only a motto originally offered to irving harris as a tribute to his years of service to us all it is also a fact if we can reduce gangs drugs dropouts abuse and joblessness even 10 we would be saving over 500 million annually our goal for 2019 is 50 reductions 2 5b yr by reinvesting even some of the savings into further expanding prevention oriented programs we can in fact achieve the goal of a gang free drug free full employment economy in america by 2020 thus implementing safe haven asap not only saves lives it can help to pay for pensions as well geip global energy independence program 2 3 t yr globally 50b yr in illinois while much of the savings from geip in the united states would be used as part of a bipartisan win win grand deal to achieve universal healthcare and education it along with safe haven can help to pay off chicago illinois pension debts in a highly positive win win way by having all candidates running for mayor and alderperson endorse the 12 step bipartisan contract for chicago now the true winners in february and april will be the people of chicago and far beyond indeed revenue of the following often proposed sources of new revenue for chicago which of the following do you favor and why a chicago casino legalized and taxed recreational marijuana a lasalle street tax a commuter tax a property tax increase a municipal sales tax increase a real estate transfer tax increase video gambling kimball ladien not only would a city owned and run chicago casino be a profit center if done correctly it could help to further boost tourism in chicago similarly it is better to legalize and tax recreational marijuana but only as a part of a much more comprehensive inpatient outpatient drug treatment program moving forward while currently politicians are talking about one taxing source or another to deal with chicago s financial crises including the pensions both safe haven and geip offer short and long term solutions to these long standing problems that can actually reduce taxes for all of the right reasons by the sun times tribune wttw ivi ipo and other such groups calling on all candidates for mayor and alderman to support the 12 step bipartisan contract for chicago illinois we can actually implement these programssaving lives and cutting taxes in the process while it would be necessary to do a rigorous cost benefit analysis of any such proposal first the dutch and more recently the chinese have used state of the art dredging technology to build first expanded dikes and then entire new islands in a highly cost effective way several years ago i propose that chicago could enter into a partnership with such a dredging company to create a new lake shore drive to the east of the current one lsd ii that could not only help significantly reduce traffic jams the entire length of the city and beyond it could also serve as a barrier to help prevent soil erosion and possibly even provide new real estate opportunities and parkland to the east of lsd while a few very short sighted people blocked the lucas museum from coming to chicago these proposals would have been just one example of finding win win solutions to long standing problems at the same time that i was proposing lsd ii i was also highly recommending that parking for the obama library not only be underground but that it be linked to the library by an underground railroad that could entertain and inform visitors at the same time cf attached it is still not too late to propose such win win plans that could keep jackson park green while supporting the new high volume traffic that is to be anticipated simply put a little win win planning can go a very long way indeed what other sources of new revenue do you favor or oppose kimball ladien see above tifs tax increment financing districts are a primary economic development tool for chicago in a tif district taxes from the growth of property values are set aside for 23 years to be used to support public projects and private development what changes do you favor if any in chicago s tif program kimball ladien tifs can not only be made much more flexible they can be implemented in a way that is a win win for all neighborhoods across the city by prioritizing for instance the implementation of additional cameras on both city blocks and in allies we could go a long way towards not only reducing crime in chicago but arresting and prosecuting the perpetrators of such crimes tif investments in such expanded camera programs could rapidly help to reduce crime and thus save lives and tax dollars in the process block clubs and local businesses could potentially help to further expedite this process in a win win way for all as noted individuals with disabilities currently preventing them from working outside of the house could easily be assigned several hours of watching tv for suspicious activity in their own neighborhoods similar programs for tutors crisis counselors etc could also be suggested if one of the important purposes of tifs is to enhance economic development in the city obviously the more that we lower crime and improve academic outcomes the more we will be able to attract businesses to all areas of the city in a win win way thus whether they are large projects aimed at bringing thousands of new jobs to chicago for smaller projects using a rigorous cost benefits analysis for all such proposals would be both fair and highly beneficial to all of the citizens of chicago aldermanic power what will you do to rein in aldermanic prerogative kimball ladien by making aldermanic prerogatives subject to not only rigorous cost benefit analysis but also community input we can look for ways to maximize the benefits of limited dollars instead of funding pinstripe patronage if we could help assure that we are maximizing positive outcomes much good would be done on many levels police reform the city of chicago has entered into a federally monitored consent decree to overhaul the training and practices of the chicago police department civil libertarians say it is long overdue but others say it is unnecessary and could make it tougher for the police to do their job what s your view kimball ladien as i have noted elsewhere as a 5th generation chicagoan i would also hear stories about how people during the depression would sleep on the beaches or in the parks in order to try and stay cool on a hot summer night and yet despite people being much poorer than even today this could be done safely on a regular basis simply put it was not a question of money it was a question of values rights without responsibilities is entitlement and is a bad thing indeed the mindset that society owes me everything and i owe society nothing will in the end destroy any society in which it is allowed true empowerment comes from combining rights and responsibilities this is what jfk had in mind when he said that we should ask not what our country can do for us ask what we can do for our country while the police are far from perfect anyone who thinks that they have an easy job should try doing it even for a single night from early childhood on it is critical that children are taught to respect the police and other authority figures even if they may disagree with a particular instruction as noted above alternative sentencing protocols for both adolescents and adults could go a long way towards ensuring that there are always swift and appropriate consequences for bad behavior during the depression it was common for there to be 40 50 children in a classroom but you could hear a pin drop and children did their homework many studies over the year have shown that the number one predictor of a child s academic performance is not class size or even dollars spent per pupil it is parental involvement this is exactly why that in addition to afterschool programs for all children there would be ongoing support groups for at risk youth and their families to the greatest extent possible again as noted above a penny of prevention truly is worth a dollar of cure the more that we restore the critical balance between rights and responsibilities in society the more that police reform will be accomplished in a positive win win way it is only when there is a total lack of consequences for bad behavior e g 80 unsolved murders etc that anarchy prevails the more that we insist on a balance of rights and responsibilities from the police as well and citizens the better a win win outcome we will achieve guns what should chicago do to reduce the number of illegal guns kimball ladien the first step to solving a problem be it in medicine or anywhere else is to start by having both a proper diagnosis and an assessment of win win best practices when we listen to supt eddie johnson with his many years of experience who advocates that criminals or other high risk individuals who are arrested carrying any weapons be they sharpened screwdrivers or assault rifles automatically have double or triple sentences the sooner we will be making our communities safe again similarly israeli schools should be prime targets for terrorist assaults on a regular basis but it is precisely because they have armed guards in all of their schools and similar facilities that such attacks almost never happen again when criminals know that there are swift and certain consequences for bad behavior whether it is in the depression era united states cf eg midnight special by leadbelly etc israel or china such behaviors are avoided it is precisely when ideologies replace outcomes that problems remain unsolved schools what is the appropriate role of charter schools within the chicago public schools system kimball ladien again you often get the wrong answers when you ask the wrong questions thus instead of focusing on charter schools one way or the other the more that we make all chicago public schools throughout the city world class in outcomes the less relevant the issue of charter schools will become by having all teachers have community service corps csc teacher s aides as well as hall monitors afterschool tutors and coaches etc the better our schools can become especially where we focus on parental involvement cf comer model above letter are outcomes will be by having children literally doing their homework and not being involved with kings and drugs the pastor we can turn not only our schools but entire communities into literal safe havens for the good of all should the chicago board of education be solely appointed by the mayor as is now the case or should chicago switch to an elected school board or some hybrid kimball ladien by having a hybrid system that provides for both community input and some appointments by the mayor we can have the best of both systems as always however we should then look at the empirical data in terms of actual outcomes concerning such models affordable housing is there enough affordable housing in your ward please explain kimball ladien while affordable housing should be available throughout the city so too should the safety of all of our communities be a major priority by offering senior citizens priorities as far as tax reductions we can help to keep the elderly in their own homes to the best extent possible especially if affordable housing in communities is linked with participating in community services e g affordable daycare eldercare home healthcare teacher s aides etc the more this can be a win win for all involved immigration chicago by ordinance is an official welcoming city this means the chicago police are generally prohibited from detaining undocumented immigrants on behalf of federal immigration authorities what s your position on this policy what more or less should be done with respect to undocumented immigrants who live in chicago kimball ladien again rights without responsibilities is enabling and is inherently a bad thing politicians who would pander for votes by actively encouraging people to disobey the law are helping neither the country nor in the end even their own communities just as we can and must eradicate crime drugs abuse and joblessness in chicago so too we must be advocating to do the same thing in communities around the world wherever they may be if we truly wish to build a better world for all then we must first solve these problems in chicago and then replicate this model across the country and the world the 2 3 t yr of savings with geip can help to rapidly implement such programs in countries around the world also using if prevent and super epic we can dramatically improve the transparency and accountability of all of our systems across the planet by tying the implementation of if prevent and super epic to the implementation of safe haven and geip we can help to build sanctuary cities and over time sanctuary countries everywhere on the way towards genuine and lasting peace of earth for the good of all currently by simply strictly enforcing an e verify system we could genetically reduce the incentive for people coming to the united states illegally if we tie such programs to the resolution of daca issues we can accomplish a win win outcome for the benefit of all thus by looking for genuine solutions to long standing problems we can finally develop programs that benefit people not only in chicago and america but literally around the world this is precisely the difference between good government and politics as usual it is time to fix the system for the good of all ethics should the inspector general have the power to audit and review city council programs operations and committees why or why not kimball ladien inspector general good government versus politics as usual while the inspector general should have the power to audit and review city council programs operations in committees the city council should also have the power to investigate the inspector general if there are grounds to suspect that politics is getting in the way of good government would you employ or have you employed staff in your office who have outside jobs or contracts with entities that do business with the city if so please explain kimball ladien overlapping jobs accountability and transparency while i have in theory no specific problems with people having multiple jobs accountability and transparency are the critical elements to ensure that all interactions are both appropriate and in the best interests of the people thus for instance i would like to help make methodist hospital a model for the city and country in terms of highly cost effective inpatient outpatient drug treatment programs as part of these initiatives i may also reach out to the university of illinois at circle uic to have residence medical students graduate and undergraduate students all participating in these programs as both a learning experience as well as potentially jobs indeed part of universal education would be the opportunity for students to participate in community service corps programs to pay off their debts while my asking price for such an arrangement would be a dollar of the year with full transparency such overlapping jobs may in fact be a win win for all involved role model is there a past or current alderman whom you model yourself after or would model yourself after or take inspiration from please explain kimball ladien there are several aldermen over the years whom i have particularly admired and would wish in ways to emulate these include dick simpson dick mel and more recently scott waguespack dick simpson went from being aldermen to a professor of political science at uic it would have been interesting had he tried to do both simultaneously dick mel was very kind to my beloved wife sylvia many years ago at a time for her great difficulty dick was also one of the original people to sign letters of support for safe haven back in 1992 dick always had a certain degree of independence from the system that i always admired while scott waguespack also has many of these traits i think that it is very important to always try to seek the truth and the win win way whenever possible to this extent the more that we can move beyond politics as usual to genuine good government based on good science best practices and outcomes both here and around the world the better it will be for all so it shall be i will leave as the operational criteria for defending success with safe haven as i wrote in its conclusion over 25 years ago and believe now more and more each day him and you hello paper for media the key the thing with the thing taking if over the next few years we can again walk down any street in any town at any time of day or night and both feel and actually be safe then we are starting to do our job if we can go into any school and find learning and growing if we can go into any workplace and find productive and drug free employees if we can reach out into any neighborhood and find a sense of pride and commitment to the community then indeed a new millennium will have been reached this is our goal this is our dream it is one i hope to share with you all working alone we can accomplish little but working together we can change the world as we read history and set the agenda we have only eight years to go and not a second to lose related also running for 47th ward alderman

of these is vietnam s ongoing anti corruption campaign which uncovered massive fraud by officials connected to the state owned petro vietnam and three major banks in a bizarre episode vietnamese security officials kidnapped a petro vietnam executive who had fled to germany brought him back to hanoi and sentenced him to two life terms in prison petro vietnam s chief executive officer was also

widely viewed as restricting free speech in the social media massive anti china public demonstrations and protests erupted in june with protests turning violent in binh thuan province political analysts attributed the protests to an undercurrent of public dissatisfaction with malaise in the government the government postponed consideration of the law on sezs to this year tightening grip on power hits human rights secretary general nguyen phu trong consolidated his leadership position when he was elected concurrently as state president following the death of president tran dai quang in

as the world s economic elite gather in davos switzerland for the world economic forum recent data suggests that corporate titans as well as average americans could be backtracking from the ebullience that characterized and most likely helped drive economic growth last year an annual pwc survey of more than 1 300 global ceos found that the number who expect economic growth to decline leaped from just 5 percent last year to 29 percent this year this drastic increase was led by the sentiment of north american chief executives whose expectations for decline rose from 3 percent a year ago to 28 percent consumer data from the university of michigan released friday also reflected a turn toward the negative measures of consumer sentiment views on current economic conditions and economic expectations all turned negative on a month to month as well as a year over year basis the index of consumer expectations recorded the sharpest decline with a 10 percent month to month decrease and a year over year drop nearly as large justin wolfers a professor of public policy and economics at the university of michigan said the widening gap in americans political leanings could be skewing soft data that measures attitudes rather than actual spending this is a relatively recent phenomenon he said one that manifested itself with president donald trump s election in 2016 and has largely persisted historically wolfers said economic survey respondents tended to leave politics out of their views about money and finances in the era of trump that has changed measures of sentiment have become incredibly polarized or politicized he said there s been a massive disconnect between measures of sentiment and the economy recent data points indicating a dimming outlook might reveal more about how americans will behave as voters rather than as consumers it could be driven by people getting off the trump bandwagon wolfers said economists point out that businesses have considerably less to look forward to in the next two years of the trump presidency than in its first two years characterized by a massive corporate tax cut and regulatory rollbacks in its survey pwc said factors including international trade tensions political upset and uncertainty and stricter monetary and fiscal policy all are forces that potentially could act as a brake on the global economy what you have now is not much more upside being seen you see a lot more downside with the political agenda and trade conflicts and no promise or hope for anything else like infrastructure pwc global chairman bob moritz told cnbc on tuesday the positive impact of the trump tax cuts a year ago has dissipated and now sentiment is driven by the other side of the trump economic agenda namely trade war said nicolas veron a senior fellow at bruegel think tank in brussels and the peterson institute for international economics unlike the tax cuts this is perceived very negatively by business the high level of policy uncertainty associated with the unconventional features of the trump administration is no good for business investment and business sentiment more generally this same dynamic also poses a risk to consumer spending despite the fact that certain key metrics that ordinarily indicate the potential for economic headwinds aren t present right now consumer sentiment is likely being impacted by the stock market volatility even among those without equity holdings and by the turmoil in washington over the shutdown and trade conflicts said martin baily a senior fellow in economic studies at the brookings institution the labor market remains very strong and there is little inflation he pointed out some economists think the biggest risk is that the fear of the unknown could snowball and turn worry of impending economic decline into a self fulfilling prophecy coming into this year things look pretty good said peter morici professor emeritus at the university of maryland s robert h smith school of business there isn t anything endemic in the economy that would point to a recession but morici expressed concern that the constant drumbeat of negative predictions about slowing growth and recession fears could lead to real economic harm that s driving down expectations in a manner that s inconsistent with the economic forecast he said you can talk yourself into a recession

pantry st joseph hospital community leaders board friends of lakeview her occupation manager government neighborhood relations chicago cubs her education university of missouri columbia journalism history of art architecture campaign website wayforward47 org twitter wayforward47 facebook facebook com wayforward47 top priorities what are the top three priorities for your ward heather way kitzes strengthening neighborhood schools the 47th ward is home to some of the best schools in the city but more can be done the k 8 schools are fantastic but the majority of families seek high schools outside the neighborhood and in some cases outside the city one of my primary goals is to make sure our local neighborhood high schools become the destination for secondary education gaining lost population the 47th ward has lost 15 of its population since the last census this is due to a variety of factors and a lack of flexible affordable housing stock plays a significant role i will advocate for smart density and affordability creating a housing stock which works for multiple demographics improving ward services constituent services are important and i am committed to keeping our community safe informed clean and vibrant recent civic work please tell us what you have done in the last two years to serve the city your neighborhood or a civic organization please be specific heather way kitzes i manage a grant for cubs charities called the schools all stars grant over the past two years cubs charities has matched 1million in fundraising activities via the schools all stars grant i am also a member of the friends of lakeview the group responsible for the low line pedestrian path which creates new community hubs connecting the southport and paulina el stations sun times 2019 chicago voting guide pensions chicago is on the hook for 42 billion in unfunded pension liabilities which works out to 35 000 for every household those pensions in the language of the illinois constitution shall not be diminished or impaired should the state constitution be amended to allow a reduction in pension benefits for current city employees or retirees how about reducing pension benefits for new employees please explain heather way kitzes pensions for current employees and retirees should not be reduced those were benefits agreed to by the city and must be honored if new future employees can agree to a collective bargaining agreement which includes adjustments to future pension benefits i would similarly honor that cba revenue of the following often proposed sources of new revenue for chicago which of the following do you favor and why a chicago casino legalized and taxed recreational marijuana a lasalle street tax a commuter tax a property tax increase a municipal sales tax increase a real estate transfer tax increase video gambling heather way kitzes i support the legalization and taxation of recreational marijuana i am open to a casino and the expansion of video gambling depending on what such proposals would look like i do not support any of the other taxes listed here unless as a last resort i still believe there are other ways to reduce spending coupled with the measures mentioned above which will get the city back on solid financial ground what other sources of new revenue do you favor or oppose heather way kitzes i oppose any new revenue through taxes which would make it even more difficult for working class families to stay and thrive in chicago tifs tax increment financing districts are a primary economic development tool for chicago in a tif district taxes from the growth of property values are set aside for 23 years to be used to support public projects and private development what changes do you favor if any in chicago s tif program heather way kitzes generally tifs are a great tool for re developing under utilized land but in recent years there has been an increased portion of tif funds used for administrative costs this is an example of government waste that we need to address i believe comprehensive tif reform must include accountability and transparency aldermanic power what will you do to rein in aldermanic prerogative heather way kitzes elections are a fair check on aldermanic prerogative if i am elected by the people of the 47th ward service to them is my top priority i will act fairly and responsibly on their behalf police reform the city of chicago has entered into a federally monitored consent decree to overhaul the training and practices of the chicago police department civil libertarians say it is long overdue but others say it is unnecessary and could make it tougher for the police to do their job what s your view heather way kitzes i support the consent decree police officers have a difficult job and i will work to support their efforts but reform is also needed guns what should chicago do to reduce the number of illegal guns heather way kitzes i support a wide range of federal and state level reforms including universal background checks which would help stop the flood of illegal weapons coming into our city from surrounding areas i also support local measures like gun buy backs and turn in days with no questions asked schools what is the appropriate role of charter schools within the chicago public schools system heather way kitzes i want parents to be able to choose the best option for their child but there are already plenty of options any further expansion of charter schools in chicago is to the detriment of public neighborhood schools that s why i ve pledged support for a moratorium on all new charter expansion in chicago should the chicago board of education be solely appointed by the mayor as is now the case or should chicago switch to an elected school board or some hybrid heather way kitzes as a cps mom i support reform in the chicago board of education i have stated previously that i support an elected school board but having served on an lsc it may be worth exploring that model as all stakeholders are appropriately represented administrators students teachers and community i would not be in favor of an elected school board for the sake of an elected school board i am in favor of efficiency transparency and strengthening the district as a whole affordable housing is there enough affordable housing in your ward please explain heather way kitzes no families are increasingly being priced out of the 47th ward due to a lack of flexible and affordable housing options de conversion of 2 and 3 flats to single family homes has been a culprit but we also need to encourage a wide range of different options including more tod s along the 47th ward s excellent transit lines brown line ashland bus western bus immigration chicago by ordinance is an official welcoming city this means the chicago police are generally prohibited from detaining undocumented immigrants on behalf of federal immigration authorities what s your position on this policy what more or less should be done with respect to undocumented immigrants who live in chicago heather way kitzes i support sanctuary city efforts in chicago we should be doing more to welcome and support immigrants ethics should the inspector general have the power to audit and review city council programs operations and committees why or why not heather way kitzes yes council needs more oversight would you employ or have you employed staff in your office who have outside jobs or contracts with entities that do business with the city if so please explain heather way kitzes no regardless of whether such arrangements are technically legal they create the appearance of impropriety which erodes the public trust role model is there a past or current alderman whom you model yourself after or would model yourself after or take inspiration from please explain heather way kitzes alderman tom tunney 44 i have known alderman tunney for nearly 20 years i have worked side by side with him since he came into office in 2002 i have long admired his dedication to the 44th ward and the people who call it home i have rarely seen him waver or stray from what he believes to be the right thing he has been a mentor to me throughout my career we may not always agree but i value his input leadership and consider him a friend related also running for 47th ward alderman

author yiping huang peking university china s economy had an unexpected downturn in 2018 industrial upgrading economic policy battles and trade friction with the united states all contributed to the slowdown the government is implementing policy measures aimed at stabilising economic momentum but downward pressure on the economy will likely continue in 2019 if the government is able to fine tune its economic policies and adopt counter cyclical measures china can still achieve a robust pace of economic growth this year as long as trade friction risks remain under control the so called middle income trap challenge led to a slowdown in china s growth after 2010 gdp per capita rose from us 3600 in 2007 to almost us 10 000 in 2018 having lost the low cost advantage china must build new industries through innovation and industrial upgrading to support the next phase of its economic development moderation of growth will likely continue until this battle between old and new industries ends the sudden weakening of growth momentum in 2018 is mainly attributable to two new developments one is the government s three economic policy battles cleaning up the environment controlling systemic financial risks and alleviating poverty that were launched in early 2018 all are necessary to improve the quality of economic growth but the first two slowed growth down directly to clean up the environment the government abruptly shut down many high pollution production facilities especially in northern china to reduce financial risks regulatory authorities took measures to control shadow banking transactions this led to a reduction of total social financing and economic activities cooled quickly unexpectedly these policies hit the private sector hard although policymakers did not specifically target private enterprises they typically have lower environmental standards and receive more funding through shadow banking this created disproportionate difficulties for the private sector prompting nation wide debate about its position in the chinese economy the government responded by reversing policy towards the private sector and reiterating its importance in the chinese economy some officials also spoke about competitive neutrality but it remains uncertain how this could be implemented effectively the trade friction with the united states is as yet having limited direct impact on china s trade activities but it is affecting investor confidence and probably delaying planned business investment whether the trade war s full effect estimated at 0 5 1 5 per cent of gdp will materialise depends on how long it drags on and how serious it becomes the economy weakened visibly during the fourth quarter of 2018 but the keqiang index a composite measure of freight credit and power consumption still indicated decent economic growth albeit slower though not significantly than that officially reported more importantly while the manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi dropped below 50 in december 2018 the non manufacturing pmi confirmed robust expansion this is consistent with the general theme of a battle between old and new industries with the government now fine tuning its environmental and financial policies their drag on economic momentum is likely already easing it is also expected that china and the united states will reach some partial agreement on trade friction during the second quarter of 2019 at latest although a full resolution is unlikely in the near future the two governments are probably making deals on balancing bilateral trade imbalances opening up china s services sector and improving protection of intellectual property rights after the global financial crisis chinese policymakers formed a consensus that china should not rely on aggressive fiscal or monetary policy expansions as it did in 2009 but when the economy suffers a downturn the government should still take some counter cyclical measures albeit of a more modest magnitude today the chinese government has limited room to take counter cyclical policies expected policy hikes by the us federal reserve bank in 2019 constrain the people s bank of china s ability to adopt monetary policy easing given limited exchange rate flexibility large liabilities by local governments and affiliated local government investment vehicles limit scope for further fiscal policy expansion and high leverage ratios cap credit and financing growth the government must create greater policy room to strengthen monetary policy independence the people s bank of china should consider either increasing exchange rate flexibility or tightening management of cross border capital flows some policymakers are worried this could increase fiscal risks if the fiscal deficit exceeds 3 per cent of gdp but in reality consolidated government debts are still about 50 per cent of gdp a 3 per cent fiscal deficit should not become a hard constraint for the government high leverage ratios are now perceived as the most serious financial risk in china but as most borrowing is done by state owned enterprises and local government investment vehicles both of which are associated with the government it is unlikely china will experience a so called minsky moment the most effective way of deleveraging would be to shut down zombie firms but this is not easy given social and economic constraints the government could consider setting up a special vehicle to take over some of the borrowing to cut off inefficient financial flows and take more time to deal with stocks this would create room for both financial institutions and the corporate sector to re leverage and grow more than 20 years ago when chinese banks had around 40 per cent bad loan ratios the government established four asset management companies which purchased about 1 4 trillion rmb us 206 billion worth of bad loans from the banks at face value this relieved the banks of their debt burden and enabled the start of a new round of restructuring there s a case for contemplating a return to these measures to ease the burden of the structural adjustment that china has to undertake now

times does not edit candidate responses who is debra silverstein she s running for 50th ward alderman her political civic background democrat elected alderman of the 50th ward in 2011 her occupation alderman her education bachelor s degree university of illinois chicago campaign website debrasilversteinforalderman com twitter debra4alderman facebook facebook com debra silverstein for chicagos 50th ward alderman 160422620641872 top priorities what are the top three priorities for your ward debra silverstein education our office s collaboration with cps has resulted in over 47 million in new investment in our local public schools including 40 million to expand rogers and decatur schools armstrong boone and stone have also received millions in new funding including new playgrounds restoration of auditoriums and the the addition of new classroom air conditioning units public safety my office and i have close working relationships with our local police and we respond quickly to public safety issues that affect our residents i ve also helped grow relationships between police and the community by hosting special meetings and community roll calls in our neighborhoods regularly attending caps meetings and organizing forums for police and local business owners i have fought for budget dollars to add additional police officers at the 24th district and sought resources to they can do their jobs we have also obtained funding from the city to make our streets safer including extensive new lighting along roadways and pedestrian bump outs and crossings delivering for residents basic city services were neglected for many years in the 50th ward but my office is very involved in making sure constituents receive the best the city has to offer we have benefited from a 15 million streetscape along devon avenue and other infrastructure projects more than 4 500 tree trimming requests have been completed since i took office we have invested millions of dollars in resurfacing streets that had not been maintained properly in decades graffiti removal and other service requests are managed quickly thanks to my office s commitment to constituent services and our effective working relationships with city agencies recent civic work please tell us what you have done in the last two years to serve the city your neighborhood or a civic organization please be specific debra silverstein i have supported an agenda in the city council that supports working families co sponsoring more than a dozen pieces of legislation to help chicagoans including ordinances increasing minimum wage and requiring businesses to provide workers with paid sick leave visiting the 50th ward is the best way to see the results of our hard work a 15 million devon avenue streetscape has breathed new life into one of the city s most successful business districts existing businesses are reinvesting here and new businesses have been added to our community including tj maxx five below treehouse humane society malabar gold diamonds cermak grocery and others including many new restaurants and retail stores on devon avenue with updated and new amenities the 50th ward is growing as a destination for not only businesses but also families a new northtown library is currently under construction in my first two terms i secured 6 million in funding for local parks including a restored historic fieldhouse and new features at indian boundary park new walking paths and athletic fields at rogers park new playgrounds tennis courts lighting and athletic fields at warren park and we recently dedicated a new passive park at devon avenue and mccormick boulevard we ve invested more than 47 million in local public schools and worked to support local private schools as well those resources provided new construction for an expansion of decatur and rogers schools new playgrounds security improvements and air conditioning for classrooms sun times 2019 chicago voting guide pensions chicago is on the hook for 42 billion in unfunded pension liabilities which works out to 35 000 for every household those pensions in the language of the illinois constitution shall not be diminished or impaired should the state constitution be amended to allow a reduction in pension benefits for current city employees or retirees how about reducing pension benefits for new employees please explain debra silverstein the courts have ruled on multiple occasions that pension agreements with current city employees and retirees cannot be diminished and we must honor our contractual obligations while there is talk of amending the illinois constitution any change should only affect new municipal employees additional pension tiers with adjusted benefits perhaps even ones that include options to invest in 401ks can provide some relief i want to work with organized labor to ensure that their input is heard in any discussions about pension reform i have made tough votes to help stabilize the city s pension obligations but more work needs to be done long term solutions will have to come from the revenue side and i am eager to work with governor elect jb pritzker the general assembly and the organizations that represent employees and retirees about options in terms of new funding streams to address pension liabilities revenue of the following often proposed sources of new revenue for chicago which of the following do you favor and why a chicago casino legalized and taxed recreational marijuana a lasalle street tax a commuter tax a property tax increase a municipal sales tax increase a real estate transfer tax increase video gambling debra silverstein because with regulations and oversight they have proven to provide additional revenue streams elsewhere i am not opposed to additional casinos or video gaming or a safe responsible initiative for the legalization of marijuana in addition i would consider an increase in the real estate transfer tax for high value properties an increase in property taxes or sales taxes should only be considered as a last resort the most significant upcoming revenue changes will likely start at the state level and i expect the governor elect and the general assembly will introduce a revenue package that will include some of the items listed above to provide new dollars for our schools infrastructure public safety and our growing pension liabilities what other sources of new revenue do you favor or oppose debra silverstein i support a progressive income tax that requires wealthy individuals and businesses to pay their fair share i am eager to see what proposals move forward in the general assembly to support working families in my community tifs tax increment financing districts are a primary economic development tool for chicago in a tif district taxes from the growth of property values are set aside for 23 years to be used to support public projects and private development what changes do you favor if any in chicago s tif program debra silverstein i supported legislation to shift tif surpluses into funds to support infrastructure projects for chicago public schools and i believe there are steps that can be taken to modernize and reform the tif system i support additional transparency when it comes to tif public disclosures in regard to the planned use of tif district dollars and new rules that hold businesses accountable to the promises they make in exchange for tif benefits particularly when it comes to job creation and investment in the community the devon and western tif was a critical tool that allowed for the funding of a desperately needed project to enhance our premier business district an area that generates tremendous sales tax revenues for the city of chicago the devon avenue streetscape was a proper use of tif and i support tif reforms that allow for tifs to be used for their primary purpose aldermanic power what will you do to rein in aldermanic prerogative debra silverstein in our community the wishes of residents are reflected in any and all decisions made by elected officials aldermen are elected to be advocates for their communities and aldermanic discretion is an important tool to affect change at the direction of community members before each of our ward s biggest projects got off the ground we facilitated meetings that put residents in the same room as city officials developers and architects to encourage an open dialogue we mail notifications send emails and even go door to door to make sure residents are aware and involved when it comes to development zoning matters and other issues the devon avenue streetscape and the new northtown library are examples of resident driven projects that benefited from extensive input from community members police reform the city of chicago has entered into a federally monitored consent decree to overhaul the training and practices of the chicago police department civil libertarians say it is long overdue but others say it is unnecessary and could make it tougher for the police to do their job what s your view debra silverstein i support the current consent decree framework negotiated by the illinois attorney general the chicago police department and the city of chicago there is a clear need for increased accountability and reforms that better reflect the values we hold i try to demonstrate my support for the police by working closely with them to make my community safer i also support providing police with additional resources for training specifically when it comes to use of force and engaging individuals dealing with mental health issues we should ensure that police have the resources they need to be effective while rebuilding trust among people in the neighborhoods they serve guns what should chicago do to reduce the number of illegal guns debra silverstein we need to reduce the demand for illegal guns by continuing to invest in underserved communities through economic development job creation mentorship programs and job skills training we also need to work with lawmakers in springfield to explore all options to reduce gun violence and end the flow of illegal guns into our communities schools what is the appropriate role of charter schools within the chicago public schools system debra silverstein rather than consider additional charter schools cps and the city as a whole needs to do more to support local schools our ward doesn t have any charter schools and while i believe they can play a role in our education system charter schools must be held to the same standards as our public schools should the chicago board of education be solely appointed by the mayor as is now the case or should chicago switch to an elected school board or some hybrid debra silverstein like the vast majority of chicagoans i support an elected school board our public schools are among our city s greatest assets and residents should have the final say in how they are managed in terms of accountability to constituents and stakeholders a fully elected school board is preferable to an appointed board with an appointed chief executive or a hybrid affordable housing is there enough affordable housing in your ward please explain debra silverstein the 50th ward is a place where many chicago families get their start and we are doing our part to provide additional affordable housing here i support growing affordable housing via the affordable housing opportunity fund and an expansion of the preservation of existing affordable rental pear program a beautiful new 16 000 square foot public library that is being built in our community has a senior housing component this is a unique project and it is currently under construction across from warren park immigration chicago by ordinance is an official welcoming city this means the chicago police are generally prohibited from detaining undocumented immigrants on behalf of federal immigration authorities what s your position on this policy what more or less should be done with respect to undocumented immigrants who live in chicago debra silverstein our city is a city of immigrants and the 50th ward is a true melting pot it s one of the communities that most represents chicago s legacy our diversity is one of our greatest strengths but people here feel like they are under attack the trump administration and rising anti immigrant sentiment has terrified residents of the 50th ward i have seen first hand how people are so scared they are afraid to come to their doors the city must maintain and grow its status as a welcoming city as alderman i have made every effort to reach out to our diverse residents and in the city council i have supported a municipal id for immigrants and others as well as increased funding for free or low cost legal advice i voted for legislation that opposes local law enforcement handing over to ice people who do not have serious criminal convictions or outstanding criminal warrants i ve been a vocal opponent of trump s policies and supported the city s lawsuit against the trump administration over efforts to block grant funding over sanctuary city status ethics should the inspector general have the power to audit and review city council programs operations and committees why or why not debra silverstein in 2016 i supported an unsuccessful effort to increase oversight in the city council by combining the offices of the inspector general with the office of the legislative inspector general the measure would have saved tax dollars provided additional resources to a proven and effective monitor of good government and increased accountability among elected officials the city s inspector general should have authority to investigate corruption and malfeasance corruption not only has a direct cost to taxpayers in terms of lost resources but it also costs us in terms of a loss of faith in government would you employ or have you employed staff in your office who have outside jobs or contracts with entities that do business with the city if so please explain debra silverstein i am a full time alderman and for my staff and i serving the residents of the 50th ward is a full time job we work tirelessly to meet the high standards we set for ourselves when it comes to the needs of our community and no i would not employ staff who have outside jobs or contracts with entities that do business with the city role model is there a past or current alderman whom you model yourself after or would model yourself after or take inspiration from please explain debra silverstein while he was not an alderman abner mikva was an educator and served as a state legislator us congressman and federal judge although later in life he was an advisor to us presidents his career started in local politics going door to door addressing the basic needs of constituents he was a strong advocate for fairness and justice and was known for fighting the chicago machine related also running for 50th ward alderman
