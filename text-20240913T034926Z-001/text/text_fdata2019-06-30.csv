news national by staff reporter get latest news by email subscribe powered by the decision by government this week to abolish the multi currency regime and re introduce the zimbabwean dollar as the sole legal tender could be catastrophic as the local currency s value may tumble against major currencies plunging the country into hyperinflation while some captains of industry and analysts welcomed the move others were sceptical and critical the zimdollar which was initially abandoned in 2009 after being ravaged by severe hyperinflation this week became the country s sole currency through statutory instrument si 142 of 2019 known as the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz legal tender regulations in 2016 government introduced the bond currency to the basket of currencies a fiat currency which was ostensibly meant to incentivise exporting firms these regulations may be cited as the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz legal tender regulations 2019 subject to section 3 with effect from 24th june 2019 the british pound united states dollar south african rand botswana pula and any other foreign currency whatsoever shall no longer be legal tender alongside the zimbabwe dollar in any transactions in zimbabwe part of the si said accordingly the zimbabwean dollar shall with effect from the 24 june 2019 but subject to section 3 be the sole legal tender in zimbabwe in all transactions the rationale to abandon the multi currency system which brought relative stability on the market when it was introduced in 2009 as explained by finance minister mthuli ncube this week is to restore the central bank s monetary authority thereby containing spiralling commodity prices and inflation what we are trying to do is restore full monetary policy where the central bank can conduct monetary policy using the array of tools that are necessary for managing monetary policy such as interest rates use of a monetary policy committee to govern things like targeting money balances or even targeting inflation ncube said basically the multi currency regime which had by the way become a mono currency in favour of the us dollar was favouring those with access to us dollars those with access to us dollars were facing no change in inflation at all for the last three years however the basis for adopting a basket of currencies a decade ago was supported by the need to stabilise zimbabwe s fragile economy in the absence of macro economic fundamentals which resulted in the decimation of the local dollar amid spiralling inflation which peaked to 89 7 sextillion percent on november 14 2008 now a decade later zimbabwe still deep in the throes of an intractable economic crisis is reeling from unstable macro economic fundamentals not conducive for the return of the local dollar the local unit a combination of electronic balances bond coins and notes already in circulation has failed to hold its own against major currencies particularly the ever firming united states dollar official figures show that inflation has risen to 97 8 though renowned us economist steve hanke forecasts it to be hovering at more than 300 ironically treasury projects inflation to recede below 14 by year end tamed as it says by the range of austerity measures currently being implemented with zimbabwe s agriculture sector which used to be the mainstay of the economy ruined by former president robert mugabe s chaotic land reform programme of 2000 experts say the southern african country s decision to abandon the multi currency system while upholding the local dollar as the sole legal tender could lead to an all too familiar path of hyperinflation ditching the basket of currencies analysts say will exert inflationary pressures on the local currency unless backed by foreign currency gold reserves and exports in february government liberalised the exchange rate resulting in the rtgs dollar tumbling in value against the us dollar and other currencies it is now pegged at 6 3 to the us dollar on the interbank market while on the parallel market it has soared to 13 critics of the return of the zimbabwean dollar which is now the monetary unit effectively in circulation say that it is imperative to ensure macro economic stability and restore public confidence before the country can start trading with its local currency they say the real value of a currency lies in the public confidence besides its intrinsic and market value but with memories of zimbabwe s hyperinflation era still fresh in their memories confidence appears to have waned as the local unit continues to tumble against currencies of choice necessitating government intervention coupled with that zimbabwe is also struggling to extinguish an estimated us 20 billion debt stock a situation which has restricted the country from unlocking fresh lines of credit perceived to be key towards mending the sbattered economy bindura university commerce lecturer felix chari said in the absence of structural economic reforms treasury s decision to abandon the multi currency regime would stoke inflationary pressures and render the local unit worthless it was premature to reintroduce the local currency in the absence of sound macro economic fundamentals required to stabilise the economy the zimbabwean dollar is vulnerable to inflation due to low levels of productivity and exports inflation will continue to rise as the zimbabwean dollar devalues chari contends former finance minister tendai biti who served in the inclusive government that saw zimbabwe adopting dollarisation as an official currency policy said the scrapping of the multi currency regime would spark civil unrest with retail shops running dry and the local unit depreciating it is insanity it is total madness you cannot introduce a new currency when the macro economic fundamentals are not there we have a crisis of confidence a crisis of legitimacy biti said you are going to see a massive shortage of goods in the supermarkets you are going to see disinvestment in the country there will be massive externalisation you will see massive civil unrest it is a major security threat however other analysts say the zimdollar s return was necessary even in these conditions

probabilities we prefer to look through this expecting ultimately that the cash rate will be at 1 by august regardless of the exact path driven by the lowering of the rba s nairu estimates and slight

initial jobless claims continues to plumb the depths on a trend basis so if it is true that the paltry may payrolls outcome does not represent a real shift down in trend payroll growth the likelihood that we see a mean reverting bounce in june is high note that in the last five years there have been four sub 100k nfp prints on a first reported basis before the most recent one in each case the subsequent rebound was significant averaging 239k with a range of 196 287k with about 1 6 million more job openings than officially unemployed folks well north of potential payroll growth is more likely than not in the near term but even if you take the may payroll number at face value and think it represents a turning point toward a much lower trend for job growth this is not inconsistent with fed thinking the fed explicitly has an expectation for slowing payroll growth in its baseline forecast the june projections showed the committee median expectation for the unemployment unchanged at 3 6 by the end of 2019 rising to 3 7 in 2020 and 3 8 in 2021 the only way you get increases in the unemployment rate by definition is by running net payroll growth below the rate of the growth in

the best first half for financial markets ever what a six months for financial markets global equities have piled on 8 trillion 6 trillion pounds bonds are on fire oil prices have surged by almost a quarter and a greek bank is one of the world s best performing stocks everything added together it may well be the best first half of a year ever and one that not even the most wily investor would have predicted after the dire end to 2018 and what has happened since the world s two top economies are slugging it out in a full blown trade war and the recession warning klaxons are blaring but still the performance numbers and milestones are astonishing the 8 trillion surge in global stocks is the result of a near 15 leap in msci s world index that is challenging the dot com boom days of 1997 as the best h1 in its near 40 year history wall street is up 18 europe 13 and china has jumped 20 which is a lot of what it lost year even factoring in it has given back 5 since the trade

beating all sectors all markets all asset classes are in positive territory and that is rather unusual a mirror image of 2018 when almost everything fell perhaps but there have been two important drivers one was china showing it was serious about monetary and fiscal stimulus for its 14 trillion economy the second of course has been the screeching change of direction by the federal reserve which suddenly looks set to cut u s interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis it has lit a fire under bond markets which have gone off like a rocket u s treasuries the world s benchmark government ious have made a whopping 7 percent as their yields have fallen almost 70 basis points this year that followed a 37 basis point fall the last quarter of 2018 whereas in the five

the yield on 10 year debt dropped below zero percent for the first time since 2016 in march and has since scored record lows my big fat greek rally a statistic likely to make most jaws drop is that greek banks remember all that euro debt crisis and capital controls stuff a few years back have been some of the world s best performing stocks this year the country s biggest lender piraeus bank is

of strength said hsbc asset management s chief global strategist joseph little the question is has it been too fast and too furious it s a very good question the fed s pirouette means the dollar index is about to experience its first quarterly loss in over a year with the yen up over 2 5 and the euro now back in the black having had its weakest q1 since 2015 the oil rally means the canadian dollar

during the election we were promised jobs and growth but in 2019 20 the conversation s forecasting panel is predicting an economic growth rate as weak as any since the financial crisis as well as dismal consumer spending no improvement in unemployment or wage growth and an increased chance of recession as in january the conversation has assembled a forecasting panel of 20 leading economists from 12 universities across six states among them are macroeconomists economic modellers former treasury imf oecd and reserve bank officials a former government minister and a former member of the reserve bank board whereas in january only three members of the 20 person panel expected the reserve bank to cut interest rates and most expected an economic growth rate approaching 3 which is the treasury s estimate of the best that can be achieved on a sustained basis this time all but two expect the bank to cut again and most expect a growth rate closer to 2 one of the most anaemic since the financial crisis read more no surplus no share market growth no lift in wage growth economic survey points to bleaker times post election on the upside the panel expects iron ore prices to stay higher for longer than did the budget it expects home prices to stabilise and it is predicting the lowest government bond rate on record making it cheaper than ever before for the government to borrow and spend its way out of trouble the panel predicts a surplus in name only in 2019 20 and overwhelmingly believes the government should be prepared to abandon it if it has to in order to keep the economy growing economic growth the panel s average forecast for year on year growth is 2 1 year on year growth is the measure used in the budget it compares economic activity throughout all of one financial year with activity throughout all of the previous financial year the budget forecast for 2019 20 is 2 75 respected forecasters including former reserve bank board member warwick mckibbin and former oecd director adrian blundell wignall expect much lower growth than 2 1 mckibbin expects 1 8 blundell wignall expects 1 5 only three of the panel s 20 forecasts are close to treasury s the rest are lower some panellists submitted forecasts for chinese economic growth under sufferance they made it clear they were forecasting official growth not actual growth which they think is much lower even so most expect official growth to slow as the trade war between the united states and china intensifies nigel stapledon says unless it is reined in and he thinks it will be it could bring on recessions other panellists including rebecca cassells say the impact of us tariffs on chinese goods has so far been positive for australia china has responded by investing in infrastructure projects that need australian iron ore and coal this together with reduced competition from other suppliers of iron ore after the collapse of a tailings dam and mine closures in brazil has lifted the price and volume of australian exports to levels not seen for some time the panel expects robust united states growth of 2 6 in 2019 although many members are concerned about the year that will follow the only panellist to forecast low us growth in this year 1 is blundell wignall who until last year analysed world economies in his role as special advisor to the oecd secretary general living standards jobs growth will disappoint both the treasury which has forecast unemployment of 5 by the end of the financial year and reserve bank governor philip lowe who has adopted a target of 4 point something all but three of the 20 person panel expect the rate to stay above 5 the average forecast is 5 3 which is close to the present 5 2 stapledon says australia s recent strong employment growth has been out of kilter with slower gdp growth and the winding down of housing construction meaning jobs growth is set to slow down pushing up unemployment brendan coates says underemployment is also climbing as more people work fewer hours than they would like making it harder for them to push for wage rises rebecca cassells points out that full time employment has grown almost twice as fast among women than men which given the low rates of pay in the industries that traditionally employ women is likely to further depress average wages the headline measure of living standards gdp per capita has been falling but a better measure real net disposable income per capita which takes better account of buying power has been continuing to climb the panel expected to climb a further 1 over the year to june 2020 after climbing 1 3 in the year to march nominal gdp which takes full account of mining revenue and drives company profits and the budget revenue has grown 5 over the past year and is expected to grow 3 in the year ahead the risk of recession the panel regards a recession as more likely than it did in january assigning a 29 probability to a conventionally defined recession in the next two years up from 25 economic modeller janine dixon says the bulk of australia s recent economic growth has come from higher commodity prices via exports she says without them australia would be reliant on weak wage and consumption growth although she believes high population growth will be enough to ensure economic activity doesn t shrink for two consecutive quarters which would be the conventional definition of a recession former treasury and anz bank economist warren hogan says with consumers tightening their belts an external shock could easily knock australia into a recession julie toth an economist at the australian industry group who has also worked for the productivity commission says with growth already low it won t take much to turn it negative debt theorist steve keen who assigns a 95 probability a recession as he did in january says australia escaped that fate during the global financial crisis in part by boosting grants to first home buyers which made australian households among the most indebted in the world and put off the day of reckoning when those debts would be unwound through a mix of good luck and good management australia has avoided a recession during three global downturns since the early 1990s the 1997 asian economic crisis the early 2000s dotcom collapse and the 2007 09 global financial crisis if it succeeds again it will enter its fourth decade recession free in this term of government in mid 2021 wages and prices the panel expects continued historically wage growth of only 2 2 in 2019 20 slightly weaker than the latest reading of 2 3 and well short of the budget forecast of 2 75 if that average forecast is right it will be the seventh consecutive year in which wage growth has fallen short of the budget forecast the good news for wage earners is that even that unusually low rate of wage growth would be well above the rate of inflation which is expected to be only 1 5 or 1 4 on the so called underlying basis watched closely by the reserve bank the bad news for the reserve bank is that it will put inflation well outside the bank s target band of 2 3 for the fifth consecutive year raising questions about whether there is any point to the band mark crosby warren hogan and adrian blundell wignall suggest broadening the target band to 1 3 tony makin and nigel stapledon suggest cutting it to 1 2 richard holden and warwick mckibbin suggest ditching it altogether and replacing it with a target for nominal gdp growth mckibbin suggests a nominal gdp target of 6 which given the present forecast for weaker nominal gdp growth would mean interest rate cuts in better times it would mean rate rises chris edmond and craig emerson defend the 2 3 inflation target saying that what is really concerning is the bank s preparedness to stay beneath the target band for extended periods home prices the panel expects only modest falls in sydney and melbourne house prices of 2 3 in each city after falls of 10 over the past year it is more optimistic on home building than is the treasury expecting housing investment to fall by 4 9 rather than the budget forecast of 7 business none of the panellists expects household spending to grow by the 2 75 forecast in the budget on average the panel expects spending growth of just 1 9 in 2019 20 which is little better than the present 1 8 and only few points above population growth janine dixon blames continuing weak growth in wages and incomes nigel stapledon says much of it flows from the weaker housing market household furnishings drive household spending growth household spending drives gdp growth accounting for more than half of it in better news the panel expects mining investment to rebound after sliding for most of the last five years its forecasts of growth in mining investment of 4 4 and growth in non mining investment of 4 are in line with budget forecasts interest rates and the budget perhaps surprisingly given its forecasts for weak employment growth weak economic growth and weak inflation the panel s average forecast for interest rates is for just one more cut perhaps as soon as july 2 but some time in the second half of the year only five panellists expect a followup cut in the first half of next year but among them are craig emerson richard holden and steve keen who were the only three to correctly forecast in january that there would be a rate cut at all this year holden expects two further rate cuts in the second half of this year taking the reserve bank cash rate to 0 75 and then a further two in the first half of next year taking it to just 0 25 keen expects one further cut on the second half of this year and another two in the first half of next year taking it to 0 5 warwick mckibbin is the only panellist expecting the reserve bank to change course expecting one further cut this year and then a series of increases as ballooning debt makes the reserve bank and other central banks realise they cut too far pushing the cash rate back up to 1 5 the panel expects a government 10 year borrowing rate of just 1 5 which is about the lowest it has ever been a year ago the 10 year bond rate was 2 7 the ultra low rate will both make it easier for the government to borrow and cut the cost of servicing its existing debt as loans are rolled over in further good news for the budget the panel expects a substantially higher spot iron ore price than does the government of us 95 a tonne by mid next year instead of the fall to us 55 assumed by the treasury the forecast is somewhat above the department of industry s new july forecast of us 95 a tonne by the end of this year trending down to us 61 by the end of 2020 but are way in excess what was forecast in the budget a sensitivity analysis included in the budget said that for every us 10 that the iron ore price was higher than budgeted the government s tax take would be a 1 1 billion higher in 2019 20 and a 3 7 billion higher in 2020 21 the panel expects the australian dollar to remain broadly where it is at just below 70 us cents as the upward push from strong commodity prices offsets the downward push from domestic economic weakness yet despite the iron ore price and lower borrowing costs the panel expects a much weaker budget outcome than the a 7 1 billion surplus forecast in april its average forecast is for a surplus of only 1 7 billion which is a mere sliver of gdp 0 1 practically indistinguishable from a deficit of the same amount the forecasts come after finance department figures for may released on friday raised the possibility of an early return to surplus in 2018 19 they suggest that surplus is at risk in 2019 20 and beyond both because of economic weakness and an because of an increasingly urgent need to respond to that weakness through spending or further tax cuts asked whether should the government strive to continue to deliver its promise of a surplus if economic growth remains weak or weakens further former oecd director adrian blundell wignall replied bluntly of course not the only panellists prepared to defend the continued pursuit of a surplus in the economy remained weak or weakened were ross guest who said it was a worthwhile aim given the steady rise in government debt to gdp ratio and tony makin who qualified his reply by saying the surplus should be achieved by pruning unproductive expenditure such as industry assistance rather than deferring tax cuts former government minister craig emerson regretfully forecast that the government would deliver a surplus whatever the economic circumstances for political reasons the conversation

it could bring on recessions other panellists including rebecca cassells said the impact of us tariffs on chinese goods had so far been positive for australia china has responded by investing in infrastructure projects that need australian iron ore and coal this together with reduced competition from other suppliers of iron ore after the collapse of a tailings dam and mine closures in brazil has lifted the price and volume of australian exports to levels not seen for some time the panel expects robust united states growth of 2 6 per cent in 2019 although many members are concerned about the year that will follow the only panellist to forecast low us growth in this year 1 per cent is mr blundell wignall who until last year analysed world economies in his role as special adviser to the oecd secretary general living standards jobs growth will disappoint both the treasury which has forecast unemployment of 5 per cent by the end of the financial year and reserve bank governor philip lowe who has adopted a target of four point something all but three of the 20 person panel expect the rate to stay above 5 per cent the average forecast is 5 3 per cent which is close to the present 5 2 per cent mr stapledon said australia s recent strong employment growth had been out of kilter with slower gdp growth and the winding down of housing construction meaning jobs growth was set to slow down pushing up unemployment brendan coates said underemployment was also climbing as more people worked fewer hours than they would like making it harder for them to push for wage rises ms cassells pointed out that full time employment had grown almost twice as fast among women than men which given the low rates of pay in the industries that traditionally employed women was likely to further depress average wages the headline measure of living standards gdp per capita has been falling but a better measure real net disposable income per capita which takes better account of buying power has been continuing to climb the panel expected that to climb a further 1 per cent over the year to june 2020 after climbing 1 3 per cent in the year to march nominal gdp which takes full account of mining revenue and drives company profits and the budget revenue has grown 5 per cent over the past year and is expected to grow 3 per cent in the year ahead the risk of recession the panel regards a recession as more likely than it did in january assigning a 29 per cent probability to a conventionally defined recession in the next two years up from 25 per cent economic modeller janine dixon said the bulk of australia s recent economic growth had come from higher commodity prices via exports she said without them australia would be reliant on weak wage and consumption growth although she believed high population growth would be enough to ensure economic activity did not shrink for two consecutive quarters which would be the conventional definition of a recession former treasury and anz bank economist warren hogan said with consumers tightening their belts an external shock could easily knock australia into a recession julie toth an economist at the australian industry group who has also worked for the productivity commission said with growth already low it would not take much to turn it negative debt theorist steve keen who assigned a 95 per cent probability of a recession as he did in january said australia escaped that fate during the global financial crisis in part by boosting grants to first home buyers which made australian households among the most indebted in the world and put off the day of reckoning when those debts would be unwound through a mix of good luck and good management australia has avoided a recession during three global downturns since the early 1990s the 1997 asian economic crisis the early 2000s dotcom collapse and the 2007 09 global financial crisis if it succeeds again it will enter its forth decade recession free in this term of government in mid 2021 wages and prices the panel expects continued wage growth of only 2 2 per cent in 2019 20 slightly weaker than the latest reading of 2 3 per cent and well short of the budget forecast of 2 75 per cent if that average forecast is right it will be the seventh consecutive year in which wage growth has fallen short of the budget forecast the good news for wage earners is that even that unusually low rate of wage growth would be well above the rate of inflation which is expected to be only 1 5 per cent or 1 4 per cent on the so called underlying basis watched closely by the reserve bank the bad news for the reserve bank is that it will put inflation well outside the bank s target band of 2 to 3 per cent for the fifth consecutive year raising questions about whether there is any point to the band inflation since 1990 for years now inflation has been below the rba s target band the conversation mark crosby warren hogan and mr blundell wignall suggest broadening the target band to 1 to 3 per cent tony makin and mr stapledon suggest cutting it to 1 to 2 per cent richard holden and warwick mckibbin suggest ditching it altogether and replacing it with a target for nominal gdp growth mr mckibbin suggests a nominal gdp target of 6 per cent which given the present forecast for weaker nominal gdp growth would mean interest rate cuts in better times it would mean rate rises chris edmond and craig emerson defend the 2 to 3 per cent inflation target saying that what is really concerning is the bank s preparedness to stay beneath the target band for extended periods home prices the panel expects only modest falls in sydney and melbourne house prices of 2 to 3 per cent in each city after falls of 10 per cent over the past year it is more optimistic on home building than the treasury is expecting housing investment to fall by 4 9 per cent rather than the budget forecast of 7 per cent business none of the panellists expects household spending to grow by the 2 75 per cent forecast in the budget on average the panel expects spending growth of just 1 9 per cent in 2019 20 which is little better than the present 1 8 per cent and only few points above population growth ms dixon blames continuing weak growth in wages and incomes mr stapledon said much of it flowed from the weaker housing market household furnishings drive household spending growth household spending drives gdp growth accounting for more than half of it in better news the panel expects mining investment to rebound after sliding for most of the last five years its forecasts of growth in mining investment of 4 4 per cent and growth in non mining investment of 4 per cent are in line with budget forecasts interest rates and the budget perhaps surprisingly given its forecasts for weak employment growth weak economic growth and weak inflation the panel s average forecast for interest rates is for just one more cut perhaps as soon as july 2 but some time in the second half of the year only five panellists expect a follow up cut in the first half of next year but among them are craig emerson richard holden and steve keen who were the only three to correctly forecast in january that there would be a rate cut at all this year mr holden expects two further rate cuts in the second half of this year taking the reserve bank cash rate to 0 75 per cent and then a further two in the first half of next year taking it to just 0 25 per cent mr keen expects one further cut in the second half of this year and another two in the first half of next year taking it to 0 5 per cent mr mckibbin is the only panellist expecting the reserve bank to change course expecting one further cut this year and then a series of increases as ballooning debt makes the reserve bank and other central banks realise they cut too far pushing the cash rate back up to 1 5 per cent the panel expects a government 10 year borrowing rate of just 1 5 per cent which is about the lowest it has ever been a year ago the 10 year bond rate was 2 7 per cent the ultra low rate will both make it easier for the government to borrow and cut the cost of servicing its existing debt as loans are rolled over in further good news for the budget the panel expects a substantially higher spot iron ore price than the government does of us95 a tonne by mid next year instead of the fall to us55 assumed by the treasury the forecast is somewhat above the department of industry s new july forecast of us95 a tonne by the end of this year trending down to us61 by the end of 2020 but are way in excess of what was forecast in the budget a sensitivity analysis included in the budget said that for every us10 that the iron ore price was higher than budgeted the government s tax take would be 1 1 billion higher in 2019 20 and 3 7 billion higher in 2020 21 the panel expects the australian dollar to remain broadly where it is at just below 70 us cents as the upward push from strong commodity prices offsets the downward push from domestic economic weakness yet despite the iron ore price and lower borrowing costs the panel expects a much weaker budget outcome than the 7 1 billion surplus forecast in april its average forecast is for a surplus of only 1 2 billion which is a mere sliver of gross domestic product 0 07 per cent practically indistinguishable from a deficit of the same amount for the overwhelming majority of the panel that expect a weaker than forecast surplus or a deficit the reasons are economic weakness and the need to respond to that weakness through spending or tax cuts asked whether the government should strive to continue to deliver its promise of a surplus if economic growth remains weak or weakens further former oecd director mr blundell wignall replied bluntly of course not the only panellists prepared to defend the continued pursuit of a surplus if the economy remained weak or weakened were ross guest who said it was a worthwhile aim given the steady rise in government debt to gdp ratio and tony makin who qualified his reply by saying the surplus should be achieved by pruning unproductive expenditure such as industry assistance rather than deferring tax cuts former government minister craig emerson regretfully forecast that the government would deliver a surplus whatever the economic circumstances for political reasons peter martin is a visiting fellow at the crawford school of public policy at australian national university this article originally appeared on the conversation
peter martin crawford school of public policy australian national university during the election we were promised jobs and growth but in 2019 20 the conversation s forecasting panel is predicting an economic growth rate as weak as any since the financial crisis as well as dismal consumer spending no improvement in unemployment or wage growth and an increased chance of recession as in january the conversation has assembled a forecasting panel of 20 leading economists from 12 universities across six states among them are macroeconomists economic modellers former treasury imf oecd and reserve bank officials a former government minister and a former member of the reserve bank board whereas in january only three members of the 20 person panel expected the reserve bank to cut interest rates and most expected an economic growth rate approaching 3 which is the treasury s estimate of the best that can be achieved on a sustained basis this time all but two expect the bank to cut again and most expect a growth rate closer to 2 one of the most anaemic since the financial crisis read more no surplus no share market growth no lift in wage growth economic survey points to bleaker times post election on the upside the panel expects iron ore prices to stay higher for longer than did the budget it expects home prices to stabilise and it is predicting the lowest government bond rate on record making it cheaper than ever before for the government to borrow and spend its way out of trouble the panel predicts a surplus in name only in 2019 20 and overwhelmingly believes the government should be prepared to abandon it if it has to in order to keep the economy growing economic growth the panel s average forecast for year on year growth is 2 1 year on year growth is the measure used in the budget it compares economic activity throughout all of one financial year with activity throughout all of the previous financial year the budget forecast for 2019 20 is 2 75 respected forecasters including former reserve bank board member warwick mckibbin and former oecd director adrian blundell wignall expect much lower growth than 2 1 mckibbin expects 1 8 blundell wignall expects

now that government has taken back control of the country s monetary policy and tamed the runaway rates on the parallel market business must play ball by reducing the prices of goods and services in tandem with the tumbling exchange rates of the united states dollar against the local unit while government has always insisted that there is no correlation between the surge in prices of commodities and the escalating parallel market rates businesses tracked the rate and pegged their prices on the prevailing black market rates their argument was that they needed to restock and by pricing their goods above the prevailing rate they would be able to buy forex from the parallel market and import their stock even those businesses whose raw materials were mostly obtained in the country priced their goods based on the black market rates on monday last week government abolished the multi currency system and introduced the zimbabwe dollar as the sole currency of trade in the country the results were immediate the parallel market was thrown into turmoil and rates have plunged at the weekend they were hovering between usd1 1 7 zwl and 1 7 5 for electronic transactions for cash transactions the parallel market rates were trading at between 1 6 and 1 6 5 crucially for the first time since the currency reforms began on october 1 last year the interbank rate at 1 8 at some banks was more than the parallel market exchange rates this trend is expected to continue into this week as monetary authorities have said they will move in to support bureaux de change so that they operate efficiently and effectively reserve bank of zimbabwe governor dr john mangudya yesterday said compliance with the new mono currency regime was encouraging as more people were transacting in local currency the market has reacted positively to the recent currency reforms implemented by government we have seen people now paying in the local currency what it means is that we are now going to conserve foreign currency it also means we are going to be a competitive country said dr mangudya before the new policy measures the market the central bank chief said was increasingly dollarising which in turn put incredible pressures on the rtgs as the us dollar was not only being drained through foreign payments but also stretched through local transactions dr mangudya said the apex bank would ably support the local currency through restricting the growth of both money supply and the fiscal deficit with this instrument si 142 of 2019 we are going to conserve foreign currency for foreign payments what we are going to do now is to restrict growth of money supply and fiscal deficit we are also going to relax regulations so that there is ease of transaction we are going to capacitate the bureau de changes to buy and sell foreign currency for transactions as low as us 500 to cater for small to medium scale enterprises we have also removed administrative limits on the operation of bureau de changes and on the cap on margins for banks for interbank foreign exchange transactions he said writing in the chronicle today the minister of finance and economic development professor mthuli ncube said by scrapping the multi currency system zimbabwe had taken back control of its economic destiny it had always been apparent to us that for true stability stability upon which economic growth can be built our own currency was necessary the multicurrency regime was holding us back like a headwind for a cyclist who is already pedalling uphill the multicurrency regime had left us exposed to the elements in this case the element was the aggressive inflation caused by the us dollar pricing put simply we had to take our destiny back into our own hands we had to take back control of monetary policy to remove that element and make it up the hill he said regaining control will first and foremost benefit you the hardworking zimbabwean our teachers and doctors our entrepreneurs and cleaners they don t earn in us dollars so why sell in us dollars prior to this move the vast majority of our hard working zimbabweans were being discriminated against in what had become a two tiered and unfair economy what we had was a situation whereby there were stable and affordable prices for the fortunate zimbabweans who had access to dollars and a paralysing high cost of living for the rest of the country this is not right and we had to step in abolishing the use of multiple currencies and the adoption of the zimbabwe dollar as the sole legal tender has always been a key component of government s transitional stabilisation programme and a crucial step in restoring normalcy to the economy we appeal to businesses to work closely with government to guarantee the success of the latest move already prices of goods and services continue to tumble with cooking oil flour rice and washing powder reportedly on the downward trend this is encouraging
from our virtual university archives reposted by reader demand edited and expanded by patrice greanville originally posted on june 6 2013 revised 29 june 2019 well plus que ça change here we are in 2013 and the imperial monster is as ravenous and vicious as ever threatening wars in all latitudes while its formal democracy rapidly dissolves into a badly concealed friendly fascism behind a bipartisan presidential façade though now four decades old this overview of hemispheric conditions by john gerassi and the dialectics of us foreign policy chiefly afflicting latin america in the 1960s is disturbingly prescient for what it says about america itself and in particular the role of american liberals while his call for immediate action may sound outdated or premature to some if not downright uncomfortable to many his narrative attests to the fact that we face not so much passing personalities no matter how despicable but a system that produces them despite these caveats this essay remains one of the finest lessons in us history likely to be found anywhere and do not miss the superb comment by our globetrotting senior editor gaither stewart who knows the latin continent well patrice greanville by john gerassi published in 1969 a great deal is being written in america these days about pax americana and american hegemony in the underdeveloped world no longer able to blot out the obvious even calm rational conscientious academicians are publicly lamenting america s increasingly bellicose policies from vietnam to the dominican republic suddenly as if awakened from a technicolor dream intellectuals are discovering such words as imperialism and expansionism and they are asking why who s to blame what can be done to stop all this the questions are childish the assumptions false the implications naïve they reflect a liberal point of view one that claims that there is a qualitative difference between u s policies today and yesterday in fact american foreign policy has varied only in degree not in kind it has been cohesive coherent and consistent what has varied has been its strength and its critics the basic difference between american imperialism today and american imperialism a century ago is that it is more violent more far reaching and more carefully planned today but american foreign policy at least since 1823 has always been assertive always expansionist always imperialist of course it has rarely been pushed beyond america s capabilities thus when the united states was weak its interventions abroad were mild when its strength grew so did its daring today as the most powerful nation on earth with a technological advance over other countries of mammoth proportions the united states can be imperialistic on all continents with relative security the main reason why we have not had the opportunity to discuss this imperialism frankly and openly within the united states in its journals in academia and on other platforms is because americans interpretation of history has been dominated by liberal historians whose basic view of life is characterized by their inability or unwillingness to connect events thus when viewing latin america where american policy has always been crystal clear americans historians will admit indeed will detail u s interventions in specific countries of central america or the caribbean will sometimes even posit an imperialist explanation for a whole period of american history but will never draw overall conclusions will never connect events economics and politics to arrive at a basic tradition or characteristic to such historians for example there is little if any correlation between the events and policies of 1823 and those of 1845 or between 1898 and 1961 a word on james k polk one of the earliest and most successful internal imperialists by patrice greanville the mexicans certainly didn t know it all gringoes looking more or less the same to them basically pale tallish northern europeans but the specific plague that hit mexico in the 1840s was one of scots irish origin most of the texian heroes and agitators for texas independence and later absorption into the newly minted united states were of scots irish descent sam houston james polk william walker james bowie the legendary andrew jackson and so on themselves offshoots of the great scots irish migration flowing out of the ulster plantation in the 1700s and scotland itself most of of the scots irish had emigrated to the ulster plantation fleeing the almost constant wars practically 800 years on the scottish english border and later charles i s pressures to adopt the episcopal faith over their fanatical presbyterian allegiances as the wiki summary reminds us most of these emigres to america from ireland had been recent settlers or the descendants of settlers from the kingdom of england or the kingdom of scotland who had gone to ireland to seek economic opportunities and freedom from the control of the episcopal church of england and the scottish episcopal church these included 200 000 scottish presbyterians who settled in ireland between 1608 1697 many english born settlers of this period were also presbyterians although the denomination is today most strongly identified with scotland when king charles i attempted to force these presbyterians into the church of england in the 1630s many chose to re emigrate to north america where religious liberty was greater later attempts to force the church of england s control over dissident protestants in ireland were to lead to further waves of emigration to the trans atlantic colonies see wikipedia scotch irish americans james knox polk the first of ten children was born on november 2 1795 in a log cabin in what is now

firstborn after her father james knox the polks had migrated to america in the late 1600s settling initially on the eastern shore then in south central pennsylvania and eventually moving to the carolina hill country like many early scots irish settlers in north carolina the knox and polk families were presbyterian see wikipedia james k polk it is quite possible that the family and cultural roots of james polk instilled in him a fierce sense of raw nationalism boundless entitlement to riches and empowerment through merit both unfortunately underscored by racism an almost inevitable virus infecting europeans at the time and surely present still today among far too many white americans especially when confronted with what he surely perceived as a degenerate and inferior semi indigenous civilisation ludicrously in possession of a territory of almost incalculable value the story of the mexico s loss of her original territory if we accept the notion that what the spaniards conquered was legitimate and not in itself also a land grab at sword and gun point to the nascent american empire would not be complete without mention of sam houston the signer of texas declaration of independence a man with cultural roots in both tennessee and texas and certainly one of the most charismatic and in his own way admirable and tragic political figures in us history like polk who often acted as his political mentor and protector houston was scotch irish by descent but his family traced its origins back to scotland not to the kind of desperate poverty often defining the lives of most scots irish immigrants but to the benefits and privileges of landed gentry sam houston was the fifth son of major samuel houston and elizabeth paxton houston s paternal ancestry is often traced to his great great grandfather sir john houston who built a family estate in scotland in the late seventeenth century his second son john houston emigrated to ulster ireland during the ulster plantation period a person of integrity and moral courage houston also stood out among his peers by his friendly and respectful attitude toward native americans with whom he had lived several years in his youth young sam was 14 when his family moved to maryville tennessee and he had received only a basic education on the virginia frontier he ran away from home in 1809 at age 16 because he was dissatisfied working as a shop clerk in his older brothers store he went southwest and lived for a few years with the cherokee tribe led by ahuludegi also spelled oolooteka on hiwassee island in the hiwassee river above its confluence with the tennessee river ahuludegi had become hereditary chief after his brother moved west american settlers in the area called him john jolly he became an adoptive father to houston giving him the cherokee name of colonneh meaning the raven houston became fluent in the cherokee language while living with the tribe he visited his family in maryville every few months see wikipedia sam houston the above is quite unusual for an american politician to say the least even a man from the so called frontier but there were many other things that made houston a man clearly out of the ordinary including later his refusal to see the young state of texas embroiled in the civil war on the side of secession for which he paid a heavy price although houston was a slave owner and opposed abolition he opposed the secession of texas from the union an elected convention voted to secede from the united states on february 1 1861 and texas joined the confederate states of america on march 2 1861 houston refused to recognize its legality but the texas legislature upheld the legitimacy of secession the political forces that brought about texas s secession were powerful enough to replace the state s unionist governor houston chose not to resist stating i love texas too well to bring civil strife and bloodshed upon her to avert this calamity i shall make no endeavor to maintain my authority as chief executive of this state except by the peaceful exercise of my functions he was evicted from his office on march 16 1861 for refusing to take an oath of loyalty to the confederacy writing in an undelivered speech fellow citizens in the name of your rights and liberties which i believe have been trampled upon i refuse to take this oath in the name of the nationality of texas which has been betrayed by the convention i refuse to take this oath in the name of the constitution of texas i refuse to take this oath in the name of my own conscience and manhood which this convention would degrade by dragging me before it to pander to the malice of my enemies i refuse to take this oath i deny the power of this convention to speak for texas i protest against all the acts and doings of this convention and i declare them null and void the texas secession convention replaced houston with lieutenant governor edward clark to avoid more bloodshed in texas houston turned down u s col frederick w lander s offer from president lincoln of 50 000 troops to prevent texas s secession he said allow me to most respectfully decline any such assistance of the united states government after leaving the governor s mansion houston traveled to galveston along the way many people demanded an explanation for his refusal to support the confederacy on april 19 1861 from a hotel window he told a crowd let me tell you what is coming after the sacrifice of countless millions of treasure and hundreds of thousands of lives you may win southern independence if god be not against you but i doubt it i tell you that while i believe with you in the doctrine of states rights the north is determined to preserve this union they are not a fiery impulsive people as you are for they live in colder climates but when they begin to move in a given direction they move with the steady momentum and perseverance of a mighty avalanche and what i fear is they will overwhelm the south while many are led to believe that history is peopled with black and white characters and this is sometimes the case the more usual situation is one of gradations in gray with good and evil mixed in often unsortable ways sam houston s life is a cautionary note in this regard pg most liberal historians will admit today that the united states has often been imperialistic in latin america up to 1933 yet slaves of their own rhetoric they will inevitably cite the rhetoric of franklin delano roosevelt the greatest liberal of them all to insist that with the new deal american imperialism came to an end they can make this statement because they are committed to the proposition that it is the american state department which makes foreign policy simply because it is supposed to and also because of their own fear of being identified with marxist ideology a fear that leads them to refuse to interpret imperialism as economic rare is the liberal historian who first asks himself just what imperialism is or if he does rarer still is he who simply and succinctly admits that imperialism is a policy aimed at material gain and this in spite of the fact that he knows full well that there has never been a stronger or more consistent justification for intervening in the affairs of other countries than the expectation to derive material benefit therefrom imperialism has always operated in three specific recognizable and analyzable stages 1 to control the sources of raw material for the benefit of the imperializing country 2 to control the markets in the imperialized country for the benefit of the imperializing country s producers and 3 to control the imperialized country s internal development and economic structure so as to guarantee continuing expansion of stages 1 and 2 that has been our policy in latin america it began in recognizable manner in 1823 with president monroe s declaration warning nonhemisphere nations to stay out of the american continent because of its rhetoric america s liberal historians interpreted the monroe doctrine as a generous even altruistic declaration on the part of the united states to protect its weaker neighbors to the south to those neighbors however that doctrine asserted america s ambitions it said in effect europeans stay out of latin america because it belongs to the united states a liberal but not an american salvador de madariaga once explained its hold on americans i only know two things about the monroe doctrine one is that no american i have met knows what it is the other is that no american i have met will consent to its being tampered with that being so i conclude that the monroe doctrine is not a doctrine but a dogma for such are the two features by which you can tell a dogma but when i look closer into it i find that it is not one dogma but two to wit the dogma of the infallibility of the american president and the dogma of the immaculate conception of american foreign policy indeed in the year 1824 secretary of state later president john quincy adams made the monroe doctrine unequivocally clear when he told simon bolivar one of latin america s great liberators to stay out of that is not liberate cuba and puerto rico which were still under the spanish yoke the monroe doctrine said adams must not be interpreted as authorization for the weak to be insolent with the strong two years later the united states refused to attend the first pan american conference called by bolivar in panama for the creation of a united states of latin america further the united states used its influence and its strength to torpedo that conference because a united latin america would offer strong competition to american ambitions on the continent as well as beyond the conference failed and bolivar concluded in 1829 the united states appear to be destined by providence to plague america with misery in the name of liberty nor was the united states yet ready to put the monroe doctrine into effect against european powers at least not if they were strong in 1833 for example england invaded the falkland islands belonging to argentina and instead of invoking the monroe doctrine the united states supported england england still owns those islands today two years later the united states allowed england to occupy the northern coast of honduras which is still british honduras england then invaded guatemala tripled its honduran territory and in 1839 took over the island of roatan instead of reacting against england the united states moved against mexico within a few years mexico lost half of its territory the richest half to the united states in 1854 the united states settled a minor argument with nicaragua by sending a warship to bombard san juan del norte three years later when one american citizen was wounded there president buchanan levied a fine of 20 000 which nicaragua could not pay the united states repeated the bombardment following it with marines who proceeded to burn down anything that was still standing the next year the united states forced nicaragua to sign the cass irisarri treaty which gave the united states the right of free passage anywhere on nicaraguan soil and the right to intervene in its affairs for whatever purpose the united states saw fit if that does not make america s material interest in nicaragua obvious to a liberal nothing will the liberal historian will insist however that during this period the state department was often isolationist indeed that it tried to enforce america s neutrality laws strictly that is true but that does not mean once again that america was not imperialistic for policy was not and is not made by the state department but by those who profit from it this was quite clear during the filibuster era when american privateers raised armies and headed south to conquer areas for private american firms in 1855 for example william walker a nashville born doctor lawyer and journalist who practiced none of these professions invaded nicaragua captured grenada and had himself elected president of nicaragua he then sent a message to president franklin pierce asking that nicaragua be admitted to the union as a slave state even though nicaragua had long outlawed slavery walker was operating for private american corporations bent on exploiting central america the trouble was that these corporations were the rivals of cornelius vanderbilt s accessory transit company whose concessions walker as president canceled vanderbilt thereupon threw his weight money and power behind other forces and they defeated walker at santa rosa he was then handed over to the united states navy brought back to the united states and tried for violating neutrality laws this had happened to him once before after failing to conquer lower california and he had then been acquitted now he was again acquitted and in fact cheered by the sympathetic jury was the jury corrupt was it imperialist itself or was it simply reflecting the teachings the propaganda the atmosphere of the united states when the first colonizers to the united states had successfully established viable societies in their new land they launched themselves westward liberal historians tell us that this great pioneering spurt was truly a magnificent impulse a golden asset in america s formation in their expansionism to the west the early americans were ruthless systematically wiping out the entire indigenous population but they were successful and by and large that expansion was completed without sacrificing too many of the basic civil rights of the white settlers thus early america began to take pride in its system later as american entrepreneurs launched the industrialization of their country they were equally successful in the process they exploited the new settlers i e the working class and their children but they built a strong economy so once again they showed themselves and the world that america was a great country so great in fact that it could not should not stop at its own borders as these entrepreneurs expanded beyond america s borders mostly via the sea and so developed america s naval power they were again successful thus once again they proved that their country was great it did not matter that jeffersonian democracy which liberal historians praise as the moral backbone of america s current power rested on the haves and excluded the have nots to the point of not allowing the propertyless to vote nor did it matter that jacksonian democracy which liberal historians praise even more functioned in a ruthless totalitarian setting in which one sector of the economy attempted and by and large succeeded in crushing another the rhetoric was pure the results formidable and therefore the system perfect that system became known as the american way of life a way of life in which the successful were the good the unsuccessful the bad america was founded very early on the basic premise that he who is poor deserves to be poor he who is rich is entitled to the fruit of his power since america was big enough and rich enough to allow its entrepreneurs to become tycoons while also allowing the poor to demand a fair shake civil rights and a certain mobility the rhetoric justifying all the murders and all the exploitations became theory out of the theory grew the conviction that america was the greatest country in the world precisely because it allowed self determination from there it was only a step to the conclusion that any country which could do the same would be equally great the corollary of course was that those who did not would not be great finally it became clear to all north americans that he who is great is good the american way of life became the personification of morality from america s pride in its way of life followed its right to impose that way of life on non americans americans became superior self righteous and pure the result was that a new jesuit company was formed it too carried the sword and the cross america s sword was its marines its cross was american democracy under that cross as under the cross brandished about by the conquistadors of colonial spain the united states rationalized its colonialism naval captain alfred thayer mahan even developed a theory based on social darwinism to prove that history is a struggle in which the strongest and fittest survive the protestant clergy also joined in to ennoble american imperialism the jury that tried walker for violating america s neutrality laws which he had clearly violated expressed that imperialist duty and colonialist spirit when it cheered walker out of the court it was simply reflecting its deep rooted conviction that nicaragua would be better off as a slave state in the union than as a free country outside it to that jury as to the american people today there can be only one democratic system worthy of the name the american there can be only one definition of freedom american free enterprise thus there is no need for the state department to proclaim an imperialist policy the vanderbilts or the rockefellers or the guggenheims the united fruit company or the hanna mining company or the anaconda company can do what they please after all they represent democracy they are the embodiment of freedom what s more they know that when the chips are down american might will stand behind them or in front within the last century america s colonial expansionism based on and strengthened by the american way of life has become consistently bolder in 1860 the united states intervened in honduras in 1871 it occupied samana bay in santo domingo in 1881 it joined peru in its war against chile in exchange for the port of chimbote as a united states naval base nearby coal mines and a railroad from the mines to the port in 1885 it again torpedoed the central american federation because it feared such an organization might jeopardize an atlantic pacific canal owned by the united states meanwhile in 1884 official united states government commercial missions were launched throughout latin america for one purpose only and as one such mission reported that purpose was successfully carried out our countrymen easily lead in nearly every major town in every republic will be found businessmen with wide circles of influence moreover resident merchants offer the best means to introduce and increase the use of the goods nothing of course has changed in this respect notice for example a report in newsweek magazine of april 19 1965 american diplomats can be expected to intensify their help to united states businessmen overseas directives now awaiting dean rusk s signature will remind united states embassies that their efficiency will be rated not only by diplomatic and political prowess but by how well they foster american commercial interests abroad moreover prominent businessmen will be recruited as inspectors of the foreign service in 1895 president cleveland intervened in venezuela in 1897 and again in 1898 the united states stopped further federation attempts in central america in 1898 after fabricating a phony war with spain the united states annexed puerto rico the philippines and guam and set up cuba as a republic controlled by the united states through the platt amendment 1901 this amendment gave the united states the right to intervene in matters of life property individual libery and cuban independence that is in everything the near absence of significant public outcry in the united states against this policy of open imperialism in both the caribbean and pacific shows once again that the people of the united states were convinced that it was her destiny to expand and that her superiority demanded it after 1900 even liberal historians lament america s foreign policy theodore roosevelt who is nevertheless admired as one of america s greatest presidents intervened by force of arms in almost every caribbean and central american country naturally the real beneficiaries were always american businessmen it is worth repeating an often quoted statement in this respect i helped make mexico and especially tampico safe for american oil interests i helped make haiti and cuba a decent place for the national city bank boys to collect revenue in i helped pacify nicaragua for the international banking house of brown brothers i brought light to the dominican republic for american sugar interests i helped make honduras right for american fruit companies that harsh but accurate indictment was supplied by a much decorated united states patriot major general smedley d butler of the united states marine corps against such interventions some local patriots fought back in haiti where united states marines landed in 1915 and stayed until 1934 2 000 rebels called cacos had to be killed before the united states pacified the island and there were other rebellions everywhere in nicaragua one such rebel had to be tricked to be eliminated augusto cesar sandino left fought american marines from 1926 until 1934 without being defeated though the marines razed various towns in nicaragua and by accident some in honduras to boot in 1934 he was offered negotiations was foolish enough to believe them came to the american embassy to confer with ambassador arthur bliss lane and he was assassinated such incidents are so common in american foreign policy that no intelligent rebel who has popular support can ever again trust negotiation offers by the united states unless the setting and the terms of these negotiations can be controlled by him it seems as if ho chi minh is just that intelligent on march 4 1933 the united states officially changed its policy beginning with his inauguration address franklin d roosevelt told the world that american imperialism was at an end and that from now on the united states would be a good neighbor he voted in favor of a nonintervention pledge at the 1933 montevideo inter american conference promised latin american countries tariff reductions and exchange trade agreements and a year later abrogated the platt amendment his top diplomat sumner welles even said in 1935 it is my belief that american capital invested abroad in fact as well as in theory be subordinated to the authority of the people of the country where it is located but in fact only the form of america s interventionism changed fdr was the most intelligent imperialist the united states has had in modern times as a liberal he knew the value of rhetoric as a capitalist he knew that whoever dominates the economy dominates the politics as long as american interventionism for economic gain had to be defended by american marines rebellions and revolutions would be inevitable when a country is occupied by american marines the enemy is always clearly identifiable he wears the marine uniform but if there are no marines if the oppressors are the local militia police or military forces if these forces loyalty to american commercial interests can be guaranteed by their economic ties to american commercial interests it will be difficult even impossible for local patriots to finger the enemy that fdr understood thus he launched a brilliant series of policies meant to tie latin american countries to the united states in 1938 fdr set up the interdepartmental committee of cooperation with american republics which was in effect the precursor of today s technical aid program of the organization of american states oas the oas itself had grown out of the pan american union which had been set up by secretary of state james g blaine as an ideal economic complement to the united states fdr s interdepartmental committee assured latin america s dependency on the united states for technical progress during the war the united states department of agriculture sent latin america soil conservation research teams who helped increase latin america s dependency on one crop economies in 1940 fdr said that the united states government and united states private business should invest heavily in latin america in order to develop sources of raw materials needed in the united states on september 26 1940 he raised the ceiling on loans made by the export import bank which is an arm of the american treasury from 100 million to 700 million and by pearl harbor day most latin american countries had received development loans from which they have yet to disengage themselves latin america s economic dependency was further secured during the war through the united states lend lease program which poured 262 762 000 worth of united states equipment into eighteen latin american nations the two excluded were panama which was virtually an american property and argentina which was rebellious roosevelt s policies were so successful that his successors liberals all whether republican or democrat continued and strengthened them by 1950 the united states controlled 70 percent of latin america s sources of raw materials and 50 percent of its gross national product theoretically at least there was no more need for military intervention latin american reformers did not realize to what extent the economic stranglehold by the united states insured pro american business governments they kept thinking that if they could only present their case to their people they could alter the pattern of life and indeed the structure itself because the united states advocated in rhetoric at least free speech and free institutions the reformers hoped that it would help them come to power what they failed to realize was that in any underdeveloped country the vast majority of the population is either illiterate and therefore cannot vote or else lives in address less slums and therefore still cannot vote what s more there is no surplus of funds available from the poor thus to create a party and be materially strong enough to wage a campaign with radio and newspaper announcements for the sake of the poor is impossible the poor cannot finance such a campaign that is why the united states often tried to convince its puppets to allow freedom of the press and freedom of elections after all the rich will always be the only ones capable of owning newspapers and financing elections now and then of course through some fluke a reformist president has been elected in latin america if he then tried to carry out his reforms he was always overthrown this is what happened in guatemala where juan jose arevalo and then jacobo arbenz were elected on reformist platforms before arevalo s inauguration in 1945 guatemala was one of the most backward countries in latin america the rights of labor whether in factories or in fields including united fruit company plantations had never been recognized unions civil liberties freedom of speech and press had been outlawed foreign interests had been sacred and monopolistic and their tax concessions beyond all considerations of fairness counting each foreign corporation as a person 98 percent of guatemala s cultivated land was owned by exactly 142 people out of a population of 3 million only 10 percent of the population attended school arevalo and arbenz tried to change these conditions as long as they pressed for educational reforms no one grumbled too much free speech and press were established then unions were recognized and legalized and finally on june 17 1952 arbenz proclaimed decree 900 a land reform which called for the expropriation and redistribution of uncultivated lands above a basic average but decree 900 specifically exempted all intensively cultivated lands which amounted to only 5 percent of over 1 000 hectare farms then under cultivation the decree ordered all absentee owned property to be redistributed but offered compensation in twenty year bonds at 3 percent interest assessed according to declared tax value america s agronomists applauded decree 900 in latin american issues published by the twentieth century fund one can read on page 179 for all the furor it produced decree 900 which had its roots in the constitution of 1945 is a remarkably mild and fairly sound piece of legislation but since much of guatemalan plantation land including 400 000 acres not under cultivation belonged to the united fruit company the united states became concerned and when arbenz gave out that fallow land to 180 000 peasants the united states condemned his regime as communist the united states convened the oas in caracas to make that condemnation official and found a right wing colonel named carlos castillo armas a graduate of the u s command and general staff school at fort leavenworth kansas to do its dirty work it fed him arms and dollars to set up a rebel force in honduras and nicaragua and helped him overthrow arbenz no matter how good a neighbor the united states wanted to appear it was perfectly willing to dump such neighborliness and resort to old fashioned military intervention when the commercial interests of its corporations were threatened since then the united states has intervened again repeatedly most visibly in the dominican republic in 1965 today there can no longer be more than two positions in latin america as a result of the dominican intervention in which 23 000 american troops were used to put down a nationalist rebellion of 4 000 armed men the united states has made it clear that it will never allow any latin government to break america s rigid economic control and what is that control today 85 percent of the sources of raw material are controlled by the united states one american company united fruit controls over 50 percent of the foreign earnings therefore of the whole economic structure of six latin american countries in venezuela the standard oil company of new jersey rockefeller through its subsidiary the creole oil corporation controls all the bases of the industrialization processess venezuela is potentially the second richest country in the world its 500 million plus net annual revenue from oil could guarantee every family counting it at 6 5 persons an annual income of almost 3 000 instead 40 percent of its population lives outside the money economy 22 percent are unemployed and the country must use over 100 million a year of its revenue to import foodstuffs although the country has enough land under a proper agrarian reform to be an exporter of food chile with enough minerals to raise a modern industrial state flounders in inflation 21 percent in 1966 while despite all the talk of revolution in freedom there is only freedom for at most one fifth of the population and revolution for no one so far the best that eduardo frei has been able to do is to launch sewing classes in the slums the right accuses him of demagogy the left of paternalism both are correct while as the christian science monitor september 19 1966 says many of the poor are apathetic saying that they are just being used as they have in the past the continent as a whole must use from 30 to 40 percent of its foreign earnings to pay off interest and service charges not the principal on loans to the industrialized world mostly the united states the alliance for progress claims that it is helping latin america industrialize on a social progress basis now more than six years old it has chalked up remarkable successes right wing coups in argentina brazil honduras guatemala ecuador the dominican republic and el salvador in exchange united states businessmen have remitted to united states 5 billion in profits while investing less than 2 billion and the alliance itself which is supposed to lend money strictly for social progress projects has kept 86 percent of its outlay to credits for u s made goods credits which are guaranteed by latin american governments and are repayable in dollars but then under johnson the alliance no longer maintains its social pretenses in fact no u s policy does as president johnson himself made clear last november when he told american gis at camp stanley korea and as recorded and broadcast by pacifica radio stations don t forget there are only 200 million of us in a world of three billion they want what we ve got and we re not going to give it to them interventionist and imperialist policies of the united states in latin america are now successfully in the third stage not only does the united states control latin america s sources of raw material not only does it control its markets for american manufactured goods but it also controls the internal money economy altogether karl marx once warned that the first revolutionary wave in an imperialized country will come about as the result of frustration on the part of the national bourgeoisie which will have reached a development stage where it will have accumulated enough capital to want to become competitive with the imperializing corporations this was not allowed to happen in latin america as american corporations became acutely plagued by surplus goods they realized that they would have to expand their markets in underdeveloped countries to do so however they would have to help develop a national bourgeoisie which could purchase these goods this national bourgeoisie like all such classes in colonialized countries had to be created by the service industries yet somehow limited so that it did not become economically independent the solution was simple the american corporations having set up assembly plants in sao paulo or buenos aires which they called brazilian or argentinian corporations actually decided to help create the subsidiary industries themselves with local money take general motors for example first it brought down its cars in parts thus eliminating import duties then it assembled them in sao paulo and called them brazil made next it shopped around for local entrepreneurs to launch the subsidiary industries seat covers spark plugs etc normally the landed oligarchy and entrepreneurs in the area would do its own investing in those subsidiary industries and having successfully amassed large amounts of capital would join together to create their own car industry it was this step that had to be avoided thus general motors first offered these local entrepreneurs contracts by which it helped finance the servicing industries then it brought the entrepreneurs capital into huge holding corporations which in turn it rigidly controlled the holding corporations became very successful making the entrepreneurs happy and everyone forgot about a local competitive car industry making gm happy this procedure is best employed by ibec international basic economy corporation rockefeller s mammoth investing corporation in latin america ibec claims to be locally owned by latin americans since it does not hold a controlling interest but the 25 to 45 percent held by standard oil it varies from colombia to venezuela to peru is not offset by the thousands of individual latin investors who to set policy would all have to agree among themselves and then vote in a block when one corporation owns 45 percent while thousands of individual investors split the other 55 percent the corporation sets policy in the u s as well as abroad besides ibec is so successful that the local entrepreneurs think american even before ibec does in any case the result of these holding corporations is that the national bourgeoisie in latin america has been eliminated it is an american bourgeoisie see the analysis in this section by carlos romeo a brilliant young chilean economist who both worked with che guevara as a practical planner and taught with regis debray at the university of havana where together they worked out the theoretical consequences of latin america s reality ibec and other holding corporations use their combined local u s capital to invest in all sorts of profitable ventures from supermarkets to assembly plants naturally these new corporations are set up where they can bring the largest return ibec is not going to build a supermarket in the venezuelan province of falcon where the population lives outside the money economy altogether and hence could not buy goods at the supermarket anyway nor would ibec build a supermarket in falcon because there are no roads leading there thus the creation of ibec subsidiaries in no way helps develop the infrastructure of a country what s more since such holding corporations have their tentacles in every region of the economy they control the money market as well which is why u s corporations backed indeed pushed the formation of a latin american common market at the 1967 punta del este conference such a common market would eliminate duties on american goods assembled in latin america and exported form one latin american country to another hence no new american investment needs to be brought down even for the 45 percent of the holding corporations a new american investment in latin america today is a paper investment the new corporation is set up with local funds which only drains the local capital reserves and the result is an industry benefiting only those sectors which purchase american surplus goods having so tied up the local economic elites the united states rarely needs to intervene with marines to guarantee friendly governments the local military bought by the american national interests guarantees friendly regimes with the approval of the local press the local legal political parties the local cultural centers all of which the local money controls and the local money is now tightly linked to american interests latin american reformers have finally realized all this they now know that the only way to break that structure is to break it which means a violent revolution hence there are no reformers in latin america any more they have become either pro americans whatever they call themselves who will do america s bidding or else they are revolutionaries perhaps the best example of this awakening is described in fabricio ojeda s toward revolutionary power ojeda once a well off student who hoped to bring about reforms through the electoral process and got himself elected national deputy eventually became a revolutionary and guerrilla chief american liberal historians social scientists and politicians insist that there is still a third way a nonviolent revolution which will be basically pro democracy i e pro american they tell us that such a revolutionary process has already started and that it will inevitably lead to equality between the united states and its latin neighbors liberal politicians also like to tell americans that they should be on the side of that process help it along give it periodic boosts in may 1966 robert kennedy put it this way in a senate speech a revolution is coming a revolution which will be peaceful if we are wise enough compassionate if we care enough successful if we are fortunate enough but a revolution which is coming whether we will it or not we can affect its character we cannot alter its inevitability what kennedy seemed incapable of understanding however was that if the revolution is peaceful and compassionate if americans can affect its character then it will be no revolution at all there have been plenty of such misbred revolutions already let s look at a couple in uruguay at the beginning of this century a great man carried out the modern world s first social revolution and he was very peaceful very compassionate and very successful jose batlle y ordoñez gave his people the eight hour day a day of rest for every five of work mandatory severance pay a minimum wage unemployment compensation old age pensions paid vacations he legalized divorce abolished capital punishment set up a state mortgage bank he made education free through the university levied taxes on capital real estate profits horse racing and luxury sales but not on income which would he thought curtail incentive he nationalized public utilities insurance alcohol oil cement meat packing fish processing the principal banks he outlawed arbitrary arrests searches and seizures separated the state from the church which was forbidden to own property he made it possible for peons to come to the city and get good jobs if they didn t like working for the landed oligarchy all of this he did before the russian revolution without one murder without one phony election but what happened a thriving middle class became more and more used to government subsidy when the price of meat and wool fell on the world market the subsidies began to evaporate the middle class was discontent used to government support it demanded more the government was forced to put more and more workers mostly white collar on its payroll the whole structure became a hand me down because the people had never participated in batlle s great revolution nobody had fought for it it had come on a silver platter and now that the platter was being chipped away those who had most profited from the so called revolution became unhappy today in uruguay more than one third of the working force is employed by the government but does not share in the decision making apparatus and the government of course is bankrupt it needs help and so it begs and the united states as usual is very generous it is rescuing uruguay but uruguay is paying for it it has too much of a nationalistic tradition to be as easily controlled as the but on matters crucial to the united states uruguay now toes the line it either abstains or votes yes whenever the u s want the organization of american states to justify or rationalize u s aggression and of course free enterprise is once again primary the oligarchy still owns the land still lives in europe from its fat earnings there are fewer poor in uruguay than elsewhere in latin america but those who are poor stay poor the middle class self centered and self serving takes pride in being vivo shrewd and sharp at being able to swindle the government and one another uruguay is politically one of the most pleasant places to live but only if one has money only if one has abandoned all hope of achieving national pride or a truly equitable society in 1910 while uruguay s peaceful revolution was still unfolding mexico unleashed its own neither peacefully nor compassionately for the next seven years blood was shed throughout the land and the indian peasants took a very active part in the upheaval but mexico s revolution was not truly a people s war for it was basically controlled by the bourgeoisie francisco i madero who led the first revolutionary wave was certainly honest but he was also a wealthy landowner who could never feel the burning thirst for change that mexican peasants fought for he did understand it somewhat and perhaps for that reason was assassinated with the complicity of the u s ambassador henry lane wilson but he was incapable of absorbing into his program the unverbalized but nonetheless real plans that such peasant leaders as pancho villa and emiliano zapata embodied in their violent reaction to the long torment suffered by their people the bourgeoisie and the peasants according to gunder frank faced a common enemy the feudal order and its supporting pillars of church army and foreign capital but their goals differed freedom from domestic and foreign bonds and loosening of the economic structure for the bourgeoisie land for the peasants although zapata continued to press the interests of the peasants until his murder in 1919 the real leadership of the revolution was never out of the hands of the bourgeoisie except insofar as it was challenged by the huerta reaction and american intervention the elimination of feudal social relations was of course in the interests of the emerging bourgeoisie as well as of the peasants education became secularized church and state more widely separated but accession to power by the peasantry was never really in the cards thus kept out of power the peasants never genuinely benefited from their revolution they did receive land periodically but it was rarely fertile or irrigated and the ejidos communal lands soon became the poorest sections of mexico the bourgeois revolutionary elite grew into mexico s new oligarchy and while some of its members did have darker skins than the old spanish colonialists the peasants were never integrated into the new institutional revolutionary party power structure today not only do they rarely vote in the 1958 presidential elections for example only 23 percent of the population voted officially and that only after frauds upped the count but they barely profit from the social laws instituted by the revolution as vincett padgett who is no revolutionary has written to the marginal mexican the law and the courts are of little use the formal institutions are not expected to provide justice there is only acceptance and supplication in the most unusual of circumstances there is for the marginal man the resort to violence but the most significant point is that there exists no middle ground in mexico today peasants still die of starvation illiteracy is about 50 percent and 46 percent of school age children do not attend schools at all most of the cotton is controlled by one u s outlet anderson clayton and 55 percent of mexican banks capital is dominated by the united states yet mexico s revolution was both anti american and violent what went wrong what went wrong is that the revolution failed to sustain its impulses it is not enough to win militarily a revolutionary must continue to fight long after he defeats his enemy he must keep his people armed as a constant check against himself and as a form of forcing the people s participation in his revolutionary government yet he must also be careful not to guide this popular participation into a traditional form of party or state democracy lest the intramural conflicts devour the revolution itself as they did in bolivia he must make the transition from a generalized concept of anti americanism to a series of particular manifestations that is he must nationalize all the properties belonging to americans or britons or turks or whoever is the dominating imperialist power like all of us who can never find ourselves psychologically until we face death until we sink to such an abyss that we can touch death smell it eat it and then and only then rise slowly to express our true selves so too for the revolution and the revolutionary both must completely destroy in order to rebuild both must sink to chaos in order to find the bases for building the true expression of the people s will only then can there be a total integration of the population into the new nation i am not trying here to define a psychological rationalization for violent revolution what i am maintaining is that if one wants an overhaul of society if one wants to establish an equitable society if one wants to install economic democracy without which all the political democracy in heaven and washington is meaningless then one must be ready to go all the way there are no shortcuts to either truth or justice besides violence already exists in the latin america continent today but it is a negative violence a counterrevolutionary violence such violence takes the form of dying of old age at twenty eight in brazil s northeast or it is the bolivian woman who feeds only three of her four children because the fourth as she told me is sickly and will probably have died anyway and i have not enough food for all four liberals of course will argue that one can always approximate compromise defend the rule of law while working for better living conditions piece by piece but the facts shatter such illusions latin america is poorer today than thirty years ago fewer people drink potable water now than then one third of the population live in slums half never see a doctor besides every compromise measure has either failed or been corrupted vargas gave brazilian workingmen a class consciousness and launched a petroleum industry his heirs filled their own pockets but tried to push brazil along the road to progress they were smashed by the country s economic master the united states peron whatever his personal motivation gave argentinians new hopes and new slogans his successors pretending to despise him bowed to u s pressure kept their country under their boot and sold out its riches to american companies in guatemala as we saw arevalo and then arbenz tried to bring about social and agrarian reforms without arming the people without violence the u s destroyed them by force and when the right wing semidictatorship of ydigoras fuentes decided to allow free elections in which arevalo might make a comeback america s great liberal rhetorician president kennedy ordered ydigoras removal as the miami herald reported in the dominican republic a people s spontaneous revulsion for new forms of dictatorships after thirty two years of trujillo was met by u s marines and so on the list is endless latin america s revolutionaries know from the experience of the dominican republic of guatemala and of vietnam that to break the structure is to invite american retaliation they also realize that american retaliation will be so formidable that is may well succeed at least under normal conditions in peru in 1965 apra rebelde went into the mountains to launch guerrilla warfare against the american puppet regime of belaunde gaining wide popular support from the disenfranchised masses it believed that it could go from phase number one hit and run tactics to phase number two open confrontation with the local military it made a grievous mistake because the united states had also learned from its experience in vietnam it knew that it could not allow the local military to collapse or else it would have to send half a million men as it had in as small a country as vietnam the u s cannot afford half a million men for all the countries that rebel thus as soon as apra rebelde gathered on the mountain peak of the andes for that phase number two confrontation the u s hit it with napalm apra rebelde was effectively if only temporarily destroyed its leaders including luis de la puente uceda and guillermo lobaton were killed but the guerrillas have also learned from that mistake today in guatemala venezuela colombia and bolivia strong guerrilla forces are keeping mobile and are creating such havoc that the u s is forced to make the same mistake it did in vietnam it is sending rangers and special forces into combat in guatemala as of january 1 1967 twenty eight rangers have been killed the united states through its partners in venezuela and bolivia has again used napalm but this time with no success in colombia the u s is using vietnam type weapons as well as helicopters to combat the guerrillas but again without notable success new guerrilla uprisings are taking place as of may 1967 in brazil peru and ecuador but even more important a new attitude has developed an attitude that had been clearly enunciated by che guevara who died in bolivia seeking to organize rebellion that attitude recognizes that the united states cannot be militarily defeated in one isolated country at a time the u s cannot on the other hand sustain two three five vietnams simultaneously if it tried to do so its internal economy would crumble also its necessarily increasing repressive measures at home needed to quell rising internal dissent would have to become so strong that the whole structure of the united states would be endangered from within the attitude further exclaims with unhesitating logic that imperialism never stops by itself like the man who has 100 and wants 200 the corporation that gets 1 million lusts for 2 million and the country that owns one continent seeks to control two the only way to defeat it is to hit each of its imperialist tentacles simultaneously thus was caesar defeated thus also was alexander crushed thus too was the imperialism of france of england of spain of germany eventually stopped and thus will the united states be stopped che guevara had no illusions about what this will mean in latin america he wrote the present moment may or may not be the proper one for starting the struggle but we cannot harbor any illusions we have no right to do so that freedom can be obtained without fighting and these battles shall not be mere street fights with stones against tear gas bombs nor pacific general strikes neither will they be those of a furious people destroying in two or three days the repressive superstructure of the ruling oligarchies the struggle will be long harsh and its battlefronts will be the guerrilla s refuge the cities the homes of the fighters where the repressive forces will go seeking easy victims among their families among the massacred rural populations in the villages or in cities destroyed by the bombardments of the enemy nor shall it be a gentleman s war writes che we must carry the war as far as the enemy carries it to his home to his centers of entertainment in a total war it is necessary to prevent him from having a moment of peace a quiet moment outside his barracks or even inside we must attack him wherever he may be make him feel like a cornered beast wherever he may move then his morale will begin to fall he will become still more savage but we shall see the signs of decadence begin to appear che concludes candidly our soldiers must hate a people without hatred cannot vanquish a brutal enemy this analysis is the inevitable and necessary conclusion of anyone who faces squarely the history of american imperialism and its effect on the imperialized people latin america today is poorer and more suffering than it was ten years ago ten years before that and so on back through the ages american capital has not only taken away the latin american people s hope for a better material future but their sense of dignity as well this analysis will shock the liberals and they will reject it but then they are responsible for it for american foreign policy has long been the studied creation of american liberals that is why an honest man today must consider the liberal as the true enemy of mankind that is why he must become a revolutionary that is why he must agree with che guevara that the only hope the peoples of the world have is to crush american imperialism by defeating it on the battlefield and the only way to do that is to coordinate their attacks and launch them wherever men are exploited wherever men are suffering as the result of american interests the only answer unless structural reforms can be achieved in the united states which will put an end to the greed of american corporations is as che guevara has said the poor and the honest of the world must arise to launch simultaneous vietnams in revolution in the revolution regis debray tried to give the first of many theoretical systemizations as to how this coordinated armed struggle can be waged american readers who generally had never heard of debray until that pamphlet became a best seller are quick to condemn him for his lack of analytical preliminaries but debray is no superficial pamphleteer though he makes some important errors in revolution in the revolution he is a serious student of the latin american scene and had published some extremely lucid essays on the political and methodological aspects of revolution one of which is included in this section prior to revolution in the revolution which was meant as a working paper anyway in this paper the most important change in tactics that he suggests is the constant creation of guerrilla fronts in underdeveloped countries these fronts he says must be headed by the revolutionary vanguards commanded by the revolutionary elite itself it is crucial he claims that the political and military leadership be combined into one command indeed into one man leaving the military considerations aside what this means politically is that the standard practices of the communist parties must be abandoned no longer can bureaucrats sit in the cities coordinating strikes electoral campaigns and quasi subversive fronts from now on revolutionaries must wage direct war against imperialism not to do so says debray is to betray the revolution to betray the people at the beginning of august 1967 latin america revolutionaries and communists met in havana to discuss these new concepts of direct confrontation with imperialism the meeting was called the organization of latin american solidarity olas and out of it came a new international a marxist leninist revolutionary international which carefully spelled out the necessity of armed struggle as the only way of defeating imperialism and establishing a socialist world the traditional communist parties of the americas and of course the observers and representatives from the socialist countries of europe which all uphold russia s policy of coexistence objected to the cuban position but backed by representatives from the guerrilla fronts of latin america the cuban line prevailed as long as imperialism exists as long as the united states dominates a single country beyond its borders as long as u s companies exploit the poor and the underdeveloped no communist has the right to call himself a communist unless he fights unless his solidarity with combatants is expressed in deeds and not words thus russia itself was condemned for giving material aid to oligarchical countries and the moscow lining communist parties were chastised for their opportunistic tactics of legal struggle through the electoral process established by the imperialists and repressive governments olas demanded clear cut definitions and it defined its own position but the traditional communist parties were not very happy though they did not walk out of the conference they made it clear that they would not accept the olas hard line this said fidel on august 10 at the closing session of olas was nothing less than treason those who support peaceful coexistence with imperialism when imperialism is slaughtering and exploiting so many people all over the world are not revolutionaries no matter what they call themselves they belong to a new vast mafia whose ultimate goal is to serve the desires

here s our summary of key events over the weekend that affect new zealand with news the americans have backed away from hard line trade actions for now agreeing to more talks on the sidelines of the osaka g20 meeting the united states and china agreed to restart trade talks after the americans offered concessions including no new tariffs and an easing of restrictions on tech company huawei the americans think the chinese will now buy more us farm goods if they do the price will turn out to be interesting the americans get to keep the tariffs already in place not realising that they are essentially a tax on themselves china has persuaded the united states to return to the bargaining table without agreeing to any of the changes that the trump administration has previously said were essential and not negotiable but which beijing regarded as an affront more talks in the future more tensions due in the future an identical playbook to the last g20 summit in argentina there is an expectation that there will be something of a relief rally in equity markets when they resume later today the us dollar may rise we ll see but in something of an interesting counter signal apple said it is shifting the production of the only model it makes in the us the macbook pro to china and most americans and by a substantial margin doubt the administration s tariff strategy although it is a highly partisan issue the australians signaled that they will be throwing their weight behind the tpp and the rcep the rcep includes china and india although the tpp doesn t but it does include japan neither include the us the inflation measure the us fed watches closely core pce personal consumption expenditure came in for may at 1 6 unchanged from april analysts had expected a minor dip but that didn t happen in any event it is still below the fed s target and it isn t moving another closely watched index is the chicago purchasing managers survey and that fell into contraction in june for the first time since january 2017 this is just another in the set of regional factory surveys showing american manufacturing is either without any growth or is in contraction the most telling aspect is that new orders are falling these pullbacks haven t yet flowed through to consumers yet although the latest sentiment survey seems to have topped out and it is those on higher incomes who are reporting the most concern about the future the surveyors said and it is more than just the us the trade tensions are generating a global slump in factory activity china s factory activity shrank as expected in june and its expansion of its service sector pmi slowed also as analysts expected both signals emphasised their need for more economic stabilisation stimulus in china the central bank authorities are jawboning banks to be restrained in their mortgage lending despite recently officially easing lending conditions in many smaller cities that easing brought a quick rise in prices in may that is obviously worrying them this latest pullback has seen chinese mortgage rates rise from 4 9 to about 5 15 the eu and a group of south american countries have agreed a large multilateral trade deal apparently the largest one the eu has ever done it took 20 years of negotiation in switzerland the bank of international settlements has called for all policy hands to the pump to protect a flagging world economy they say interest rate policies can t do it all in its annual report released overnight it says the global economy is losing momentum and it is time to address that aggressively with both fiscal and monetary loosening they are especially concerned about global corporate debt after remarkable growth in leveraged loans especially in the us but exactly why they think addressing this with more public debt and lower interest rates is unclear other than that will bolster bank profitability in australia new rba data shows that lending to businesses and property buyers grew only marginally in may while the fall in personal loans got deeper in fact australian housing debt grew just 3 7 in the year to may the slowest annual growth rate since records started in 1976 the new zealand data shows ours grew 6 3 and staying in australia a new banking code of practice comes into force today among other things there will be no more unsolicited offers for higher credit card limits no more commissions on lmi and no more attempts to sell insurance with other products customers want the s p500 ended last week up 0 6 on friday but over the week it will recorded a small loss

of trading last week the brent benchmark is down too at us 64 50 the kiwi dollar is up 125 bps in the past week against the us dollar you may recall it rose 105 bps in the prior week we seem to be in

1 euro cents that all pushes the twi 5 up to just on 71 7 we aren t yet at the same type of firming we got in october and november 2018 when we firmed a full 8 but we might be starting along a similar track bitcoin is lower today even if it is still near its recent highs it is now at us 11 270 down 6 from where we left it on saturday the bitcoin rate is charted in the exchange rate set below the

spread this news by takura zhangazha the zimbabwean government recently did the unfathomable at least according to social media pundits some civil society organisations unions and influential urbanites it arbitrarily and abruptly re introduced a local currency for all domestic financial transactions at least at law as expected there was an immediate outburst of anger on social media in press conferences statements and i am pretty sure in the near future in anticipated or provisionally announced forms of physical protest all of which can be easily pointed out to be as a result of the general mistrust of the government s monetary policy and as awkward as it sounds the lack of trust in any form of a national currency the origins of which appear with the massive inflation that coincided with the global financial crisis in 2007 8 and lasted in zimbabwe at least until the introduction of a multi currency regime just before the formation of a unity government in 2009 in this we had relatively liberal use of the united states dollar usd the south african rand and a host of other not so readily available currencies this led to the stabilisation of inflation albeit at great cost to our ability to retain the global value of the usd in tandem with developments in the global financial markets while i am not aware of any economic books that were written about this multi currency monetary by 2015 it became almost unsustainable to rely on these multi currencies we had begun purchasing them from their respective central banks so the government introduced the relatively unpopular but utilitarian bond coin in order to deal with challenges of transactions by retailers it was pegged at 1 1 with the popular usd the then government went a step further and decided to introduce bond notes almost a year later and suspicion were heightened that it was about to re introduce a fully fledged currency again the bond note like its predecessor the coin was pegged at the same value as the usd suspicions abound but both forms of currency were utilised widely especially by poorer zimbabweans who did not have regular access to the usd in between these ambiguities about currencies and suspicions about government a coup that was not a coup happened in 2017 and a disputed but legitimised election occurred in 2018 by the time we got through the heady disputes over presidential election results in early 2019 the government introduced a third form of a version of a local currency called the real time gross settlement rtgs in early 2019 this essentially meant we had a surrogate currency one that would with time set the ground for the introduction of a somewhat formal one depending on our ability to meet the fiscal requirements of global financialised capital i e imf world bank afdb in no short while the government introduced a rated multi currency regime it began officially at least with the rtgs trading somehow at 2 5 to the usd this was to be the straw that broke the camel s back again in no short time we were at higher official bank rates via the rtgs to the usd it did not work as politically planned instead what we had was a quasi free market currency trading system underpinned by state regulation arguments about the capacity of the state to respond to the financial markets quickly spread acceptable as these were in a neoliberal sense the key questions that emerged were around the sustainability of the same either in relation to imports of goods or just even the extractive political economy trying to lure foreign investors and now the zimbabwean government has gone the whole hog with the introduction of a new currency the end effect of which is more in keeping with neoliberal economic policy than it is intended at being populist it is a move designed to satisfy domestic and foreign capital s requirements to do business at a much lower cost all in the now proven vain hope that there will be a trickle down effect for the creation of jobs as well as that the free market will be able to resolve social and economic challenges faced by the majority poor all of this done under the mantra of a return to normalcy the knee jerk and for now populist rejection of a local currency in favour of the usd is however intriguing in two specific respects the first being the political dimension of a general mistrust of government with a currency whose commodity exchange value is not in the view of the public guaranteed by global capital this public mistrust is also being buttressed by the previous hyper inflationary period 2007 2009 and the stability brought in by the introduction of a multicurrency system thereafter this essentially means the general mindset of the urban zimbabwean public is in sync with global capitalism s expectation of an economy i e one that follows its laisses faire rules and despises contextual protectionist economics the only difference being that apart from a currency global capital understands with great sophistry there are many other ways to bell the cat beyond a multi currency system the latter point being rather ironic because it is also one that finance minister mthuli ncube and his boss president emmerson mnangagwa understand too well hence the general approval of their economic policy by the gatekeepers of global capital namely the world bank and the imf with the added approval of most southern african governments that are implementing similar economic policies the second astounding aspect is that of how zimbabweans now view money and in particular the usd as a commodity in classical marxist terms we have now come to view it more like a fetish or even a deity it has come to mean more than it is in transactional terms its value now transcends what it actually is in reality we are quite literally under the spell of commodity fetishism because it has also become a commodity that has had become a social arbiter of how we relate to each other without really acknowledging it all of this until now when talk of a local currency from government became louder and is now a reality and even if an economist of repute were to explain to an educated zimbabwean that money is really imagined they will find great resistance to that universally given notion to conclude it is evident that the introduction of a local currency does not mean there will be economic abundance for all but neither did the retention of a multi currency regime it is therefore imperative that we being to examine the system behind the monetary policies in whatever form they come and to do so at the point of ideology in order to counter it in our case neoliberalism as an ideology and austerity as a strategy are informing the current and previous currency exchange systems and economic malaise we have had to endure but then again where money or the usd becomes a fetish in and of itself it is a hard ask to call on cdes to understand the system more than the deity takura zhangazha

this article is more than 4 years old getty last tuesday cars com came out with its annual made in usa list jeep s cherokee came in at 1 as the most american made of the vehicles but of the top 10 most american made of the cars seven were japanese brands six honda and one from honda subsidiary acura it s all a reminder that the foreign competition which needlessly inflames opportunistic politicians is rooted in a whole lot of nothingness the foreign competition frequently employs american workers but that s not the purpose of this write up much as it s unfashionable to say today it s the countries most open to the world s plenty including plenty produced in countries that allegedly cheat when it comes to trade that are the most prosperous thank goodness the u s doesn t have a level playing field when it comes to americans exchanging with producers in other countries while countless other countries that are much poorer than we are put up excessive barriers to foreign goods the average tariff in the u s on foreign goods is 1 4 it s still too high the number should be zero but immense american prosperity is a reminder that the countries with markets that are largely open to foreign production prosper always when we re free to import from anyone we also have the best chance to specialize in what we produce here sorry protectionists but rich countries don t spend time worrying about poorer countries harming their people through tariffs still that s once again not the purpose of this write up instead the focus will be on another stat unearthed by cars com while the jeep cherokee is the most american made of vehicles 28 of the inputs that make up the final product are imported the above rates mention in consideration of judy shelton s weekend interview with the wall street journal shelton is the very excellent author of the very excellent book money meltdown she s u s executive director of the european bank for reconstruction and development and also one of the most gracious people i know at present she s being considered for the federal reserve board and while i think fed critics and supporters alike vastly overstate the central bank s relevance my hope is that shelton is nominated and confirmed she will quickly expose the economists in the fed s employ as hopelessly wedded to easy to discredit notions about money inflation and economic growth including the laughable belief inside the fed that growth causes inflation importantly it s because shelton could so easily outclass the well credentialed inside the fed that her interview was at times disappointing no doubt compromise is the norm in washington but it seems like shelton is compromising too much to please a washington that s seemingly gone protectionist and devaluationist overnight she didn t sound like her wildly insightful self in her interview with tunku varadarajan in particular shelton made the point more than once that currency devaluation by countries makes their products more competitive globally in shelton s words nations gain a price advantage over competitors by devaluing their currencies but the jeep cherokee shows why this isn t true like any product in the world today it s the result of enormous amounts of global cooperation such that 28 of the cherokee is foreign made so if currency policy accents devaluation the price of manufacturing said product naturally rises and that s only the beginning as shelton no doubt knows the biggest driver and nothing else comes close of price advantage is investment it s through feverish investment that businesses are able to produce more and more goods and services at costs that continue to decline but if currency policy favors devaluation the tax on investment grows there s a reason that malaise was so evident during the nixon carter 1970s and the bush obama 2000s the heavily devalued dollar during both decades existed as a cruel tax on investment that s why it was so puzzling to read shelton say that devaluing countries are cheating american producers no they re cheating their own devaluation erodes the exchangeable value of work in countries forced to endure it plus it once again exists as a huge tax on the investment without which there is very little economic growth as shelton surely knows money is a veil changes in its price won t alter the real price of anything but they will raise the dollar yen euro pound yuan to name a few currencies price of production devaluation always harms the country pursuing it the most instead of making this crucial point shelton blamed the loss of market share by u s automakers to japanese competition in the 1980s to an allegedly weak yen about the 80s and japan china is the new japan from a political standpoint shelton told varadarajan about u s auto workers telling her then that we can compete against the best in the world but we can t compete against the central bank of japan the quibble here is that from 1971 right through the 1980s the united states was the devaluing country not japan while a dollar bought 360 yen in 1971 by 1985 it only purchased 240 crucial here is that in 1985 a yen that had already crushed the dollar was per the plaza accord forced even higher versus the greenback the plaza accord communiqué specifically stated that some further orderly appreciation of the main non dollar currencies against the dollar is desirable and the yen s rise versus the dollar continued at present a dollar buys 107 yen in short the enemy for u s auto workers wasn t a weak yen but in fact a weak dollar that rendered gas guzzling american cars quite a bit less competitive in the 70s and 00s more specifically it s no surprise that chrysler was bailed out in the late 70s and that gm and chrysler were bailed out in 2008 09 a weak dollar is terrible for carmakers whose comparative advantage is large thirsty cars there s no arguing with shelton that stable money is the only proper foundation for capitalism but the fact that it is calls into question her assertion that cheap floating money somehow benefits wealthy investors important is that shelton knows this too she knows that when it comes to investment it s all about products for products much as trade is products for products with investment we delay consumption in the near term in order to hopefully attain returns exchangeable for a great deal more in the way of resources longer term money is always and everywhere an agreement about value that facilitates trade and investment this matters in consideration of shelton s implicit stance that monetary mischief somehow benefits those who can borrow vast sums on margin no investors gain from relentless capitalism which means they do best when the dollar is in the best shape such that people are improving one another as much as possible through trade and investment which brings us to present fed policy shelton asks why permit the most important price for channeling financial resources to their most productive use i e the cost of capital to be determined by a government agency it s troubling but per shelton s prescient prediction long ago about the u s s r s looming crash the fed clearly doesn t set the cost of capital that only happens in poor countries like the former soviet union the u s is staggeringly rich that s all the evidence we need that the fed s power is quite a bit more theoretical than real so while there s disagreement with shelton about money the fed and markets there s little evidence that qe has been the source of stock market vitality in modern times it s my hope once again that she winds up at the fed if so she ll expose disdain among economists for gold defined money as hopelessly uninformed it will be a blast to watch what s less fun is

from a european commission meeting revealed the ec were likely to give italy until the end of the year to bring down its debt on wednesday data showed that german consumer confidence slumped for the

global stock markets were flat in anticipation of what the sidebar meeting between president trump and xi at the g20 meeting would bring after the 80 minute meeting trump said that negotiations are back on track the baseline scenario leading up to the g20 sit down of the two leaders was just the restart of trade talks without a big announcement or details on how closer or far they are to reach a deal there is a high probability that the outcome will be similar to the previous g20 meeting where another truce was announced fears of tariff escalation will ease but current tariffs could remain unless real progress in made from both sides in their meeting in osaka everybody played their part without any additional drama and until more details emerge we are back at square one the road ahead looks complicated as china demands more equal treatment and the us is pushing through on intellectual property protection the us dollar is mixed against major pairs at the end of trading on friday commodity currencies lead the charge with the new zealand dollar almost 2 percent up on the greenback the canadian dollar rose 1 percent as strong economic indicators play down the probability of an interest rate cut the fed clipped the dollar s wings by signalling an upcoming benchmark rate cut oil is positioned to rise after trade cease fire between china and the us the opec had a more productive g20 summit with russian president putin announcing an extension to the production cut agreement that will be finalized later this week when the group meets in vienna markets will look forward to an action packed first week of july the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec will meet with major producers to finalize the extension discussed by putin at the g20 manufacturing data in china and the us will not show any impact from the g20 meeting but the indicator could change drastically going forward chinese factory activity was lower than expected at 49 4 and remains in contraction with the newly announced truce between china and the us will have to deliver an agreement or else global manufacturing will continue to deliver soft data points the reserve bank of australia rba could slash its rate to 1 percent as the central bank is part of the dovish choir of monetary policy makers that are back to their easing ways the week wraps up with the release of the u s non farm payrolls nfp on friday us jobs are expected to bounce back after the disappointing march report that showed only a gain of 75 000 a range from 150 000 to 210 000 is forecasted with

percent trade uncertainty ahead of get g20 added volatility to energy pricing it was the main reason the opec and the other major producers pushed back their ministerial meeting to this week russia remains on the sidelines and seems only a big drop in oil prices would expedite an extension of the agreement to cut production to stabilize prices crude prices have been pressured downward as the trade war between us china was a negative factor on energy demand supply disruptions added support to prices but the major factor was the opec which is why if russia does not agree to an extension the initiate could be too much for saudi arabia to handle by itself despite trump and xi getting back to the negotiation table on trade russia decided to go ahead with a production cut extension that could last 9 months gold gold under pressure from positive trump xi comments on trade at g20 the most anticipated meeting at the g20 left market participant wanting more the sit down between trump and xi yielded a new round of talks with no clear date the opec on the other hand was more productive and pretty much announced that the production deal will be extended the group had delayed their ministerial meeting and after the us china ceasefire they decided to go ahead with continuing to limit production output by up to 9 months gold rose 0 97 percent on friday as the yellow metal is back on top as the favourite destination for investors seeking refuge from uncertainty the willingness to cut rates from the fed is keeping the dollar weak and gives the gold the upper hand as july gets underway the market is pricing in a rate cut to be announced at the july federal open market committee fomc that will put more downward pressure on the dollar middle east tensions and the ongoing brexit debate will be in the spotlight in july making a strong case for gold climbing higher as major central banks run back their easing monetary policy playbook gold will be pressured as trade optimism reduces the appeal of the yellow metal as a safe haven although given the macro headwinds it remains part of various diversification strategies the lack of details on what has really changed from the us china negotiations makes it hard to believe the new talks will have a different outcome which is a positive for gold the next biggest obstacle for gold will be us economic indicators if there is a significant rebound the fed could hold the benchmark rate at its july meeting the market has walked back the number and depth of the rate cuts after some less dovish comments from fed members if there are massive job and inflation gains in the nfp report gold could fall as the rate cut narrative gets weaker content is for general information purposes only it is not investment

share the year 2019 has been rich with economic news we have observed six key themes 1 the great divide what we don t know about investments could fill an encyclopedia but the current positions of the stock and bond markets are difficult to reconcile last week the s p 500 closed at a record high level after a sell off in may investors in equities and corporate debt regained their confidence thanks to hints of cooling tensions between the u s and china and the prospect of interest rate cuts by the federal reserve government bond markets however did not find cheer interest rates across maturities were little changed and the inversion of 3 month and 10 year u s treasury yields has persisted nervous investors may prefer the stability of bonds to the risks of equities at any price and 12 trillion of sovereign securities now pay negative interest rates therein lies the puzzle how can equity markets stay bullish when bond markets are sending recession signals some will point to dovish signals from central banks as supportive of stocks but monetary easing in the united states is not expected to be substantial and will take time to reach full effect in markets like the eurozone and japan rates are already negative and unlikely to decline further it is difficult to think that corporate earnings will remain untouched by trade conflicts tariffs are often absorbed in profit margins and supply chains are expensive to alter companies and industries targeted by trade retaliation will face unique challenges roughly 45 of sales for s p 500 companies come from outside the united states growth in several regions is showing clear signs of strain from ongoing trade frictions some say fixed income markets are giving heavier weight to risk cases which may be true but it is unclear why equity markets would not show the same respect for possible downsides it is unusual to see stock and bond prices so strong simultaneously it will be interesting to see whether the seemingly conflicting signals coming from the two markets will be reconciled in the second half of the year 2 inflation missing in action what happened to inflation we will soon set a record for the longest expansion in u s history but prices have not responded in the manner we had anticipated as we have discussed many factors are holding back inflation e commerce has enhanced the ability of consumers to compare prices and find the best deals while measurement techniques are changing to keep pace with this shift older populations spend less and are more cost conscious while corporations have made great progress toward controlling their costs stubbornly low inflation has been most surprising in the context of perhaps the best news of the current growth cycle the relentless fall in unemployment rates broad measures of the labor market are improving across countries and opportunities to work are expanding while low unemployment is cause for cheer its pairing with low inflation is also causing confusion despite continued global expansion inflation has been receding historically the phillips curve defined a trend between employment and inflation when there is slack in the labor market inflation is typically moderate when joblessness falls employers have to pay more to attract and retain workers yet in this cycle the phillips curve has gone flat wage gains in the u s have actually retreated a bit this year despite an unemployment rate below 4 low inflation is a mixed blessing consumers and purchasing managers benefit from stable prices while businesses do not face compressed margins from higher wage costs however persistently low inflation presents a challenge to monetary policymakers and can create self fulfilling expectations of disinflation or deflation we think inflation will drift upward from here and the federal reserve s most recent forecasts concur but we thought the same at the start of the year 3 central banks in reverse just a year ago the world s central banks had confidence in the sustainability of the global expansion and were mapping a course to bring interest rates back to more normal levels contemplating the final year of his tenure european central bank ecb president mario draghi began mapping out a course to bring eurozone interest rates back into positive territory as a capstone on a notable central banking career how times have changed the federal reserve is expected to cut interest rates at least two more times this year last week draghi indicated that the ecb is open to trimming rates and resuming its bond purchase program amid darkening regional economic prospects the bank of japan boj has also signaled its willingness to increase stimulus and the reserve bank of australia is expected to cut its cash rate further the catalyst for the reversal is trade policy and it is threatening the global expansion central banks don t have control over tariffs but they are mandated to react accordingly in the second half of the year we expect them to swallow hard and provide insurance against recession the ultimate question is do central banks have enough ammunition to fight the next battle according to former chair of the federal reserve janet yellen i m sorry to have to say i think the answer is no they do not have enough bullets and this is really a concern central banks will have to hope that pre emptive easing and dovish talk will reduce the possibility of a downturn 4 trade unchecked and unbalanced trade headlines and tweets have kept us on our toes thus far this year the u s has taken a hard line with china sent a chill through the european union eu and japan and started a scare with mexico the u s administration s ability to instigate so many simultaneous conflicts is a reflection of the power held by the executive branch this leaves us wondering what ever happened to checks and balances article i section 8 of the constitution of the united states makes the power of the legislature clear the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to regulate commerce with foreign nations however since 1974 congress has ceded much of this power through trade promotion authority tpa many underestimated the influence that the white house could have over trade policy tpa grants fast track trade negotiation authority to the executive branch promising that congress will only vote to approve or deny any negotiated agreements not amend them tpa empowers trade delegates to confidently represent their country there is an element of efficiency in this approach as it avoids the need to legislate each aspect of complicated arrangements tpa is temporary current law will keep it in force through july 2021 but congress could act to rescind it sooner with tariffs starting to take their toll on business sentiment we are surprised to see so little interest by congress to reassert its constitutional power beyond the u s the world trade organization wto has been a paper tiger the united states justified its tariffs on steel and aluminum with a questionable claim of national security protection in retaliation many countries enacted tariffs that may also run afoul of wto rules the wto is meant to arbitrate these issues but the organization has never dealt with so many grievances of large scale an adverse finding could trigger the u s to withdraw from the wto a potentially fatal blow to the organization in the end the wto may only be useful for mediating smaller disputes and maintaining multilateral partnerships large problems may be beyond its capacity 5 collateral damage the trade tussles between the world s two largest economies have clearly jeopardized global economic fortunes this year though stress between the u s and china is bilateral the ramifications have been multilateral weakening global growth amid elevated uncertainty around trade policies is forcing multinationals to reassess their complex supply chains chinese exporters are centered under the trade war s shadow but the situation has also thrown shade at several south asian economies particularly singapore and malaysia these two nations have high export orientations dependence on global supply chains and strong trade integration with china and the u s both have a large share of intermediate exports to china that are used in the production of chinese exports vietnam which specializes in telecommunications has been the only exception as trade diversion appears to have boosted its exports to the u s the australian economy is caught in the crossfire too china is australia s largest trading partner and the u s is its largest direct investor mediating between the two is like walking a thin tightrope u s china tensions are hurting a long list of trade dependent economies europe isn t insulated either research by the international monetary fund found about 70 of total european exports are linked to forward and backward supply chains according to the eu s chamber of commerce in china survey around one third of eu companies have been hit hard by the ongoing trade tensions according to oxford economics a full blown trade war could cover nearly 800 billion worth of trade leading to serious consequences for those directly or indirectly involved see above chart if peace doesn t break out soon the second half of 2019 could be very challenging the world over 6 leadership vacuum nationalism which puts domestic interests before global engagement is altering the balance of politics on almost every continent today that makes it more difficult to achieve consensus and cooperation across countries this condition is afflicting the eu most acutely the european parliamentary elections are a month in the past but the difficult discussions over who will lead the key european establishments is illustrative of the political dissonance at the core of the monetary union france and germany the unifying forces behind european policy are in disagreement over a number of issues they differed on the length of the brexit extension and are now wrestling over the next generation of european leaders including the president of the ecb with the european parliament ep now more fragmented than ever decision making is only going to get tougher as irish prime minister leo varadkar quipped on his way out of last week s eu summit it s quicker to elect a pope than pick a new set of leaders a lack of leadership is hindering europe s economic prospects more pressingly the eu is currently confronted with difficult decisions on fiscal policy with economic growth faltering a no deal brexit threatening and a central bank with little to offer it would seem a good time for countercyclical spending but as shown above all countries in the eurozone are in excess of the recommended 60 ceiling on the ratio of debt to gdp relaxing these guidelines some fear would open a pandora s box to all kinds of government spending some more productive than others it might be difficult for the european commission to police the process especially given deep disagreements among countries on the appropriate level of fiscal freedom to vest in national legislatures with a louder voice in the ep european populist and nationalist parties will continue to push for policies that return power to member states control immigration and ease european fiscal rules together these changes would weaken the very foundations of the european project it s going to be a busy second half in brussels

president donald trump has long been convinced that the united states is locked in an unfair trading relationship with china the u s has lost 500 billion a year for many years he has said several times in a possible reference to the balance of trade that showed the nation bought 420 billion more goods from china in 2018 than it sold trump has long touted china s huge exports to the u s as a sign that beijing has been taking advantage of american businesses for decades his determination to redress what he sees as an imbalance has resulted in an escalating trade war with stringent tariffs affecting not only the two countries economic outlooks but also the entire global economy and when he sits down with xi jinping on the sidelines of the g 20 summit being held june 28 and 29 in osaka japan all eyes will be on whether they can restart trade talks that collapsed amid a war of words in may while both sides have good economic incentives to return to free trade experts say the two superpowers also have good political reasons to hold firm and back up the tough rhetoric with action on the u s side the mood music was good with treasury secretary steven mnuchin saying wednesday that washington and beijing were almost done with their trade deal whatever happens next the u s china spat threatens to overshadow the meeting of some of the world s leading economies and crucial topics such as climate change and urgent reform of the world trade organization in may trump doubled u s tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods to 25 percent and said he was prepared to slap the same tariff on the remaining 300 billion if there was no progress in talks the effect of this would be huge goldman sachs has warned it would cause global equity markets to fall by 4 percent the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd predicts that renewed tensions between the two countries could see global gross domestic product gdp drop by as much as 0 6 percent the chief economist of the international monetary fund imf gita gopinath said in a blog post in may that the trade war could significantly dent business and financial market sentiment disrupt global supply chains and jeopardize the projected recovery in global growth in 2019 low income households in the u s would be chief among those to suffer from increased prices if the tariff regime was extended she added that s why the mood music coming out of osaka the first official meeting between the two sides in months matters so much why has the dispute become so intense trump spoke so much about u s china trade on the campaign trail in 2015 that a three minute compilation video of him saying china went viral on social media and has since been viewed more than 15 million times a sign for the g 20 summit at a train station in osaka japan tomohiro ohsumi getty images and as promised he has delivered an anti globalization protectionist america first trade agenda billed as a policy that protects u s workers and businesses from unfair chinese practices not everyone believes trump s bold rhetoric will be met by further action there is a real question over whether the u s administration would really be willing to impose all of those i m dubious because this would involve putting tariffs on almost all of the rest of chinese imports said mike jakeman a senior economist at pwc the accountancy and consultancy company in london that would lead to domestic inflation and suddenly you ve got consumers who are quite angry as to why the cost of buying a new iphone has gone up appreciably he said and in an election year when trump has already talked about the economy extensively in his campaign he probably won t want that risk trump s twitter account hails u s economic success on a daily basis from record jobs numbers to stock market highs and it s this economic good fortune that allows him to treat china in terms of foreign policy not just economics jakeman added it s remarkable that trump has gone almost three quarters of the way through his term without really having a difficult decision to make about the economy he has enjoyed a really solid spell that s allowed him to pursue his foreign policy strategy he said national pride as for china the dispute is also about national pride as well as economic success posturing goes both ways and according to james mcgregor an american author journalist and businessman who has lived in china for more than 25 years and is currently chairman of the consulting firm apco worldwide china may have more time to spare despite its domestic economic slowdown the bremen express cargo ship prepares to dock at florida s portmiami which saw china as its top trading country in 2018 joe raedle getty images file i think we have to remember xi jinping does not have to get re elected in 2020 donald trump does and when there s more tariffs coming and they really hit the u s economy and the stock market takes a dive trump will want the stock market to go back up before his election he said so i do think china can be more patient than the u s on this because it s now wrapped up in chinese nationalism very tightly because of huawei he said referring to the huge chinese communications firm that in may was banned from doing business in the u s on whether china is being unfair to u s companies seeking to do business in the country as trump and others allege the picture is more complex the trump administration has made chinese compliance with ip laws a priority for any agreement on reducing or eliminating tariffs between the two countries and it has become a protectionist issue that underscores national pride for both leaders all the more so after trump banned huawei china s leading communications firm from doing business in the u s vicky pryce a former senior u k government economist and now a board member at the centre for economics and business research a london based consultancy said that while american consumers would ultimately be the ones to pay the price for higher tariffs the u s had been justified in taking china to task on various fronts president donald trump greets china s president xi jinping during a business leaders event at the great hall of the people in beijing on nov 8 2017 nicolas asfouri afp getty images file for one thing the government helps chinese companies in a variety of ways such as widespread hidden subsidies she said china has been opening up and so on but it has used all sorts of tricks that make it hard for anyone to see if they have been dumping goods and so on she said you can t say whether in an economic sense it s been wrong but the question is whether you go about it this way the issue of ip theft has long been a bone of contention for trump and for american businesses one third of whom say chinese firms have stolen from them at some point in the past decade at a cost of between 225 billion and 600 billion annually according to the office of the u s trade representative china needs to step up efforts in reform and opening up and carry out more policies in respecting and treating foreign companies and chinese companies as equal to create a better business environment said wei jianguo a former vice minister of commerce and the vice president of china international economic exchange center a government think tank the escalation of tariffs comes as the global economy faces the possibility of a downturn after picking up in 2016 and 2017 with investment and manufacturing stagnating economists generally define a global recession as when growth falls below 2 percent the imf is forecasting 3 6 percent for 2020 which is out of the danger zone but significantly below the 4 percent seen in 2017 so an economic cease fire between the two sides could be a much needed boost if there is suddenly a resolution of the trade problem then you could see a very substantial improvement pryce said i don t think it s a very happy environment at the moment
us president donald trump has based his foreign policy on a series of harsh economic blockades each designed to frighten coerce and even starve the target country into submitting to american demands while the practice is less violent than a military attack and the blockade is through financial means rather than the navy the consequences are often dire for civilian populations as such economic blockades by the united states should be scrutinized by the united nations security council under international law and the un charter when trump campaigned for office in 2016 he rejected the frequent us resort to war in the middle east during the years 1990 2016 the us launched two major wars with iraq 1990 and 2003 as well as wars in afghanistan 2001 libya 2011 and syria 2012 it also participated in many smaller military interventions mali somalia and yemen among others while the syrian war is often described as a civil war it was in fact a war of regime change led by the us and saudi arabia under a us presidential directive called timber sycamore none of these us led wars achieved their political objectives and the major conflicts have been followed by chronic violence and instability the attempt to force syria s bashar al assad from power led to a proxy war eventually involving the us syria russia saudi arabia qatar iran turkey israel and the united arab emirates that displaced over 10 million syrians and caused around a half million violent deaths while trump has so far eschewed a new war he has continued us regime change efforts by other means trump is often called an isolationist but he is as interventionist as his predecessors his strategy at least so far has been to rely more heavily on us economic power than military might to coerce adversaries which creates its own kind of cruelty and destabilization the trump administration currently is engaged in three attempts at comprehensive economic blockades against north korea venezuela and iran as well as several lesser blockades against countries such as cuba and nicaragua and an intensifying effort to cut off china s access to technology the blockade against north korea is sanctioned at least in part by the un security council the blockade against iran is in direct opposition to the security council and the blockade against venezuela is so far without security council engagement for or against the us is attempting to isolate the three countries from almost all international trade causing shortages of food medicines energy and spare parts for basic infrastructure including the water supply and power grid the north korean blockade operates mainly through un mandated sanctions and includes a comprehensive list of exports to north korea imports from north korea and financial relations with north korean entities the un food and agriculture organization reports that 10 million north koreans are at risk of hunger partly owing to sanctions t he unintended negative impact sanctions can have on agricultural production through both direct and indirect impacts cannot be ignored the fao warns the most obvious are restrictions on the importation of certain items that are necessary for agricultural production in particular fuel machinery and spare parts for equipment the draconian us sanctions on venezuela have come in two phases the first beginning in august 2017 was mainly directed at the state oil company pdvsa the country s main earner of foreign exchange the second round of sanctions imposed in january 2019 was more comprehensive targeting the venezuelan government a recent detailed analysis of the first round of sanctions shows their devastating impact the us sanctions gravely exacerbated previous economic mismanagement contributing to a catastrophic fall in oil production hyperinflation economic collapse output is down by half since 2016 hunger and rising mortality us sanctions against iran have been in place more or less continuously since 1979 the most recent and by far most draconian measures introduced in august 2018 and intensified in the first half of this year aim to cut iran off from foreign trade the us sanctions are in direct contravention of un security council resolution 2231 which endorsed the 2015 nuclear agreement with iran the effects have been devastating the international monetary fund forecasts that iran s economy will shrink by 10 percent between 2017 and 2019 with inflation reaching 30 percent this year medicines are in short supply one might expect that other countries would easily circumvent us sanctions but the us has threatened to punish foreign companies that violate the sanctions and has used the dollar s global clout as a bludgeon threatening to sanction foreign banks that finance trade with iran european companies have fallen into line despite the european union s express desire to engage economically with iran over the longer term it is likely that more ways will be found to circumvent the sanctions using yuan ruble or euro financing yet the erosion of us sanctions will only be gradual despite the intense economic pain inflicted on north korea venezuela and iran none of them has succumbed to us demands in this sense sanctions have proved to be no more successful than military intervention north korea has maintained and most likely is expanding its nuclear arsenal the iranian regime rejects us demands concerning its missile program and foreign policies and venezuela s president nicolas maduro remains in power the us blockades have been carried out by presidential decree with almost no public debate and no systematic oversight by congress this has been a one man show even more so than in the case of president led wars which trigger vastly more public scrutiny trump realizes that he can impose crippling sanctions abroad with almost no direct costs to the us public or budget and with virtually no political accountability military blockades are acts of war and therefore subject to international law including un security council oversight america s economic blockades are similar in function and outcome to military blockades with devastating consequences for civilian populations and risk provoking war it is time for the security council to take up the us sanctions regimes and weigh them against the requirements of international law and peacekeeping jeffrey d sachs is a

the relationship between ghana and the international monetary fund imf is to many ghanaians a difficult one most ghanaians are of the view that the country should divorce itself from the international body a look at sentiments expressed in statements by former presidents and finance ministers under whose tenure the country exited one sponsored programme or another illustrate this well they ranged from the decision to be independent of imf budgetary support is a watershed in the history of the country s economic development to we won t go to imf again ghana will no longer be troubled by conditionalities of imf these quotes encapsulate how ghanaians feel about the relationship but is the relationship that bad an informed assessment requires some context how ghana relates to all bretton woods institutions a historical assessment of this will better contextualise the nature of ghana s relationship with the imf the early years ghana was the first sub saharan african country to gain independence in 1957 it was undoubtedly a beacon of hope for the region the country had significant natural resources as well as a highly educated population the relationship between ghana and the imf and world bank dates back to the late 1960s following the overthrow of kwame nkrumah s government in 1966 the country suffered nearly two decades of political instability and economic decline a prolonged drought worsened the situation as did widespread bush fires this resulted in an unparalleled famine adding to the burden on government was the need to resettle 1 million citizens expelled from nigeria the next decade saw the global oil crisis as well as a persistent downward trend in the terms of trade by the 1980s inflation was at a triple digit level undoubtedly by 1983 ghana s economy was in tatters it desperately needed support to reverse the downward spiral as a result ghana embarked on a major programme of economic reform it did this through an imf and world bank sponsored structural adjustment programme and economic recovery programme over the years these have become a major reference points in terms of the relationship between ghana and the bretton woods institutions the scale of reforms under these arrangements were enormous structural adjustment the structural adjustment facilities were used to steer ghana toward becoming a market friendly nation where incentives were created by the free market in the process the country embarked on a large scale overhaul of institutions encouraged competition by privatising state own enterprises built institutional capacity and attained macroeconomic stability undeniably ghana chalked up some initial successes under the programme it was in fact referred to as the programme s ideal student due to significant improvements in its macroeconomic indicators but after nearly two decades of adjustment in 2001 the country fell on hard times it was classified as a highly indebted poor country a world bank and imf initiative aimed at reducing the external debt burden of very poor countries at the time all ghana s earlier successes had been eroded the economy was suffering from rapid exchange rate depreciation high inflation and very low external reserves the severe crisis was partly due to high debt service requirements that affected the budget and affected the balance of payments in 2001 the newly elected government opted for debt relief under the highly indebted countries initiative this decision was met with a lot of public backlash people s view was that ghana had fallen from being the beacon of hope for africa to being heavily indebted and poor people started to ask lots of questions about the implications of the effects of 16 years of imf and world bank adjustment programmes and their ramifications on ghana s development to many the country had been tied to the apron strings of the bretton woods institutions and had to wean itself off as soon as possible again by mid 2013 the government s efforts to achieve fiscal consolidation were undermined by policy slippages external shocks and rising interest cost this continued until mid 2014 but then the country s net international reserves position had weakened further and the exchange rate had depreciated sharply fuelling inflationary pressures these macroeconomic mishaps occurred against the background of the issuance of eurobond and a short term loan contracted by the cocoa board in the same year yet public debt continued to rise at an unsustainable pace ghana then entered another imf backed stabilisation program its 16th since independence after missing targets in 2013 and 2014 on 3 april 2015 the imf approved a three year extended credit facility arrangement with ghana this was aimed at the restoration of debt sustainability and macroeconomic stability to foster a return to high growth and job creation while protecting social spending the programme was extended for an additional year ending on 2 april 2019 undoubtedly the programme resulted in significant macroeconomic gains with rising growth single digit inflation fiscal consolidation and banking sector clean up nevertheless challenges remain ghana performs again in its world economic outlook the imf is forecasting that ghana will be the fastest growing economy in the world this year with a projected growth rate of 8 8 as with previous imf world bank sponsored programmes ghana is once again out performing itself as usual the government is very optimistic about the prospects of the country following its exit from the programme the obvious question being asked is what is different this time the programme appears different in a number of ways first it was based on a combination domestic and foreign of sources of finance second conditionalities attached to it were informed by homegrown policies this was unlike previous programmes where conditionalities were based on the washington consensus lastly ghana has also made important changes it passed a new law the first of its kind in the country to govern government spending the act seeks to ensure fiscal responsibility macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability a key provision gives parliament the power to censure the finance minister if spending exceeds defined limits what next given the chronology of ghana s relationship with the imf and the cycle of achieving targets under its programmes before falling back on bad habits most believe it s just a matter of time before the country goes back to the imf asking for help the likelihood of this happening is increased by the fact that the country goes to the polls in 2020 this means there is bound to be a tendency for government to overspend whatever happens next it s important to note that the structure of the economy has not changed it is still highly susceptible to external shocks particularly commodity prices to the extent that these external shocks are unavoidable the imf and world bank will remain critical partners in the country s development process

economic and monetary policy at a turning point where is the economy heading in europe the united states and china despite the escalating trade dispute between the united states and china the global economy continues to grow robustly albeit at a slower pace looking at developments in major economies beyond the euro area activity in the united states is supported by the strong labour market accommodative financial conditions and current fiscal stimulus however economic growth is expected to decelerate at the same time in china the slowdown in domestic demand has been cushioned by the implementation of a series of fiscal and monetary policy measures although the escalation in the trade dispute with the united states is foreseen to weigh on trade china is expected to continue its orderly transition to a more balanced growth path the incoming data for the euro area in the first quarter of 2019 have been somewhat better than expected euro area real gdp increased by 0 4 quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2019 bolstered by resilient domestic demand however survey information and economic indicators point to somewhat weaker growth in the second and third quarters of this year this reflects the ongoing weakness in global trade and the prolonged presence of uncertainties that continue to weigh on euro area growth in particular in the manufacturing sector consequently the eurosystem staff projections see euro area real gdp growth of 1 2 in 2019 which will accelerate further to 1 4 in both 2020 and 2021 compared with the march 2019 staff projections the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised up slightly for 2019 largely owing to a stronger than expected first quarter at the same time real gdp growth has been revised down for 2020 and 2021 mainly reflecting a somewhat weaker contribution of foreign demand the fundamental factors supporting the euro area expansion remain broadly in place labour market dynamics remain robust with unemployment at 7 6 in april the lowest level since august 2008 employment increased by 0 3 quarter on quarter in q1 2019 as in the previous quarter the cumulative increase in the number of people employed between q2 2013 the trough of euro area employment and q1 2019 amounts to 10 8 million nevertheless the risks surrounding euro area growth are tilted to the downside on account of the prolonged presence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets turning to inflation headline inflation was 1 2 in june according to eurostat s flash estimate unchanged from may which conceals lower energy prices and a recovery in services inflation while measures of underlying inflation remained very subdued on the basis of current futures prices for oil headline inflation is likely to decline over the coming months before rebounding towards the end of the year oil prices as measured by the usd price of brent crude oil have risen by more than 20 since the start of the year this scenario is broadly in line with the latest eurosystem staff projections which foresee annual headline inflation of 1 3 in 2019 rising gradually to 1 4 in 2020 and 1 6 in 2021 broadly confirming the march outlook at the same time labour cost pressures have strengthened and broadened in germany for example wages rose in the first quarter of 2019 by 2 5 in nominal terms and by 1 2 in real terms this is due to high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets which is translating into a pick up in wage growth summing up although the incoming data for the first quarter of 2019 have been somewhat better than expected weak global trade and the prolonged presence of uncertainties continue to act as a drag on euro area growth the monetary policy stance this led the ecb s governing council at its meeting on 6 june to take a series of decisions in pursuit of its price stability objective first we decided to adjust our forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates we now expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term the decision to shift the date based part further into the future from at least through the end of 2019 to at least through the first half of 2020 transparently conveys to the public the governing council s genuine expectation that the current outlook for price stability very likely will not warrant a tightening of monetary policy at least for another year second we confirmed the ongoing full reinvestment of the principal payments from the maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation finally we determined the modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii which were announced in march tltro iii operations will start in september 2019 and end in march 2021 each with a maturity of two years we decided that the interest rate in each operation will be set at a level that is 10 basis points above the average rate applied in the eurosystem s main refinancing operations over the life of the respective tltro for banks whose eligible net lending exceeds a benchmark the rate applied in tltro iii will be lower and can be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the operation plus 10 basis points the schedule defining the borrowing costs under tltro iii is marginally less generous than that applied under the outstanding tltro ii in line with our intent of not discouraging banks that can afford to fund themselves in the market on attractive terms from doing so at tltro ii maturity at the same time the pricing schedule incorporates features that can greatly enhance our accommodative monetary policy stance as banks with strong lending performance will retain the opportunity to borrow at negative interest rates the pricing remains sufficiently generous especially when compared with alternative sources of funding for banks to keep credit flowing to firms and households on a scale that can continue to support the economy and inflation all in all this set of decisions will provide the monetary accommodation necessary for inflation to remain on a sustained path towards levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term while also preserving favourable bank lending conditions and supporting a smooth transmission of our monetary policy this being said the governing council remains ready to act in case of adverse contingencies and to use its instruments as appropriate to ensure price stability a reliable strategy is an anchor for credible monetary policy erratic policy debates for the purpose of creating short term stimulus risk undermining that credibility in the long run

g20 summits continue to fall short on trade and protectionism at least donald trump and xi jinping agreed to kick the us china trade war down the road president trump is pulling back from threatened further tariff hikes on china s goods into the us president xi has agreed to buy what mr trump calls a tremendous amount of us agricultural products that will help to reduce america s bilateral trade deficit with china the danger remains that this comes at the expense of other exporting nations such as australia amid all this scott morrison barely given the time of day by fellow leaders at last year s summit on the expectation that he would be another short lived australian prime minister performed well he took the message of free trade to a private dinner with mr trump and his officials and urged world trade organisation reform so it could deal with issues such as chinese pilfering of intellectual property and opaque subsidies that encourage chinese over production that ends up flooding global markets yet the osaka summit was also a reminder that australia is a supplicant at the global trade table of the america first mr trump and china s ex officio emperor xi jinping as he weaponises trade for political purpose mr trump could jack up tariffs on china exports any time as a us ally australia could get caught up in any chinese retaliation equally mr trump could introduce new tariffs on australian exports to the us which have only been avoided to date thanks to deft diplomatic work and because australia happens to have a trade deficit with the us this new uncertainty that is undermining the rules based global trading system and security order over which the us has presided since world war ii will continue to make things difficult for australia as parliament resumes after the may 18 election mr morrison should use this uncertainty and downside risk to increase the ambition of his policy program to return australia to the first best public policy framework that underpinned almost three decades of economic growth in the first instance that means getting the coalition s promised tax cuts passed this week labor must accept that the electorate squarely rejected its vision of a big taxing big spending big government australia and pass these tax cuts through the senate mr morrison and treasurer josh frydenberg must also get on with their own announced if modest plan for cutting unproductive red tape and compliance costs as part of a serious agenda to sharpen incentives and drive productivity and prosperity this should include resisting the hayne inspired urge to drown the banking sector in dirigiste regulations that raise the cost and reduce the supply of credit particularly to small businesses while generating hefty fees for the legal profession in the meantime the reserve bank should hold back from lowering the official cash rate to 1 per cent on tuesday as expected by financial markets governor philip lowe has clearly signalled a further easing is likely this year following last month s cut the first since august 2016 the australian financial review continues to worry that this will simply inject more risk into the financial system for little return in stimulating economic growth even bitcoin is being refuelled by global cheaper money in any case the reserve bank s new test of requiring the jobless rate to fall to 4 5 per cent simply has not been given enough time to be tested as dr lowe has pointed out the number of unfilled jobs for each unemployed person has fallen to resource boom proportions cutting interest rates for two months in a row would be a sign of baseless urgency given the latest labour force indicators show job growth accelerating and the infrastructure boom running into skills and materials shortages the housing correction is bottoming and tax cuts are likely to be handed out within weeks prudence suggests that the central bank should preserve whatever firepower it has left for when it really needs it such as if the us china trade war does escalate
7 trotsky s analysis of pre revolutionary spain an assessment 1 the republican socialist coalition government 1931 1933 with the establishment of the republican socialist cabinet following the april municipal elections and the june elections to the cortes a number of modest reforms were passed to secularize spain and ameliorate dire living conditions in the countryside socialist cabinet ministers had passed a number of decrees to help albeit in a very limited way tenant farmers and agricultural workers a decree of municipal boundaries términos municipales was passed which mandated that landowners could contract labor from another municipality only on the condition that all laborers within the landowners municipality were already employed a law was passed to protect tenant farmers from unjust eviction failure to pay rent being the only grounds for eviction furthermore tenant farmers could petition the courts to get reductions on rents mixed juries jurados mixtos were inaugurated to settle rural labor disputes on july 1st an edict was passed proclaiming the 8 hour day in the countryside and overtime pay for work performed over eight hours the socialists during their party congress on july 10th endorsed a number of reforms before the constituent cortes namely separation of church and state civil rights divorce agrarian reforms secular education and the nationalization of railways mines and forests another important socialist reform that would be included in article 44 of the constitution was the ability of property to be expropriated for the purpose of social utility even if this legislation appeared radical to some the constitution passed on december 9th 1931 epitomized the substantive limitations of capitalist democracy the document included the following compulsory military service similar to that under the monarchy powers to suspend constitutional rights under threats to the republic for example denigration of public institutions actions provoking the flight of capital illicit possession of arms and unreasonable refusal to work revoking the right to assembly for threats to the public order compulsory arbitration for labor disputes and limiting the voting age to 23 in a country where leading militants were as young as sixteen years old the economic downturn hit industry particularly the mining sector and agriculture hard competition from british coal imports depressed the market for spanish coal mine owners in asturias had responded by closing mines reducing hours and ignoring workers demands for the 7 hour day on september 9th 1931 a modest agrarian reform bill was passed which included small wage increases for agricultural workers in the context of an economic downturn and reduced profits increased wages essentially meant direct redistribution of wealth to the poor the far right mobilized to oppose it claiming that high rural wages would bankrupt them the truth was agricultural families lived on a starvation wage that did not allow many to introduce meat into their diets the landowners declared an economic war on laborers conducting rural lockouts and refusing to hire workers and withholding wages for work already performed the latifundistas backed by the political right also refused any concessions to tenant farmers who lived in virtual enslavement and were threatened with eviction these forms of economic sabotage on behalf of the landowners popularized the idea among laborers and tenant farmers organized in the fntt the ugt affiliate and main organizer of the agricultural workers that if they won t produce we should take the land and run it collectively the substance of this reform paled in comparison to what trotsky and the oce argued was necessary they understood that the dismal state of industry and agriculture in the midst of plenty for the wealthy required the implementation of radical reforms as the only solution to the crisis trotsky and the oce argued that spanish industry was unable to keep up with foreign competition prompting protectionist measures to safeguard markets for spanish goods as spanish protectionism provoked british and french retaliation on spanish agricultural exports the cyclical downturn of the economy could only be solved through the state monopoly of trade as for agriculture there needed to be a radical redistribution of land to the peasantry in this connection the demands regarding church were confiscation of all church wealth dissolution of all orders prohibition of religious teachers in schools church funds to be redirected to aid peasantry and confiscation and redistribution of land to the peasantry concerning the reform of the military trotsky and the oce demanded the elimination of the officer corps and elections of officers by the common soldier republicans did little to curb the excesses of the church the republicans were so tied to landowners wealth the landowners in turn were economically and ideologically bound to church accordingly the republicans proposed only to disrupt church groups if they were considered detrimental to spanish nation the jesuit order a group which had amassed incredible wealth was eventually disbanded in 1932 however the jesuits avoided the confiscation of their wealth funneling their riches into the coffers of other religious orders although state funding for the church had officially ended state subvention of catholic schools continued with respect to reforming the military the republicans offered officers an early retirement with pay although this led to the exodus of 7 000 officers the aristocratic milieu within the army remained intact while the republicans and socialists deliberated over petty reform in the cortes a generalized strike wave continued throughout spain trotsky wrote in april 1931 about the role of strikes in advancing the gains of the revolution the revolution awakens and in this lies its force the most backward downtrodden the most oppressed toiling masses the strike is the form of their awakening by means of the strike various strata and groups of the proletariat announce themselves signal to one another verify their own strength and the strength of their foe one layer awakens and infects another only through these strikes with all their mistakes with all their excesses and exaggerations does the proletariat rise to its feet assemble itself as a unit begin to feel and conceive of itself as a class as a living historical force never have revolutions developed under a conductor s stick excesses mistakes and sacrifices are the very nature of any revolution the strike wave of 1931 1932 was formidable in its magnitude and geographical scope these years matched 1930 in militancy and struggle the critical difference was that the republicans and socialists were now in power if the republicans and socialists did not deliver on their promises of social reform the masses would look for another way forward the far right conservative monarchist and increasingly fascist in spain caught unawares by the swift republican socialist victory at the polls in april and june was quick to regroup acción popular the organization of the far right headed by gil robles was poised to obstruct any attempt to introduce sweeping social reform in the countryside and of the church as trotsky predicted the socialists acted as the velvet glove covering the republican fist in all of the strike actions throughout 1931 and 1932 the psoe and ugt bureaucracy discouraged strike actions sought to bring these struggles out of their control to a swift end or even explicitly supported government repression of these actions likewise as trotsky anticipated the increased militancy of the rank and file within the ugt resulted from their increased expectations for winning reforms after all workers now had socialist representation in the government trifón gómez a right wing socialist and leader of the railwaymen s union within the ugt summed up the sentiment of the rank n file this way if there were not three socialist ministers in the government the concessions would have been received by the workers with applause and gratitude however since there are socialist ministers they think the railways should be handed over to them lock stock and barrel for the republicans the whole purpose of having the socialists in the coalition was to dampen militancy azaña the republican prime minister would write in his diary if the presence of three socialist ministers in the government cannot prevent the strike what use is it throughout 1931 the socialists and the ugt trade union bureaucracy advocated winning reform through the government bodies i e the cortes believing that strike action would only do the disservice of antagonizing the right wing when strikes broke out they were often led by the anarchist cnt and fai unions and much less often by the communist party although they frequently had the sympathy of the ugt rank and file the psoe and the ugt bureaucracy s endorsement of the republican crack down on these struggles fomented political division and distrust between the ugt and anarchist unions and did nothing to appease the right wing on the contrary acción popular was emboldened and strengthened by the repression of the left despite the ugt s attempts to divert the struggle throughout these years their unions witnessed incredible growth beginning at a membership of approximately 287 000 it is estimated that per week between four and five thousand workers were joining the ugt and between two and three thousand agricultural workers were joining the fntt by 1934 the ugt and fntt together boasted a membership of approximately 1 2 million or 500 growth in the span of three years the fntt alone grew from 36 000 to 400 000 from 1930 to 1932 the cnt fai grew from 500 000 to 1 2 million between 1931 and 1932 this was consistent with trotsky s perspective that the masses in revolution would flood into reformist organizations and parties first before joining any revolutionary party trotsky anticipated that increased struggle would force the rank and file workers to politically break from their leadership in the mining region of asturias the sindicato minero asturiano sma a ugt affiliated union consistently defied the ugt bureaucracy led most of the miners and performed many united actions with the cnt and pce led unions in another case the ugt railway union voted to organize itself in an independent union because of the ugt failure to address worker grievances adequately furthermore the fntt was compelled to take actions in the countryside independent of the position of the ugt leadership by 1932 the psoe leadership was aware and concerned that their moderate posture threatened their credibility among the membership in february 1932 a ugt national committee meeting was held where representatives expressed concern about not delivering enough on reform and questioning the effectiveness of a coalition with the republicans ugt representatives recognized that government repression of strike action was demoralizing the psoe and ugt base what they had refused to acknowledge was that the real battle for winning reform lie not within the cortes but implementing that reform in society at the grassroots level the two year period of struggle of 1931 1932 culminated the libertarian uprising of casas viejas cádiz during the month of january in 1933 the fai led an uprising that spread from cataluña zaragoza seville madrid all the way to casas viejas in casas viejas the fai declared a libertarian commune and the civil guard repressed the uprising guard killing 12 people the massacre put in bold relief the lengths to which the republicans would go to repress the very people who had elected them it also expressed socialist prostration and duplicity the psoe which many regarded as the political leader of the working class came out publicly against the uprising casas viejas emboldened the far right which lumped socialists anarchists and communists into one group that threatened the existence of private property and the church acción popular had opportunistically utilized the incidents in casas viejas to portray the republicans and socialists as incapable stable government as well as enemies of the peasant 2 prelude to revolution and civil war the rise of the right and the asturian insurrection 1934 by the end of 1933 the psoe was on the political defensive after having opposed workers struggle for more than two years acción popular grew as result forming a coalition of right wing groups ceda this coalition won increasing votes in the april municipal elections in 1933 and obtained the largest representation of any other political group or coalition in the elections to the cortes held in november the results of the cortes elections on november 19th 1933 were as follows ceda 115 seats radicals 104 seats the republicans 99 seats the socialists 58 seats clearly the psoe s dampening of struggle did nothing to appease the right wing and win reform on the contrary it strengthened the right and weakened the left nevertheless the election results did not represent a decisive political shift to the right among the spanish populace the right wing never won more than 40 of the vote in any one location and the abstention rate was very high and was attributed mainly to anarchist abstention in the election in response to the radicalization of the rank and file workers and peasants and the growing momentum of the right the psoe began to reevaluate its role in the republican coalition largo caballero the minister of labor of the republic became the most prominent spokesperson of a more salient left wing within the psoe and ugt indalecio prieto represented the more moderate wing and controlled the party and union bureaucracy having learned nothing from the previous two years prieto continued to advocate a reformist and gradualist strategy to socialism by mid 1933 caballero began to denounce right wing obstruction of reform warn about the threat of fascism and the need to take new revolutionary measures he had concluded that establishing a coalition with the republicans was a mistake and the reason for the growth of the far right the increase of the fascist right alarmed caballero and he warned that if the government did not put a stop to fascism in spain the working class would have to create its own organizations for doing so caballero on july 23rd had called fascism the bourgeoisie s last resort at a time of capitalist crisis and in a speech to the socialist youth argued that capitalism was too inflexible to accept progressive social reform and therefore a transition to socialism was necessary luis araquistáin another left socialist leader told the socialist youth that the passivity of the german social democratic party spd was the reason for fascism succeeding in germany after republican martinez barrio had formed an exclusively republican cabinet on october 8th and called elections to the cortes for november 19th caballero declared in a campaign speech that if socialist progress were made impossible the socialists would have to abandon bourgeois democracy and proceed to a revolutionary seizure of power although ceda had won more voters than any other political party or coalition the radicals and other republicans did not want to risk the potential backlash of letting the far right assume leadership positions in the cabinet parallel to this gil robles cautiously following the example of hitler did not want to overreach politically but rather ensure the consolidation of his base and assume power peacefully in response to the election results the psoe left wing became more vocal through 1934 they had witnessed the fascist takeovers in germany and austria and saw the fascist right in their own country gain considerable electoral ground within ceda in the event that the far right entered the government caballero had advocated the building of a revolutionary organization and fighting for the revolutionary seizure of power however caballero did not follow through organizationally on his threats radicals from the boc approached caballero and proposed forming worker alliances alianzas obreras organizations that could unite left political forces for the purpose of combating fascism and fighting for socialism although caballero participated in meetings to discuss their formation he was ultimately dismissive and did not contribute to building them also the anarchists true to their anti political inclinations opposed these bodies on the grounds that they involved parties instead throughout 1934 the psoe left wing leadership sat passively by while important struggles were left to be repressed the first struggle that the psoe ignored was a general strike in saragosa of april may 1934 which lasted 36 days the second struggle was an fntt called strike on june 5th to protest landowners withholding wages from agricultural workers in the southern provinces the psoe denounced the strike leading to government suppression and the imprisonment of 500 militants in badajoz and four killed at the hands of the civil guard in fuente del maestre the psoe could have called for industrial action in solidarity with their fntt comrades but neglected to do so the third and by far the most radical movement which foreshadowed the social revolution and civil war to come was the asturias uprising in october of 1934 on october 4th the radical party prime minister alejandro lerroux announced the ascension of three ceda ministers to cabinet posts in response the asturian miners led an uprising taking over the mining region in northern spain as previously noted militancy among the asturian miners was quite high throughout the first years of the republic the dominant union in asturias was the ugt affiliate the sma others were the anarchist sindicato único su and the communist breakaway from the latter the sindicato único de los mineros asturianos suma the position of the sma leadership was very moderate the union daily avance stated in august 1932 by respecting the existing work norms we will create a system of civility and mutual understanding and limit social conflict to that natural area defined by the logical antagonism of interests it should not be a war between slavers and africans a struggle between slaves and tyrants but simply the disagreement between the worker who aspires to a more humane and better life and the employer who understandably desires to obtain a reasonable return on his investment from a struggle imbued with this spirit it is always easy to reach an understanding which harms the interests of neither party this is how we understand the class struggle and this is how we will practice it the rank and file did not heed this message of conciliation in august 1932 a strike was called to protest the imposition of the four day week following an agreement between owners and miners strike activity resumed on a number of occasions because mine owners did not respect the promised agreement ultimately miners struck in mid november the strike lasted six days and involved 50 000 miners the government was forced to agree to miners demands control of iron imports tariff protection and state acquisition of coal in january 1933 another strike was called which lasted from february 6th to march 4th miners protested the owners raising coal prices lowering wages and firing miners the government responded to miners demands they reviewed the mine owners bookkeeping and owners agreed to retirement fund contributions nevertheless the owners discontinued contributions to retirement in september 1933 provoking a general strike the first national miners strike in spanish history which ended in a victory compared to the sma the cnt led su had a small following and the pce led suma even smaller their strikes only mobilized a small section of the mining population and often resorted to ultra militant tactics of dynamiting mines and armed confrontations with police this did not attract the radicalizing miners herein explains the paradox the militancy of the miners did not lead to their split from the sma even when there was open disagreement with the policy of the leadership this union remained the predominant leader among the miners the election of the ceda pushed the miners even further to the left out of a total of thirty two strikes in the first nine months eight were explicitly political and three of these eight were general strikes the socialist youth played a leading role among the miners and were more militant relative to their leadership the asturian insurrection which began on october 4th with ceda s entrance into key government positions was planned as part of a broader uprising throughout spain in order to kick the ceda right out of the government the movement lasted a total of two weeks miners took control of the coalfields disarming the civil guard and even repelling military personnel sent by the republican government after some considerable fighting the miners took control of oviedo the capital of asturias at the peak of the struggle they controlled about thirty percent of the region and eighty percent of the total population adrian shubert relates how democratically elected committees began to run the daily affairs of the area these local committees took control of all aspects of social organization incumbent on a government as well as military affairs they were active in food supply and rationing health labour communications propaganda public order and justice money was abolished and replaced by vouchers issued to each family and valid for an amount of food determined after a thorough census in sama the supply committee dealt with local farmers to assure quantities of milk eggs and meat in oviedo sama and mieres hospitals were organized and the wounded of both sides treated work committees organized the conservation of the mines and the operation of essential public services such as water and electricity explosives were produced in mieres and armored vehicles in turón in la felguera the fai kept the duro felguera foundry going turning out armoured cars in three eight hour shifts per day however the psoe leadership concerned most about the institutional integrity of the ugt as a peaceful bargainer in the government was not politically and organizationally equipped to lead a revolution they did not prepare their unions and party branches to participate in the strike in madrid even the more militant cnt within cataluña did not mobilize what is worse following the insurrection caballero dissociated himself politically from the uprising while in prison out of fear of provoking the right wing and he stated that strikes only dissipated the energies of the working class before the final seizure of power the miners held out for two weeks but were eventually beaten by detachments of moroccan legionaries led by francisco franco repression was the most violent yet seen in spain 3 000 militants were executed and the rest imprisoned the government throughout spain went on the offensive arresting every radical and left wing leader 3 the pace of revolution and its dangers spain 1931 vs russia 1917 trotsky had observed that toward the end of 1931 the workers movement had experienced an ebb the exception being workers uprisings in cataluña in january 1932 that continued through early 1932 and ended with the failed right wing coup of general sanjurjo in august 1932 however trotsky insisted that the revolution had not exhausted itself trotsky wrote toward the end of 1931 the extraordinary delay of the proletarian vanguard lagging behind the events the politically dispersed character of the heroic struggles of the working masses the actual assurances of reciprocity between anarcho syndicalism and social democracy these are the fundamental political conditions that made it possible for the republican bourgeoisie in league with social democracy to establish an apparatus of repression and by dealing the insurgent masses blow for blow to concentrate a considerable amount of political power in the hands of the government needless to say the spanish revolution has not yet ended it has not solved its most elementary tasks the agrarian church and national questions and is still far from having exhausted the revolutionary resources of the popular masses more than it has already given the bourgeois revolution will not be able to give with regard to the proletarian revolution the present internal situation in spain may be characterized as pre revolutionary but scarcely more than that it is quite probable that the offensive development of the spanish revolution will take on a more or less protracted character trotsky attributed the slower pace of the spanish revolution in part to the absence of a revolutionary party that could compete politically with the socialists and anarchists nevertheless there were other objective factors that trotsky identified that affected the slower character of the revolution to identify these factors and gauge their relative weight in shaping the revolution trotsky compared the spanish experience to that of the russian revolution of 1917 and the french revolution of 1789 the great french revolution took over three years to reach its highest point the dictatorship of the jacobins the russian revolution produced the dictatorship of the bolsheviks within eight months here we see a tremendous difference in tempo if in france events had developed faster the jacobins would not have had the time to take shape because they did not exist as a party on the eve of the revolution on the other hand had the jacobins represented a power on the eve of the revolution events would probably have proceeded faster that is one of the factors determining the tempo but there are also others perhaps more decisive ones the russian revolution of 1917 was preceded by the revolution in 1905 which lenin called a dress rehearsal all of the elements of the second and third revolutions were prepared beforehand so that the forces participating in the struggle moved as if according to plan this hastened extraordinarily the period of the revolution s rise to its culmination nevertheless it must be kept in mind that the decisive factor in relation to the tempo in 1917 was the war the agrarian question might have been postponed for months perhaps for a year or two but the question of death in the trenches could bear no postponement the soldiers were saying what good is the land to me if i am not alive the pressure of twelve million soldiers was a factor in the extraordinary acceleration of the revolution without the war in spite of the dress rehearsal of 1905 and the presence of the bolshevik policy the pre bolshevik period of the revolution might have lasted not eight months but perhaps a year or two more spain of 1931 was not russia of 1917 the russian revolution was propelled forward by the mass defection of the peasantry fighting in wwi compounded by an agricultural crisis in the countryside although there was an agricultural crisis in spain there was no war pushing the peasantry to desert the front and flood into soviets the soviets which represented heavily the soldiers and peasants were critical forums for the bolsheviks to establish political alliances with the peasantry absent workers councils and a war in spain trotsky predicted that the revolution may take years to fully mature and develop whereas the russian revolution took nine months to lead to a workers victory objective factors aside the presence of a mass revolutionary party the bolsheviks to raise fight and win the demands of the working class and peasantry greatly accelerated the pace of the russian revolution the absence of a revolutionary party in spain would after a period of time make the masses impatient with their lack of progress trotsky warned that this could lead to an early revolutionary confrontation between radical workers in cataluña and the ruling class before the working class throughout spain was ready to fight for political power trotsky observed there are factors that pull in the opposite direction and may provoke premature attempts at a decisive battle that are equivalent to defeat of the revolution the weakness of the party accentuates the strength of the spontaneous elements in the movement the anarcho syndicalist traditions have the same effect trotsky related that revolutionary impatience among sections of radicalized workers was a typical phase in social revolution and evident in a number of historical examples june 1848 and the french paris commune march 1871 in france and the july days of the russian revolution of 1917 trotsky explained the general nature of these moments the possessing class having come to power through the revolution is inclined to think that the revolution has by that exhausted its mission and is concerned more than anything else with proving its reliability to the forces of reaction the revolutionary bourgeoisie provokes the indignation of the masses by the very measures with which it strives to gain the good graces of the overthrown classes the disillusionment of the masses proceeds very quickly even before its vanguard has had a chance to cool off from the heat of the revolutionary battles it appears to those at the head of the movement that by a new blow it can finish or correct what it previously did not carry out resolutely enough from this comes the impulse for the new revolution unprepared without a program without looking back at the reserves without a thought for the consequences on the other hand the bourgeoisie which has come to power acts as though it were waiting for a stormy uprising from below in order to attempt to settle matters with the people such is the social and psychological basis for that supplementary semi revolution which more than once in history became the provocation for a victorious counterrevolution during the july days of 1917 the movement experienced an upsurge in st petersburg that almost led to a premature confrontation of revolutionaries with the kerensky led bourgeois government nonetheless this movement did not lead to a decisive defeat of the revolution the blow dealt to the masses and the party in july 1917 was very heavy but it was not the decisive blow the victims were counted by the tens but not by the tens of thousands the working class emerged from this trial neither beheaded nor debilitated it preserved its fighting cadres intact these cadres learned a great deal and led the proletariat to victory in october what distinguished the russian experience from france of 1848 and 1871 was the ability of the bolshevik party to deter the frustrated vanguard of the workers and soldiers from taking power too early whereas the july days of russia 1917 led to an acceleration of the revolution the asturian insurrection of 1934 led to defeat however like the july days this blow albeit the most brutal yet delivered to the spanish workers did not defeat the revolution revolutionaries would still have some time to learn from their mistakes and provide a new strategy even though trotsky s concerns vis à vis the over acceleration of the spanish revolution were written in 1931 for the purpose of warning about the early rise of the catalan proletariat they presage the events of asturias in 1934 the asturian insurrection highlighted another important matter the relationship between civil war and revolution following the suppression of the asturian commune trotsky countered sections of the reformist left who believed that the defeat in asturias proved revolutionary tactics were ineffective and counterproductive trotsky explained at length that asturias was the result of an inevitable consequence of revolution the armed confrontation between the workers and capitalists in other words civil war trotsky summarized civil war we have said following clausewitz is a continuation of politics by other means this means that the result of the civil war depends for one forth not to say one tenth upon the development of the civil war itself its technical means its purely military leadership and for three fourths if not for nine tenths on the political preparation of what does this political preparation consist of the revolutionary cohesion of the masses of their liberation from servile hopes in the clemency generosity and loyalty of democratic slave owners of the education of revolutionary cadres who know how to defy official public opinion and who know how to display towards the bourgeoisie one tenth the implacability that the bourgeoisie displays towards the toilers without this temper civil war when conditions force it and they always end by forcing it will take place under conditions most unfavorable to the proletariat will depend upon many hazards and even then in the case of military victory power can escape the hands of the proletariat whoever does not foresee that the class struggle leads inevitably to armed conflict is blind but he is no less blind who fails to see behind this armed conflict and its outcome the whole previous policy of the classes in struggle furthermore the successful counter revolution in asturias was predicated on the whole previous policy of the socialists and anarchists in spain the socialist party like the russian social revolutionaries and mensheviks shared power with the republican bourgeoisie to prevent the workers and the peasants from carrying the revolution to its conclusion for two years the socialists in power helped the bourgeoisie disembarrass itself of the masses by crumbs of national social and agrarian reforms against the most revolutionary strata of the people the socialists used repression the result is two fold anarcho syndicalism which would have melted like wax in the heat of revolution had the workers party pursued the correct course was strengthened and drew around it the militant layers of the proletariat at the other pole social catholic demagogy succeeded in skillfully exploiting the discontent of the masses with the bourgeois socialist government when the socialist party was sufficiently compromised the bourgeoisie drove it from power and took over the offensive on the whole front the socialist party had to defend itself under the most unfavorable conditions which had been prepared for it by its own previous policy the bourgeoisie already had mass support at the right the anarcho syndicalist leaders who during the course of the revolution committed all of the mistakes typical of these professional confusionists refused to support the insurrection led by the traitor politicians the movement did not take on a general character but remained sporadic the government directed its blows at the scattered sections of the workers the civil war forced by the reaction ended in the defeat of the proletariat 4 repression political realignments and the popular front 1935 1935 was a year of repression of the left nevertheless the revolution was not defeated radicals and militants of all shades were discussing what the lessons of the past struggle were as well as next steps for the movement caballero himself was reading marx lenin and trotsky and identified at least in words with bolshevism concluding that a new revolutionary international be constructed beyond the 2nd and 3rd internationals therefore 1935 was also a year of critical political alignments that would shape the future formation of the popular front government in february of 1936 the youth section of the psoe the partido socialista de la juventud psj boasted a following in the tens of thousands of young radicals already looking for a bolshevik style party caballero s revolutionary bombast and lack of action demonstrated him to be an impotent leader of the growing radicalization the socialist youth who were looking for a consistent revolutionary alternative to the moderate psoe eventually merged with the communist youth in april of 1936 to form one organization in which the communist party would dominate the jsu juventud socialista unificado the communist party internationally had since hitler s rise to power moved from the ultra revolutionary policy of the third period to a policy of accommodation to moderate reformist parties the popular front the communist party adopted the popular front policy in august of 1935 at the seventh congress of the communist international comintern and advocated unity with all left parties including the republicans the pce had grown from a membership of 800 in 1931 to 10 000 in 1934 and 30 000 by the end of 1935 aside from the inability of the cnt fai and the psoe to effectively harness the radicalization into a unified revolutionary force the following factors can explain the rise of the communist party in spain from 1931 1936 1 the masses in spain and worldwide still looked to the communist party as heir to the first successful workers revolution in russia 2 the communist party advocated the popular front strategy of uniting all left forces in the government and beyond a policy that comforted many who were frustrated with political divisions on the left for years even decades and 3 they were given credit for leading militant struggles particularly among the miners in asturias in 1934 the trotskyist organization ice the group with the best political ideas was also the smallest and therefore could not win revolutionary militants and leaders away en masse from reformist socialism stalinist communism and anti political insurrectionary anarchism the size of ice proved decisive at its highest point it had boasted only 800 members thus it was incapable of competing politically with the psoe cnt and fai these were mass organizations which all together organized between 2 5 and 3 million workers a clear majority of the spanish proletariat instead during 1935 the ice not seeing a clear way to influence events as a small group and having come to sharp political and personal disputes with trotsky opted to merge with juan maurin s dissident communist boc to form the partido obrero de unificación marxista poum in september this organization was based in cataluña and as boc had a membership of 5 000 by 1934 and 6 000 by 1936 as the poum ceda s increasing influence and control over the government frightened even the republican party on may 5th 1935 the number of ceda ministers in the government increased to five which included gil robles as head of the ministry of war with francisco franco appointed as commander in chief of the army the radical party true to their tradition had become mired in scandal and corruption which led to their virtual implosion as a political party and lerroux s exit from the political scene as prime minister ceda s presence in the government appeared ever more ominous therefore when the time had come to either cede the position of prime minister to gil robles or dissolve the cortes and call new elections zamora had chosen the latter the elections to the cortes resulted in the victory of the popular front an electoral coalition of left parties only months later the fascist right would counter with an uprising initiating the civil war gil robles had tried hitler s peaceful road to institute fascism and failed the only solution left would be to wage war the communist party had convinced the reluctant psoe to join the republicans once again in a government coalition the republicans had formally proposed that the socialist party join the popular front government on november 14th 1935 finally the psoe met on december 15th and the moderate wing led by prieto dominated the discussion distancing itself from the caballero left wing and endorsed the popular front strategy the anarchist leadership who had historically advocated abstention from elections for the first time did not explicitly tell their members to not vote even the poum the political formation that most approximated a revolutionary marxist position and even still quite far in trotsky s purview signed on to the popular front 5 the failure to build a revolutionary party in spain 1930 1935 trotsky was expelled from the soviet union in 1929 he along with a number of revolutionaries who agreed with his assessment of stalinism formed the international left opposition ilo however the political pressures were intense many capitulated and dissociated themselves from trotskyism and sought re entry into the russian party some even committed suicide the ilo entered the 1930 s as a tiny force relative to the cadres in the communist parties worldwide what they lacked in resources they made up for in political clarity trying to rescue a revolutionary marxist perspective from the clutches of a stalinist counter revolutionary policy for the ilo spain was unique in 1930 relative to other countries because there existed a nucleus of followers in exile and throughout spain who agreed with and decided to organize with trotsky meanwhile the pce in spain had only 800 members and negligible influence in the workers movement furthermore the other dissident communist current the fcc b or boc organized itself independently and dissociated itself from the pce as noted earlier this group was larger than ice with a few thousand members the possibility of winning these radicals and pce members away from stalinism and toward more consistent revolutionary positions seemed more probable relative to other places in addition spain was entering into a period of increased struggle with its transition from a monarchical dictatorship to a liberal democracy in 1931 the opportunity to expose the counter revolutionary nature of stalinism would be just as great in spain as it would be for the ilo in germany in the fight against hitler s growing fascist movement a number of people have recounted the discussion between the oce ice and trotsky concerning how a revolutionary party could be built in spain between 1930 and 1935 some take trotsky s side in the debate others side with the ice s decision to form the poum and some simply explain the political disputes the decisions and positions trotsky and the oce ice advocated need to be seen within the context of the incredible obstacles and limitations they faced in real time only then is it possible to understand better why they advocated certain positions and why they reached the conclusions they did such an approach needs to account for the historical context in which oce ice and trotsky made decisions without the benefit of hindsight that the historian possesses while simultaneously using a historical view to look at factors beyond the 1930 35 time frame that impacted the ability of the revolutionary current associated with trotsky to grow a political tensions and breaks between the oce ice and trotsky the oce established itself in exile at a meeting in liege belgium in 1930 andreu nin the most prominent member who spent his exile in the ussr during the 1920 s finally made his way to barcelona in 1931 the composition of the oce despite being small about only 50 people at its founding possessed a number of capable cadres furthermore they were from a variety of areas of spain asturias the basque region cataluña madrid and the agricultural regions of southern spain trotsky living in exile at this time in turkey relied on his contact with nin who was proficient in russian i establishing a solid political operation the correspondence between trotsky and nin during the years 1931 and 1932 shows that trotsky appeared uneasy with a number of actions nin had taken and not taken for trotsky the priority of any revolutionary organization aspiring to be a mass party of the working class was to establish a political base of operation nin and his comrades needed to operate independently as a leadership and build political roots throughout the country through the establishment of a regular paper and journal nevertheless nin after arriving in barcelona prioritized collaboration with boc over establishing a political base for the oce he believed that boc s criticism of stalinism would make it more amenable to influence and would therefore be an important part of the building of a real mass party in spain in addition nin communicated that joaquín maurín the leader of boc and he were neighbors which facilitated political work and collaboration in the end nin believed he could win maurín over to the oce s and trotsky s perspectives while trotsky communicated that he was encouraged about maurin s openness he harbored some concerns first boc s publications demonstrated a lack of political clarity and consistency on a range of issues and assumed political positions that were deeply at odds with the oce second although nin collaborated with maurín in drafting theses within the boc group did this mean that he was coming closer to the oce in terms of organizing in the same group there was no indication that this was the case for trotsky it was more probable that maurín would join the oce if it were already established with an independent analysis and organization thus for trotsky it came back to the priority of the oce building its own organizational strength first and then winning influence on that basis to many radicals in boc nin was an outsider because he had not been in spain for a long time about a decade and had little in terms of political and organizational links over the course of 1931 and 1932 nin found that there were big political disagreements with maurín that led to breaks in their political relationship re establishing ties and renewed breaks boc s politics were far from consistent with revolutionary marxism the boc never took a principled position regarding the increasingly stalinist comintern and wanted to keep relations open with it this reflected in their propaganda referring to socialists as social fascists and campaigning on the slogan class against class maurín was the undisputed charismatic leader of boc and beyond him the organization was far from being on the same page politically from 1931 to 1935 boc s viewpoints regarding trotsky in their publications were erratic at times they voiced praise and defense of trotsky s ideas and in the next breath heavy criticism and political distancing in terms of the organization itself boc was created to be a broader organization with the fcc b or catalan federation being the leader within it in reality both groups were indistinguishable from one another and so it was simply known as boc even still nin as a representative of the oce was not allowed to join openly as a member because of his affiliation with trotsky maurín and boc accommodated heavily to catalan nationalism and not only supported the right for cataluña to separate but actively advocated that it do so in addition they overestimated the pre revolutionary events of 1931 and 1932 thinking the revolution was upon them maurín believed the cnt was the body through which workers could take power and called on the cnt to do so in 1932 after maurín found the cnt difficult to influence he advocated building a separate trade union effectively isolating its organization of militants from the cnt while the boc was a key leader in the formation of the alianza obrera in 1934 like with the cnt he overestimated the revolutionary nature of this body and argued that it would become the organ of workers power in the revolution after the asturias uprising the alianza obrera dissipated shortly thereafter trotsky argued that the oce had wasted precious time trying to influence the politically confused boc when it could have spent the time establishing its independent political operation the movement of the worker and peasant masses in spain was promising but it was missing a key ingredient a revolutionary party with an established political center the oce did not officially announce itself publicly in barcelona until september 1931 and did not have as of yet a regular paper of which to speak the oce did have a theoretical monthly journal comunismo which had started in may 1931 it is estimated that this journal had a circulation of 1 500 copies before it ended in october 1934 although the journal held some political sway among radicals with its consistent publication schedule and its high political quality its purpose was more theoretical and it did not comment regularly on everyday struggles and political questions following the political fallout with the boc and the official announcement of the oce s existence in barcelona nin and the oce leadership produced a paper el soviet this paper s existence was sporadic and short lived it launched on october 15th 1931 in barcelona only three editions were issued that month before ceasing publication the paper surfaced again in may 1932 until july 1932 before disappearing for the final time by this time the strike movement that swept the country in 1930 and 1931 had already ebbed with the exception of important miners strikes that took place in asturias throughout 1932 another paper the ice published was la antorcha which appeared in may 1934 in madrid but like its predecessor el soviet only three editions appeared ii independence vis à vis the pce as previously noted the pce was a very small group in spain and did not exist at all in cataluña outside of barcelona the most politically radical region trotsky through the ilo maintained the perspective that stalin s policy in the ussr was an unstable centrist position that swung widely from the political left to right in this way stalin was very vulnerable and could be dislodged from political power trotsky did not believe that stalin s move to industrialize the country through the forced collectivization of the peasantry in 1928 represented a counter revolution from above and the acceleration of the consolidation of a new ruling class in russia some in russia were drawing different conclusions than trotsky and were already defining russia as state capitalist even though trotsky argued against state capitalism as an apt description of the ussr years later he fully understood the counter revolutionary role of stalinism as a political force he believed stalin could be pushed from power if the conditions were ripe i e renewed revolutionary activity the political and organizational conclusion from trotsky s perspective of the soviet union was that the ilo should despite expulsion remain a faction of the official communist party in practical political terms this meant that ilo groups like the oce should not view themselves as a separate organization from communist parties like the pce rather they should try to win over these poorly advised parties in terms of a concrete approach this meant that the oce should support pce candidates in elections and not run candidates of their own over the course of 1930 and 1931 this created an increasingly confusing situation for the oce nin questioned a policy that forced them to politically endorse a group that was completely hostile and hardly a political force the pce during this time never related with the oce in a friendly manner and called trotskyism counter revolutionary early on nin asked trotsky if they should convince people coming around the oce to enter the pce first and then later join the oce trotsky responded that such an approach hardly made sense because the pce would miseducate people politically and they would never arrive to the oce nonetheless nin s question was a valid one based on the overall relationship trotsky advocated toward the communist parties worldwide how does one reconcile being an expelled faction of a party while being an independent political force and what are the concrete political applications of this seemingly contradictory approach nin s and the oce s experience with this policy led them to question its worth in spain during the third congress of the oce in march 1932 the oce voted to change its name to the ice izquierda comunista de españa and in favor of putting forth its own candidates in elections by this time direct correspondence between nin and trotsky had ceased and trotsky understood the name change as a political challenge to the decisions of the ilo for the ice it represented a much needed independence from the rigid and hostile pce the ice still officially part of the ilo and seeing themselves as such defended their decision for greater independence as follows as great as the differences between the communist left and stalinism may be in practice the opposition has no program other than the reform of the party which makes this reform a prior condition for the execution of its policy the traditional attitude of the opposition is totally insufficient in the actual circumstances and by persisting in it the opposition will not achieve a political solution in the decisive moments since any partial reforms that might be achieved in the international would not substantially modify the nature of stalinism thus a rift developed between the ice and trotsky as political bridges were being reconstructed between ice and boc this rift between trotsky and the ice widened over the course of the following year even as early as 1931 when nin was beginning to settle in spain intense factional disputes had developed regarding the ilo s french section over time this issue would become intertwined with problems within the oce ice involving a founding member these disputes did not involve issues directly related with the political situation in spain nonetheless they exacerbated already existing political disagreements the assumption of hitler to power in germany in 1933 due primarily to stalin s ultra leftist directives to the kpd to not unite in struggle with the spd to defeat hitler led trotsky to conclude that the third international was dead he argued that ilo groups should no longer be organized as factions of the official party and needed to be completely independent the ilo decided to rename itself the international communist left icl a name very similar to the spanish communist left izquierda comunista de españa experience seemed to vindicate the spanish comrades experiences regarding relations with the pce as well as their name change to ice this opened trotsky to the charge that he was not sufficiently informed of the specific conditions that comrades faced in spain a charge that ice members would say repeatedly distancing themselves further from trotsky iii entry into the psoe or fusion with boc after four years of political activity the ice had grown from 50 members to between 700 and 800 the political shift to the right following the republican socialist coalition government of 1931 33 led to the ceda winning a majority in the cortes in 1933 they attempted to push themselves into cabinet positions a year later prompting the asturias uprising the electoral swing to the right politically in spain produced a left wing radicalization among the rank and file of the socialist party and the ugt that reflected itself in the leadership of the party largo caballero the most prominent spokesperson for the left wing drew the conclusion that forming a coalition government with the republicans had been a mistake and went so far as to conclude that a bolshevik style party needed to be created at this time trotsky had advocated entry of the ice into the psoe in order to win the recently radicalized left particularly the socialist youth away from this party this could lead to the foundation of a revolutionary party in the tens of thousands the ice membership had their doubts how could they go into a party and then break people away from that party wouldn t they be treated in a hostile manner did this not contradict trotsky s earlier argument about having an independent party to draw people to instead the ice decided to merge with the boc and form the poum this decision provoked a political and organizational break with ilo although trotsky remained open to communication with the poum through the civil war why did the ice decide to form the poum first the desire for unity was strong following the brutal repression of the asturian commune and the continuing political persecution of 1935 the psoe had been a party that was responsible for repressing struggle this soured the expectations of the ice to gain anything from entry into that party moreover the french group s entry into the french socialist party failed to establish a revolutionary party of any size the move completely failed and greatly demoralized the french ilo trotsky s push to enter the psoe was a desperate attempt to build a party in an increasingly difficult situation where immediate prospects for growth were limited with the benefit of hindsight we know that poum did not succeed in leading a workers revolution during the civil war but does that mean entry into the psoe would have built the party that could have led a successful revolution although a limited degree of collaboration among ice and socialist youth did happen this was not deep enough to win people away from the party en masse the choice available to the ice in 1935 that would allow them to break out of their isolation was entry into the psoe or joining with boc in a unified but very small revolutionary organization this choice the ice faced stemmed from one problem the limits of being a small organization trying to build a party in the middle of pre revolutionary events hence the question is why did the ice fail to grow from 1930 35 the answer to this question lies in part through making some concluding remarks about the polemics between trotsky and oce ice discussed above however a fuller answer will require to look beyond these years and briefly discuss the pre history of revolutionary marxist organization in spain one that developed very differently from the bolshevism trotsky knew the factors already noted that contributed to the oce ice failure of building a revolutionary marxist party during the years 1930 35 include 1 delays in getting a political operation up and running along with the sporadic and limited frequency of a revolutionary press 2 trotsky s and the ilo s tactical approach to the pce one that greatly disoriented and confused the spanish comrades during the pre revolutionary struggles of 1930 33 and 3 nin and the oce having become embroiled in factional struggles within their own organization and within the ilo that greatly strained relations between the oce ice and trotsky these factional struggles within the ilo were occurring before nin had even settled into a political routine in barcelona when it came time to take advantage of the radicalization taking place in society from 1933 34 the ice was too small to attract the radicalized sections of the psoe ugt and fntt therefore they opted to merge in a united party with radicals who most identified with their viewpoints the boc even though this party lacked a clear and consistent revolutionary program b looking at factors outside the time and space of 1930 35 spain any analysis that describes the failures of a revolutionary party to form in spain during these years needs to understand the problem of stalinism as the primary cause stalin whose power grew in proportion to the degeneration of the russia and failure of european wide revolution effectively isolated dissidents having the formidable resources of the state behind him stalin was able to lay claim to the revolutionary legacy of the russian revolution effectively co opting newly radicalized people into communist parties worldwide revolutionaries like trotsky who had concluded that the stalin led ussr was on the wrong track had difficulty defining its nature he did not see stalin as having initiated an economic and political counter revolution in the ussr trotsky never broke completely from the idea that stalin represented an unstable and therefore transient phase in the political history of the ussr consequently from 1930 to 1933 he believed the left faction could win political power back once people saw how far stalin s policies had diverged from revolutionary marxism therefore trotsky was being careful not to dismiss the cadres in the communist parties internationally doing so could mean the loss of leadership over the communist movement and the experienced political cadres that would be the foundation of a renewed revolutionary policy on the other hand trotsky s theoretical views regarding the ussr and stalin s role within it did have costs it led the ilo factions to not view themselves as an independent political force from the official communist parties he would quickly change his position after seeing how stalin s counter revolutionary policy directly led to hitler s rise to power and did not end in stalin s removal from power nonetheless regarding pre revolutionary spain there was a real loss of time between 1930 and 1933 a period of struggle that could have formed and shaped a revolutionary party had already passed the final and probably the most important consideration is that the process of building a successful revolutionary party begins long before the revolution lenin and the bolshevik tendency within the russian social democratic labor party rsdlp came from a rich revolutionary tradition that began with the narodnick movement of the mid to late 1800 s and the formation of the first marxist group the emancipation of labor group over a period of decades they maintained contact with their russian comrades through a revolutionary press and meetings even during long periods of exile in contrast anarchism had dominated the radical politics of the spanish for decades and the socialist party suffering from all the political weaknesses of social democracy after wwi did not attract the most militant revolutionary workers likewise the spanish communist movement born in 1920 was small mired in fractious polemic and failed to attract the most revolutionary workers nin being one of the foremost spanish marxists was not in a position to build a revolutionary organization to the extent that lenin had in russia over a 30 year period trotsky explained to his spanish comrades that a revolutionary party is welded together in the ups and downs of struggle a process that requires a period of decades not years absent this work in non revolutionary times the network of cadre indispensable to shaping events during a revolution will not be formed around the same time that the oce began organizing in spain trotsky wrote in his history of the russian revolution without a guiding organization the energy of the masses would dissipate like steam not enclosed in a piston box but nevertheless what moves things is not the piston or the box but the steam trotsky s revolutionary experience brought to the fore his ability to offer a very clear strategy on the fight for workers revolution in spain however while trotsky understood the need for a revolutionary party his limitation was that he joined the bolshevik party at the height of struggle during the russian revolution when it was already established he never had the experience of building a party of cadre as lenin did he was learning how to do this for the first time in conditions that were in many ways more difficult than for lenin the only example of living socialism in the form of the soviet union had degenerated into a bureaucratic nightmare with communist parties worldwide subjected to its dictates furthermore the spanish revolutionary process of the 1930 s came at a time when the workers movements throughout europe had already suffered a number of historic defeats with the social democratic parties becoming discredited in the face of revolution both nin and trotsky among others were trying to build revolutionary organization in a hurry and at the end of a european wide revolutionary movement during the interwar period 6 the struggle for self determination in spain 1931 1936 throughout the rivera dictatorship of the 1920 s spain spent seven hundred million pesetas per year to fund its colonization of northern morocco a policy that benefited only a handful of spanish capitalists and government officials the republican socialist coalition continued the colonial occupation on the pretext that moroccans benefited from progressive democratic government trotsky and the oce demanded the self determination for morocco this position would help the development of the spanish revolution in a number of ways first it would win the confidence of the moroccan people to the side of the spanish proletariat and weaken spanish imperialism in addition counteracting spanish chauvinism with the demand for moroccan self determination could placate the counter revolutionary groups in the colony such as the moorish troops and the foreign legion who could be sent to spain to repress a revolutionary movement finally any movement for self determination would undermine spanish imperialism facilitating workers power over the bourgeoisie indeed the absence of a policy for moroccan self determination among the socialists and anarchists proved detrimental to the development of the revolution from 1931 to 1936 a sincere commitment to moroccan self determination could have neutralized the reactionary regiments of the foreign legion that crushed the asturias uprising furthermore spanish morocco was the base from which general francisco franco launched the fascist uprising of july of 1936 a morocco cataluña and the basque region the question of independence or as it played out autonomy for spain s provinces was equally critical the basque and catalan regions were the most industrialized areas of spain as previously noted trotsky and the oce advocated the broadest autonomy for these national regions even separation if the populace so demanded not raising this demand would mean acquiescing to the politics of castilian bureaucratic centralism and imperialism exhibited toward the colonies and semi autonomous regions the development of nationalism was different in character between the basque and catalan regions the difference in part was due to the nature of capitalist development in each region in the case of cataluña the agricultural sector developed more or less side by side with industry each sector facilitated the growth of the other through mutual investment and consumption furthermore compared to the basque region capitalist firms were smaller on average greater in number and more evenly distributed in contrast agriculture in the basque region had a more antagonistic relationship with industry there was a higher concentration of industry bigger firms and smaller in number and these enterprises were heavily dependent on foreign capital in cataluña the capitalists had developed in relative autonomy to the castilian center although they did benefit from madrid s coddling of catalan industry through protectionist policies in contrast the basque industrial and financial firms were more integrated and therefore less antagonistic to madrid as noted earlier trotsky argued that the politics of nationalism could not be separated from the nature of struggle between classes in the case of cataluña these politics found a social base in the radicalized sharecroppers of the region the rabassaires and among the capitalists of the light industrial sector for the basque region the impetus for autonomy and separation came from the reactionary rural middle class landowners in the countryside and small business owners in the urban areas nevertheless the desire for autonomy also seeped into the working class in cataluña militants in the cnt were supportive of autonomist initiatives in the basque region workers within the solidarity of basque workers sov union favored autonomy and some even separation for trotsky and the oce socialism was the only system capable of abolishing the imperialist subjugation of the semi autonomous regions and the capitalist system that propped up imperialist relations therefore for the catalan and basque workers the battle for self determination was a democratic demand that could only be fully realized through workers revolution b cataluña catalan nationalism which had a long history grew under rivera culminating in the declaration of an independent catalan republic following the april municipal elections of 1931 the left republican party esquerra gave expression to the petty bourgeois nationalism of cataluña this party had won a plurality of votes 36 of the total vote in the regional elections including a majority of the working class vote colonel francesc macià the leader of esquerra formed a regional catalan government the generalitat although macià spoke in favor of a federation of iberian republics the autonomy statute he drafted did not propose separation from madrid conceding to pressure from madrid the statute macià proposed only granted a limited degree of autonomy on political and economic questions related to the province norman jones summarizes the limited nature of the autonomy statute the statute of autonomy created a catalan parliament whose legislative competence was limited to agriculture the secondary transport network public health and poor relief regulation of municipal government and catalan civil law however the statute also authorized the generalitat to administer as agent for the central power without any legislative competence public education major public works labor conciliation services and the police forces and law courts in all these areas nevertheless amendments had introduced close state inspection and provision for unilateral intervention from madrid the gravest alteration inverted the draft statute s financial terms barely one third of catalan taxation was allotted to the generalitat to be handed over to cover the costs of existing state services in the region as they were transferred from madrid the remainder the direct taxation was retained by the state on august 2nd macià presented the statute to the catalan people in the form of a referendum the referendum passed with an overwhelming endorsement 99 4 of the vote it was then transmitted to the cortes for consideration after a prolonged period of political haggling and stalling the central government passed the referendum on september 9th 1932 cabinet ministers in the newly formed republic in madrid were not friendly to the idea of catalan autonomy miguel maura a republican and minister of the interior sought to curb the political jurisdiction of the generalitat by having the final word on bureaucratic appointments to the regional government including cataluña s four civil governorships prieto then the minister of finance used his authority to financially sabotage the barcelona city council for attempting to resolve its debt issues withdrawing all government deposits from barcelona s largest bank furthermore largo caballero then minister of labor sought to subject all labor disputes through binding arbitration boards this often led to opportunistic practices on the part of caballero who anxious to establish growth of ugt unions within cataluña favored ugt led unions in settlements over the cnt catalan workers felt the brunt of madrid s centralism in the newly formed republic in one case cnt led dockworkers in barcelona struck and reached an agreement with the governor macià however maura had appointed a right republican anguera de sojo as civil governor to barcelona who rescinded the agreement established this provoked a resumption of the cnt dockworkers strike as jones explains august brought a wave of industrial disputes in which he increasingly used his police powers to try to compel observance of largo s labor legislation if a union refused to go to arbitration its strike was illegal anguera had its pickets and strike committee arrested and encouraged the employer to resist and recruit fresh labor from mid 1933 through 1934 the question of autonomy became more significant with the rise of the far right throughout spain ceda was staunchly opposed to any form of autonomy for spanish provinces the right wing shift electorally throughout spain in 1933 also expressed itself in cataluña with the election of lliga regionalista a conservative republican party to the leadership over the generalitat after the november elections lliga feared the catalan working class they opposed separation or independence worrying that the fight for autonomy would provoke further militancy and depended on castile s repressive institutions to discipline the catalan working class the piece of legislation that escalated the confrontation of political forces in cataluña was the cultivation law ley de cultivos passed on april 12 1933 this law allowed tenant farmers in cataluña the option to purchase the land they farmed provided they had done so for eighteen years by payments to the proprietors spread over fifteen years even with this modest social reform the government filled with cedistas did not bend on june 8th the central government with the backing of the catalan landowners voided the law on the basis that the generalitat had overstepped its jurisdiction the generalitat and the catalan government responded by passing another cultivation law identical to the first the battle grew more pitched as gil robles mobilized ceda and catalan landowners to protest the legislation the final showdown between madrid and cataluña in the pre civil war years occurred during the asturias uprising boc through alianza obrera called a general strike to declare solidarity with the miners revolt however the alianza obrera s call to strike did not receive the support it had hoped the cnt in barcelona did not join the battle the generalitat despite feeling the pressure from below did not wage a fight for a more substantive autonomy the central government entered barcelona quickly suppressed the strike and declared martial law after having met no resistance on the part of the generalitat from 1931 to 1936 the left was unclear about the question of catalan autonomy the psoe while in the government assumed a chauvinistic attitude toward cataluña the cnt which dominated the radical left in cataluña did not offer a clear revolutionary perspective on the right of catalan to autonomy the anarchist leaders of the fai variety either supported separation but did not distinguish their position from esquerra or abstained from political questions whereas the syndicalist wing within the cnt was against any move to separate from madrid finally the smaller dissident group boc led by joaquín maurín through the alianza obrera demanded that the generalitat proclaim cataluña an independent republic a position synonymous with esquerra the question of autonomy in cataluña temporarily stymied would resurface with the formation of the popular front in 1936 and esquerra s resumption of political leadership over cataluña c the basque region whereas cataluña was the cauldron of the spanish revolution and a home for left radical parties unions and organizations the basque region euzkadi was politically more conservative while the nationalist opposition of esquerra to madrid in cataluña was politically to the left of the central government the basque nationalist party pnv a moderate conservative catholic party that won in the november 1933 general elections in the basque provinces did not support the anti clerical positions of the republican socialist government nor the asturias uprising of 1934 the pnv led union the solidarity of basque workers sov was the only union that competed with the psoe and ugt in the region during these years still this competition did not come from the left juan medrano sums up the contradictory nature of basque nationalism within a context of castilian imperialism catholicism was the true religion of the basque country that political independence was both right and the objective to be achieved by the basque people that efforts needed to be made to preserve and strengthen the basque race and that the old practices and traditional institutions of the basque provinces should be re established the republican socialist coalition rejected the basque autonomy statute on the grounds that the region would become a right wing stronghold hostile to the republic however opposition to basque autonomy meant that the republicans and socialists were the new chauvinists putting them in political agreement with the surrounding and politically conservative and even increasingly fascist provinces like navarre the northern base for the future fascist uprising of july 1936 indeed there were questions concerning whether or not the vote for autonomy was democratic since the electoral system the fueros favored the rural districts over the urban the former being more inclined toward autonomy than the latter although the basque electoral process to achieve autonomy from 1931 1933 was questionable from a formal democratic viewpoint even more questionable was the coalition government position of rejecting autonomy on the basis of strengthening democracy when in fact they were undermining the will of the basque people only a movement from within the basque urban centers could question the democratic process of the autonomy movement the madrid government rejecting basque autonomy set into motion contradictory political forces it strengthened the influence of basque clerics over the working class while simultaneously directing basque working class anger at castilian chauvinism furthermore while the pnv was politically conservative they were not fascists the party had gone through a progressive phase of development reflected in the modernization of the economy in the region to be sure the pnv did join the far right ceda coalition in the elections of 1933 however they soon realized they were in enemy camp the other groups in ceda like renovación española and acción popular were extremely hostile to the idea of basque autonomy calvo sotelo a reactionary monarchist politician famously and facetiously remarked that spain would be red before broken roja antes que rota in other words it was preferable that the country be under communist control than being broken up into a number of republics the fascists in ceda viewed any concession to basque autonomy as a step toward total separation from spain accordingly they squashed any proposal for basque autonomy during the years 1934 1935 during these years the basque pnv formed a temporary alliance with republicans and socialists resisting ceda s extreme nationalism the pnv endorsed the popular front government which assumed political power in february 1936 basque autonomy was formally granted on october 1st 1936 when the civil war was already underway ultimately the fascist national front defeated resistance in the basque region in june of 1937 one of the most brutal and notorious examples of fascist repression occurred in the basque town of guernica 7 trotsky s analysis of pre revolutionary spain an assessment trotsky s starting point for understanding the spanish revolution was grasping the economic character and nature of spain spain like russia of the early 20th century combined feudal features in the countryside with advanced modern industry in the urban areas the difference was that spain by 1931 was already well passed russia of 1917 in terms of industrialization and the working class in spain was larger in proportion to the peasantry than russia and boasted a substantial rural proletariat this combined and uneven development created the prospect for the working class to be the leading political force in spain the ruling bourgeoisie represented in the various republican parties was too timid to overturn the feudal institutions on which it depended to discipline the working class the political corollary of combined and uneven development was the leading role of the working class in the developing revolution what trotsky called permanent revolution the working class was the only social class structurally capable of assuming leadership over the struggle for democracy and socialism revolution required first and foremost that the working class have a revolutionary party a leadership of tested and experienced cadres rooted in day to day struggles at the grassroots level the revolutionary party would lead a united front of left forces at the base of society to fight the right and realize democratic reforms that the democrats were completely incapable of realizing on their own the process of fighting for even the most innocuous reforms with revolutionary means i e strikes pickets and demonstrations would build the struggle for socialist revolution one of the most important democratic demands to fight for was the withdrawal of the spanish imperialism from the colony of morocco and support the right of the catalans and basques to self determination the republican socialist coalition under the republic of 1931 1933 although passing modest reforms through the cortes did not fight the industrialists and landowners and their right wing political backers for the realization of these reforms within society the gradualist and reformist posture of the psoe and the ugt bureaucracy was adopted to preserve their institutional power at all costs within capitalism the socialists and the ugt bureaucracy gave their republican partners a left wing cover to dampen workers struggle and endorsed the suppression of strikes consistently labeling them as untimely and provoking a backlash from the right this demoralized the hopes of the worker and peasant masses who had hopes in the newly established democracy wiping away centuries of oppression and exploitation and contributed to their radicalization to the left likewise the cnt s general rejection of politics and the fight for political power of the working class and peasantry produced a muddled program for revolutionary action and did little to lead the spanish masses in consolidating and strengthening their struggles the anarchists demonstrated much in terms of militancy and leadership in struggles nevertheless their actions were often isolated and led to premature insurrections with the government that provoked significant repression and did little in terms of strengthening their revolutionary forces the lack of political clarity and revolutionary leadership on the part of the socialists and the anarcho syndicalists meant that the masses who were radicalizing and drawing revolutionary conclusions were left without a political home this diffused and demoralized the overall struggle from 1931 and 1933 leading to the rise of the right in the november 1933 elections and ultimately the savage defeat of the asturias insurrection of 1934 the years 1933 to 1935 were aptly referred to as the bienio negro the black biennial during the reign of the right in spain from 1934 to 1935 a left wing within the psoe and ugt at the leadership and rank and file level became more vocal having witnessed the rise of fascism internationally caballero the most prominent spokesman of this tendency within the psoe declared the 2nd international was dead and a bolshevik style party needed to be formed even though caballero did nothing to build a revolutionary party and bring about workers revolution in spain he along with the cnt did not support the alianzas obreras the socialist youth was ready to fight for political power the left in spain with the absence of a mass revolutionary working class party remained incredibly divided and weak this was already apparent with the failure of the asturian uprising when the psoe ugt and cnt forces throughout spain did not wage a struggle in solidarity with the miners even though an incredible level of solidarity existed between the cnt ugt and pce affiliated unions within asturias the radical communist left was too small to influence the larger groupings of socialists and anarchists the communist party had grown the most of all radical groups it hardly had a party history before being subjected to the dictates of the comintern and following a policy of sectarianism exemplified in the third period 1928 1934 then performing an about face the pce advocated a policy of accommodation to liberalism in the form of the popular front beginning in 1935 the politically best and clearest grouping the trotskyist ice was also the smallest consequently it was unable to wrest political influence from the anarchist cnt and socialist psoe during these years the lack of a revolutionary party during the pre civil war period of 1931 1935 shaped the policy of the civil war to come the left plagued with divisions yearned for unity the desire for unity led to an increase in the popularity of the communist party message and the formation of the popular front government in february of 1936 however this broad umbrella of political groups representing all social class interests and political viewpoints to the left of fascism would prove to be a diffuse political force during the coming revolution and civil war in july of 1936 indeed the civil war and revolution formed an indissoluble whole the civil war was merely the military expression of a social revolution taking place throughout spain s countryside and cities it embodied fascist counter revolution and workers and peasants social revolution without workers revolution the civil war could not be won in a way beneficial to the oppressed and exploited in other words the working class would not be able to dictate the terms of the new society following the civil war without civil war workers would have lost the revolution and thus the battle to overturn capitalism and capitalism s last card fascism

president donald trump s trade war with china is based on two basic and complementary assumptions the u s economy is strong and perhaps more importantly stronger than the chinese economy last summer when the war began heating up both assumptions were certainly true the american economy was booming while china s was slowing hence the u s was in a better position to withstand any pain in a tariff war of attrition but the first of those assumptions at least is beginning to falter as signs grow of economic weakness in the u s as an economist who conducts research in international trade i believe that a weaker u s economy would likely affect trump s ability to engage in a prolonged trade war with china no matter how much he might want to signs of weakness the u s economy has been expanding for a decade now and no economy can continue to grow indefinitely the may jobs report was the latest indicator that the party may be coming to an end the report showed that the u s economy added only 75 000 jobs that month a significantly lower number than the 224 000 jobs added in april even though the unemployment rate stayed at the extremely low figure of 3 6 worryingly there was virtually no wage growth in addition another key metric the so called ism manufacturing index fell to its lowest level in trump s presidency in may and while gdp growth has remained fairly robust there have been other harbingers of underlying weakness in recent months including a bond market signal that a recession may be on the horizon and a broad measure of the health of the u s economy that recorded its slowest increase in more than two years putting this all together it suggests a key premise behind trump s trade war with china may not hold up for much longer trade war s role one of the reasons to blame for economic sluggishness is the trade war itself and specifically trump s use of tariffs to prosecute it contrary to what he has said in the past elementary trade theory shows that tariffs not only hurt the intended target but the tariff imposing nation as well this fundamental theoretical prediction is now being borne out in practice for instance a recent and ongoing study by a group of economists shows that the higher prices resulting from trump s tariffs on china have been paid largely by u s retailers and some of them may soon be passed on to consumers a separate study focused on washing machines found that tariffs resulted in an average 12 increase in the price of the appliance whether it was imported or made domestically then there s the impact of the retaliatory tariffs studies show that the u s coal crude oil and agricultural sectors have all been detrimentally affected by chinese tariffs imposed in response in addition there is reason to believe that the slowdown in american job growth is being felt most acutely in the sectors that are most susceptible to trade tensions such as manufacturing construction mining and logging in other words if the deleterious impacts of trump s trade war with china continue to be felt in an economy that is weakening it is certainly likely that there will be much greater opposition to these tariffs from industry groups and lawmakers these possibilities cast serious doubt on trump s ability to continue let alone achieve the concessions he might need to win a protracted trade war with china fed to the rescue trump may end up having an unexpected ally in the federal reserve however evidence of weakness has already ended the u s central bank s policy of monetary tightening by raising interest rates the latest data will no doubt put considerable pressure on the fed to actually cut rates to avoid a more sustained slowdown if it does then the fed driven stimulation will mitigate some of the pain felt by americans as a result of trump s trade war with china and continue to prosecute his trade war high stakes that being said it is still too early to say definitively that the u s economy is cooling and given trump s unpredictability it s impossible to forecast what may happen no matter what at least for now the president appears to have no intention of backing down but for me a weakening economy adds to the reasons why this trade war is not only futile but harmful for one thing i believe tariffs alone cannot address the underlying structural problems that afflict u s china trade and let s not forget that the trade war has global repercussions the organization for economic cooperation and development recently warned that an escalation of this trade war as trump has repeatedly threatened will damage the rest of the world trimming 0 7 off global growth by 2021 that may not sound like much but this trimming amounts to a whopping us 600 billion in lost economic activity it s a reminder that the stakes of this war are enormous amitrajeet a batabyal arthur j gosnell professor of economics rochester institute of technology this article is republished from the conversation under a creative commons

hedging your way to success during an economic downturn revix team follow published in revix roundup 7 min read jun 24 2019 listen share in 2018 the south african gdp grew by 0 8 in april 2019 the imf lowered its original gdp growth from 1 4 to 1 2 how do you plan for your future with a declining economy one investment tactic that many south africans prefer to investing in south african businesses is to take advantage of hedging their rands by purchasing foreign currencies one of many reasons for this is the decline in value of the rand over the last ten years the rand has decreased in value by approximately 67 whereas the dollar has only decreased by around 3 in value in january 2010 telkom shares cost r3 500 00 share and on 14 june 2019 the closing price was r9 523 00 share so if you purchased one share in 2010 and sold it this year you would have made an approximate profit of r6 023 00 however by factoring in the 67 decline in the value of the rand that r9 523 00 is worth the same as what r3 142 59 was in 2010 at first glance you were about to make a tidy profit but after considering the actual value of the rand and inflation a ten year investment in a company trading in south africa might lose you money this trend runs across the board in south africa with the gdp declining each quarter and nationally owned services continually needing bailouts and delivering short of even the lowest of expectations source south african market insights the contraction in the first quarter of 2019 where south africa s gdp declined by the most since 2009 is said to be caused mainly by eskom s power cuts which severely affected manufacturing and mining manufacturing declined 8 8 after a 4 5 growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 with seven of the ten manufacturing divisions reporting negative growth the largest decreases were petroleum chemical products rubber and plastics motor vehicles paper publishing and printing while paper publishing and printing s decline might be linked to other sources such as the increase of mobile phone use and access the other sectors are indicative of the start of a further economic decline mining also declined by 10 8 after falling 3 8 in the fourth quarter of 2018 if you compare the zar to usd over the past ten years investing in the dollar in 2010 would get you close to double your money if you sold it for zar today but what happens when those countries start to show signs of instability instability is a relative term a trader might consider a 5 variance in price in a 24 hour period as unstable and a reason to make a trade and a long term investor might look at that same 5 variation and deem it too unstable to invest or vice versa but this approach is perhaps better suited to stocks than foreign currencies when you approach currency hedging you need to consider the whole country s economy as well as the current political climate the usa might be a historically sound investment however with an unpredictable president trump years of unprecedented money printing low interest rates and the china usa trade tensions at an all time high there is a lot of uncertainty the same can be said for the current state of the uk economy as investors are unsure of how brexit might affect the country and its trade partners the problem with hedging into foreign currencies is that currencies are a form of fiat money as opposed to hard money like a currency backed by gold or silver the price of fiat money is indirectly determined by a central authority the central bank who is able to increase and decrease the money supply remember price is found when supply equals demand so if there s more money supplied without comparative demand the price of a currency should go down in relative terms the price of money is also affected by the overall economic performance of the country it s financial stability and in particular confidence in its government if a government made a decision that made it less attractive to investors the price of the currency relative to another currency would likely drop hard money however would not be affected because of its 1 1 backing by the commodity in question south africa has felt the effects of multiple governments who are either unwilling or unable to make sensible decisions that build an environment in which an economy can thrive choosing instead to print and pump money into state owned enterprises that consistently underperform this has caused the next domino to fall where industry is no longer able to compete on the global stage because of productivity and output decreases due to badly run businesses like eskom source global competitiveness index south africa has fallen 5 places in the world economic forum s global competitiveness report 2018 it s interesting that south africa has the 35th largest market size yet sectors like manufacturing are declining and ict information communications technology is placed at 85th globally this could mean that even though manufacturing is declining usually a sign of a country moving from blue to white collar work the ict adoption is still very low this seems to be a clear indication that the country needs to continue down the path of education and investing in semi skilled labour until it is able to generate more white collar work this however doesn t seem to be possible due to inadequate planning and delivery from parastatal organisations unable to supply water and power affecting manufacturing mining and general business so what do we do when governments fail to provide the best possible conditions for their currency or businesses and investment becomes too risky we hedge with cryptocurrencies unlike fiat currencies that are controlled by a central authority like the south african reserve bank cryptocurrencies are decentralised this means that the responsibility of maintaining the network and the flow of cryptocurrency is left up to the network itself as opposed to a central authority the implication of this is essentially that there is no single point of control which could choose to include or exclude transactions the amount of currency produced or decide who can and can t spend money resulting in a truly open and free market that is highly resistant to attack and manipulation what that means is that by distributing the ledger of all of the transactions that have ever occurred on a blockchain to thousands of nodes computers and requiring that they all have the same copy of transactions a single person or group could not make any changes to the blockchain as they would need 51 of the network to agree with them to put this into perspective it would cost around 842 838 00 usd per hour to attack the bitcoin network and it would need to maintain control of the majority of the network indefinitely which makes an attack like this extremely unprofitable reasonably decentralised cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin 100 countries 10 602 nodes ethereum 69 countries 8 282 nodes and monero 61 countries 1 585 nodes are not controlled by a single person group or organisation they are independent in every way and are not limited by the viewpoint of a single country or region due to the distribution of the network this means that you have a network that has to make decisions not just for a small group of people like a government might do but instead make decisions that are satisfactory on a global scale that isn t to say that there aren t disagreements but because the network requires consensus the majority decision will always win and since node operators or miners are financially incentivised to ensure that the network performs well the decision making tends to be one focused on not disrupting the growth or integrity of the network most cryptocurrencies are also disinflationary there are exceptions meaning that they are designed to increase in value because they become progressively more scarce as time passes this is the exact opposite of fiat produced by governments who tend to devalue currencies by introducing plans like quantitative easing or printing money quantitative easing has helped economies in north america and europe however for an emerging economy like south africa it could be devastating as is the case in venezuela the case for hedging into cryptocurrency is best made by the simple graph above in the past 10 years the dollar has lost 3 of its value the rand has lost 67 of its value and bitcoin has increased in value by 388 801 revix gives users the ability to hedge their rands with our crypto bundles

remarks by president trump in press conference osaka japan june 29 2019 imperial hotel osaka osaka japan 3 51 p m jst the president thank you thank you very much appreciate it it s been a really great period of time i ll be leaving now as you know for south korea some of you will be coming with us i understand that we may be meeting with chairman king kim and we ll find out we spoke with the people kim jong un was very receptive he responded and so we ll see because tomorrow we re going to the dmz i said while i m there i ll shake his hand we get along there s been no nuclear tests there s been no long range ballistic tests gave us back our hostages which was great and a lot of good things are happening over there so i let him know we ll be there and we ll see i mean i don t i can t tell you exactly but they did respond very favorably i want to thank everyone for being here today that s a lot of press a lot of press is outside too they re less happy than you are but the g20 summit has been fantastic prime minister abe has done an incredible job as he always does and he hosted it very beautifully you know where it s going to be next year i think do most of you know where it s going to be next year it s going to be in a very great part of the world and we ll be announcing exactly what s happening but this was a really good summit and really well done so professionally done this marks my third visit to japan as president melania and i are we ve just left tokyo a short while ago as you know a very short while ago where we were the first state guests to their majesties the emperor and empress of japan and that was thrilling first time in 202 years that an event like that took place so that was quite exciting and i m thrilled to be back i always like being back in japan we ve had a great relationship we ve never been closer to japan than we are right now over the past two days leaders from the world s largest economies have convened here at osaka which is a tremendous city you fly over and you say does it ever stop it s big it s beautiful it s clean and it s really a the job they do with industrial manufacturing and lots of other things is really incredible we had a very productive conversation with a number of the leaders not only nations but business leaders here in japan and together we put together a lot of ideas and a lot of challenges for the future that we ll be able to meet and get things going very well our meetings also touched on women s economic empowerment you probably saw that ivanka trump was she s done a fantastic job and also a fantastic job in getting jobs for a lot of people within our country almost 10 million people the importance of resilient and secure infrastructure we discussed that at great length the need to uphold the rule of law and the critical importance of achieving a future for international trade that works all of the time for all of the people in addition to the working sessions we had a lot of working sessions many of you were at the working sessions i had tremendous bilateral meetings with many of the heads of state and just some of them are australia japan india germany russia brazil saudi arabia china turkey uk and i met with mexico also with the representatives of mexico who have done an incredible job they ve really stepped up to the plate i appreciate it and i want to thank them they have 6 000 troops at their southern border by guatemala and it s very hard to come in now and they have they just ordered really it was somewhat of a surprise 16 000 troops at our southern border their immigration laws are very strong ours are a disaster ours are a disgrace to our country we have loopholes and asylum that we could fix the asylum very quickly we could get rid of and fix the loopholes but we could get rid of the loopholes and we would have absolutely no problem at the border but if you watch the debates if you call them debates or whatever they were they don t really i think they want open borders i guess even though four years ago they wanted walls to be built i heard we just had another judge rule against us on a section of wall and that s a disgrace we ll appeal it right away ninth circuit as usual they go right into that ninth circuit the good news i put a lot of judges in and a number of them are in the ninth circuit now and it s very unfair it s very unfair when a judge can do what they do where a judge in a certain area can close down a country but we also had a big victory last week with the wall we had a judge in d c who gave us a very big victory so we re building a lot of wall but we had a ruling just yesterday late from a judge in the ninth circuit again so we re immediately appealing it and we think we ll win the appeal there was no reason that that should ve happened and a lot of wall is being built and again mexico is doing a real job our border patrol they ve done incredible work and ice is they re just special people law enforcement generally is just is special so with that i just want to say that these meetings have been great the one that i guess most people are interested in is china we had a great meeting president xi and we ve known each for as long as i m president and many of you were at the event in china a year ago when i ve never seen anything like it the it was beautiful we talked about it we dinner last night president xi and a number of us and it was something really incredible in beijing the red carpet was rolled out for all of us for this country for our country and we had a great meeting and we will be continuing to negotiate and i promised that for at least the time being we re not going to be lifting tariffs on china we won t be adding an additional tremendous amount of we have i guess 350 billion left which could be taxed or it could be tariffed and we re not doing that we re going to work with china on where we left off to see if we can make a deal china is going to start they re going to be consulting with us and they re going to start spending money even during the negotiation to our farmers our great farmers in the midwest i call them the great patriots because that s what they are they re patriots and china is going to be buying a tremendous amount of food and agricultural product and they re going to start that very soon almost immediately we re going to give them lists of things that we d like them to buy our farmers are going to be a tremendous beneficiary you know if you look at farmers for 15 years before i came into the into this position farms and farmers have had a hard time if you look at that graph it was it was down fairly steeply down and a lot of it was because nafta was a terrible deal and we have i spoke with nancy pelosi last night about the usmca that s mexico and canada and it s now before them and they ll have to make a decision but that s one that the farmers love the manufacturers love the unions love it s a great deal for this country and nafta was i think one of the worst trade deals ever made maybe the wto was worse the wto from the time that happened in 95 from the time that happened china became like a rocket ship it was pretty much flat lined and then all of a sudden they joined the wto and they became they went i mean they went through the roof and very much to our liability it s we lost tremendous amounts of money over the from that time i mean we just lost tremendous amounts it was a terrible deal the wto world trade and if you look at nafta nafta has been a disaster for our country the usmca is a great deal for our country i think canada is happy but they re not happy like we re happy but they re very happy it s a good deal for canada a good deal for mexico they want it mexico just approved it in full canada is waiting for us to approve it i was with the prime minister just left him a little while ago and they re thrilled with the deal and we re thrilled everybody wants it and hopefully it will be a bipartisan deal i view that i told that to nancy pelosi i said view this as a bipartisan deal because a lot of the democrats want it especially i would say the farmers but really the industrial areas also the unions we ve got things on wages and we ve got things on the environment that few people have ever been able to get into an agreement and it s a very big deal it s a very big deal and it s a great deal tremendous support so they have to put it up for a vote and i think you ll get a great vote in the house and you ll get a great vote in the senate and you ll have a tremendous trade deal between the united states and canada and mexico and it s going to be something very special so we spend a lot of time with a lot of countries we do business with a lot of them australia is an example with japan we re negotiating with them because they send us millions of cars and we send them wheat doesn t work but what happens is japan is you probably saw some of the things they re doing but they re opening up many car companies and factories and plants throughout our country especially in michigan we have a lot of activity in ohio beyond japan activity we have a lot of activity now where companies are coming back to our country we re the hot show we re the hottest show in town we re the hottest show in the world right now our economy is the best one thing that every leader virtually every leader that i dealt with said is that congratulations it s incredible what s happened to the american economy we re the best economy in the world and it s something and it started from election day i put it out yesterday because we took a tremendous boost from the day after i got elected the stock market went crazy from that point until essentially now i think we hit in certain of the markets we hit the all time high again for many many times i can t tell you what it was but many many times we broke the record and we re you know our stock market is great our jobs are great we have the best job numbers essentially we ve ever had in some categories definitely we ve ever had the minimum you could say is in 51 years but it s really more than that and now it s going to be more than that african american asian american you saw that hispanic american the best numbers in history the history of our country we have the lowest unemployment numbers best numbers and many others too blue collar workers are doing fantastic they re the biggest beneficiary of the tax cuts the blue collar blue collar you know we talk about for the rich it s really for everybody and it s also for big companies where they re moving here and remember who owns the stocks because the people that own the stock it s not the big companies it s the people with 401 k s whose numbers are at 60 percent and 70 percent and 42 percent and all different numbers that are tremendously high where the other spouse thinks that the spouse that s investing in the 401 k is a super genius but those 401 k s are very high and if you listen to what i ve been listening to and we re not going to devote anytime to it but with that kind of an attitude their 401 k s are going to crash and the market would crash because with what they want to do you would crash the market and the amount of wealth that would be lost would be incredible but i d rather wait until later in the campaign to say that because to be honest with you i want them to go and take these policies and bring them up i don t want them to change them anytime soon let them go have a good time but it s been very interesting to watch what s happening actually i found it very interesting so with that we ll take a few questions and then i m heading out to south korea and i may or may not see kim jong un but we ll be heading out to south korea spend about a day and a half there with president moon who is a really good guy he was here too as you know i saw him i met with him also and we ll see what happens please john q mr president thank you so much for joining us here the president yes q we all appreciate it it s always good to have a chance to ask questions of you directly can you tell us a little more about how this china deal may work going forward because chinese officials have told fox news that they will not make any concessions until all of the tariffs have been lifted they also want relief on huawei they want it taken off the black list they might want you to stop pursuing extradition of meng wanzhou can you tell us how you see all of this unfolding and if you do meet kim jong un at the dmz tomorrow would you step across the border into north korea the president sure i would i would i d feel very comfortable doing that i would have no problem with respect to china basically we agreed today that we were going to continue the negotiation which i ended a while back and we re going to continue the negotiation we agreed that i would not be putting tariffs on the 325 billion that i would have the ability to put on if i wanted that where you know we re fairly advanced depending where you want to look at and where you want to start pretty advanced we discussed we did discuss numerous other things we mentioned huawei i said we ll have to save that until the very end we ll have to see one of the things i will allow however is a lot of people are surprised we send and we sell to huawei a tremendous amount of product that goes into the various things that they make and i said that that s okay that we will keep selling that product these are american companies john that make product and that s very complex by the way highly scientific and in some cases we re the ones that do it and we re the only ones that do it we re the only ones with the technology what we ve done in silicon valley is incredible actually and nobody has been able to compete with it and i ve agreed and pretty easily i ve agreed to allow them to continue to sell that product so american companies will continue and they were having a problem the companies were not exactly happy that they couldn t sell because they had nothing to do with whatever was potentially happening with respect to huawei so i did do that we talked about education and students somebody was saying it was harder for a chinese students to come in and that s something that if it were it somebody viewed it that way i don t we want to have chinese students come and use our great schools our great universities they ve been great students and tremendous assets but we did discuss it it was brought up as a point and i said that will be just like anybody else just like any other nation and we re actually going to a point where you know we re looking that if you graduate from a college because our great companies we talk about silicon valley and other places we have a problem in this in our country that you graduate number one in your class from the best school in the country and they say you have to leave we can t keep them and we re going to make it we re going to call it the smart person s waiver but we re going to make it so that they can not only stay but maybe they have access to green cards we want to keep these people here we have to keep yeah go ahead john q but are you concerned that as they did before china took it most of the way down the road and then say the president sure q we re going to pull back inaudible the president that could happen but we re holding on tariffs and they re going to buy farm product so you know so but that could happen john this doesn t mean there s going to be a deal but they would like to make a deal i can tell you that and if we could make a deal it would be a very historic event you know we ve never really had a deal with china we have we ve had tremendous deficits tremendous amounts of money was put into china 500 billion a year and i mean you know not just surplus and deficit i m talking about real hard cash and it should have never ever been allowed to have happened for all of our presidents over the last number of years go ahead please q yes mr president steve herman from the voice of america after your discussions with prime minister abe here are you still thinking about withdrawing from the u s japan security treaty and what did the prime minister say to you about that the president no i m not thinking about that at all i m just saying that it s an unfair agreement and i ve told him that for the last six months i said look if somebody attacks japan we go after them and we are in a battle full force in effect we are locked in a battle and committed to fight for japan if somebody should attack the united states they don t have to do that that s unfair that s the kind of deals we made that s every deal is like that i mean it s almost like we had people that they didn t either care or they were stupid but that s the kind of deals we have that s just typical but i have been i told him i said we re going to have to change it because look nobody is going to attack us i hope but you know should that happen it s far more likely that it could be the other way but should that happen somebody attacks us if we re helping them they re going to have help us and he knows that and he s going to have no problem with that yes please q thank you mr president i actually have a russia question but i wanted to quickly clarify is meng wanzhou s case also going to need to wait until the very end or is it possible the u s would drop the extradition effort the president when what on what q ms meng from huawei the top financial inaudible the president we didn t discuss ms meng we didn t that was not discussed we did discuss huawei but we didn t discuss her situation q okay thank you on russia respectfully it seemed like maybe you didn t really mean it when you said yesterday don t meddle in our elections mr president and then you guys both started laughing the president well i did say it you re to have to take a look at the words i did say it and we had a discussion we had a great actually we had a great discussion president putin and myself i thought it was really a tremendous discussion i think they d like to do trade with the united states and they have great product they have great land they have very rich land and a lot of oil a lot of minerals and the kind of things that we like and i can see trade going out with russia we could do fantastically well we do very little trade with russia which is ridiculous frankly so i could see some very positive things happening yeah but as per your question though i did say it and i did discuss it a little bit after that too yeah please q thank you mr president yesterday former president jimmy carter suggested that your presidency is illegitimate and that you only got the white house with help from russia your reaction to that sir the president russia russia russia isn t it crazy okay jimmy carter look he was a nice man he was a terrible president he s a democrat and it s a typical talking point he s loyal to the democrats and i guess you should be but as everybody now understands i won not because of russia not because of anybody but myself i went out i campaigned better smarter harder than hillary clinton i went to wisconsin i went to michigan the night of the vote i had 32 000 people at 1 o clock in the morning on election day i won michigan i won wisconsin i won pennsylvania i won states that traditionally haven t been won by a republican for many years haven t been won by a republican and this had nothing to do with anybody but the fact that i worked harder and much smarter than hillary clinton did now i ll say this jimmy carter i was surprised that he would make a statement i saw it it was not a big thing but i saw the statement and it s you know a lot of democrats like to make that statement he s been trashed within his own party he s been badly trashed i felt badly for him because if you look over the years his party has virtually he s like the forgotten president and i understand why they say that he was not a good president look at what happened with iran that was a disaster what iran did to him they tied him up in knots the reason ronald reagan probably because president so you know it s a democrat talking point yeah please go ahead jim q yes mr president if i could follow up on the question about your comments with vladimir putin the president sure q about russia meddling you did seem to be joking there with the russian president are we taking that to be wrong the president no q and what is it with your coziness with some of these dictators and autocrats at these summits with mohammad bin salman the crown prince of saudi arabia when you were asked about the case of jamal khashoggi you did not respond to that question in front of the saudi crown prince the president i don t know that anybody asked me q were you afraid of offending him on that subject the president no not at all i don t really care about offending people i sort of thought you d know that laughter q well you passed up an opportunity there the president and by the way congratulations i understand your book is it doing well q it s doing very well mr president the president really q i ll get you an autographed copy the president good send it i want to see it q yes sir yeah the president send me a copy no i get along with everybody except you people actually i get along with a lot of people i have a tremendous relationship with president xi nobody else would have the deal that we have we re getting tens of billions of dollars from china coming in a lot of things are happening and despite that we re moving along towards something that could be very historic but i get along with president putin i get along with mohammad from saudi arabia look i spoke to saudi arabia when the oil prices a year ago were getting very high and i wasn t so nice and i said you got to get some more oil into the system because what s happening is no good and they did and the people are driving at you know very low numbers right now you haven t seen in the old days you d have spikes where the gasoline went to 5 and more and it wasn t so good but i also get along with people that would be perceived as being very nice you have a lot of very nice leaders of countries i was with q but mr president isn t the president i was with wait a minute i was with prime minister may today i was with so many you take a look new head of australia look at japan abe prime minister abe is a fine they re all fine as far as i m concerned some are stronger than others some are tougher than others and a lot of people q mr president but if i may though mr president on the case of jamal khashoggi you have a lot of journalists in this room who object to what appears to be the saudi government s complicity and perhaps orchestration of the assassination and dismembering of a journalist the president yeah q and when you were given the opportunity to call mohammad bin salman out on that you did not do it did you do it privately and do you agree that it is despicable for a government to kill a journalist in that fashion the president yes i do i think it s horrible or anybody else by the way q yeah the president but i think it s horrible and if you look and look into saudi arabia and you see what s happening 13 people or so have been prosecuted others are being prosecuted they ve taken it very very seriously and they will continue to and i ve let everybody know i m not i m very unhappy about that whole event but if you look at what s going on and right now within saudi arabia they re prosecuting additional people there s a lot of things happening at the same time i will also say and nobody said nobody so far has pointed directly a finger at the future king of saudi arabia i will say i spoke to his father jim i spoke to his father at great length they ve been a terrific ally they re creating millions of jobs in this country they re ordering equipment not only military equipment but 400 billion worth of and actually even more than that over a period time worth of different things and with that being said i m extremely angry and unhappy about a thing like that taking place but as of this moment more than 13 people are being prosecuted and i hear the number is going to be going up but it s a good question yes please q thank you mr president i m ching yi chan with shanghai media group it s very good to note that you averted the further escalation of trade tension with china and can you share some details of your interaction with president xi this time and also if i may another quick question on north korea do you think it s possible that there will be a third one on one summit with chairman kim the president oh sure q within this year the president oh it might happen tomorrow i mean to be honest we won t call it a summit we ll call it a handshake if it does happen i don t know that it will but it could happen i know i think he d like to do it and i wouldn t mind doing it at all i m going to be i m literally visiting the dmz and so but i will as per your question about president xi he s a brilliant leader he s a brilliant man and you know better than i he s probably considered to be one of the great leaders in 200 years in china and we just have a very he s strong he s tough but he s good we have a very good relationship and i said you know we can t have it where the united states loses this kind of money for the privilege of building up china it has to be a fair deal and he understands that but as he said nobody ever came to us it s true no other president came to him this would ve my presidency could be a lot easier not only for that but for many other reasons it d be a lot easier but i don t want it to be easy it s a point in time i have a chance to do things that nobody else has ever done so we re making a deal with china or we re attempting and if we don t we ll go back into you know we have a tremendous ripe field of tremendous money that would be coming into our country but i have a feeling that over a period of time and again i m not rushed and i told him that i want to get the deal right it s extremely i wouldn t even say complicated but very intricate but in the meantime i think our farmers are going to end up being the great beneficiary and what i did with the farmers because they did lose a certain amount of money i went to sonny perdue who is our secretary of agriculture i said sonny how much money in the best year did china spend on our farms in our farms buying he said the best year about 16 billion i said okay well we re taking in much more than that now every year in tariffs and i took 16 billion out of those tariffs and essentially out of those tariffs and we re distributing it among farmers who have been hurt because they have been used as a pawn so that china could get a good deal but in the end the farmers are going to be the biggest beneficiary but i ve made up for the fact that china was you know targeting our farmers because they know the farmers like me and i like them i love them and they sort of love me i guess when you get right down to it and it was 16 billion billion that s a lot of money but i took it out the tariff money essentially and we are in the process of distributing it the farmers could not be happier other than they re unusual i had them around a table many of the farmers and about five weeks ago and they said we don t want money we want just a level playing field i said you re right most groups want money they ll take any way you want to give it to them they ll take the farmers are in a class by themselves in so many ways they don t want subsidies they don t want a handout all they want to do is have a level playing field they re unbelievable people and as i said they re unbelievable patriots jon q thank you mr president first a quick follow up you ve made this very public invitation to kim jong un will it be a bad sign if he doesn t show up the president no of course i thought of that because i know if he didn t everybody is going to say oh he was stood up by chairman kim no i understood that it s very hard to he follows my twitter q he does the president and it s very hard q he follows you on twitter the president i guess so because we got a call very quickly laughter a lot of people follow it but you know they ve contacted us and they d like to see if they can do something and we re not talking about for you know extended just a quick hello and we get along i get along with him and i get along with other people like you know for instance on jim s question it s a fair question but i really have great relationships with everybody i think you know i said a long time ago that maybe i ll be a sleeper on foreign policy and if you look at what s happened on foreign policy now we are working on iran and we ll see what happens i think they d like to make a deal i think they d be very smart to want to make a deal but we re going to see what happens i m okay i have all the time in the world they re doing very poorly they were doing they were very brutal when i first came in eighteen sites of confliction meaning where they were behind but i think on foreign policy if you look at what s happening and the other thing that s happening is we re not being taken for suckers anymore i mean we have countries where we d lose on defending them because we defend a tremendous percentage of the world and they don t pay us for it and then on top of it we lose money with that same country on trade and it s all changing and they understand it s changing and they expect it to change they can t believe honestly like i d ask prime minister abe i said how did this happen where you send us billions and billions of dollars worth of cars and other things and we send you practically nothing he said nobody ever complained same thing with china i said you know you send a car to us we charge you essentially nothing it s 2 5 percent but basically you don t have to there are ways around that so you send a car to us and you pay nothing we send a car to you made in the united states and we have to pay 45 percent tariff how did that happen he said we just kept lifting it lifting it lifting it i mean they re being honest with me we just kept lifting it and nobody called but i call i call go ahead jon q and i want to ask you about the debate you clearly saw at least some of the democratic debate the president yeah q i m sure you saw the exchange between joe biden and kamala harris the president i did q on the issue of federal busing federally mandated busing biden thought that was a bad policy he tried to stop it kamala harris said it was an important part of desegregation including in her own experience where do you stand on that issue of federally mandated busing the president well first of all before i get into that i thought that she was given too much credit he didn t do well certainly and maybe the facts weren t necessarily on his side i think she was given too much credit for what she did it wasn t that outstanding and i think probably he was hit harder than he should ve been hit biden i thought he was hit actually harder and as far as that i will tell you in about four weeks because we re coming out with certain policy that s going to be very interesting and very surprising i think to a lot of people jennifer do you have a question q but do you think kamala harris would be a tough opponent for you given what you saw in that debate the president you never know who s going to be tough you never know one that you think is going to be tough turns out to be not much and sometimes you think one and i ve seen it because look i had 17 we had actually a total of 18 a lot of people think 17 governor of virginia remember add the governor of virginia wasn t there long previous governor but of the 18 you know many were all their lives they wanted to be politicians i never thought about being a politician until about two days before i decided to run a little before that but not too much before and they you know you looked at some of them they re very talented you look at their résumés it s like great and sometimes the ones that i thought would be the toughest were not the toughest at all i mean i could write a book i should write a book but some of the people that i did in the republican because we had sort of a similar thing we had 18 instead of i guess they have 24 or 25 but some of the ones that i thought would be absolutely absolutely without question the toughest turned out i didn t they were tough at all others that a lot of people said weren t tough they were tough i think she was given far too much credit for what she did that was so out of the can what she said that thing was right out of a box and i thought that he didn t respond great i wouldn t say it was this was not winston churchill we re dealing with okay but it wasn t it wasn t i don t think nearly as bad as they portended it to be jennifer go ahead q thank you mr president the president thank you q could i clarify your negotiations and what you agreed to with china on huawei the president sure q did you agree that huawei can sell to the u s or that u s companies can sell to huawei the president u s companies can sell their equipment to huawei i m talking about equipment where there is no great national emergency problem with it but the u s companies can sell their equipment so we have a lot of the great companies in silicon valley and based in different parts of the country that make extremely complex equipment we re letting them sell to huawei q and then on turkey sir will turkey face sanctions if it goes ahead with the s 400 purchases the president okay so turkey is an interesting case because there s another one jim that i get along with very well and he s a tough cookie okay right president erdogan he s tough but i get along with him and maybe that s a bad thing but i think it s a really good thing because frankly he wanted to wipe out he has a big problem with the kurds as everyone knows and he had a 65 000 man army at the border and he was going to wipe out the kurds who helped us with isis we took out the caliphate we have 100 percent of the caliphate and i called him and i asked him not to do it they are i guess natural enemies of his or turkey s and he hasn t done it they were lined up to go out and wipe out the people that we just defeated the isis caliphate with and i said you can t do that you can t do it and he didn t do it so i have a relationship but let me tell you so he goes out during the obama administration he wants to buy our patriot missile right they wouldn t sell it to him he wants to buy even though he s a member of nato and in theory he could be an ally if he respected the president and he s got a big army and he s you know they re fighters turkey is big fighters and we re working on idlib province together because he doesn t want to see 3 million people killed and neither do i in syria but and i mentioned that that was another thing i mentioned folks to president putin i said please take it easy with idlib because you know they ve been encircling that i think if i didn t put out a statement six months ago that would ve been catastrophic but they have 30 000 terrorists in idlib province you have 3 million people and you know getting terrorists is okay but you don t want to kill 3 million people or a million people to get the terrorists so anyway so we get along great but what happened with turkey and i will tell you when it s fair and when it s not fair he wanted to buy the patriot missile president obama s group said no he kept wanting to buy it they kept saying no no no couldn t buy it now he needed it for defense he needed it so he then went to russia and he bought the s 400 made a deal to buy it because he couldn t get it they wouldn t allow him to buy it they wouldn t allow it this administration meaning this administration previous to mine would not let him buy it so he goes out he goes to russia and he makes a deal for the s 400 and let s assume it s not nearly as good but he made a deal he paid them money a lot of money put up a lot of money and he bought it as soon as he bought it people went back to him from our country and they said listen we don t want you to use that system because it s not the nato system et cetera et cetera you know all the reasons we don t want you to use that system do us a favor we ll sell you the patriot he said it s too late i already bought it there was nothing he could do he already bought it in the meantime he bought over a hundred f 35s the greatest fighter jet in the world it s stealth you can t see it it s real hard to beat something when you can t see it but he bought over a hundred i think he bought 116 but he bought over a hundred a lot and there s options for more and now he wants delivery he s paid a tremendous amount of money up front to lockheed our company our jobs everything and now they re saying he s using the s 400 system which is incompatible with our system and if you use the s 400 system russia and other people can gain access into the genius of the f 35 but honestly i m all for our country but he got treated very unfairly he was told you can t buy it you can t buy it you know it s the old secret when you can t have something all of a sudden he ends up going and getting something else and then they were they said first they said we ll sell it to you you can have it in four years then they said we ll get it to you immediately but he said i can t do it i bought i ve spent a fortune on buying another system similar system from russia the problem is he already bought the planes and the planes aren t compatible from our standpoint not from the standpoint of compatibility but from our standpoint national security wise so it s a mess it s a mess and honestly it s not really erdoğan s fault so now we have breaking news donald trump loves turkey he loves turkey donald trump is on the side of turkey instead of the united no i m not q you don t seem like you want to go ahead with the president i love our country but i have to tell you president erdoğan who has done he gave me our pastor back pastor brunson nobody else could get him back remember they couldn t get him back president obama he was in jail for 35 years he was going to be in jail forever pastor brunson he was an innocent man i called him and after a very short period of time pastor brunson was standing in the oval office with me and he was back so you know he s been from my standpoint and he s a tough guy okay when you talk about tough he s tough but i get along with him i think he was unfairly treated where you were told you can t have it and then after he bought another system we said we ll sell it to you we ll give it to you right away but he couldn t use it then but by that time he had already bought the plane so it s a complicated deal we re working on it we ll see what we can do q can i ask you one last quick thing on china the president yes go please q so there was a negotiation on huawei welcoming students holding off on tariffs so it sounds like china has agreed to buy more ag but is this a lopsided agreement or what more did china agree to the president no we agreed on china this is actually a good question i did agree to allow our companies you know jobs i like our companies selling things to other people so i allowed that to happen very complex things not easy this is not things that are easy to make very few companies are able to do it but a tremendous amount of money our companies were very upset you know these companies are great companies you know all of them but they weren t exactly happy with it but we re allowing that because that was a national security we re allowing them to sell but we agreed to leave that until the end huawei is a complicated situation we agreed to leave that we re leaving huawei toward the end we re going to see we ll see where we go with the trade agreement yes please q thank you i have a question about the border but i just wanted to follow up quickly on the question about busing do you see it as a viable way of integrating schools does that relate to the policy that you re going to unveil the president well it has been something that they ve done for a long period of time i mean you know there aren t that many ways you re going to get people to schools so this is something that s been done in some cases it s been done with a hammer instead of velvet glove and you know that s part of it but this has been certainly a thing that s been used over the i think if vice president biden had answered the question somewhat differently it would ve been a lot it would ve been a different result because they really did hit him hard on that one so but it is certainly a primary method of getting people to schools q and is it does it relate to the policy that you re going to unveil that you just floated the president it relates to everything we re doing and you ll be hearing about it in over the next couple of months q over the next couple of months okay and i want to ask you about the border it seems like there is officially a week to go until the ice raids begin under that deadline that you imposed the president yeah q given that you have a july 4th recess is it realistic to think that you re going to get a deal to actually reform the asylum laws the president no because we could do it in we could do it you know i say to people i used to say 45 minutes i say 15 but we could do it quickly we could do it in a day we could do it in an hour we could reform asylum very quickly we could get rid of the loopholes very quickly these are horrible loopholes and the reason that mexico is so good because they do have very very tough immigration they don t have the kind of things and the kind of stupidity that we have i mean where somebody touches one foot on our sand and we now have to bring them into a court we then have to register them we then have to catch and release them and they go and they live in our country then they re supposed to come back in three years for a court case and about 2 percent come back as you know i mean you know it just as well as anybody i really think maybe better than most but the fact is they come back but nobody comes back two percent come back it s a horrible system now what we re doing is they come in illegally and we re bringing them out legally but at the request of some you know very good democrats they asked me if i could hold it and i did for a couple of weeks and we have a week left but other than the fact that we did get in a very bipartisan way we got and i appreciate speaker pelosi because she really worked with us it was humanitarian money i mean they didn t have any money and we re running don t forget nobody has ever had this problem before we re running hospitals we re running so many different things for the kids and the kids are brought up because under the laws the kids are used legally used to get other people to come in if you have a child it s much easier to come into our country it s easy anyway but if you have a child it s much easier so we have these kids who have been absolutely abused horribly abused and we could stop that with a minor change in the law it s a terrible thing that they re not doing it so here s what s happening so i said all right let s see if you can give that to us now in the meantime we did we just got it approved last night so we have the 4 5 billion in humanitarian aid right and that s good so we have that but we can have that number go way down if we stop people from coming up for instance if we had walls up and if we had it hard the father and the beautiful daughter who drowned and you know the rio grande is a very tough you know that has moments where it can be very calm and then all of a sudden it becomes totally violent and people get swept away but if they thought it was hard to get in they wouldn t be coming up they wouldn t be coming up and so many lives would be saved so essentially if they would change the laws and i said it would take us an hour but let s give you two weeks at the end of the second week we ll be removing people legally removing in other words q so you re still planning for that deadline that deadline is still in place which is now a week from now the president oh yeah unless we do something pretty miraculous but the democrats it seems to me they want to have open borders and for the life of me i cannot figure that out it s one thing because i want people to come into our country we need them because we have all these companies coming in you know we have foxconn in wisconsin we have so many companies coming in auto companies just today i was with president abe he told me another auto company is going to build a big plant they need people so i m all for that the only problem is that they have to come in through a process they have to come in legally it s also very unfair you have millions of people on line for years trying to get into a country they take tests they study they know a lot about our country they read they do they have to go through a very complicated process and these people have worked hard they ve been on line for seven eight nine years and then somebody walks in and they re you know welcome to the united states it s really honestly it s very unfair but yeah we will be removing large numbers of people people have to understand yes the laws are q in a week the president yeah starting in a week after you know sometime after july 4th q so the deal that was just passed does nothing to make you want to step back from that raid the president well that s different that s humanitarian no that s a different that s humanitarian we needed that just to take care because we re running now hospitals i mean the border patrol these are incredible people they re doing what they you know nobody ever thought they were going to be doing this and people are coming up the reason people are coming up is because we re doing so well as a country in past years we weren t doing well in past years mexico was doing better you know they took 32 percent of our car business they were doing better than we were doing in the past now we re the hot country in the world and people are coming up because they want a piece of that action and the other reason children are coming up is because we had a separation policy okay under president obama we had separation president obama built those cells they were in 2014 they were built they all said oh look how horrible then it turned out that it was built by president obama and i m not blaming anybody i m not blaming him i just say this they had a separation policy right i ended it but when i ended it i put out a statement i think it s going to bring more children up because you re ending it you re saying now the child can stay with the parent so i said ending it is nice in one way but in terms of what we re doing it makes it even tougher but the really bad thing is the cartels and i really think that mexico because you know they did 6 000 now they re doing 16 000 on our border i think that mexico is looking to swamp the cartels and those kind of numbers will do it it would be a great thing what mexico is doing for us is great by the way without the tariffs they wouldn t have done it for us we ve been after we ve been after them for many years to do it but they have really so far it s only a week the numbers are way down and so far a lot of good things have happened yes sir please yes please in the second row q thank you mr president two questions about iran the president would you like me to leave now or here s the thing i can stay we can do this for a long time my only problem is this i don t need stories he stayed up there too long if i stay up there quickly they say why did he not give us more time if i stay up for two hours they ll say he stayed up too long i mean if you promise you re not going to say i say because everybody has got a hand up and if you want i ll go on should i go on or should i not go on what you do you think q go on q at least one more the president okay and you re not going to say he went on too long q at least one more the president because we have time you know i have a flight that actually leaves pretty much when i want it to laughter okay let s go q thank you mr president two questions about iran a week ago you called off a strike because you were concerned it would kill iranians the president disproportionately absolutely q disproportionately did the military leaders provide you with any alternative you know some derelict oil rig that could have been hit to the president no no no q to make a point the president oh i had many alt oh yeah i have i ll bet i have 50 alternatives i have many alternatives yeah i mean you know what you don t know what the sites were you said oil rig you don t know what the sites were but i had many alternatives no no military leaders did a great job when we chose and designated certain areas that we were thinking about i said how many people are going to die i mean i m talking about on the other side that means a lot to me too okay how many people are going to die they said probably about 150 you don t know could be much worse than that could be less too i guess but it could be much more than that because this is heavy stuff going in and we would have been 100 percent we have the greatest military in the world i deal with them all the time these people are incredible people lethal and hopefully we don t have to use it much i mean we ve spent if you look at the numbers 716 billion this year we had planes that were so old that we didn t now we have brand new f 35s we have brand new super hornets and f 18s and i mean the equipment we have is incredible the army now has beautiful new things everything is we have a military that s really great hopefully we don t have to use it very much but no they came in and they said this and i asked them a question and they came back a short time later and they said about 150 people i said that s really disproportionate i don t like it q my second question is that here at the g20 summit what can you tell us has the ball been moved in any particular direction towards easing the tensions with iran in some of the meetings that you ve had the president well i have had a lot of countries come up to me france has come up if you look at president macron good guy he came up to me he said you know i do a lot of business meaning france does a lot of business with iran i would love to go see them it s all right anybody can see them i don t mind talking i think talking is great i m not going to say oh don t talk to them don t talk to them i do think john kerry should not have been talking to them i think that s delaying this process a lot i think he violated the logan act actually but i think john kerry speaking to iran a lot maybe saying things like gee you know if you wait another 15 months maybe trump will lose the election and then you can deal with a person that s a lot easier than trump you ll deal with a stiff that will give you everything you want and that makes it a little tougher for me to make a deal but that s okay yeah please go q mr president during the week you tweeted out your displeasure with the supreme court s decision on census and you suggested you may seek to delay the president yeah i think it s very unfortunate q are you in fact going to try to delay the census the president well we re looking at that legally because they re asking us to do a census and you know the census it was shocking to me i figured it would be you know not expensive to do a census it s billions of dollars you know that right billions billions they go knock on doors of every house in the country and they get everything they re not allowed to ask whether or not somebody is a citizen of the united states how horrible and ridiculous is that so we are looking at that yeah sure q do you know if you have the legal authority to do that the president because it wasn t a real decision that boom this is the way it is it was like now right now it depends on it depends on what happens i guess it was a very strange decision it was a very very sad decision not in terms of voting not in terms of just a very sad because it was so convoluted it was to get to that decision had to be very very hard q well justices said that your guys were playing politics when deciding not to count non citizens the president hey who s really playing politics okay check it out you tell me who s playing politics yeah go ahead please q thanks mr president i think i heard you mention earlier the president you re q geoff earle with daily mail it s been a while i think i heard you mention that with vladimir putin you had said you spoke about election interference privately as well did you give did you speak to him in a sterner tone did you tell him there the president no i just q would be serious consequences the president we talked about it hey we talked about it you know we ve talked about it before you know he denies it totally by the way just to i mean how many times can you get somebody to deny something but he has in the past denied it he s denied it also publicly but we talked about it we talked about a lot of other things i tell you we talked about something that i think is very important and that s putting a cap on what he s buying and we re buying from a nuclear standpoint and other arms control we talked a lot about arms control and i think he d like to see arms control and so would we i think it makes a lot of sense q what was the context in which you the president yeah go ahead q did you raise what was in the mueller report did you sort of articulate to him the president oh the mueller report was a very q that you thought that things inaudible the president good report i mean it was a good report i had 18 people that hated me i had mueller who was totally conflicted and obviously didn t like me we had he was totally conflicted and yet no obstruction no collusion and you know that was good report yes please q thank you mr president the president and you know the democrats want a do over or five they want to get it right they re working to get it right they want a do over or five yes please q edward szall with trunews president trump your administration just unveiled the economic portion of the deal of the century my question to you is why were no palestinians members of the white house peace plan committee the president well they are a very important part of it but they don t really have to be we re just getting started we have and as you know we have a very good david friedman a great gentleman one of the most successful lawyers in new york who loves israel david friedman jason greenblatt who worked for me and my company great great lawyer great talent jared kushner and with me being president if you don t get that deal done it will never happen we ll have to see what happens but i think the palestinians basically i m not sure i know they want to make a deal but they want to be a little bit cute and that s okay i fully understand where they re coming from as you know i ve ended the money to that was we were paying them 550 million a year and i ended that money because a year ago i heard they were saying nasty things i said wait a minute we re trying to make a deal we re trying to help them and they re saying these nasty things we re not going to pay now if a deal is made we would go back on a humanitarian basis not so different from the border because you see the problems and what s going on it s terrible but i think we have a very good chance of making a deal and a lot of people think that s probably the toughest deal of all and it may very well be the toughest deal of all a lot of people think it can t be made i mean over the years a lot of people would say that s a deal that can t be made no matter what but you know hey i like to we re going to try but i really believe that i went to other negotiators from past years for many many years they ve been trying to make this deal and i said did you ever take the money away because they were always very hostile and they said no we wouldn t do that that s inappropriate why is it inappropriate i mean they re saying bad things why is it inappropriate and what i ve done is said look as long if you re not negotiating and if you don t want to make peace we re not going to pay you so let s see what happens i think they want to make a deal and i ve had a very good relationship with some of their leaders and obviously i ve had a good relationship with israel now the transaction was thrown up in the air a little bit because of what happened with bibi netanyahu s election they thought he won and then all of a sudden they couldn t put together the coalition and now they re back to campaigning again so that was something that came up that who would have expected that maybe something will happen faster but you know that s going to be going on for about three months there s a good chance we could there s a chance i don t want to even say good chance on that one because people say it s the hardest deal i ve heard when i was young i d say what do you think of this they d say oh that s tougher than israel and the palestinians making a deal they used to use that as like the metaphor they used to use that as the excuse for a deal that was very tough to make so it s probably about the toughest deal to make i actually think that there s a good chance yes sir please go ahead yeah white shirt no the gentleman behind you yeah okay go ahead we ll get to you q thank you the president go ahead that s the man i m looking at q demetri sevastopulo financial times can i just ask first one clarification the president sure q are you saying you re taking huawei off the commerce department entity list the president no not at all no no we re going to be talking about huawei but we are going to be supplying equipment from our companies our companies make billions and billions of dollars worth of equipment but we are not discussing huawei with president xi yet i want to see before we start getting into that i want to see where we end up we have to we have a national security problem which to me is paramount very important q but are you taking huawei off the commerce department entity list the president we re talking about that we have a meeting on that tomorrow or tuesday q and my question is you talk a lot about the economic and the trade practices of china and you re very critical you don t talk so much about the national security concerns about china the president well that s not q what do you worry about china inaudible the president it goes without i think that goes without saying i mean look what i ve done look what who s done what i ve done i took zte off if you remember i was the one i did that that was a personal deal and then president xi called me and he asked me for a personal favor which i considered to be very important he s a leader of a major country and it was very important to him having to do with where the employees are located and his relationship to that area and it was 85 000 employees and they were almost out of business and he agreed to pay 1 2 billion penalty and some other things including a board change and including some management changes et cetera zte which is a you know much smaller than huawei but it s very big and they paid us a billion two 1 2 billion i mean part of the problem is then the democrats go out and say if i got 200 trillion they d say this was terrible what a terrible deal because that s the way politics is it s sort of sad but you know we got 1 2 billion and we closed it we opened it and we had certain changes made as you know they made changes to the board they changed the board they made management changes and they paid a lot of money and they also have to buy american product buying american product is very important to me it s a big it s a big thing q can i just ask you to clarify the president yeah go ahead blue blue shirt q stefan niemann with ard the president are we going to continue onward q yeah the president yes q yes the president does anybody say no huh q thank you stefan niemann with ard german television one question the president we just left angela q i know the president she s another friend of mine people don t think so q and you called her a fantastic woman the president we have a great relationship i hope you know that q yes we will not forget that the president we spent a lot of time together too q you praised this g20 summit as extremely successful yet it was a g19 against one summit if we look at climate change why is it that you still think ignoring the dangers of climate change is in the interest of the american inaudible the president i don t ignore it so we have the best numbers that we ve ever had recently and i m not looking to put our companies out of business i m not looking to create a standard that is so high that we re going to lose 20 25 percent of our production i m not willing to do that we have the cleanest water we ve ever had we have the cleanest air you saw the reports come out recently we have the cleanest air we ve ever had but i m not willing to sacrifice the tremendous power of what we ve built up over a long period of time and what i ve enhanced and revived i m not i m just not willing to do that and they understand where i stand and you know i m not necessarily sure i agree i can tell you i m not sure that i agree with certain countries what they re doing because i think they re losing a lot of the power of what they can do with factories and with and i m not talking about political power although that comes with it i m talking about the powering of a plant it doesn t always work with a windmill when the wind goes off the plant isn t working it doesn t always work with solar because solar is just not strong enough and a lot of them want to go to wind which has caused a lot of problems and you know the problem with wind is in the united states we re subsidizing these wind towers all over the place because wind doesn t work for the most part doesn t work without subsidy and i don t want to be subsidizing things that don t have to be subsidized the united states is paying tremendous amounts of money on subsidies for wind i don t like it i don t like it i don t want to do that we ll take a few more go ahead go ahead q thank you sir two questions on iran please the president one q one question on iran laughter okay well iran the president pick the better one please q will do sir iran says that it will be on the verge of violating the threshold for uranium enrichment in the jcpoa as soon as potentially next week what will be your response when that happens the president you ll see q okay can i have a follow up the president that s all i can do that s all i can do no but that s all i can do q just the president i can only say you ll see we cannot let iran have a nuclear weapon just can t do it please q thank you mr president celia mendoza from voa latin america you met yesterday with president putin and in the readout it says that you touched the subject of venezuela the president yeah q but can you expand a little bit of what was said during the meeting about venezuela and also the president well first of all we re following venezuela very closely it s a catastrophe it s what socialism can do i use it all the time i mean it s what socialism can do it was one of the richest countries 20 years ago it s got among the largest oil reserves in the world and they don t have food they don t have water it s really actually incredible i discuss it with i ve discussed it with almost every leader this weekend we discuss venezuela because we don t ever want that to happen to us or their countries okay go ahead q you mentioned that change of regime takes time and then in venezuela it has proven the president oh sure it takes time q but do you think that it s a possibility the president the problem is so many people leaving venezuela it s like going to be a ghost town it s a very bad thing that s happening in venezuela nobody has seen anything quite like it actually especially from the standpoint that they were so wealthy they ve gone i know so many people from venezuela living in miami they re incredible people they re incredible incredible a lot of them live in doral miami it s they call it little venezuela i know them so well these are people that are hard workers warm they re just incredible and to see what s happening to venezuela is heartbreaking it s really heartbreaking q mr president do you think that it is a time for change the strategy and do you still believe that juan guaidó is the person to lead the country you have backed him up the president sure you have a lot of strategies i have five different strategies i could change any moment but in the meantime we re helping them from the standpoint of aid we re getting as much aid as we can i think they re making a big mistake because they re not making the aid very easy as you know you know they re not making it easy to get to people but people are starving to death and their water they have no water they have no water they have oil but they don t have any water no we have a lot of things in store if we have to do that we don t want to do anything but you know we don t want to get involved to the extent that you may be thinking but we have a lot of alternatives we have five different alternatives for venezuela and we ll see what happens it s doing very poorly and maduro is doing very poorly obviously it s not it s just not working just not working yes ma am go ahead q anita kumar with politico i just wanted to the president so from where are you q politico anita kumar politico i just wanted to follow up on the questions that were asked jim asked about the president question question question q question about the crown prince that you met with earlier today i didn t hear you answer the question did you raise the killing of jamal khashoggi with him the president i asked yes q and what was the response the president i asked him what was happening and he was telling me that i think he said 13 but could be more and i think he said more are in the works that there are large numbers of people being prosecuted he s very angry about it he s very unhappy about it and i did mention it to him very strongly and he answered very strongly but they re prosecuting large numbers of people that was a bad event okay q and sir the president yeah go ahead please q can i just follow up you mentioned you mentioned that the intelligence community you mentioned that no one had pointed the finger at him but actually the cia did the intelligence community the president i cannot comment on intelligence community i just i m not probably i guess i m allowed to do what i want to do in terms of that right we can declassify unlike hillary clinton she decided to just give it out we can declassify the truth is that i just don t want to talk about intelligence but i will say this a lot of people are being prosecuted and they re taking it very seriously over there and they ve done a great job in saudi arabia from the standpoint of women and from a lot of different things are happening in saudi arabia one of the other things very important with saudi arabia that not only are they an ally not only have they spent tremendous amounts of money coming into our country and they have been a good ally and they have actually bought tremendous amounts of military equipment that we use and that we re able to use but they re also very much now changed their ways as to financing terror which i can t say for a lot of other countries if you look at iran if you look at other countries in that area they re financing terror now it s harder for iran because iran doesn t have the money they used to have and they were given 150 billion they were given 1 8 billion in cash but saudi arabia has come a long way i ll tell you in terms of reform saudi arabia really has come a long way yeah please in the gold yeah you right q thank you very much mr president i m inaudible with china s inaudible media business news organization in china just a little bit of follow up on huawei you say you re going to discuss huawei s entity listing soon is it possible would you say it s a possibility that huawei is going to be removed from the list the president is it going to what q removed from the entity list is it possible the president i don t want to talk about it now i mean we re looking at that very carefully huawei is very much in play in terms of our country and in terms of intelligence and the intelligence community we know a lot about huawei but i don t want to mention that right now i just think it s inappropriate i will say that we re not making it other than what i told you already we re not making it a big subject we re going to save that for later q okay and another question on the big picture of u s china relations what do you think the u s and china should see each other are we strategic partners are we competitors are we enemies what are we the president no i think we re going to be strategic partners i think we can help each other i think in the end we can if the right deal is structured we can be great for each other if china would open up you re opening up a tremendous you know the largest market in the world and right now china is not open to the united states but we re open to china that should have never really been allowed to happen okay yes please q thank you mr president on russia are you planning to go to moscow next spring as president putin invited you the president yes q and do you agree with him that western style liberalism as has been defined over the post war period is now obsolete and no longer relevant to today s world the president well i haven t heard him say that but he did invite me to russia for the defeat of nazis that s a big thing defeat of nazis you know russia lost he said 25 million people i had actually heard 50 million people but he said yesterday that russia fighting the nazis they lost 25 million people you would know better than anybody peter but it was a tremendous you know they suffered greatly and they re having a 75th you could really say celebration of the defeat of the nazis and he invited me and i said i would give it very serious consideration that was a russia went through a lot they lost i guess far more than anybody fighting the nazis in terms of people and he did invite me and i said we would get back but we will give that very serious consideration okay thank you peter q his comments to the financial times right before arriving here was that western style liberalism is obsolete i know you probably haven t read the interview do you think that s true the president well again he may feel that way i mean he sees what s going on and i guess if you look at what s happening in los angeles where it s so sad to look and what s happening in san francisco and a couple of other cities which are run by an extraordinary group of liberal people i don t know what they re thinking but he does see things that are happening in the united states that would would probably preclude him from saying how wonderful it is at the same time he congratulated me as every other every other leader of every country did for what we ve done economically because we probably have the strongest economy we ve ever had and that s a real positive but i m very embarrassed by what i see in some of our cities where the politicians are either afraid to do something about it or they think it s votes or i don t know what peter i don t know what they re thinking but when you look at los angeles when you look at san francisco when you look at some of the other cities and not a lot not a lot but you don t want it to spread and at a certain point i think the federal government maybe has to get involved we can t let that continue to happen to our cities ladies and gentlemen thank you very much i ll see some of you in south korea maybe at the dmz but this has been an honor thank you all very much thank you applause end 5 05 p m jst news letter join the globalsecurity org mailing list enter your email

this article is more than 4 years old facebook s libra cryptocurrency is generating an immense amount of hype some hail it as the beginning of the end of sovereign fiat currencies others believe it will draw people into the cryptocurrency world leading them inexorably to place their faith in the one true cryptocurrency bitcoin and others worry about the effect on central bank monetary policy and the possibility that a run on libra could trigger another financial crisis i think this is all massively overblown but there is one aspect that should worry everyone and almost nobody is talking about getty firstly let s look at the claim that libra could replace sovereign currencies this is fundamentally nonsense sovereign currencies are the vehicle in which governments accept taxes unless foolhardy governments accept libra as an alternative to their own currencies believe me this is not a good idea people will always need sovereign currency and no governments are not about to disappear and taxes come to an end dream on crypto libertarians what about libra replacing sovereign currencies for day to day transactions facebook says in time we hope to offer additional services for people and businesses like paying bills with the push of a button buying a cup of coffee with the scan of a code or riding your local public transit without needing to carry cash or a metro pass in time dear oh dear i can pay bills with a few keystrokes on my smartphone buy a coffee by scanning a contactless card or qr code on my phone and touch in and out with a contactless card on london s tube i can transact using contactless cards or a smartphone all over europe and in many countries outside europe too the americans who wrote the whitepaper really should get out more more importantly these are not the sort of payments that really matter to people they are discretionary spending what people do with the money they have left over after they have paid taxes rent and essential bills until landlords utility companies and grocery stores accept libra libra has no chance whatsoever of replacing sovereign currencies to be fair replacing sovereign currencies is not in facebook s interests it is relying on them to maintain libra s value libra will be pegged to a basket of major sovereign currencies if there were a run on one or more of those currencies libra would become unstable so the last thing facebook wants is people to abandon the sovereign currencies that back libra killing off the dollar and the euro is not on its agenda libra won t pay interest on its tokens and they won t be backed by deposit insurance so it is difficult to see why anyone would want to hold significant quantities of libra for transaction purposes and it s also uninteresting as an investment since libra will be pegged to a basket of currencies and backed 100 by assets denominated in those currencies investors would effectively be buying shares in an index tracker fund like we ve never seen those before perhaps the idea is that facebook and whatsapp and instagram users would hold small quantities of libra so they can buy the odd coffee or pay for cinema tickets but buying libra exposes them to fx risk if the values of the currencies in the basket changed so would the value of their libra in their own currency surely it is much better to keep their money in an insured bank deposit account with a contactless card and a mobile payments facility of course there are people who don t have access to banks facebook s marketing documentation makes much of the unbanked for many people around the world even basic financial services are still out of reach almost half of the adults in the world don t have an active bank account and those numbers are worse in developing countries and even worse for women in developed countries people who don t have access to banks are typically people with very bad credit histories people who don t have permanent addresses people who don t have identification e g illegal immigrants people with criminal records they are unable to meet banks know your customer requirements which are intended to prevent fraud and money laundering some of these people already use pre paid cards as an alternative to bank accounts they load the cards with cash at atms then gradually spend the balance down this is safer and less cumbersome than carrying cash in theory libra could be an alternative to a pre paid card but facebook says libra will comply with kyc aml requirements if it does then it can t be an alternative to cash or pre paid cards for people who fail kyc checks if it doesn t it will get shut down either way it can t help the unbanked in developed countries however in developing countries where banks are few and far between but everyone has a smartphone libra could be a safer alternative to cash though even in developing countries the need to comply with kyc aml regulations could rain on libra s parade but since the poor don t have much in the way of discretionary spending power and generally aren t interested in making international payments libra would need to be very widely adopted to be of much use to them in effect it would need to replace the sovereign currency for transactions m pesa has achieved this in kenya but not elsewhere has facebook considered that the governments of developing countries might put up barriers to adoption of private sector currencies created by rich white men in silicon valley libra would however make it much quicker and cheaper to exchange emerging market currencies for dollars this is not a bad thing but unless exchanges are efficient honest a rarity in crypto markets and widely available people could find their money becoming trapped on the libra platform and this brings me to a third problem with libra libra is what we call a closed loop system you can only spend it on things available for sale through facebook and its associated apps if you want to buy something through another platform you must convert your libra back into another currency if it were amazon that had created this currency we might not regard this as a major problem but facebook is not yet a sales platform on the scale of amazon yes it promotes ads and businesses have marketing pages but it has a long way to go to match amazon or alibaba for sheer ubiquity although facebook seems to be hoping that lots of new entrants will use libra s scripting language to design smart contracts for goods and services to be sold through its platform the fact that facebook is so far behind amazon and alibaba as a sales platform seriously diminishes libra s usefulness some people seem to think that it is not alibaba that facebook is trying to compete with but wechat that s possibly true but if so this is a fundamental mistake the economic world does not run on people pinging money to each other through chat groups though wechat would like to think that it does it runs on merchants selling goods and services and people buying what those merchants have to offer what about the threat libra could pose to financial stability or monetary policy there is a not insignificant risk that in the event of a run on libra it will prove not to have the 100 reserve backing that it claims if that happened then people would not be able to recover some or all of their money but that wouldn t necessarily mean central banks or governments would have to intervene those shouting about risks to financial stability seem to think that libra would be so huge that central banks would be obliged to bail it out the eurodollar market on steroids the eurodollar market s collapse in 2008 nearly brought down the global financial system but it was a wholesale financial market made up of giant banks and corporations moving trillions of dollars around libra would be a retail market consisting of people and merchants buying goods and services even if they are very large retail markets don t have the potential to wreck financial stability in the way that wholesale markets do regulators should take an interest of course financial crises always start in the unregulated sector and libra will be in effect a giant shadow bank but if regulators are concerned about libra s effect on financial stability they already have a solution force facebook to become a regulated bank subject to capital and liquidity requirements like all other banks after all goldman sachs had to become a regulated bank in order to gain legitimate access to fed liquidity why should facebook be different the underlying issue here is the unspoken assumption that facebook is too big to regulate too big to bail and too big to fail why does everyone think governments will allow facebook to rule the world and this brings me to my real concern about the libra project facebook s business model since its inception has been to harvest and monetize data i see no reason to assume that this has changed so when i find buried in libra s whitepaper two sentences that imply facebook s real aim in creating libra is to set the standard for global digital identities my hair stands on end as dave birch director of consult hyperion and an expert on digital identity puts it there are no throwaway remarks in a facebook white paper that has taken a year to put together it s in there for a reason are actually going to try and fix the identity problem dave seems fairly sanguine about facebook s intention but i am not we now know just how damaging facebook s data harvesting can be if facebook became the standard setter for digital identities it could gain access to all personal data and that is what it wants not control of finance control of data and if you think your personal data would be digitally secure from harvesting simply because facebook said so you are the biggest sucker in the world from a financial perspective libra seems fairly harmless even if all 2bn of facebook s users adopted libra for some transactions and all 90m of its small businesses used libra for purchases and sales it is not going to pose a major threat to the financial system let alone replace sovereign currencies but libra is in reality a

getty zombie companies could endanger financial stability as the global economic downturn is deeper than expected the very detailed analysis and graphs from the bank for international settlement s bis

dependent growth model indeed aggregate debt public plus private in relation to gdp while it plateaued in the past year is much higher than pre crisis bis analysts clearly explain that at the same time interest rates nominal and real remain historically low even as economies hover around estimates of potential and financial conditions in advanced economies notably in the largest among them

in the united states and the united kingdom companies in other countries have also taken advantage of the prolonged climate of low interest rates according to agustín castens general manager bank for international settlements high levels of debt also point to vulnerabilities in a number of emerging market economies emes in some cases these are in the household sector most often they are in the corporate sector not least as foreign currency debt has expanded strongly since the crisis the current vulnerabilities reflect in part spillovers from prolonged accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies as emes are especially vulnerable to capital flow reversals and exchange rate fluctuations particularly worrisome are countries in emerging markets where the sovereign or companies have borrowed in foreign currency if economic or market downturns hit those countries their currency will depreciate making it harder for borrowers to service their foreign currency loans investors chase for yield has influenced a significant demand globally for structured bonds which pool leveraged loans collateralized loan obligations clos according to the bis annual economic report clos have surged reminiscent of the steep rise in collateralized debt obligations that amplified the subprime crisis bis economists warned that should the leveraged loan sector deteriorate the economic impact would depend on the potential amplification mechanisms these can run right through the banking system linked to unstable wholesale funding and other parts of the financial system that hold leveraged loans and clos via price adjustments the probability of these factors taking effect is best assessed against the backdrop of the longer term deterioration in credit quality of the corporate sector in some advanced economies visible in the concentration of the outstanding stock of securities in the triple b segment just above non investment grade junk status the amount outstanding of clos in the u

level immediately preceding the 1990s asian crisis moreover lending to leveraged firms i e those borrowing in either high yield bond or leveraged loan markets has become sizeable in 2018 leveraged loan issuance amounted to more than half of global publicly disclosed loan issuance loans excluding credit lines the concern is as i have written previously in these columns that if financial conditions tighten either because interest rates rise in certain countries or because rates to borrowing companies rise due to their credit quality deterioration leveraged companies will be very vulnerable legislators regulators and market participants should not become complacent as the bis points out the strong outflows from bonds and loan funds and the sharp widening of ae and eme spreads in late 2018 illustrate how fast markets can shift there are very strong interconnections between market risk and companies credit quality and liquidity the ability to meet obligations when they come due market characteristics can influence the extent to which financial conditions respond to a deteriorating business environment in particular following a long term decline in credit quality since

after struggling to receive recognition of legitimacy within the mainstream zeitgeist during its sophomoric years distributed ledger technology dlt now comprises the driving force behind a new wave of technological creative destruction today we are going to take a look at some of the industries and processes that are most dramatically undergoing a transformation in response to the advent of blockchain technology food the opaque nature of global supply chains poses a significant challenge to efforts to ensure that the commodities labor and inputs required to produce goods are from a safe and ethical origin in order to tackle these issues an increasing number of companies are exploring blockchain based solutions on june 25 walmart china announced plans for the movement of food products throughout its supply chain using the walmart china blockchain traceability platform which was built on vechain s thor blockchain announced at the traceability system construction seminar during the 2019 china products safety publicity week in beijing walmart china indicated that 23 product lines have been test launched on the platform with a further 100 product lines spanning 10 different product categories expected to be incorporated onto the platform before the end of the year walmart china anticipates that 50 of its total sales of packaged meat will comprise products tracked using its traceability platform in addition to 40 of its total sales of packaged vegetables and 12 5 of its total seafood sales by 2021 the platform will also allow walmart china customers to acquire detailed information pertaining to the production for a specific item by scanning the barcode of the product with their smartphone among the information that will be made available to consumers are facts about a product s source geographic location logistics process and walmart china s product inspection report during the announcement walmart china representatives spoke of the possibility for distributed ledger technology to ensure the quality and safety of edible agricultural produce and to bolster consumer confidence through enhancing supply chain transparency in addition to facilitating significant efficiency savings in production across the pond walmart recently announced a collaborative endeavor alongside the united states food and drug administration fda ibm merck and kpmg to develop a proof of concept blockchain for the purpose of tracking prescription drugs on june 27 u s based snack food company brimhall foods announced a partnership with surge holdings to deliver brim s products via a distributed ledger based ordering system with the company claiming that surgepay s blockchain network will allow it to access tens of thousands of new retailers diamonds in 2003 a united nations general assembly resolution established the kimberley process certification scheme kpcs which sought to increase transparency in the diamond industry and inhibit the circulation of blood diamonds i e diamonds mined in war zones and sold to finance insurgency or the activities of warlords despite the kpcs seeing adoption among more than 80 countries since its establishment the scheme has received significant criticism for failing to achieve its aims in december 2011 nongovernmental organization ngo global witness abandoned the kpcs following the scheme s endorsement of unlimited diamond exports in zimbabwe in may 2015 australian entrepreneur leanne kemp founded everledger a digital registry for diamonds powered by the ibm blockchain platform the mission of the registry is for everledger to assess the diamonds using grading reports provided by the gemological institute of america in 2018 de beers group an international corporation that mines and trades diamonds announced that it would develop a blockchain based traceability platform named tracr the platform would seek to track the diamond supply chain from the mine to the retail store later that year chow tai fook jewellery group and alrosa a partially russian state owned diamond mining company announced that they had joined the tracr pilot in january 2019 russian state backed media outlet tass reported that russia s ministry of education and science had introduced a dlt enable platform for track and guarantee the authenticity of natural diamond products across its supply chain the platform was developed by russian startup bitcarat with each diamond given a unique code that is recorded on a distributed ledger the ledger also records the history of previous transfers of ownership pertaining to tracked diamonds securities many analysts are predicting that security token offerings stos are poised to drive a revolution in fundraising processes owing both to the efficiency savings afforded by dlt and the advantages that the adoption of distributed ledger based systems have in place of the complex web of centralized ledgers that currently underpin the settlement of securities in the first quarter of 2019 market research firm inwara estimated that the number of stos had increased by 130 when compared with q4 2018 stos are expected to further break down barriers preventing small businesses from accessing venture capital in addition to allowing issuers to access a global liquidity pool however despite the excitement surrounding stos the foundational infrastructure of the security token industry is still in its developmental stage the market for stos is now emerging during august 2018 an online retailer and early cryptocurrency adopter overstock com raised 134 million in an initial coin offering ico for its security token exchange called tzero the exchange was opened for trading during january of this year with tzero s proprietary token comprising the sole crypto asset available for trade at launch tzero launched just weeks after sharespost a regulated alternative trading system and registered broker dealer that facilitated the first ever secondary trade of a security token in the form of blockchain capital s bcap tokens art in recent years the art world has increasingly warmed to blockchain technology embracing the innovative crowdfunding capabilities afforded by stos in july 2018 dlt platform maecenas partnered with london gallery dadiani fine art to sell virtual tokens representing fractional ownership of a piece of art for the very first time the token sale saw 31 5 of andy warhol s 1980 work 14 small chairs auctioned in exchange for btc and eth valued at approximately 5 6 million several months later maecenas announced that it had partnered with john mcafee and crypto asset exchange ethershift io to conduct what it described as the first perpetual digitalization and tokenization of a picasso artwork the auctioning process saw the digital artwork represented as a single erc 721 token with a fixed number of erc 20 tokens distributed to designate ownership of the physical asset maecenas founder and ceo marcelo garcía casil stated as an analogy you could think of the erc 721 as the certificate of incorporation of a company and the erc 20 tokens as the company shares in november 2018 christie s new york became the first auction house to record sales using dlt with its 318 million sale of a barney a ebsworth collection being recorded using artory s blockchain based registry artery s registry tracks the histories and archival material pertaining to a piece of art while also facilitating anonymous transactions between buyer and seller the following month liechtenstein based thearttoken announced that it had raised over 11 million through its tat token sale the tat tokens represent fractional ownership in a curated collection of post war and contemporary art real estate during the san francisco blockchain week 2019 it was announced that a security token offering had raised 18 million in venture capital to purchase a fragmented equity stake in a resort in the u s city of aspen the offering dubbed aspen coin saw digital tokens issued via the crowdfunding website indiegogo allowing accredited investors to purchase aspen coin tokens which are compliant with u s security and exchange commission sec regulations each aspen coin was listed at the price of 1 with minimum investments set at 10 000 when announcing the success of aspen coin slava rubin the founder of indiegogo and president of asset management company elevated returns who assisted in the execution of the offering spoke of the potential for security tokens to expand the number of investors exposed to real estate you re actually talking about a real asset that people are paying hundreds of dollars or thousands of dollars every night to stay in and this already makes tons of revenue it real estate tokenization fragments the asset if you wanted to buy the st regis aspen before fragmentation you would have had to write a check for 250 to 300 million that limits the number of people that can actually have exposure to the asset as of this writing the sto monitoring service stoscope estimates that there are currently 13 active real estate security offerings providing exposure to a range of investment products including real estate investment trusts and fragmented ownership in student accommodation land registries the immutability and transparency of distributed ledgers provide an attractive solution to the management of land registries for both developed and developing nations many developing nations suffer from crippling issues pertaining to the management of land registries particularly nations struggling with corruption or those that have experienced regime changes in recent history as a consequence there are often conflicting claims of ownership to land with some claimants possessing crude documentational evidence such as hand written notes in may 2015 texas based companies factom and epigraph announced that they would work alongside the government of honduras in what comprised the earliest attempts to build a blockchain based land title registry at the time the initiative was described as only the second instance in which a national government had adopted blockchain technology however the project soon stalled with factom s founder and chief architect paul snow attributing the failure of the venture political issues one year later bitfury began working alongside the national agency of public registry in the republic of georgia in an initiative to use the bitcoin blockchain to validate property related government transactions during may of this year marc taverner global ambassador and head of market development at bitfury estimated that more than 2 million land registry transactions have been recorded on the bitcoin blockchain taverner said if you re a citizen now you can have comfort that the government is operating the way in which they register land on the blockchain which makes it entirely transparent and trustworthy and a citizen now can trust the system rather than having to trust an individual or a particular politician also there has been a recent proliferation in state institutions seeking to use blockchain to create digital land registries with propy inc launching a pilot project to record real estate conveyance documents in the vermont city of the south burlington and the netherland s land registry indicating that a blockchain based solution will be incorporated into the nation s registry by the end of 2021 in another instance australia s new south wales land registry services engaged with blockchain technology provider chromaway to develop a dlt based proof of concept for electronic property conveyancing election technology in 2014 denmark s liberal alliance became the first major political party to utilize blockchain technology to conduct an election a blockchain was used for internal voting at the party s annual meeting in hvidovre copenhagen at the time a party committee member emphasized the benefits of employing dlt to execute the vote stating the blockchain removes the need for trust because the technology can run autonomous without interference from humans and it is at the same time open source and transparent so that everybody can look under the hood and see what s going on last year a press release circulated by agora a swiss startup comprising a distributed ledger based voting platform inspired reports claiming that sierra leone had become the first country to use a blockchain to conduct a national election on march 7 2018 however on march 18 2018 the national electoral commission nec of sierra leone issued a tweet asserting that the nec had not used blockchain technology in any part of the electoral process in april 2018 the u s state of west virginia saw 144 military personnel stationed across 24 different countries participate in primary elections using blockchain based voting platform voatz becoming the first u s jurisdiction to employ dlt to facilitate voting the platform which was developed by symantec was conceived in response to only 13 of overseas u s service members signing up to receive ballots during the 2016 federal election of which only 9 were eligible one year later it was announced that denver would become the second u s state to utilize blockchain in a municipal election again using voatz to target overseas service members in addition to voters located internationally 4 000 individuals in total in february 2019 it was revealed that the australian state of south australia engaged dlt firm horizon state to provide the technology and support for a blockchain based election last year horizon state was contracted by the democratic party of india to consult its base regarding policy positions in addition to lending its platform for a leadership election conducted by new zealand s opportunity party public investment the dlt revolution is increasingly penetrating governance processes with the potential efficiency savings and monitoring capabilities afforded by blockchain enticing adoption among many government institutions brazil s national bank for economic and social development bndes has been in the development of a virtual currency for the purpose of augmenting the transparency of public spending since late 2018 named bndestoken the token comprises an ether based stablecoin that is pegged to the brazilian real with bndes holding a monopoly over both the issuance and redemption of the tokens related as brazil s economy risks recession regulators and banks implement blockchain on june 3 brazilian media outlet state of sao paulo reported that elo company a film production company known for its work on alê abreu s oscar nominated boy and the world had participated in a proof of concept for the bndestoken initiative bndes has hired elo company to produce a documentary with bndestoken expected to be issued to finance many aspects of the film s development the proof of concept comprised the simulation of payment of four screenwriters using bndestoken the bndestoken initiative has been praised by several actors involved in the pilot for increasing the transparency surrounding the distribution of public funding with the president of elo company sabrina nudeliman stating that the platform provides real time accountability bndes systems analyst fabiano mattos has argued that the bndestoken both helps the brazilian development bank measure the efficacy of its loan issuance and facilitates public monitoring of the society wide impact and reach of its spending mattos asserted it is publicly and irrefutably possible for a citizen and society as a whole to monitor the disbursements of public money made by the bndes and also to see the impact of this action on the various actors of the brazilian economy bndestoken would vastly improve the way we can measure effectiveness of bndes funding financial aid ngos are increasingly favoring financial aid over material provision with australian media outlet micky reporting that approximately 70 of syrian refugees have been forced to sell in kind donations for cash in order to conduct the purchases required by their personal circumstances however the issuance of financial aid is marred by a number of challenges including long waiting times for distribution and verification processes to be established and poor monitoring and reporting capabilities that obfuscate the ability for donors to verify the efficacy of their donations in may 2019 oxfam international conducted a month long trial of a disaster relief program in the island nation of vanuatu that sought to harness dlt to improve the efficiency and outcomes in distributing financial aid named unblocked cash the pilot saw 200 citizens of the natural disaster prone nation issued tap and pay cards loaded with approximately 4 000 vanuatu vatu roughly 50 worth of e tokens backed by makerdao s dai stablecoin thirty four vendors participated in the project including local stores and schools related from clean water supply to rebuilding notre dame crypto and blockchain in charity the pilot was deemed a success by oxfam with the trial s vanuatuan participants describing the program as the preferred mode for the delivery of financial aid in future attributing such to greater ease of use when compared with previous cash aid programs the enrollment process for unblocked cash took less than six minutes whereas previous oxfam cash assistance programs in vanuatu have involved approximately hour long wait times for enrollment more than 2 000 transactions were recorded during the program following the pilot oxfam australia s humanitarian lead joshua hallwright told cointelegraph that it is highly likely that oxfam will use stablecoins or other distributed ledger technologies to provide cash aid in disaster responses in the future either in vanuatu or elsewhere cross border settlements while facilitating frictionless cross border remittances at an individual level has long comprised a fundamental mission of cryptocurrency a number of governments and private companies have sought to create centralized blockchain transborder settlements in may of this year the bank of canada boc and the monetary authority of singapore mas concluded the first trial of cross border payments using central bank digital currencies on a blockchain platform the trial comprised the linking of boc s and mas respective distributed ledger platforms jasper and ubin using hashed time locked contracts facilitating trustless payment versus payment pvp settlement accenture and jpmorgan chase supported the project by assisting in the development of their respective blockchain platforms upon which jasper and ubin were built the central banks described the pilot as showcasing great potential to increase efficiencies and reduce risks for cross border blockchain payments with a joint report published by the boc and mas stating a fragmented world with differing standards processes norms and regulations is the key challenge in cross border payments today dlt could offer an easier and faster path towards adoption than a centralized approach because it can leave the different jurisdictions involved in control of their portion of the network while allowing for tight integration with the rest of the network in june 2019 fnality international announced that its utility settlement coin usc project raised 63 2 million in its series a financing round the usc project comprises an endeavor on the part of 14 financial firms to develop a digital token for cross border settlement fnality group s membership includes banco santander bny mellon barclays cibc commerzbank credit suisse ing kbc group lloyds banking group mufg

usd forecast update 3 after sliding 0 45 over the course of monday s session the uk pound to us dollar exchange rate remained under pressure heading into tuesday with sterling last seen trading down a further 0 13 at 1 26210 it s a relatively quiet day for markets with limited releases on the schedule however with fed rates cuts looming federal open market committee fomc member speakers are likely to draw attention and on tuesday we ll see williams voter neutral and mester voter hawkish both take to the podium with investors looking for any hints about the july rates decision in particular with some fed members previously citing trade tensions as one of downside risks for us economic growth it will be interesting to see if there is any change in tone in light of the positive developments at last weekend s g20 meeting wrote lloyds bank commercial banking analyst nikesh sawjani data wise the only notable release on the schedule is likely to be the uk s latest construction sector pmi which following monday s lacklustre manufacturing print will provide a second clue as to how q2 growth is shaping up service sector pmi to follow on wednesday gbp usd forecast update 2 the pound to us dollar gbp usd exchange rate was placed on the defensive at the start of this week s session with the pairing falling as low as 1 2632 in the wake of the uk s manufacturing pmi this showed that growth in the uk s factory sector contracted for the second consecutive month in june also recording its worst performance since february 2013 meanwhile the us dollar roared ahead on monday as the us china trade truce was seen as positive for usd amid speculation it will reduce the chances of large interest rate cuts from the federal reserve this year gbp usd forecast update the uk pound to us dollar exchange rate fell to last week s range lows as monday s european session got underway with the greenback lifted post g20 by the us china trade war ceasefire at the time of writing sterling was seen trading at 1 25057 down 0 25 the week ahead holds a plethora of potentially high impacting data with us data in particular expected to be in focus given the implications for the fed us pmis are due ahead of the latest round of us labour market statistics on the upcoming pmis danske bank chief analyst jens sørensen wrote we expect ism to decrease and come in at 50 8 down from 52 2 in our view the us manufacturing sector is not immune to the global slowdown but we think the index will remain just above the important 50 threshold that said risk is skewed to the downside for the gbp data remains secondary to any political brexit developments with data releases likely to be interpreted through the lens of brexit monday will see the latest uk manufacturing pmi forecast to edge 0 1 points higher but remain in contraction territory at 49 5 advertisement overall with brexit the predominant risk factor for the gbp upside is expected to be limited as long as a no deal brexit remains a possibility that should keep the pound below the psychological 1 30 mark against the u s dollar wrote han tan market analyst at ftxm despite the pound s poor performance for most of last week amid a lack of notable uk support and ongoing brexit and political fears the british pound to us dollar gbp usd exchange rate was unable to avoid major losses last week and as a result ended june well above the lows seen in the middle of the month this was partially due to broad weakness in the us dollar on federal reserve interest rate cut bets last week s movement was fairly muted overall with gbp usd opening at the level of 1 2733 and spending the second half of the week trending with a modestly downside bias on friday gbp usd edged higher from the week s worst levels and trended closer to 1 2700 again despite the gbp usd losses last week the pair remained well above the previous week s opening level of 1 2588 and that week s post january low of 1 2520 pound to us dollar gbp usd exchange rate driven by political sentiment amid mixed data even though there was a lack of notable support for the pound last week the pound to us dollar exchange rate s losses were limited overall and the pair rebounded from weekly lows before markets closed on friday this was due to numerous factors but especially continued weakness in the us dollar investors have been hesitant to buy the us dollar in recent weeks as bets have risen that the federal reserve will cut us interest rates over the next year while the bank may not be as dovish as some investors speculated due to the bank distancing itself from us president donald trump s demands for lower interest rates the rate cut bets have still kept persistent pressure on the us dollar on top of this us trade and geopolitical tensions as well as weaker us data throughout the past week have made investors even more hesitant to buy the us dollar friday s us data was mixed with some personal consumption expenditure pce price index stats beating forecasts while some of michigan s latest consumer sentiment figures fell short the lingering pressure on the us dollar made it easier for the pound to rebound at the end of the week investors bought the pound back from its cheapest levels in end of quarter fixings but the british currency has had a heavily bearish quarter over all the pound has been throttled by rising bets that brexiteer boris johnson will become britain s next prime minister and that he could lead the nation to a no deal brexit gbp usd only advanced in june due to the us dollar s own broad weakness pound gbp exchange rate forecast the month of britain s next prime minister by the end of july britain will most likely have a new prime minister and it is most likely to be boris johnson boris johnson and jeremy hunt the two remaining candidates in the leadership contest are campaigning for the conservative party membership base voting among conservative party members will take place until later in july when the winner will be officially confirmed with markets betting on a johnson win and johnson still claiming that a no deal brexit is more likely than another brexit delay there is unlikely to be much for investors to react to in the coming week if there are any surprising uk political developments the pound could be influenced and politics are likely to remain in focus for the pound over this week s upcoming uk pmi stats us dollar usd exchange rate forecast us data and g20 developments could influence fed bets once again the us dollar is most likely to be the primary driver of pound to us dollar exchange rate movement over the coming week as another slew of major us data will be published throughout the week ism s key june pmis will be published starting with the typically influential manufacturing pmi on monday and followed by the non manufacturing pmi on wednesday these will give investors a much better idea of how us economic activity has been over the past month if the data falls short investors may speculate that more aggressive easing from the federal reserve is possible other us data to keep an eye out for over the coming week includes trade balance data and factory on wednesday and of course june s key non farm payroll report on friday the nfp report is especially influential to the fed outlook so there is plenty of data for us dollar investors to react to next week of

investors often disagree on their strategy this is because every investor s goals are different as investors we like to lump people into groups or communities who are striving for similar but not identical goals these groups often disparage each other and believe their methodology is superior according to sociology this is a classic example of othering what does that mean remember back to high school typically there is the in crowd and the freaks or others these others were marginalized and often ignored or worse bullied seeking alpha like a high school has crowds of individuals who typically adhere to one investing style and when an article or author publishes a different idea it gets attacked these groups feel threatened when others arrive it threatens their preconceived ideas othering is seen on national scale as well but investors being from all nations create groups of their own one classic argument is etfs exchange traded funds versus cefs closed end funds both of these options contain hundreds of examples that encapsulate various investing methodologies they can be actively or passively managed and investing in a single sector or all of them etfs vs cefs creates new divides among investors who align with similar investing theories at high dividend opportunities we recommend to invest in a large selection of high yield etfs and cefs we are very selective in the options we include in our core portfolio cefs strongly outweigh etfs let us take a look at why what is an etf an etf is an exchanged traded open end fund meaning it can actively create or redeem shares as needed this means there is no limit to how large a fund can become the oldest surviving etf currently is spdr s p 500 trust etf spy and tracks the s p 500 index these options rarely stray far from their nav and prices are reset to them almost nightly cheap diversification one of the biggest draws for etfs is their instant diversification for passive or conservative investors etfs generally hold a basket of a large number of stocks this is a benefit and a drawback source this means you get the best and the worst of the underlying stocks generally this basket is determined by the index it tracks spy quietly tracks its index and provides exposure to the entire s p 500 even if an investor does not have the cash available to buy a single share of each company within it bottom line benefit of access to a large number of holdings drawback of limited control to avoid bad companies passive or active management etfs will have one of two management styles the most common is passive this means that the etf tracks an index as closely as possible as new shares are generated based on cash flows into the etf the etf buys the weighted balance of shares of its indexes securities actively managed etfs like infracap mlp etf amza have portfolio managers who invest according to the limits of an index but are competing against it instead of blindly following it amza is an example where this style of management can fail to beat its index and stands as an example where this management style is heavily dependent on the portfolio managers for success bottom line typically passively managed etfs are more common and more popular for hands off investors easy liquidity this is a major draw for etf investors buying and selling etf shares is extremely easy you re not dependent on other investors alone but the fund also to redeem or create shares near the nav net asset value price this means it is very easy to buy into an etf and sell out of it this provides investors an easy route to get diversification in areas where volume can be low and diversification can be hard plus selling those same holding in a pinch can be hard the flip side of this means that often etfs can have irrational sell offs when the nav drops this can create a feedback cycle where the selling of shares forces redemptions and can cause the fund s nav to drop further this is amplified when the underlying holdings are highly illiquid etf investors often buy when a fundâ s holdings are performing well creating a buy high sell low issue for the fund new buyers force it to buy shares at higher prices and sell them at lows invesco senior loan etf bkln is an example of this phenomenon bkln buys and holds senior secured bank loans these are more illiquid than normal securities in the third quarter of 2018 bkln saw a steady uptick in selling to redeem the shares the fund had to quickly sell loans that normally take time to sell this means selling at cheap prices further hurting the nav and flooding a market known to be illiquid with extremely cheap loans this added liquidity of an etf caused this fund s nav and thus share price to drop rapidly ironically this was not because the loans were facing added pressures defaults remain at an all time low bottom line added liquidity can help investors move readily in and out of etfs but this sword is double edged and can readily hurt investors who don t need the added liquidity what is a cef a cef is a closed end fund this means that the fund has a set number of shares available on the market the fund can issue more shares over time but unlike etfs cefs do not issue and redeem them in the same fashion this set number of shares means cefs have a nav value and a market price savvy investors have created a breed of investors who trade exclusively based on cef metrics to capture market inefficiencies due to mispricing of a cef s nav vs market price diversification like an etf cefs offer cheap diversification as well cefs typically invest in holdings related to a sector or index xai octagon floating rate alternative income term trust xflt currently yields 8 84 and invests in the senior loan and clo sector for example meanwhile liberty all star equity fund usa invests across a broad range of sectors to achieve its goal cefs more so than etfs have a specific goal or style of investing in mind all cefs have a manager who oversees the portfolio choices of the fund as well as its distributions bottom line cefs provide diversification their holdings are frequently updated and sometimes can be harder to track than etfs portfolio managers aim to avoid the bad investments that etfs passively invest your dollars in premiums and discounts cefs are unique compared to etfs that they can trade at a discount or premium to nav these metrics are used by some investors to buy into funds that are discounted thus every dollar invested by you buys more than that dollarâ s worth of what the fund is invested in conversely popular funds will often trade at a premium to nav where every dollar you invest is backing less than that dollarâ s worth of investments why would an investment trade at a constant premium some funds are invested in assets that are illiquid and hard to value or are trading at a discount themselves consider oxford lane capital oxlc or eagle point credit ecc yielding 16 22 and 14 21 respectively they have been trading at a premium for an extended time meanwhile ofs credit occi has been trading at a discount occi recently ipo ed and new funds typically trade at a discount to nav meanwhile occi hasn t updated its nav since 12 31 18 meaning it very well could be at a premium and we don t know right now bottom line investing in a discount to nav can leverage your dollars however limiting your investments to only those trading at a discount would cause you to miss many opportunities medium liquidity cefs offer similar liquidity to common equity and much less liquidity than etfs this is because they trade in a similar manner to normal equity trades this is a benefit for investors looking to invest in less frequently traded securities like bonds and loans for example oxlc and ecc might face strong market price declines but their nav will be unaffected this is because the nav is not directly impacted by the markets selling off the fund itself while providing an easier out from an asset type than it may normally provide the large lumbering etfs in that sector can vastly affect nav values as seen in december the irrational selling of bkln caused oxlc and ecc to see irrational nav declines and thus market share price drops their underlying assets continued to generate strong returns bottom line cefs provide higher liquidity for many highly illiquid asset classes while conversely offering less liquidity than etfs provide how do they fit into hdo s investment style so how does high dividend opportunities utilize etfs and cefs recently we ve gained attention for investing in clo funds like oxlc and ecc but many of our readers know we have invested also in vaneck vectors bdc income etf bizd which yields 9 65 and ishares mortgage real estate capped etf rem which yields 9 08 we use these etfs to allow conservative investors easy access to diversification across these sectors where many landmines exist why etfs we use etfs as a means for conservative investors to get exposure to a sector that is 1 potentially high risk and 2 the sector as a whole should see tailwinds for improvement we also invest in specific high quality choices in these sectors as well the etfs exist in our conservative portfolio while the individual choices in our core portfolio why investing in a single choice can be considered a higher risk choice but also higher reward this single or couple of choice investments can lead to a higher return ares capital arcc which yields 9 05 is a key example of this a choice high quality bdc to invest in versus an etf that invests also in lower quality ones why cefs we use many cefs with proven track records in our portfolios these cefs we ve touched on recently in the reit space these funds allow us to convert capital gains the fund sees into income streams adams diversified equity fund inc adx provides large sums of year end income from its underlying capital gains from securities we wouldn t otherwise have exposure to it also provides the income we desire for our portfolio and lifestyles we use cefs to 1 leverage the skills of the portfolio manager 2 gain income from sectors that typically don t provide them and 3 gain access to asset types we wouldn t have access to anyways key takeaways etfs and cefs can cause strife among investors over the superiority of either as well as how to best use them here at high dividend opportunities we actively use both investment vehicles to achieve our goal of a portfolio yielding between 9 10 our conservative investors are able to access similar markets as our less conservative investors via etfs to have the added downside protection of diversification while also limiting their upside cefs give us access to new asset types and ways to produce income

give bernie sanders props for popularizing the term socialism it used to be a conversation stopper now it is a conversation starter but sanders isn t helping the socialist cause by confusing it with the old new deal liberalism of fdr as norman thomas the socialist party s 1936 presidential candidate famously quipped in a radio address roosevelt did not carry out the socialist platform unless he carried it out on a stretcher socialism has traditionally meant social ownership and democratic administration of the economy that s the dictionary definition that s the socialist tradition one can see that from this old membership card of the uk labour party a party nominally committed to democratic socialism from 1918 until the tony blair s third way neoliberals got this clause 4 deleted from the party constitution in 1995 now bernie sanders is deleting economic democracy based on social ownership of the major means of production from our understanding of socialism as he said in his november 2015 speech on democratic socialism so the next time you hear me attacked as a socialist remember this i don t believe government should own the means of production when he returned to the topic of democratic socialism again on june 12 this year he never said a word about any kind of social ownership nothing about the worker cooperatives he touted in his 2016 book our revolution nothing about the idea sanders had floated just two weeks before the speech of socializing companies by requiring them to regularly put a portion of their shares in a fund controlled by workers democratic socialism for sanders in his speech is simply fulfilling an updated version of president roosevelt s 1944 call for an economic bill of rights which sanders defined as the right to a decent job that pays a living wage the right to quality health care the right to a complete education the right to affordable housing the right to a clean environment the right to a secure retirement these are rights that socialists support i have campaigned for this sort of economic bill of rights in three campaigns for new york governor since 2010 it was our green alternative to the public austerity that both democrats and republicans were proposing in the wake of the 2008 housing and financial meltdown we called it the green new deal socialism means system change socialism is a different system of economic organization from capitalism sanders never addresses how capitalist property relations divide society into class hierarchies with the billionaire class on top under capitalism workers are exploited the owners not the workers the takers not the makers grab for themselves the wealth that workers create with their labor workers get a fixed wage while capitalists take all the profits under socialism workers receive the full value of their labor the net income after paying for production costs equipment materials supplies taxes etc is distributed to the workers in proportion to their labor contribution this socialist system of distribution yields an equitable distribution of income in the first place at the point of production sanders tax and transfer social programs only partially compensate after the fact for exploitation and its inequitable distribution capitalism is prone to economic crises due to overproduction during market booms leading to excess inventories and layoffs during market busts these recessions and depressions impoverish workers and further concentrate wealth as the bigger capitalists buy up assets at deflated prices a socialist economic democracy can plan for stable production without boom and bust cycles but sanders gives no indication that this is part of the case for socialism socialist economic planning also enables an ecological socialism of sustainable production of enough to meet people s material needs without exceeding ecological limits capitalism on the other hand is a system of blind relentless growth driven by its competitive structure which requires capitalist firms to grow or die in the competition for market shares and profits capitalist growth disregards ecological limits and is destroying the ecological foundations of the human economy sanders call for the right to a clean environment requires ecosocialism but sanders says nothing about how democratic socialism is needed to realize this right particularly with respect to the climate crisis exxon chevron and the koch brothers will never reinvest their earnings from fossil fuels into clean renewables big oil must be socialized along with power utilities railroads banking and other key sectors in order to plan the rapid transition to 100 clean energy across all productive sectors from electricity and transportation to agriculture and manufacturing the federal government took over or built a quarter of us manufacturing capacity during world war ii in order to turn industry on a dime into the arsenal of democracy that helped beat the fascists we need nothing less to defeat climate change capitalist competition also generates war global corporations enlist their home based nation states and militaries in an international competition for resources markets cheap labor and geopolitical military positioning this capitalist international structure produces endless wars and the inevitability sooner or later of global nuclear annihilation by the nuclear armed states if we don t change the system socialism s international cooperation would build peace based on mutual aid in place of capitalism competitive nationalistic militarism the jingoistic display of a dozen american flags as the total backdrop for sanders 2019 socialism speech was the antithesis of socialist internationalism the speech said nothing critical about the u s global military empire or about socialism as the alternative to capitalist imperialism and the path to peace democracy requires socialism sanders presentation of liberal social programs as socialism fails to address the power rooted in the private ownership and dictatorial control of the means of production dictatorial control extends well beyond the workplace where employees work as directed by supervisors without many of the constitutional protections of the bill of rights capitalist economic dictatorship encompasses the whole economy and the government without socialist economic democracy programs to implement the economic bill of rights will be resisted or if passed rolled back by the capitalists because power will remain in their hands concentrated economic power under capitalism yields concentrated political power for the capitalist class this power is obviously exercised through campaign donations advertising and lobbying but it is also expressed directly in the economy capitalists can strike too they can refuse to finance government borrowing they can withhold or offshore investments depress the economy and blame the reformers usually the threat of these measures is sufficient to bring progressive reformers to heel the capitalists who exercise this private economic power are not up for election sanders liberalism is vulnerable to the capitalist veto because it depends on taxing the capitalist economy to fund the social programs capitalists don t want to pay taxes and are especially opposed to taxes that fund social programs that strengthen the economic security and therefore the bargaining power of the working class a sanders administration would have to pander to the capitalists or face economic sabotage bill clinton found this out he was instructed during the transition planning for his presidency by goldman sachs robert rubin who became his top economic advisor and treasury secretary that he would have to drop his modest reform program of education spending public works and middle class tax cuts in order to show the investor class the fiscal austerity they demanded clinton exclaimed you mean to tell me that the success of the economic program and my re election hinges on the federal reserve and a bunch of fucking bond traders clinton found out that the u s bond market a few thousand traders working for a handful of investment banks had veto power over his economic program democracy needs socialism political democracy requires economic democracy socialist economic democracy based on social ownership and democratic administration of the economy is needed so people have the power to enact and maintain an economic bill of rights the economic bill of rights as an anti racist program sanders economic bill of rights will be popular with working class voters public opinion polling has consistently shown majority support for government action to realize these rights from the 1940s up to today i am again campaigning for it as i have in past campaigns but in addition to calling for socialist economic democracy as necessary for securing these economic rights i am also saying the economic bill of rights must be implemented in a way that reverses the growing racial wealth gap and the increasing segregation in housing and segregation that we have experienced since the 1980s it was disappointing that in sanders unvarnished praise of fdr s new deal that he did not acknowledge and correct for the racial bias in its implementation social security at first excluded sharecroppers farmworkers and domestic workers which disproportionately excluded black people and poor people of every color the administration of the home ownership loan corporation the federal housing administration and the public housing program discriminated against black people and increased segregation as did the education and housing programs of the gi bill new deal policies increased the economic gap between black people and white people it was martin luther king jr whom sanders cites favorably in his speech and other civil rights leaders who picked up the torch for fdr s economic bill of rights in the 1960s with their 1963 march on washington for jobs and freedom 1966 freedom budget and 1968 poor people s campaign they demanded an economic bill of rights but this time with the indispensable addition that the programs be administered equitably without racial discrimination that is the anti racist torch we must pick up today in campaigning for the economic bill of rights anti racism is one of the reasons we call for a green new deal in order to distinguish it from the racism of the old new deal those 1960s civil rights leaders saw their demands for universal economic rights as a means of undermining the white racial backlash that was then mounting in reaction to the passage of federal civil rights laws white workers were being mobilized against civil rights and desegregation by the dixiecrat democrats and the goldwater republicans blacks were scapegoated as a threat to white workers jobs and economic well being competition for limited opportunities and resources provided a material underpinning for white racism in turning from civil rights to human rights the civil rights movement believed they needed to secure economic rights for all in order to secure civil rights for black people they intended to undercut racism by leading an interracial movement of poor and working people for economic rights for all as a philip randolph the socialist labor leader who conceived of the march on washington put it we must liberate not only ourselves but our white brothers and sisters the failure of the democrats to implement the economic bill of rights during the johnson administration when they held the presidency and both houses of congress in the 1960s ultimately led to the white backlash taking power today in the form of donald trump an important part of the way to beat back his negative program of racist scapegoating is still the same a positive program of economic rights for all old fashioned new deal liberalism is not enough it will take socialist economic democracy to secure economic rights for all
this article is more than 4 years old henry milleo picture alliance via getty images they rally around him though it has little to do with him and more to do with proving a point their side is right the other side is wrong and mean and oppressive and cranking up the volume on the social media outrage machine fascists suffering from all sorts of social phobias ex president luiz inacio lula da silva is merely a symbol he symbolizes the notion that those on the political left are society s biggest victims except that brazil s new left are not the downtrodden the illiterate and the old they are the well educated who know something about postcolonial theory and the well traveled who spent months abroad or even live abroad now since climate change will destroy the world in 12 years they have no time to play nice they must fight they must resist anyone who does not see things as they do in the lula year s they resisted too only it was different they resisted a weak economy they resisted a lopsided nation with the rich in the south and deep poverty in the north they resisted the government that made all those things possible then lula s workers party pt became the government then they nearly broke it they got kicked out of power one by one fabio vieira fotorua nurphoto via getty images now lula is in jail for his role in the petrobras bribe scandal he is the most famous national leader sitting in prison anywhere in the world but he is no nelson mandela many people were victims of the scandals that unfolded in the lula years thousands of people lost their jobs petrobras retirees saw their petrobras shares drop 80 in value over an eight year period brazil s left became radicalized again in 2016 when then president dilma rousseff of the pt was about to be impeached the party s splinter groups created in lula s first term when some politicians became dissatisfied with his government s pragmatism and lackluster environmental policies have moved further left their supporters are like american progressives on twitter their followers wear it with a badge of honor leftist esquerdista marxist marxista palestinian flags cuban flags no brazilian flags female gender pictograms even if a man maybe even a nod to veganism almost a sacrilege in brazil brazil s new left led by academics and the jet set version of the media a list consider lula a political prisoner those right wingers as now personified by new president jair bolsonaro are out to get them all first it s lula then it s them he supported the military dictatorship in the cold war years the very dictatorship that abused women like dilma a real political prisoner mathematically that means bolsonaro is a fascist dictator who hates women associated press not too long ago brazil s intelligentsia were mostly all tucanos the nickname given to the social democracy party psdb lula was uneducated a simple man with bad manners who s never been to paris he had more in common with the brazilian working stiff than he had with a university of são paulo professor now lula is suddenly their che guevara these academics and surely their students who support left wing politics have more in common with their peers in the bay area of san francisco than lula s traditional base brazil s new left is more in tune with brooklyn new york than with the men and women working on an assembly line in abc paulista they have little to nothing in common with the poor guy in pernambuco lula s home state who sells cheese on a stick at the beach they worry about him mostly from far away they might stress out about his pension on twitter if they tweet more maybe they can exact justice for their side in brazil big picture justice is symbolized by freeing lula his freedom proves their point the courts are corrupt against them and greedy right wing politicians or the english language media s preferred term far right politicians are running roughshod over them those in the opposition are racist they are homophobic it sounds familiar doesn t it paulo fridman 2016 bloomberg finance lp like here they have youtubers like the mamaefalei channel momma says who send camera crews into left wing protest movements to ask them questions sometimes they get punched in the face like here they have people who carve themselves up with swastikas in order to blame supporters of a president they hate the story makes the rounds until it falls flat raising way more questions than it answers brazil s new left is as hysterical as ours they are relentless at making their point heard over and over and over and over again the man they want free oversaw the ransacking of brazil s greatest state owned enterprise petrobras whose money subsidizes gasoline prices for the masses donates millions to protect wildlife off brazil s coast and in brazil s pantanal and funds local movie productions it was so bad for petrobras once the truth came to light that some people on wall street wondered whether it would delist and default on its debt if lula is innocent and only brazil s left and their international media junky friends believe so then at the very least he and his party were asleep at the wheel lula supporters won t even agree to that given the fact that the petrobras bribe schemes happened under pt governments then their incompetence created this mess a mess that undeniably rests on their shoulders it is unmatched gross negligence lula supporters won t agree to that either truth be told lula was one of the most beloved presidents in brazil s modern history at a time he was the most popular president in all of the americas barack obama referred to lula as the man because he was so popular many low income brazilians like lula not because of social welfare programs but because lula was brought up like them he s a metal shop worker who speaks their language and did it well he was and is a strong character and a strong leader it is heartbreaking for millions of brazilians who support him to see him end up this way to brazil s new left saying lula is in jail because he is corrupt is like calling them stupid even if you re not calling them stupid it drives them nuts lula is not corrupt he is the victim of a witch hunt he is innocent if you don t see that there is something wrong with you it s like talking to a democrat who thinks russia still colluded with trump and that trump is vladimir putin s spy in the oval office if you don t believe that it s because you are watching fox news in prime time patricia monteiro 2018 bloomberg finance lp lula has eight more cases against him in the petrobras car wash scandal he will either be in jail or under house arrest for the rest of his life it s sad for some but true for all lula stood up for the poor but he was no modern day social justice warrior he also was not one to get caught up in race relations like today s new left he wasn t anti gay but give him a few shots of pinga and no doubt he would fire off something that would get him banned from twitter if today s young liberal brazilian was within earshot also like the u s opposition to trump brazil s left uses media and social media as a weapon to ridicule and ostracize one day they will follow in the footsteps of their american activist counterparts and organize bans on advertisers attached to individuals they despise they are already censoring facebook brazil recently censored a conservative activist group called movimento brasil livre from advertising this weekend s pro car wash march the temporary blocking of their account occurred on tuesday the group said the day the supreme court was deciding lula s fate again facebook probably mistakenly as always blocked access to mbl s site but we can also assume facebook s brazilian progressives who hate bolsonaro and believe lula is a political prisoner didn t want people to know about the march by 11 a m são paulo time car horns were already blaring down avenida paulista in support of the petrobras investigators who doubts that facebook brazil techies are not itching to define those organizers as a hate group who to the left of lula doesn t think that mbl is a hate group lula never did this sort of thing though he did once threaten to take away the journalism visa of new york times correspondent larry rohter for an article that many journalists saw as a hit piece against lula which brings us to brazil s new media outlets offshoots of the american liberal resistance press the huffpo buzzfeed and the the intercept led by glenn greenwald of ed snowden fame have given brazil s progressives a new way to frame their issues wrapped in an american brand oddly enough greenwald is considered a shill for trump here due to his criticism of the media s handling of the trump russia story but in brazil greenwald is the new left s gringo of choice he was one of the only foreign journalists to interview dilma during her impeachment and lula while in jail the opposition in brazil hates this guy so much that their terms of endearment for himwords cannot be used here david paul morris 2018 bloomberg finance lp the intercept is basically expanding the international left s view against the new government thinks thiago aragao a partner and strategy director for arko advice a brasilia based political risk firm they see how that media strategy plays out in the u s and has chipped away at the populist government in hungary says aragao who is also a senior associate at the center for strategic and international studies in washington it was greenwald at the intercept not a mainstream brazilian media outlet nor one linked to pt like brasil 24 7 that leaked conversations showing key petrobras crime fighter sergio moro talking smack about lula three weeks ago it was a terrible look for moro brazil s new left of which greenwald is surely a part his husband david miranda is a congressman and member of the socialism and liberty party psol was convinced that lula would be granted a mistrial ap photo armando franca the intercept s story reverberated first on brazil s twitter then foreign correspondents in brazil picked it up and ran with it retweeting each other s comments patting each other on the back in a veiled i knew it praising the work of true investigative journalism the supreme court was forced to reconsider lula s verdict thanks to greenwald but greenwald failed to free lula like the left had hoped obviously the supreme court did not have the evidence that greenwald had and claims he has more of his latest anti car wash info may have as many gaffes as revelations which is making greenwald look like the democratic party advocates cheering on the russia investigation the very crowd he s been criticizing for nearly two years it is unclear what other info he has and whether it will be more damning brazil s new left looks formidable but may really be a 200 pound weakling their strength comes from social media amplification which then turns into global news stories by the traditional media whose reporters are following those voices on facebook and twitter primarily the volume of intensity from the left on twitter in brazil is equal to what you see in the u s but like here they just spend a lot of time whipping each other into a frenzy rather than looking at the facts on the ground says kevin ivers director of the dci group a political risk consultancy in washington d c psol congressman jean wyllys known by most in brazil to be a drama queen is a recent example of the new left s feeding frenzy on anything proving their oppression wyllys was receiving death threats he says the threats were coming from bolsonaro supporters bolsonaro is famous for saying he would disown his children if they came out as gay wyllys who is also gay said he did not feel safe in bolsonaro s brazil and packed his bags he supposedly lives in spain greenwald s husband miranda took his seat in congress the wyllys story set twitter alight the international media picked it up predictably yet another example that brazil s choice of bolsonaro over pt was a bad mistake psol is one of the pt splinter parties created in the early 2000s it is mostly a rio de janeiro based political party full of people from high society who live in sheltered neighborhoods like urca and the activist minded middle class who are trying to save rio s shanty towns known as favelas they volunteer their time in poor public schools smack dab in the middle of brazil s biggest war zone people get shot and people die it s a mess not unlike brazil s gnarly politics psol is the progressive democrat worried about human rights abuses by the state more than violent crimes committed by the citizenry the traditional pt hard hat voter is worried about getting his kid to school without getting caught in a crossfire between warring dope gangs this is where the new left gets totally lost they only look big because their message is amplified on social media outlets that are also down with the cause eric baradat afp getty images the sloganeering the intercept articles the free lula movement and the talking points on globo news have chipped away at bolsonaro and moro s popularity pt will survive but pt is not the new left either progressives who wear the red star banner of the pt split for the red sun of psol or other tiny parties like the communist party of brazi or they may realize that the bulk of the country does not see things their way as time moves forward and hopes of lula s return dim politicians from the progressive left will have to perform in order to bring in new voters under new laws designed to reduce the number of political parties in brazil a party needs 3 of the national vote or they are not getting a seat in the national congress even if they are winning larger percentages in rio and sao paulo the rule takes affect in 2030 they need to expand the progressive message nationwide to get more voters in order to survive says filipe carvalho a brazil analyst for eurasia group in washington d c let s face it the lula left or better yet the lula base voter is low income or from big labor a minority of them are from academia and the student body enamored by lula s charisma brazil s new left is not that they have more in common with aoc than cut that s new york s progressive newcomer alexandria ocasio cortez and pt s biggest base the central workers union photo by castellotti brazil s new left does not have the vision that the u s left has for the country says carvalho their main issue is opposing bolsonaro and freeing lula they are only held together by that bond analyzing this from afar and sticking with a u s centric point of view brazil s new left got woke lula was never woke if he is freed from jail he won t get woke lula s time is up his best case scenario now is a mistrial highly unlikely and almost wholly dependent on greenwald or house arrest the old left s hero is in jail the new left is still searching for one if lula s petrobras bribery scandal had never come to light and busted hundreds of people in the process many bolsonaro voters would prefer lula over this this new crop of hysterical left wingers lula voters gave up on the pt because of petrobras that s how bolsonaro won and the left lost bolsonaro might look at them from afar and wave saying to them all tchau queridos

the international monetary fund urged deeper cooperation among world economies in order to reduce tariffs and remove other obstacles to global trade its managing director said in my discussions with g20 leaders i noted that the global economy has hit a rough patch investment has weakened and trade has slowed significantly with export and import growth rates at their lowest level since the great financial crisis the imf managing director christine lagarde said at the end of the summit of group of 20 nations in osaka japan on saturday even though the imf expects growth to strengthen somewhat going forward the risks to the outlook remain serious she noted the biggest among these risks ms lagarde said is the uncertainty clouding global trade on the back of retaliatory tariffs imposed by the world s two biggest economies the us and china last week the two countries agreed to restart trade negotiations that broke down last month a move that has removed an immediate threat to global growth for the time being leaders from the g20 countries the european union and several other countries and international organisations were invited to participate in the discussions at the osaka summit which aimed to explore key issues related to the international financial system the talks this year were taking place againts the backdrop of a slowdown in the world economy the imf in april downgraded its global growth forecasts for this year mainly due to persistent trade tensions between the us and china and a slowing chinese economy global gross domestic product growth is projected to slow to 3 3 per cent in 2019 down from the 3 5 per cent the imf had forecast for 2019 in january the world economy is forecast to rise to 3 6 per cent in 2020 and plateau at 3 6 per cent in the medium term sustained by the increase in the relative size of economies such as those of china and india that will outpace the growth of advanced and emerging market economies the washington based lender said in its latest world economic outlook the cut in growth is the third time the imf has downgraded its global outlook in the past six months the 2019 outlook is also the weakest since the financial crisis reflecting slowing growth in most advanced economies and signs that higher reciprocal export tariffs introduced by the us and china last year are weighing on trade while the resumption of trade talks between the us and china is welcome tariffs already implemented are holding back the global economy and unresolved issues carry a great deal of uncertainty about the future ms lagarde said i reiterated that the priority should be to reduce obstacles to trade new and old tariffs and otherwise and to address the underlying sources of trade tensions and distortions global economies need a trading system fit for today s world which means addressing gaps in the international rule book including areas such as agricultural and industrial subsidies services and e commerce the imf chief noted the imf welcomed japanese prime minister shinzo abe s announcement of the osaka track framework relating to data flow and e commerce and joined other leaders in calling for accelerated reform of the world trade organisation improvements in fiscal policy to balance global debt levels that has spiralled in recent years and reforms to support productivity and employment are among the other areas the imf underlined the g20 must also continue efforts to address corporate taxation issues and regulations around financial corruption climate change and women s empowerment it added while the global economy is at a precarious stage with the right policies and working together we can overcome the challenges we face and set the world on a path of stronger more sustainable balanced and inclusive growth ms lagarde said

created by the crack quiz team at the times of chester county pa copyright 2019 all rights reserved no reproduction without express written permission in order to help the right thinking citizens of chester county we wanted to offer this helpful quiz to find out if you are a victim of creeping socialism or a good upstanding american capitalist for each yes give yourself one point for each no well sorry comrade nothing for you because the state has it all now do you store all of your funds in offshore accounts refusing to use publicly guaranteed banks or credit unions are you not an attorney if yes 5 points sorry comrade your entire career is subsidized by public money have you always refused to use a public park or attend a sporting event or concert at a publicly funded venue will you pass on medicare and use only private health insurance for the rest of your life explanations and background of questions although right thinking americans beat back the socialist wave of the 1780s and 1790s when government tried to build and maintain roads privately funded toll roads and turnpikes were the most useful roads in the country until about 1850 when socialists pushed public funding of railroad right of ways and takeover of formerly private roads when they went bankrupt due to railroad steam boat competition those socialist pilgrims ruined it for everyone by decreeing public schools in the massachusetts bay colony in 1647 for two centuries the colony state socialist haven will lead the way on public education other states sheep like will follow suit such as pennsylvania socialists including benjamin franklin in philadelphia started the union fire company in 1736 thus forever ruining the possibility of a more capable private sector managing fire control boston in that socialist haven of massachusetts started its first full time public police force in 1836 forcing private companies out of business new england stuck again here with the first publicly funded library in petersburg new hampshire in 1833 it would be a number of years before they could lend our das kapital however that arch villain socialist franklin d roosevelt signed the social security act into law in 1935 allowing old age payments rather than honoring the time tested tradition of allowing old folks to die in the streets of starvation as right thinking americans know is proper in 1965 lyndon johnson signed the law creating medicare and medicaid socializing medicine for the old and the poor keeping them alive when natural selection and market forces as the good lord intended would not have america has been poorer for it since although the first arguably public hospital opened in philadelphia in 1751 once again with franklin as a driving force with a 2 000 grant from the pennsylvania general assembly such dangerous socialist ventures were rare before 1860 after the civil war advances in medical science led to the establishment of dozens of public not for profit hospitals although it has taken decades to battle back the socialism today s excellent highly affordable for profit health care system continues to beat back challenges from the likes of obamacare and medicare for all while the first continental congress obviously full of socialists refused to hire mercenaries to fight the british who were right thinking enough to do so it established the united states army in 1775 funded by tax dollars although it and later armed forces such as the u s navy the u s marines and the u s air force have waxed and waned over the decades and this socialist cash grab now accounts for about 15 of the total federal government budget the first public park in the american colonies was sigh again started by those boston socialists boston commons in 1640 after an obviously rigged public vote this ugly trend continued before before the 20th century but only sporadically then through an accident of history the radical socialist theodore roosevelt distant cousin of fdr and fellow traveller created scores of national parks national forests and wildlife preserves all in places where strip mining deforestation and oil drilling would have been more right thinking this led to the obviously insane practice of preserving open space and preventing right thinking capitalists from free market economic development yup tax breaks and special perks for corporations are as old as the u s itself with alexander hamilton getting the first known tax break from new jersey another well known bed of socialism in 1791 since world war ii they ve grown increasingly popular meaning many large profitable companies pay a lower effective tax rate than the average taxpayer every court in the country is paid for and managed by government funds taxpayer money this is enshrined in the u s constitution and was codified the judiciary act of 1789 forcing all americans to pay for judges and lawyers to well argue and make a lot of money off your backs previous solutions involving swords guns and or fisticuffs settled legal disputes much more swiftly without government intervention see above basically all attorneys are dependent on the socialist state without laws and courts they d just be annoying people in bad suits instead they get piles of money from the rest of us although publicly funded prisons have been part of the us government since about 1790 replacing executions as the cost effective go to punishment for most crimes various efforts to get tough on crime have lead to some 7 million people soaking up free room and board at public expense although some private prison companies now exist they are still funded by public funds obviously at a higher cost than simple executions teddy roosevelt strikes again in 1906 just because a few ok thousands of people died from ingesting contaminated fake or dangerous cures a bit of rugged individualism and allowing people to learn which products worked and which didn t would have worked just fine but socialists like tr insisted on passing the pure food and drug act allowing government to interfere with right thinking companies selling dangerous or poisonous products
if you re brave or lazy enough to be a totally hands off investor congratulations you ve got a nice surprise coming when you open your second quarter account statements you ll likely notice a bump higher from three months earlier most types of investments did well from april through june with u s stocks setting record highs bond funds packing a year s worth of returns into three months and gold hitting its highest price in six years but chronic checker uppers those who looked at their funds every few days or weeks know how bumpy the ride was getting there investors had to stomach losses of more than 6 for their s p 500 index funds in may in between the records set in april and again in june anyone holding funds with stocks from developing economies absorbed even bigger losses as worries rose about worsening trade relations between the united states and countries around the world it was the federal reserve that ended up making the second quarter a success story for most investors the central bank hinted that it may cut interest rates this year to help the economy an about face from its direction just a few months ago after raising rates in december for the seventh time in two years the fed intimated early this year that it would hold steady on rates now some investors expect it to cut rates up to three times this year here s a look at some of the trends that made the quarter bonds delivered strong steady returns while other markets shook bonds are supposed to be the ballast for any portfolio and they more than lived up to that reputation during the second quarter while stock markets around the world careened up and down bonds funds not only pumped out regular interest payments but also rose in price the largest bond fund by assets returned 2 8 for the quarter as of tuesday more than it returned in four of the last six full years prices for bonds rise when yields fall and the 10 year treasury s yield dropped below 2 during the quarter for the first time since 2016 just don t expect returns to stay this big for bond funds in the future there s less cushion said gene tannuzzo deputy global head of fixed income at columbia threadneedle investments with the 10 year yield moving in a range of 2 00 to 2 04 earlier this week down from 2 50 early in the quarter there s simply less room for yields to fall to push up prices for bonds lower yields also mean investors buying bonds today pocket less in income unless there s a recession which would likely cause a steep drop in rates bond funds will likely return no more than they re yielding many voices along wall street expect rates to stay close to where they are deutsche bank s dws recently cut its forecast for where u s treasury yields will be a year from now by 0 30 percentage points down to 2 00 for the 10 year treasury for example at wells fargo asset management the forecast is for 2 00 to 2 50 on the 10 year treasury at the end of the year bonds are unlikely to repeat the performance we ve seen in the last six months said tannuzzo but given the fed they can still be that consistent ballast buy and hold was a winning strategy again for stock investors for years those with strong stomachs have consistently been rewarded for seeing any dip in the stock market as a buying opportunity in may investors began to doubt that as stocks sank after president donald trump threatened to raise tariffs first on china and then on mexico investors pulled a net 12 9 billion out of u s stock funds according to morningstar even index funds which have been hoovering up cash in recent years saw outflows as investors scrambled to get out of the way of tumbling markets but those who stuck with stocks were quickly rewarded in early june when fed chairman jerome powell gave the first hints that the central bank could cut rates the fed held rates steady at its meeting in the middle of june but investors are nearly certain that it will cut rates at its meeting at the end of july the s p 500 returned to a record on june 20 and the largest u s stock fund returned 2 9 for the quarter as of tuesday the european central bank has also indicated its willingness to help the economy and foreign stock funds recouped much of their losses from earlier in the quarter the average emerging market stock fund returned 0 3 in the quarter as of tuesday after being down as much as 5 5 earlier in the quarter gold glittered again after years of oscillating between roughly 1 000 per ounce and 1 400 per ounce gold broke above the range during the quarter for the first time since 2013 again look toward the fed rate cuts tend to help the price of gold by holding down the value of the dollar against other currencies and opening the possibility of higher inflation
resilience is set to become the key issue as we look forward to h2 as i note in a new analysis for icis chemical business none of us have ever seen the combinations of events that are potentially ahead of us and none of us can be sure which way they will develop so it seems essential that we start to create contingency plans to build corporate resilience ahead of their possible arrival of course we can all hope that we are just seeing a series of false alarms and that business as usual will end up as the outcome but hope is not a strategy even if we optimistically believe it is an 80 probability the scale of the potential problems under more pessimistic scenarios suggests it would be prudent to decide ahead of time how to tackle them everyone will have their own list of possible outcomes mine is as follows business as usual central bank rate cuts avoid recession risk presidents trump and xi reach stable agreement to roll back tariffs oil market tensions disappear in the middle east brexit uncertainty is put on hold with another extension period sustainability concerns over single use plastics are put on back burner central bank rate cuts avoid recession risk presidents trump and xi reach stable agreement to roll back tariffs oil market tensions disappear in the middle east brexit uncertainty is put on hold with another extension period sustainability concerns over single use plastics are put on back burner gathering clouds china s vast offshore borrowing creates increasing risk of corporate defaults as growth slows particularly if the trade war continues geo political risks mount in the middle east brexit leads to major friction between the uk and eu27 more major consumer products companies decide to end use of single use plastics china s vast offshore borrowing creates increasing risk of corporate defaults as growth slows particularly if the trade war continues geo political risks mount in the middle east brexit leads to major friction between the uk and eu27 more major consumer products companies decide to end use of single use plastics storm warnings issued debt problems morph into major bankruptcies impacting a range of supply chains around the world us iran tensions mount in the middle east causing oil prices to rise sharply regional tensions mount as the world settles into a new cold war between the usa and china polymer volumes are hit by a rapid escalation of consumer concerns over single use plastics asia is likely to prove the catalyst for this potential next crisis if it hits china has begun to deleverage over the past 2 years taking 2tn out of its high risk shadow banking sector but unfortunately this tightening has driven many of the riskiest businesses into the offshore dollar markets where naïve western fund managers have rushed to place their bets driven by their need to achieve higher returns than are available in their domestic bond markets if world trade continues to slow as the chart from reuters shows and the remnimbi starts to weaken then some of these borrowers will inevitably default in turn this risks a chain reaction across world markets impacting not only the zombies but also their supply chain partners what would your company do in these circumstances as the american writer ernest hemingway noted in the sun also rises there are two ways to go bankrupt gradually then suddenly and the suddenness of the final stage makes it almost impossible for companies to survive if they have not used the gradual stage to create contingency plans history unfortunately shows that when markets turn executives suddenly find they have very little time in which to think through how to respond governments will also be in the line of fire due to their debt levels and it is unlikely that politicians will know how to respond they used to be clear about the key issue for the voters as bill clinton famously observed in 1992 it s the economy stupid but today s politicians instead simply assume that central banks can always print more money to overcome financial and economic crises they have forgotten the simple mnemonic that many of us learnt at school namely that to assume can make an ass of u and me time spent now on building your company s resilience to potential future challenges may therefore prove time very well spent if hopes for business as usual turn out to have been wishful thinking please click here if you would like to download the full article
for a working man i mean a black working man you could hope to be one of those pullman porters but the next best thing was to earn top dollar over in a packinghouse this sentiment expressed by a chicago meatpacking worker was echoed by many black workers in the early to mid twentieth century though jobs in meatpacking were always among the better industrial jobs available it was the united packinghouse workers of america upwa that made the industry a leading source of economic stability racial justice and workplace empowerment for black workers the material gains achieved by the upwa in collective bargaining elevated black packinghouse workers into the loosely defined blue collar middle class but the union offered much more than that the story of the upwa is an inspiring example of multiracial unionism and labor s broader political engagement beyond its membership in many urban areas packing houses were the largest and most important multiracial institution around african americans eastern europeans irish germans scandinavians and native born protestants could all be found laboring in meatpacking plants across the country oral histories of the experience of black workers in these plants provided at length in the excellent work meatpackers by rick halpern and roger horowitz give us deep insight into the crucial role the union played in improving the lives of working class black people during this period the upwa used shop floor actions to fight boldly against racial and gender discrimination on the job and made a point of challenging racist attitudes among white union members in the name of class unity the relentless activism of the upwa did not stop at the plant gates however upwa leaders used their engaged membership to take on civil rights initiatives that mattered in the communities where workers lived the struggles of meatpacking workers provide an excellent model for how unions today can address the fight against racist and xenophobic views among union members and inequalities in other realms of society a spotlight on the upwa also provides a corrective to simplistic claims about the labor movement s role in perpetuating racism and the relationship between class politics and the fight against racial discrimination black meatpacking workers did not see class based organizing as inadequate or an impediment to their fight for racial equality as the words of these workers show they saw their union as the primary institution they could use to secure a life of dignity in every sense of the word growth of an industry before 1860 small local firms provided most meat because perishable items could not be shipped over long distances the technological breakthrough of refrigerated train cars facilitated the creation of large meatpacking firms in or near urban rail hubs like many other industries at the time large scale industrial production brought with it specialization and division of labor highly skilled butchers gradually became replaced by knife workers and laborers with very narrowly defined tasks the work still remained labor intensive due to the inconsistent size of meat stock and the difficult angles required for cutting machine operators and helpers were only 20 percent of the workforce the goal of securing steady employment in meatpacking plants attracted many southern blacks to northern industrial centers during the great migration of the 1910s as in many other industries black workers were primarily used as strikebreakers in the early twentieth century this was the perfect tool for employers to reinforce fragmentation within the working class and distrust between workers of different races many american federation of labor afl unions excluded blacks at the time which of course all but ensured that those same workers would be easily recruited to break strikes black male workers consistently worked in the more physically demanding jobs with environmentally dangerous conditions in the rendering house and hide cellar workers absorbed disgusting odors on top of developing skin problems and respiratory illnesses on the killing floor they dealt with chronic back injuries and temperatures over 100 degrees during the summer months however it was on the killing floor that workers had the greatest leverage after all production cannot start until dead animals are available to cut and process women mostly worked in departments that developed processed food white women dominated in cleaner jobs like bacon slicing black women primarily worked in offal and casing departments where they prepared organs like intestines bladders and hearts in casings workers often suffered from pneumonia rheumatism and arthritis the process of engaging black workers in union activity was long and painful in 1904 there was unity among skilled butchers and unskilled immigrant laborers during a national strike the company brought in large numbers of black strikebreakers and racial violence ensued many working class black people seemed to be permanently alienated from trade unionism because of experiences such as these hopes for multiracial unionism in meatpacking revived during world war i which caused a severe labor shortage and greater leverage for workers the suspension of immigration from europe also led to the massive recruitment of black workers to the industry the stockyards labor council slc was created in 1917 and by 1918 it had enrolled 90 percent of chicago s white packinghouse workers organizing southern black migrants proved difficult because major black institutions like churches and newspapers were anti union meatpacking companies cynically curried favor with these institutions in order to exploit this division to the fullest as shop floor militancy increased throughout the war secretary of war newton baker was forced to create a mediation commission in the hopes that it would prevent disruptions in key industries arbitration produced concrete advances for chicago packinghouse workers an eight hour workday forty eight hour work week dollar a week raise and overtime provisions this victory opened up the way for huge membership gains among previously skeptical black workers black shop stewards began serving alongside whites and the union sponsored multiracial social events such as picnics and dances the end of the war however immediately turned the labor shortage into a labor surplus the chicago race riot of 1919 further destroyed hopes of a multiracial union and the slc soon collapsed taking advantage of the opening packing firms withdrew from the arbitration agreement and unilaterally reduced wages in 1921 the amalgamated meat cutters amc called a strike but again black workers were used as scabs and the union was defeated as the amc became further discredited packing companies set up welfare programs that won the allegiance of a significant number of workers a special effort was made to nurture a following among skilled black workers deemed strike insurance by one company executive the coming of the cio by the 1930s black packinghouse workers were no longer recent migrants without industrial experience they had been able to win at least a small degree of respect and confidence from their white coworkers the failed strike of 1921 proved to many whites that support from black workers was absolutely essential if the union were to win any strike white packinghouse worker gertie kamarczyk said they didn t come in and hug em and kiss em but they knew they had to be together period even though some of them were anti negro they still knew you had to be together to form a union and to win some of their demands packinghouse workers rode the wave of organizing breakthroughs made by the congress of industrial organizations cio in the mid 1930s many of which involved significant numbers of black workers in october 1937 the steelworkers organizing committee swoc helped to form the packinghouse workers organizing committee pwoc the swoc sent the brilliant orator and prominent black trade unionist henry johnson to work on the organizing drive the pwoc set up departmental organizations and stewards boards with deliberate representation from different ethnic groups union organizers constantly reminded black workers that the union could push back against racist management practices the local at the chicago armour plant won a major victory against discrimination by getting rid of the stars on black workers time cards these stars served no other purpose that to single out blacks for layoffs in several cities there were even strikes by majority white plants to stop discriminatory practices including a plant occupation in kansas city in 1938 in 1943 delegates from hundreds of meatpacking local unions voted to form the united packinghouse workers of america fighting discrimination on the job from the beginning the upwa made it a priority to fight racism on the shop floor and in the meatpacking labor market in 1950 the union formally adopted a robust anti discrimination program and encouraged civil rights initiatives throughout the union the integration of segregated departments dressing rooms and other plant facilities was one of the first priorities they also sought to end hiring discrimination against black women at the plant and in the broader community as an aid to these initiatives the union tried to work with and influence community organizations such as the naacp one black worker recalled how local union officials told reluctant white workers either work with them or find another job that was spelled out to them and they cooperated very nicely black workers were strongly committed to the idea that the union could only survive on the basis of racial unity in the plants philip weightman steward and worksite leader at the chicago swift plant described how he fought to keep the union from dividing along ethnic lines we could not cater to whites and we could not cater to the blacks this is the principle on which this union is organized no second class citizenship we never met with a black group or a white group it was always bringing together by consistently stressing the material benefits the union was winning they were able to convince some hesitant white workers to support the multiracial union many packinghouse workers claimed they made a religion of unity exciting demonstrations of shop floor power were used to enforce racial equality within the plants this was especially true of the workers who were part of the second phase of the great migration and entered the plants during world war ii they tended to be more militant and had higher expectations sam park and charles hayes were part of this cohort in chicago and decided to take matters in their own hands when management refused to hire black women in the bacon slice department they led a group of black workers from the killing floor up to management s office still dripping in blood and sat on their desks until the company relented the union was also instrumental in helping black women secure employment in meatpacking plants they were supported by other efforts to take on racism in the labor movement for example rowena moore became involved in an initiative directly inspired by a philip randolph s march on washington movement moore and others tried to secure employment for black women in omaha s defense industries and coordinated with packinghouse unionists this experience stayed with moore i ve said i ll always have a special love for the union because they did support getting the black women in there anti discrimination initiatives did not always go smoothly of course the 1952 national agreement with armour mandated desegregation of all plant facilities but in some locals white workers demanded that signs for separate facilities be reinstated which they promptly were by now however the national union was too invested in this fight to let it go easily upwa president ralph helstein threatened to strike the company and the signs were removed again most black workers had no illusions that the union was perfect or that it was going to be easy to fight discriminatory practices activists like rowena moore often butted heads with certain union officials who were more resistant on matters of racial and gender discrimination but most workers still believed that taking ownership of the union as a vehicle for transformative change was the best way forward in the words of moore if you re not satisfied with something you don t just pack up your books and go home you work with the group and try to change it or do something to improve it the organized left mostly in the form of the communist party was crucial to the success of multiracial organizing in many cases in the 1930s some younger black workers came into contact with the left in unemployment campaigns and its support for the scottsboro boys herbert march a white worker got involved in labor organizing through the young communist league and started working at the chicago armour packing plant in 1933 there he built a strong cp unit that was always at the forefront of fighting discrimination even black workers who were never interested in joining the communist party had to acknowledge their impressive track record when it came to fighting racism philip weightman said they talked multiracial anti discrimination i give them credit for that i may not have been as aggressive as i was if it hadn t been for them you see beyond the shop floor early in its life the upwa sent clear signals that it would get involved in issues beyond the plant gates at their second convention in 1944 the host hotel refused to house black delegates packinghouse leaders moved it to a cramped union hall despite 102 degree heat solidarity between black and white workers on the job was leveraged in fights to desegregate local bars restaurants and hotels a particularly effective tactic was to send teams of black and white workers into a local bar asking for service when the black workers were denied service whites would also walk out back at the union hall a complaint would be filed with the state s attorney and usually the establishments would have to desegregate in fort worth texas the upwa was successful in desegregating both the holden hotel and tarrant county public schools this activity reflected a historical period when civil rights struggles had a decidedly working class character and were closely linked with the labor movement william rasberry a packinghouse worker in kansas city recalls the labor movement we were sort of like an advisory to the civil rights movement and we supplied the money this labor civil rights coalition reached its peak in the 1940s and 1950s and was based on a fundamental premise emphasized by leaders like a philip randolph and bayard rustin since the vast majority of african americans were working class a broadly social democratic program anchored in industrial unionism was the best way to advance their interests many of the campaigns mounted during the apex of southern civil rights activism targeted the specific political economic foundations of the jim crow system not an abstract white supremacy aside from union campaigns these included struggles around the poll tax fair hiring and public education by the end of world war ii there was consensus even among black moderates and liberals that expansion of the industrial union movement would be critical for further advancement as the 1960s unfolded black poverty was increasingly studied and explained in individualist psychological terms rather than in the context of political economy unfortunately the close connection between labor and civil rights during this period is often overlooked in historical accounts today to advance upwa s civil rights objectives black packinghouse workers took over many local naacp branches in places like chicago omaha and kansas city where this happened the class character of the naacp was changed from middle class to working class rowena moore so effectively dominated the naacp in omaha that management let her set up a table in the plant the upwa and allied community groups also turned their attention to opening up job opportunities for black workers in other industries william rasberry became regional vice president of the national negro labor council and targeted major industries that discriminated in hiring like airlines banks and department stores throughout martin luther king jr s career upwa was always a staunch ally of his they strongly supported the montgomery bus boycott and invited king to their anti discrimination conference
omodele adigun history they say always repeats itself this assertion proved true last monday when the governor of the central bank of nigeria cbn mr godwin emefiele fired a warning shot to the banking sector to brace up for another round of recapitalization akin to the one done by his predecessor prof chukwuma soludo 15 years ago which was tagged consolidation like soludo emefiele had said while unveiling his second term five year agenda 2019 2023 in abuja that the cbn management would work with relevant stakeholders to recapitalise commercial banks in the country to make them stronger to undertake greater risks it would be recalled that soludo had in his address on july 6 2004 announced a 13 point reform agenda for repositioning the cbn and the financial sector the recapitalisation policy was just one of the steps taken to sanitise the banking industry he had noted that the vision or prospect of the cbn and the federal government was a banking system that is part of the global change and which is strong and reliable especially with the prevailing global financial meltdown it is a banking system which must be efficient depositors can trust and investors can rely upon recapitalisation was then the policy thrust that required that the minimum capitalization for banks should be n25 billion as against the prevailing n2 billion with full compliance before the end of december 2005 that is 18 months rather than 12 months normally given in many countries only banks that met the requirement were licensed to undertake banking business while those that failed to meet up either merged or liquidated for the first time the nigerian banking industry witnessed merger between the small and big banks however banks that are able to exceed the capital requirement stand a better chance of luring customers and instilling confidence in the system the ensuing mergers and acquisitions m as involved 76 banks out of the initial 89 banks this brought down the number of banks to 25 moreso all the banks mobilized funds through initial public offering ipo and 14 bank licences were revoked the 76 banks represented 93 5 per cent of the deposit share of the market while the 13 banks that failed to meet the recapitalization requirement accounted for 6 5 per cent of the deposit share of the industry at the end of the 18 month consolidation recapitalization exercise the capital market witnessed a boost of n406 billion in market capitalization and n360 billion was accepted by the cbn in addition to foreign capital inflow of 654 million and 161 993 later ibtc and stanbic merged this brought the total numbers of banks operating in nigeria to 24 bankers and financial experts all over the world expressed satisfaction at the success of the policy which eliminated the old fashioned banking style for one that would move the economy forward 13 banks failed the consolidation exercise these are african express bank all states trust bank assurance bank city express bank eagle bank fortune international bank gulf bank lead bank liberty bank metropolitan bank societe generale bank of nigeria trade bank plc and triumph bank plc following the consolidation the banking industry and the country s economy were better off the benefits included roll out of more branches to reach the unbanked high paying jobs for graduates funding of big ticket transactions increased value to shareholders the emergence of mega banks promotion of choice products for consumers delivery of world class services among others and many nigerian banks opened offshore branches in africa europe china and the usa for the first time in history but while giving reasons for the impending recapitalisation exercise emefiele rationalized the move on capital depreciation of the lenders his words in the next five years we intend to pursue a programme of recapitalising the banking industry so as to position nigerian banks among the top 500 in the world banks will therefore be required to maintain higher level of capital as well as liquid assets in order to reduce the impact of economic crisis on the financial system soludo did the last recapitalisation exercise in 2004 and increased the capital base of banks from n2 billion to n25 billion it helped the banks and the economy become stronger we could now take up large ticket transactions but relate the value of n25 billion in 2004 when the exchange rate was about n100 dollar to now when the rate is n360 dollar that is about 75 million so we need to recapitalise it s a policy trust and will be discussing at committee of governors meeting and modalities will be unveiled for everyone to see sanusi era when mallam sanusi lamido sanusi was appointed on june 4 2009 by president umar yar adua as the cbn governor he pledged to give a sense of direction to the banking sector which was in dire need of close monitoring and supervision on assumption of office he carried out in depth review of the banking system and its operators he reversed most of soludo s policies due to a number of factors he identified eight interdependent factors that led to the fragile financial system that was pushed into crisis by the global economic meltdown and recession the eight main factors include macro economic instability caused by large and sudden capital inflows major failures in corporate governance in banks lack of investor and consumer protection inadequate disclosure and transparency about the financial position of banks critical gaps in regulatory framework and regulations uneven supervision and enforcement unstructured governance and management process at the cbn and weaknesses in the business environment in the country he announced a blueprint that is meant to change the mindset meet expectations of banking public restore confidence and stabilize the banking industry and grow the economy for the well being of nigerians the blueprint is anchored on four pillars namely enhancing the quality of banks establishing financial stability enabling healthy financial sector evolution and ensuring that financial sector contributes to real economy for record purpose the cbn governor having critically identified the weaknesses and strengths of the banking industry revealed his well articulated blueprint for banking reforms during the policy interviews he granted financial times of london on june 21 2009 barely two weeks after he assumed office and the second interview that was granted on december 19 2009 however mixed reactions trailed the reforms and policies of the apex bank the stakeholders in the financial sector expressed divergent views on sanusi s reforms and policies some stakeholders said his reforms rather than solving the problems in the financial sector had brought more problems to the sector and economy at large others however argued that his policies had impacted positively on the economy according to the cbn governor although the 24 banks had bad loans the negative capital of 10 of them was put at n1 5trillion the total estimate of non performing loans npls in the industry was summed up to n2 2 trillion with the eight banks that failed his audit test namely union bank afribank intercontinental bank bank phb spring bank oceanic bank finbank wema bank unity bank capital adjudged inadequate for operations and etb accounting for n1 5 trillion of the npls major highlights of the cbn reforms are sacking of indicted bank chief executive officers and executive directors injection of n620 billion into the eight bailed out banks categorisation of banks appointment of advisers for affected banks licensing of three credit bureau screening and interviews of managing directors executive and non executive directors establishment of the asset management corporation of nigeria amcon n500 billion for financing power sector projects restructuring and refinancing loans for smes and manufacturing sector and the introduction of the n200billion small and medium enterprises smes guarantee scheme since the banking sector is the hub around which all other economic activities revolve the health and prosperity of the bank is a major source of concern to nigerians especially the regulators according to soludo out of the 10 banks audited as at august 2009 the balance sheets of five of them union bank finbank oceanic bank afribank and intercontinental bank shrunk shareholders funds impaired and they had liquidity problems their huge exposure to non performing loans margin loans has affected the banks these banks had spent length of time at the expanded discount window edw introduced in september 2008 by the apex bank these five banks accounted for 90 per cent of transactions at the edw the remaining banks accounted for 10 per cent these banks took money from the inter bank to repay their exposure to the discount window it is an indication that their balance sheets had shrunk the management teams had acted in a manner that was detrimental to the interest of their depositors and creditors he added emefiele s era in september last year the apex bank revoked the operating licence of skye bank plc with immediate effect and licensed polaris bank to take its assets and liabilities emefiele explained that the decision was reached following the inability of the owners of the bank to shore up the capital of the distressed bank which had earlier received a n350 billion intervention in july 2016 skye bank requires urgent recapitalization as it can no longer continue to live on borrowed times with indefinite liquidity support from the cbn we have decided to establish a bridge bank polaris bank to assume the assets and liabilities of skye bank the strategy is for amcon to capitalize the bridge bank and begin the process of sourcing investors to buy out amcon diamond bank merged with access bank following the completion of its merger processes with diamond bank access bank plc last april 1 became the largest retail bank in africa by customer base spanning three continents 12 countries and with 29 million customers its executive director personal banking said that the merger created a nigerian banking powerhouse and a pan african financial services champion with 27 000 staff across 592 branches he said that with the successful merger the bank has a new visual identity which fuses the best of access bank and diamond bank financial standing of the banks as of last may the total assets and liabilities of the banks amounted to n38 641 8 billion at end of april 2019 showing a 0 5 per cent increase compared with the level at the end of the preceding month total specified liquid assets of banks stood at n13 634 3 billion at end of april 2019 representing 60 3 per cent of their total current liabilities at that level the liquidity ratio was 0 1 percentage point below the level at the end of the preceding month but was 30 3 percentage points above the stipulated minimum liquidity ratio of 30 0 per cent the loans to deposit ratio at 58 49 per cent was 1 0 percentage point lower compared with the level at the end of the preceding month and was lower than the maximum ratio of 80 0 per cent by 21 51 percentage points banks credit to the domestic economy rose by 0 6 per cent to n20 973 8 billion at end april 2019 compared with the level at the end of the preceding month reacting to the planned recapitalisation of banks president of the chartered institute of bankers of nigeria cibn dr uche olowu said there was no need for panic among bankers as the nigeria financial system remains stable he said that the whole idea of recapitalisation was to continue to sustain that stability in order to expand the scope of banks to do bigger businesses olowu said that the only thing the boards of these banks would do is to go back to the drawing board and restrategise ahead of the cbn s impending guidelines of the reapitalisation assuring the system will take care of itself with adequate planning asked if the policy would lead to mergers and acquisition the cibn boss said there was no need to preempt the cbn or banks but that the system will in itself unfold when the guidelines are released in his response to cbn s planned recapitalisation the chief executive officer of financial derivatives limited mr bismarck rewane said that the move was all about building buffers to enable them withstand shocks should there be any the economic expert said that the n25 billion recapitalisation in 2004 does not have the same value as what obtains in 2019 coupled with the differentials in exchange rate over a 15 year period he explained that when n25 billion is divided by n155 to one dollar which was the exchange rate in 2014 the dollar equivalent should now be multiplied by n360 to a dollar which is the current prevailing rate about n75 billion would be the result he said that what that means is that banks should be prepared to triple their shareholders fund or at best double their capital over a 15 year period saying it is a regulatory induced consolidation rewane said that compared to african banks nigerian banks are still strong considering what happened during the amcon induced consolidation of 2009 to 2012 when some banks bought into one another according to him some banks will have to increase their capital and not necessarily merge because the cbn has just licensed some banks which will also have to meet the new capital requirement is it true that the banks need higher capital to do their businesses the answer is yes let us take stock of the consolidation of 15 years ago has it led to increased financial inclusion and services has it reduced cost has it made nigerian banks competitive if the answer is yes then there may be no need for further recapitalisation but if the answer is no then there will be need to increase capital to make them regional giants also commenting of the planned bank recapitalisation policy the managing director cowry asset limited mr johnson chukwu said that it should be not be a one size fits all approach just like it was done in 2006 he said that given the level of advancement in banking regulation globally what the cbn should do in its latest effort is to design a guideline that will allow banks have capital that can sustain their operational risk capacity he argued that already the banking sector has the capital adequacy ratio that is clearly based on the risk portfolio a financial institution is exposed to for instance he said international banks have a higher level capital adequacy ratio compared to local banks that have lower ones i don t expect the cbn to come up with a blanket capital base requirement for all banks the need should be risk based for it to make meaningful impact he warned meanwhile the chairman chartered institute of bankers of nigeria cibn prof uche uwaleke has urged the cbn to raise new bank s capitalisation threshhold to n100 billion up from n25 billion the n25 billion is already eroded when you look at our exchange rate it is better to have 10 healthy banks than 20 that will be giving cbn headache the tier two banks are also the most exposed banks to npls the big five are not giving cbn much problem like the others bigger banks can easily bankroll larger businesses so if we are one of the 500 banks in the world we can play comfortably in the international league bigger banks have better corporate governance and monitoring by cbn is much easier fewer stronger banks will invest in the right technology to deliver better services he said

by henry munashe jaji adlai stevenson a former american vice president once said public confidence in the integrity of the government is indispensable to faith in democracy and when we lose faith in the system we have lost faith in everything we fight and spend for this statement underscores the importance of public confidence as a test of the efficacy of a government the fundamental principle of administrative law has always remained the same namely that in a democracy the people are supreme and hence all state authority must be exercised in the public interest in light of the preeminence of people in a democracy it is imperative that people feel that the administrative system is fair and efficient since the purpose of administrative law is to ultimately serve the interests of the people and the people must be confident about the administrative functioning there has been a raging debate among economists with supply side economists arguing that to stimulate economic growth a government must lower taxes spending and regulation keynesians on the other hand argue that the government should raise taxes and increase spending in order to stimulate growth i am a fan of the supply side economists but in addition to their ideas i believe a more urgent need in stimulating economic growth is to restore confidence in the future of our nation zimbabweans have lost faith in government institutions after the 2008 economic meltdown when the government badly mishandled what should have been a manageable financial crisis the 2009 2013 gnu ended the economic hemorrhaging but there is fear that the economy is going back to the dark experiences of 2008 the appointment of professor mthuli ncube as the minister of finance in september 2018 was received by the public with great expectations nine months down the line the once celebrated technocrat has done little if not nothing to restore confidence and hope into the zimbabwean public his announcement yesterday putting an end to multi currency regime vindicated all those who have always argued that zanu pf does not understand the nature and causes of zimbabwe s economic problems and can t be able to solve them the minister officially de dollarized the economy which has been dollarized for the past ten years dollarization can be defined as the holding by residents of a significant share of their assets in the form of foreign currency denominated assets usually it is differentiated between official or de jure and unofficial or de facto dollarization the former refers to the case in which foreign currency is given typically exclusive legal tender status this implies that the foreign currency is used for purposes a currency may have including as a unit of account for public contracts de facto dollarization represents the situation of a foreign currency being used alongside the domestic currency as means of exchange for transaction purposes i e as currency substitution from 2009 2016 zimbabwe had de facto dollarization and moved to de jure dollarization after the introduction of bond notes in 2016 the major reason why zimbabwe ended up dollarizing in 2009 was to stabilize the economy which was marred by hyperinflation caused by seigniorage foreign currency shortages which resulted in black market premium disruption of production especially in the agricultural sector and imported cost push inflation ten years down the line the minister has decided to de dollarize ironically citing the same reason that he intends to stabilize the economy but the fundamental conditions have not yet changed inflation is skyrocketing production is still subdued the black market is still being trusted more than the official market and the economy is still suffering from imported inflation at the center of all this is a continued deterioration of public confidence the government needs to shape public perception there is a strong sense that our ship of state is rudderless in a treacherous economic sea the minister is failing to deal with the basics a dysfunctional regulatory system that has brought us bank failures in the past 2 decades remains in place cobbled together with bailing wire john panonetsa mangudya remains the rbz governor regardless of him declaring that he was going to resign if bond notes were to fail the same mangudya who misrepresented that bond notes were not a currency but rather an export incentive restoring confidence in our institutions requires the political will to fix what is broken people are frightened by the policy inconsistencies that are characterizing mthuli s reign hardly three months ago was the minister on song swearing that the multi currency system was there to stay a position that he changed a few weeks ago saying zimbabwe was considering introducing a currency in nine months time and the currency came within a month with these inconsistencies it is difficult for any serious business to plan and it is difficult for any citizen to have confidence in whatever the government is trying to do unfortunately for mthuli ncube it is not what he is doing that matters but rather what he is seen to be doing by the public the de dollarization announcement of 24 june 2019 will put the final nail on the country s economic coffin in the short run retailers will likely respond by removing products from the shelves thereby creating artificial shortages forcing prices up these products will likely resurface on the black market and maybe sold in us dollars in the long run the same retailers will struggle to restock since most of their products are imported from south africa and they require foreign currency to restock in response to the rise in inflation the rbz is likely to respond by printing bigger bond notes denominations or bring them in a completely new zimbabwe dollar currency with government expected to increase civil servants salaries they are likely to fund this rise using the printing press this increase in money supply which will not be backed by an increase in production will likely cause inflation to increase further at the end of all this zimbabwe will be back to where it was on the eve of dollarization in 2009 and the government at that time will have to dollarize again in order to stabilize the economy mthuli needed to consult all stakeholders before making his announcement because he needed all stakeholders buy in for his new currency to see another day june 24 2019 will be remembered as a black monday and mthuli s announcement will be remembered in history as the catalyst to a spectacular fall from grace of the stock of a once celebrated technocrat mthuli will be remembered as the worst zimbabwe s finance minister in history history will remember him as one who failed to instill public confidence henry munashe jaji is an economics phd candidate based in australia he is also the mdc australia branch chairman he can be contacted on email or twitter gosawehumba
charles flores the other day a bright young tv presenter was publicly asking how and why the media seems so hooked on this never ending story of the pn crisis in the aftermath of the recent electoral debacles when there is so much else to which they could turn their attention quite obviously he was seeking to justify his station s blatant camouflage of the whole affair while the rest of us in blogs newspapers radio and tv continue to follow with bated breath events occurring in such rapid sequences that make one wonder whether the never ending story is actually meant to stop figuratively speaking it s like having a bowlful of apples desperately trying to work out which of them is actually the rotten one causing all the circus advertisement while the current pn saga has taken unprecedented twists and turns thanks mainly to that one rotten fruit that looks like the rest in the basket but is stinking brown inside this is not the first time the maltese media has had such a field day nor will it be the last we all remember the dom mintoff affair during alfred sant s two year labour government in the late 1990s sad though it was the media lapped it up as we followed the goings on frequently and strikingly similar to the present day pn scenario that eventually led to a hasty general election 1998 which unsurprisingly produced a dramatic second consecutive change of government that was more or less a never ending story as well the media again with the exception of the station having to defend the status quo fell like hawks on the protagonists with the ways things are going within the pn compound however it is difficult for anyone to foresee how the story is going to end when or if it ever does in the traditional maltese manner of dealing with near future issues the betting scale continues to oscillate between rupture and a coup both of course in the name of democracy ivan bartolo a member of the pn executive the one out of three namesakes with a penchant for resignations at least had the courage of his convictions and came out presenting what turned out to be a dubious two hundred signature petition for the party s general council to meet over the leadership issue not doing anything he argued could mean there would be no party and no democracy a bit grandiloquent one would say given that history is replete with parties that had died or almost died and been reborn the petition was in the meantime superseded by another petition this time from the incumbent s side calling for the rotten fruit to accept the reality of things as they have developed since 2013 in this ever changing state of affairs the media s concern is the pn s inability to officially identify the rotten apple and decide on how and when to remove it from the fruit bowl how can one expect the media to act differently when this never ending story continues to unfold into a soap opera of such quirky dimensions fake began a long time ago so it has now transpired that the moon rock given to the then dutch prime minister by the apollo 11 astronauts in 1969 was a fake previously valued at 308 000 the lunar rock is confirmed to actually be earth produced petrified wood the dutch have a queer sense of humour one of their tv stations once came all the way from amsterdam to interview me in the middle of mdina s main square asking why the maltese national jury which i chaired that year had chosen to include the dutch song in its vote when they themselves had thought it was such a poor composition now instead of crying shame at the americans easy these days with the donald at the helm and quickly throwing the stone into some nearby canal curators at amsterdam s rijksmuseum have said they will continue to keep it as a curiosity when it had not yet been declared a fake the moon rock used to attract thousands of visitors each year we can laugh about it was the stoic reaction from one of the museum s investigators see the assimilation but then nasa is known to have presented moon rocks to more than a hundred countries malta included following lunar missions in 1969 and the 1970s which inevitably brings me to our lunar rock was it a fake too i use the past tense since the stone was stolen from the national museum of natural history in may of 2004 and has since never been recovered our piece of now dubious lunar rock from apollo 17 presented to malta by us president richard nixon more than four decades ago was valued at a staggering 5 million if the maltese were also taken for a lunar ride the thief or whoever bought it from him must be simmering in his own skin had he stolen the maltese flag that was displayed next to the rock and which allegedly the us astronauts had taken up with them in their 1972 mission he would have made a better bargain can we laugh about it too golden comeback i know i know it s a fixation on my part as a purely curious amateur observer of things economic but i continue to wonder what gold reserves this booming national economy is yielding i am not using a metaphor for the unprecedented increase in the number of social benefits the reality of almost zero unemployment the drastic reduction of poverty the sustained achievement of a budgetary surplus and the rush of foreign investment i really mean gold reserves those shiny ingots nations keep hidden away for a rainy day throughout this month gold prices have rallied to six year highs powered by countries seeking to move away from the us dollar at a time when global central banks are accumulating gold reserves in record numbers china alone has purchased more than 70 tons of the precious metal since december in the first five months of this year russia added 78 tons having already stocked 274 tons last year in 2018 alone gold reserves of central banks around the world surged by 651 5 tons an increase of 74 per cent with the world s two largest economies the us and china involved in an aggravating trade conflict one can understand the current global hesitation but as malta happily slashes her debt to well below the eu benchmark how is our real gold doing
havana the cuban government said thursday that it is raising state salaries as part of a broader package of economic reforms but it revealed no details of its larger plan beyond increasing worker compensation a salary increase has long been seen as one of the first steps in the unification of cuba s unique dual currency system a process that could be a risky gambit in the face of an economic crisis exacerbated by tightened u s sanctions for the last quarter century cubans have used one peso worth about four cents and another worth nearly a dollar the stronger peso was introduced as a replacement for the dollars traded on the black market during the island s post soviet economic crisis in the 1990s over time the two currencies have come to be used by the communist government to set extremely low prices for goods and services considered basic rights and extremely high prices for others considered luxuries creating distortions that cripple economic growth cuban officials said díaz canel presided over an important meeting of the country s governing council of ministers on june 21 although they did not specify the agenda of the meeting the collapse of venezuela s economy has led to a cut in aid to cuba and sharp slowdown worsened by a series of trump administration measures designed to cut off funding to the island s government a meeting of the council of ministers approved economic measures to overcome the current situation and an increase in the state sector díaz canel wrote on twitter thursday evening he said details would be announced on state television at 8 p m when a state run newspaper tweeted that a wide ranging salary reform had been approved the president quickly responded that this is an incremental salary increase next comes the reform the announcement read on state television said that the minimum salary would be nearly 17 a month while the average salary would increase from 32 to 44 there were also slight rises in state pensions the announcement made repeated references to a variety of measures approved by the council of ministers but said only that in coming days our population will receive more detailed information about the extent of the reforms through various media arturo lopez levy a visiting assistant professor of political science at gustavus adolphus college in minnesota called the announcement a timid start to salary reform he said it could be part of an attempt to create more autonomy and incentives for increased production at state run enterprises whose operations have long been dictated by the central government it could cushion a future monetary unification but it won t really facilitate that by itself he said it helps nothing more under cuba s byzantine pricing system an average water bill denominated in cuban pesos will be a few dollars for example while home internet billed in the stronger convertible peso can cost hundreds of dollars a month while the average cuban must trade 24 or 25 cuban pesos for a convertible one many state run enterprises can obtain a convertible peso for 10 cuban pesos or even one peso a privilege that effectively subsidizes the state sector by many hundreds of millions of dollars a year every cuban has the right to a salary increase said dariel tejeda a 28 year old tour guide the country and all the state workers have needed this for a long time ending the dual currency system is expected to lead to the eventual removal of subsidies and bankruptcy of dozens even hundreds of state enterprises and the loss of many thousands of public sector jobs with lower or no subsidies state companies would be forced to raise prices for that reason a state salary increase has long been seen as a key precursor to monetary unification in cuba follow nbc latino on facebook twitter and instagram
islamabad prime minister imran khan saturday said the government will now launch a full fledged crackdown on money laundering and plug the loopholes left by the former ruling elite to commit the crime taking the floor after the national assembly passed 107 supplementary grants relating to different ministries divisions and departments on the last day of budget session he said the main reason for

current opposition the americans collaborated to have the national reconciliation ordinance nro signed because it was in their interest khan said setting the record straight that person who signed the nro with musharraf to hide his corruption is now using the word selected he said adding that asif zardari also sent money abroad through the hundi and hawala without naming shahbaz sharif khan said he too was using the word selected for him despite that they were also manufactured in the nurseries of dictators the prime minister particularly thanked the armed forces and chief of army staff coas general qamar javed bajwa for voluntarily freezing the defence budget despite a tense situation on the eastern borders and the line of control loc general bajwa suggested that savings from the defence budget be spent on development and uplift of balochistan and fata imran said amid a thunderous applause from the treasury benches khan said the incumbent government had taken special measures in the budget to check lopsided development in the past and develop those areas left far behind in development he said when the pti government took over it inherited current deficit of 19 5 billion and there was dollar crunch in the country it is a fact that the rate of dollar goes up when it is in short supply in the country and when there is current deficit he added he asked as to how those politicians who were facing charges of corruption and looting public money could deliver speeches in this house of public representatives how a person who has been facing billions of rupees corruption charges for the last 30 years can head the public accounts committee pac whose task is to protect public interests he regretted that the last parliament had passed a bill allowing a leader disqualified by the supreme court to head a political party imran congratulated his party and ministers chief whip and allies for their participation in the budget session saying quality speeches were delivered from the treasury benches imran particularly appreciated minister of state for revenue hammad azhar for conducting the budget session and his composure during the proceedings he has emerged as a young leader and earned the place of federal minister for himself he said the prime minister was happy to note that the budget was passed despite big slogans from the opposition and despite efforts of a politician who gathered the opposition parties for toppling the incumbent government he asked as to how those who left behind record current deficit could question the present government he said the government was sparing no effort to plug the loopholes which the former rulers had left for money laundering we are also making efforts to attract foreign investment he said adding that the government was under tremendous pressure as the country was passing through a difficult phase he said special budget had also been kept for various schemes in karachi and pointed out that the government was introducing such a system that would enable the local governments to generate their income the prime minister said a detailed package would be announced next week for promotion of the agriculture sector he said pakistan had signed an agreement with china for cooperation in the agriculture sector adding that china would cooperate with pakistan in seed production and technology transfer which would help bolster our agricultural production khan said the government would also expand the industrial base to create jobs and enhance exports he said it was the first time after 1960 that a government had taken steps to develop the industry we have given incentives to the industrial sector and they will get more in future as well he added khan appreciated his economic team for taking steps that had brought down the current account deficit by 30 percent regarding the government housing project the prime minister said different schemes would be launched in the next week which would create jobs and support about 40 industries associated with the construction sector he said the government had also cut imports and import of exotic food items would be discouraged he assured the house that all efforts would be made to protect the poor and vulnerable segments of society and shift burden to the affluent class he said allocations for ehsas programme had been enhanced from rs100 billion to rs190 billion in the federal budget 2019 20 he said rs217 billion had been allocated in the budget to provide subsidy to the poor power consumers while rs100 billion had been reserved as loans for the youth in his speech minister of state for finance and revenue hammad azhar said the government had substantially brought down the supplementary demands for grants as last year these stood at rs599 4 billion while this year these were standing at about rs200 billion he said the opposition parties should appreciate reduction in the supplementary budget the house also passed a resolution strongly condemning the language used by the ppp chairman bilawal bhutto zardari against the national assembly speaker the resolution was moved by minister for human rights shireen mazari demanding an apology on the floor of the house speaking briefly in the house opposition leader muhammad shahbaz sharif suggested an exclusive session to discuss issues relating to foreign affairs at a time when many international developments were taking place he said efforts were being to get a special place for india in the united nations he said the foreign minister should have come up with a suggestion for discussion on foreign affairs an in camera session can also be convened if there are secret matters he added responding to the opposition leader s concerns foreign minister shah mehmood qureshi said the government had no objection to it adding that there should be a bipartisan approach on the foreign policy earlier speaking on supplementary grants former prime minister and pml n leader shahid khaqan abbasi raised objections to rs20 billion supplementary grant for the election commission of pakistan ecp which he said could not hold free and fair elections the country s economy will face the current situation when elections are not transparent he said adding that many members sitting in this house had not been elected through votes he said the finger is pointed at the last elections because the ecp had no role inside the polling stations he said nowhere in the world security personnel were deputed inside the polling stations now that the security situation has improved the security forces personnel should not be deputed inside polling stations in the upcoming fata polls he suggested pml n member rana tanveer hussain also objected that a heavy supplementary budget had been placed before the house for the ecp which conducted selection not elections he said supplementary grants being sought for the president house and prime minister s house had also exposed the government s claims of austerity he said the prime minister undertook foreign visits along with cabinet members friends relatives and their relatives if this is the state of austerity then imran khan should apologise to the house for his claims he said syed naveed qamar of ppp said heavy supplementary grants spoke volumes of the government s financial discipline he said the supreme court had also advised that the government should spend within the budget limits instead of seeking supplementary budget

in february a dairy farmer friend sent me a note confiding that a few farmers she knows are living on cereal until their milk checks arrive yet the recently released census of agriculture shows that the number of young farmers is growing even as the average age of farmers also increases and there are uplifting articles about young black farmers connecting with the land and enjoying the self empowerment that comes with being an independent farmer meanwhile voices are rising about the central role that regenerative and organic farming can play in a green new deal a program to mobilize all possible forces to prevent climate disaster how can we make sense of these conflicting currents what policies and programs will create a just transition for family scale farmers what changes will enable farmers to maximize the potential of photosynthesis for putting carbon in the soil to supplement reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in mitigating climate disaster farmers who are constantly worrying about financial viability have little bandwidth for new practices or long term improvements that take initial investments as robert leonard and matt russell noted in an opinion piece in the new york times government programs like the current farm bill pit production against conservation and doing the right thing for the environment is a considerable drain on a farmer s bank account especially when so many of them are losing money to low commodity prices and president trump s tariffs related story op ed environment health organic farms are under attack from agribusiness weakened standards organic farmers are taking action against agribusiness moves to undermine the organic food labeling system truthout the farm debt crisis of the 1980s never completely went away and has now resurfaced with a vengeance in 2017 aggregate farm earnings were half of what they were in 2013 due to vast overproduction of basic commodities and farm income has not recovered the north american free trade agreement resulted in the loss of mid sized and smaller farms in all three signatory countries as integrated production and marketing favored larger farms since 1950 the u s has gone from 5 4 million farms to just over 2 million a loss of more than 3 million farms with important shifts from many smaller integrated farms to fewer large more specialized farms that grow even larger for dairy farms in particular these have been hard times as illustrated by the losses in the two top dairy states new york state has lost 20 percent of its dairy farms in the past five years wisconsin lost 691 dairy farms in 2018 while the persistence and shrewd maneuvering of organizations like the national sustainable agriculture coalition and the national organic coalition meant that programs that support organic and sustainable farming fared remarkably well in the 2018 farm bill the bulk of the more than 500 page bill carries on with business as usual even making it easier for big farms to get bigger by failing to cap the payments any one farm can receive and allowing more relatives to cash in on programs in the bill both mainstream parties advocate the neoliberal free trade policies that the ever more aggregated seed food and chemical corporations have imposed upon the u s since world war ii to the detriment of family scale farms all over the world the dairy farmers who got through the winter eating cereal and the new farmers who are eagerly starting out are in urgent need of radical change why is this happening political economist and author eric holt giménez would say this is just capitalism working as it is supposed to faced with slim margins in the race to cover farm expenses farmers produce more and that drives prices down even further the beneficiaries are the ever larger corporations that have consolidated their dominance in the food sector the result shoppers pay more and a shrinking portion of what they pay goes to farmers at first this mainly hit conventional farms then in 2017 organic processors started limiting the amount of milk they purchased from organic dairies and cut the price paid below the cost of production as a result family scale farms of all kinds are going out of business and tragically there are increasing reports of farmer suicides if you juxtapose the agricultural economic insights chart with the united states department of agriculture usda chart above showing the declining number of farms it is clear that loss of farm income corresponds with the loss of farms more than half of u s farm households lost money farming in recent years according to the usda which estimated that median farm income for u s farm households was negative 1 553 in 2018 farm incomes have dropped despite record productivity on u s farms because oversupply drives down commodity prices through a plethora of racist policies black farmers have lost land at more than five times the rate of white farmers from the peak of black farmland ownership in 1910 until the 1990s meanwhile profits in consolidated food businesses farm inputs retail stores remain high with returns on investment ranging from 8 to 35 percent clearly there is plenty of money in food it just does not get apportioned fairly to the people who do the actual work programs to train new farmers especially veterans get media attention and funding but as the national young farmers coalition repeats tirelessly land in most parts of the country is too expensive for a farmer to buy with farm earnings usda data show that farm families have a middle class income but only on the largest farms growing a few commodities is that income from farm earnings so while presidential candidates and green new dealers are putting bold proposals on the table for public discourse farmers farmworkers and concerned eaters should take the opportunity to hammer out proposals that will solve the structural issues that have turned u s farming into a problem instead of the win win win solutions that are possible declaring that she wants washington to work for family farmers again sen elizabeth warren promises to take some steps in the right direction by breaking up vertically integrated trusts allowing farmers themselves to repair the equipment they purchase ensuring that contracts for livestock farmers are fair reinvigorating country of origin labeling and restricting foreign ownership of farmland sen bernie sanders goes much further outlining a program that would completely restructure the food system so that farmers can make a living and afford to pay living wages to employees these are the policies this country needs if we hope to keep family scale farming when farmers can afford to adopt regenerative organic practices they will take more carbon out of the air and put it in the soil where it builds soil health making the people and livestock who eat those crops healthier the original new deal s parity pricing also fueled the soil conservation that ended the dust bowl farmers can focus on carbon farming if the price they receive in the marketplace covers the costs of running their farms family scale farmers and the people who want to eat locally grown food all need a fair green new deal for the 21st century this article was produced by earth food life a project of the independent media institute before you go truthout faces a serious

president donald trump declared the us was winning the trade war a day after reaching a temporary truce with chinese president xi jinping president donald trump with china s xi jinping in osaka credit ap on a visit to south korea following the group of 20 summit in japan trump said at a news conference that the federal reserve has not been of help to us at all in his trade spat with beijing despite that we re winning and we re winning big because we have created an economy that is second to none he said the white house has yet to reveal details of trump s arrangement with xi leaving uncertainty about how the two countries will proceed trump said after the g20 meeting that he would hold off indefinitely on tariffs planned for an additional us300 billion 427 billion in chinese imports while allowing us companies to continue to do some business with china s huawei technologies one of the country s most prominent firms
for a working man i mean a black working man you could hope to be one of those pullman porters but the next best thing was to earn top dollar over in a packinghouse this sentiment expressed by a chicago meatpacking worker was echoed by many black workers in the early to mid twentieth century though jobs in meatpacking were always among the better industrial jobs available it was the united packinghouse workers of america upwa that made the industry a leading source of economic stability racial justice and workplace empowerment for black workers the material gains achieved by the upwa in collective bargaining elevated black packinghouse workers into the loosely defined blue collar middle class but the union offered much more than that the story of the upwa is an inspiring example of multiracial unionism and labor s broader political engagement beyond its membership in many urban areas packing houses were the largest and most important multiracial institution around african americans eastern europeans irish germans scandinavians and native born protestants could all be found laboring in meatpacking plants across the country oral histories of the experience of black workers in these plants provided at length in the excellent work meatpackers by rick halpern and roger horowitz give us deep insight into the crucial role the union played in improving the lives of working class black people during this period the upwa used shop floor actions to fight boldly against racial and gender discrimination on the job and made a point of challenging racist attitudes among white union members in the name of class unity the relentless activism of the upwa did not stop at the plant gates however upwa leaders used their engaged membership to take on civil rights initiatives that mattered in the communities where workers lived the struggles of meatpacking workers provide an excellent model for how unions today can address the fight against racist and xenophobic views among union members and inequalities in other realms of society a spotlight on the upwa also provides a corrective to simplistic claims about the labor movement s role in perpetuating racism and the relationship between class politics and the fight against racial discrimination black meatpacking workers did not see class based organizing as inadequate or an impediment to their fight for racial equality as the words of these workers show they saw their union as the primary institution they could use to secure a life of dignity in every sense of the word growth of an industry before 1860 small local firms provided most meat because perishable items could not be shipped over long distances the technological breakthrough of refrigerated train cars facilitated the creation of large meatpacking firms in or near urban rail hubs like many other industries at the time large scale industrial production brought with it specialization and division of labor highly skilled butchers gradually became replaced by knife workers and laborers with very narrowly defined tasks the work still remained labor intensive due to the inconsistent size of meat stock and the difficult angles required for cutting machine operators and helpers were only 20 percent of the workforce the goal of securing steady employment in meatpacking plants attracted many southern blacks to northern industrial centers during the great migration of the 1910s as in many other industries black workers were primarily used as strikebreakers in the early twentieth century this was the perfect tool for employers to reinforce fragmentation within the working class and distrust between workers of different races many american federation of labor afl unions excluded blacks at the time which of course all but ensured that those same workers would be easily recruited to break strikes black male workers consistently worked in the more physically demanding jobs with environmentally dangerous conditions in the rendering house and hide cellar workers absorbed disgusting odors on top of developing skin problems and respiratory illnesses on the killing floor they dealt with chronic back injuries and temperatures over 100 degrees during the summer months however it was on the killing floor that workers had the greatest leverage after all production cannot start until dead animals are available to cut and process women mostly worked in departments that developed processed food white women dominated in cleaner jobs like bacon slicing black women primarily worked in offal and casing departments where they prepared organs like intestines bladders and hearts in casings workers often suffered from pneumonia rheumatism and arthritis the process of engaging black workers in union activity was long and painful in 1904 there was unity among skilled butchers and unskilled immigrant laborers during a national strike the company brought in large numbers of black strikebreakers and racial violence ensued many working class black people seemed to be permanently alienated from trade unionism because of experiences such as these hopes for multiracial unionism in meatpacking revived during world war i which caused a severe labor shortage and greater leverage for workers the suspension of immigration from europe also led to the massive recruitment of black workers to the industry the stockyards labor council slc was created in 1917 and by 1918 it had enrolled 90 percent of chicago s white packinghouse workers organizing southern black migrants proved difficult because major black institutions like churches and newspapers were anti union meatpacking companies cynically curried favor with these institutions in order to exploit this division to the fullest as shop floor militancy increased throughout the war secretary of war newton baker was forced to create a mediation commission in the hopes that it would prevent disruptions in key industries arbitration produced concrete advances for chicago packinghouse workers an eight hour workday forty eight hour work week dollar a week raise and overtime provisions this victory opened up the way for huge membership gains among previously skeptical black workers black shop stewards began serving alongside whites and the union sponsored multiracial social events such as picnics and dances the end of the war however immediately turned the labor shortage into a labor surplus the chicago race riot of 1919 further destroyed hopes of a multiracial union and the slc soon collapsed taking advantage of the opening packing firms withdrew from the arbitration agreement and unilaterally reduced wages in 1921 the amalgamated meat cutters amc called a strike but again black workers were used as scabs and the union was defeated as the amc became further discredited packing companies set up welfare programs that won the allegiance of a significant number of workers a special effort was made to nurture a following among skilled black workers deemed strike insurance by one company executive the coming of the cio by the 1930s black packinghouse workers were no longer recent migrants without industrial experience they had been able to win at least a small degree of respect and confidence from their white coworkers the failed strike of 1921 proved to many whites that support from black workers was absolutely essential if the union were to win any strike white packinghouse worker gertie kamarczyk said they didn t come in and hug em and kiss em but they knew they had to be together period even though some of them were anti negro they still knew you had to be together to form a union and to win some of their demands packinghouse workers rode the wave of organizing breakthroughs made by the congress of industrial organizations cio in the mid 1930s many of which involved significant numbers of black workers in october 1937 the steelworkers organizing committee swoc helped to form the packinghouse workers organizing committee pwoc the swoc sent the brilliant orator and prominent black trade unionist henry johnson to work on the organizing drive the pwoc set up departmental organizations and stewards boards with deliberate representation from different ethnic groups union organizers constantly reminded black workers that the union could push back against racist management practices the local at the chicago armour plant won a major victory against discrimination by getting rid of the stars on black workers time cards these stars served no other purpose that to single out blacks for layoffs in several cities there were even strikes by majority white plants to stop discriminatory practices including a plant occupation in kansas city in 1938 in 1943 delegates from hundreds of meatpacking local unions voted to form the united packinghouse workers of america fighting discrimination on the job from the beginning the upwa made it a priority to fight racism on the shop floor and in the meatpacking labor market in 1950 the union formally adopted a robust anti discrimination program and encouraged civil rights initiatives throughout the union the integration of segregated departments dressing rooms and other plant facilities was one of the first priorities they also sought to end hiring discrimination against black women at the plant and in the broader community as an aid to these initiatives the union tried to work with and influence community organizations such as the naacp one black worker recalled how local union officials told reluctant white workers either work with them or find another job that was spelled out to them and they cooperated very nicely black workers were strongly committed to the idea that the union could only survive on the basis of racial unity in the plants philip weightman steward and worksite leader at the chicago swift plant described how he fought to keep the union from dividing along ethnic lines we could not cater to whites and we could not cater to the blacks this is the principle on which this union is organized no second class citizenship we never met with a black group or a white group it was always bringing together by consistently stressing the material benefits the union was winning they were able to convince some hesitant white workers to support the multiracial union many packinghouse workers claimed they made a religion of unity exciting demonstrations of shop floor power were used to enforce racial equality within the plants this was especially true of the workers who were part of the second phase of the great migration and entered the plants during world war ii they tended to be more militant and had higher expectations sam park and charles hayes were part of this cohort in chicago and decided to take matters in their own hands when management refused to hire black women in the bacon slice department they led a group of black workers from the killing floor up to management s office still dripping in blood and sat on their desks until the company relented the union was also instrumental in helping black women secure employment in meatpacking plants they were supported by other efforts to take on racism in the labor movement for example rowena moore became involved in an initiative directly inspired by a philip randolph s march on washington movement moore and others tried to secure employment for black women in omaha s defense industries and coordinated with packinghouse unionists this experience stayed with moore i ve said i ll always have a special love for the union because they did support getting the black women in there anti discrimination initiatives did not always go smoothly of course the 1952 national agreement with armour mandated desegregation of all plant facilities but in some locals white workers demanded that signs for separate facilities be reinstated which they promptly were by now however the national union was too invested in this fight to let it go easily upwa president ralph helstein threatened to strike the company and the signs were removed again most black workers had no illusions that the union was perfect or that it was going to be easy to fight discriminatory practices activists like rowena moore often butted heads with certain union officials who were more resistant on matters of racial and gender discrimination but most workers still believed that taking ownership of the union as a vehicle for transformative change was the best way forward in the words of moore if you re not satisfied with something you don t just pack up your books and go home you work with the group and try to change it or do something to improve it the organized left mostly in the form of the communist party was crucial to the success of multiracial organizing in many cases in the 1930s some younger black workers came into contact with the left in unemployment campaigns and its support for the scottsboro boys herbert march a white worker got involved in labor organizing through the young communist league and started working at the chicago armour packing plant in 1933 there he built a strong cp unit that was always at the forefront of fighting discrimination even black workers who were never interested in joining the communist party had to acknowledge their impressive track record when it came to fighting racism philip weightman said they talked multiracial anti discrimination i give them credit for that i may not have been as aggressive as i was if it hadn t been for them you see beyond the shop floor early in its life the upwa sent clear signals that it would get involved in issues beyond the plant gates at their second convention in 1944 the host hotel refused to house black delegates packinghouse leaders moved it to a cramped union hall despite 102 degree heat solidarity between black and white workers on the job was leveraged in fights to desegregate local bars restaurants and hotels a particularly effective tactic was to send teams of black and white workers into a local bar asking for service when the black workers were denied service whites would also walk out back at the union hall a complaint would be filed with the state s attorney and usually the establishments would have to desegregate in fort worth texas the upwa was successful in desegregating both the holden hotel and tarrant county public schools this activity reflected a historical period when civil rights struggles had a decidedly working class character and were closely linked with the labor movement william rasberry a packinghouse worker in kansas city recalls the labor movement we were sort of like an advisory to the civil rights movement and we supplied the money this labor civil rights coalition reached its peak in the 1940s and 1950s and was based on a fundamental premise emphasized by leaders like a philip randolph and bayard rustin since the vast majority of african americans were working class a broadly social democratic program anchored in industrial unionism was the best way to advance their interests many of the campaigns mounted during the apex of southern civil rights activism targeted the specific political economic foundations of the jim crow system not an abstract white supremacy aside from union campaigns these included struggles around the poll tax fair hiring and public education by the end of world war ii there was consensus even among black moderates and liberals that expansion of the industrial union movement would be critical for further advancement as the 1960s unfolded black poverty was increasingly studied and explained in individualist psychological terms rather than in the context of political economy unfortunately the close connection between labor and civil rights during this period is often overlooked in historical accounts today to advance upwa s civil rights objectives black packinghouse workers took over many local naacp branches in places like chicago omaha and kansas city where this happened the class character of the naacp was changed from middle class to working class rowena moore so effectively dominated the naacp in omaha that management let her set up a table in the plant the upwa and allied community groups also turned their attention to opening up job opportunities for black workers in other industries william rasberry became regional vice president of the national negro labor council and targeted major industries that discriminated in hiring like airlines banks and department stores throughout martin luther king jr s career upwa was always a staunch ally of his they strongly supported the montgomery bus boycott and invited king to their anti discrimination conference
islamabad prime minister imran khan said the government will now launch a full fledged crackdown against money laundering and plug the loopholes left by the former ruling elite to commit crime taking the floor after the national assembly passed 107 supplementary grants relating to different ministries divisions and departments on the last day of the budget session on saturday he said the main reason for increase in devaluation of pak rupee was money laundering mainly by the ruling elite in the past how can others be stopped from money laundering when those sitting in the government themselves are involved in this illegal practice he asked the prime minister said in the last four to five years the properties of pakistanis in dubai had reached the figure of 5 billion while there is also information that resident pakistanis were keeping 10 billion abroad taken out of the country he said asif ali zardari also took foreign exchange out of pakistan through the omni group making a mention of hudaibiya paper mills and hill metal he asked how the opposition leader who himself was a money launderer could talk about devaluation of pak rupee he came down hard on his critics saying those calling him a selected prime minister had signed an nro with a military dictator to hide their corruption and were manufactured in the nurseries of military dictators he said murad saeed in his speech quoted former us secretary of state condoleezza rice who had mentioned in her autobiography that former military ruler pervez musharraf was asked to drop corruption cases against members of the current opposition the americans collaborated to have the national reconciliation ordinance nro signed because it was in their interest khan said setting the record straight that person who signed the nro with musharraf to hide his corruption is now using the word selected he said adding asif zardari also sent money abroad through hundi and hawala without naming shahbaz sharif khan said he too was using the word selected for him despite they were also manufactured in the nurseries of dictators the prime minister particularly thanked the armed forces and chief of army staff general qamar javed bajwa for voluntarily freezing the defence budget despite a tense situation on the eastern borders and the line of control general bajwa suggested that savings from the defence budget be spent on development and uplift of balochistan and fata imran said amid a thunderous applause from the treasury benches khan said the incumbent government had taken special measures in the budget to check lopsided development in the past and develop those areas left far behind in development he said when the pti government took over it inherited current deficit of 19 5 billion and there was dollar crunch in the country it is a fact the rate of dollar goes up when it is in short supply in the country and when there is current deficit he added he asked as to how those politicians who were facing charges of corruption and looting public money could deliver speeches in this house of public representatives how a person who has been facing billions of rupees corruption charges for the last 30 years can head the public accounts committee whose task is to protect public interests he regretted the last parliament had passed a bill allowing a leader disqualified by the supreme court to head a political party imran congratulated his party and ministers chief whip and allies for their participation in the budget session saying quality speeches were delivered from the treasury benches imran particularly appreciated minister of state for revenue hammad azhar for conducting the budget session and his composure during the proceedings he has emerged as a young leader and earned the place of federal minister for himself he said the prime minister was happy to note that the budget was passed despite big slogans from the opposition and despite efforts of a politician who gathered the opposition parties for toppling the incumbent government he asked as to how those who left behind record current deficit could question the present government he said the government is sparing no effort to plug the loopholes which the former rulers had left for money laundering we are also making efforts to attract foreign investment he said adding the government is under tremendous pressure as the country is passing through a difficult phase he said special budget had also been kept for various schemes in karachi and pointed out the government is introducing such a system that would enable the local governments to generate their income the prime minister said a detailed package would be announced next week for promotion of the agriculture sector he said pakistan had signed an agreement with china for cooperation in the agriculture sector adding china would cooperate with pakistan in seed production and technology transfer which would help bolster our agricultural production khan said the government would also expand the industrial base to create jobs and enhance exports he said it was the first time after 1960 that a government had taken steps to develop the industry we have given incentives to the industrial sector and they will get more in future as well he added khan appreciated his economic team for taking steps that had brought down the current account deficit by 30 percent regarding the government housing project the prime minister said different schemes would be launched in the next week which would create jobs and support about 40 industries associated with the construction sector he said the government has also cut imports and import of exotic food items would be discouraged he assured the house all efforts would be made to protect the poor and vulnerable segments of society and shift burden to the affluent class he said allocations for ehsas programme had been enhanced from rs100 billion to rs190 billion in the federal budget 2019 20 he said rs217 billion is allocated in the budget to provide subsidy to the poor power consumers while rs100 billion is reserved as loans for the youth in his speech minister of state for finance and revenue hammad azhar said the government has substantially brought down the supplementary demands for grants as last year these stood at rs599 4 billion while this year these were standing at about rs200 billion he said the opposition parties should appreciate reduction in the supplementary budget the house also passed a resolution strongly condemning the language used by the ppp chairman bilawal bhutto zardari against the national assembly speaker the resolution was moved by minister for human rights shireen mazari demanding an apology on the floor of the house speaking briefly in the house opposition leader muhammad shahbaz sharif suggested an exclusive session to discuss issues relating to foreign affairs at a time when many international developments were taking place he said efforts are being to get a special place for india in the united nations he said the foreign minister should have come up with a suggestion for discussion on foreign affairs an in camera session can also be convened if there are secret matters he added responding to the opposition leader s concerns foreign minister shah mehmood qureshi said the government has no objection to it adding there should be a bipartisan approach on the foreign policy earlier speaking on supplementary grants former prime minister and pml n leader shahid khaqan abbasi raised objections to rs20 billion supplementary grant for the election commission of pakistan ecp which he said could not hold free and fair elections the country s economy will face the current situation when elections are not transparent he said adding many members sitting in this house were elected through votes he said the finger is pointed at the last elections because the ecp had no role inside the polling stations he said nowhere in the world security personnel were deputed inside the polling stations now the security situation has improved the security forces personnel should not be deputed inside polling stations in the upcoming fata polls he suggested pml n member rana tanveer hussain also objected that a heavy supplementary budget was placed before the house for the ecp which conducted selection not elections he said supplementary grants being sought for the president house and prime minister s house had also exposed the government s claims of austerity he said the prime minister undertook foreign visits along with cabinet members friends relatives and their relatives if this is the state of austerity then imran khan should apologise to the house for his claims he said syed naveed qamar of ppp said heavy supplementary grants speak volumes of the government s financial discipline he said the supreme court had also advised the government should spend within the budget limits instead of seeking supplementary budget

the psei has rallied strongly the past month and a half rising by 7 percent the outlook of the domestic economy has also improved as interest rates continue to go down thanks to the benign inflation environment and the ongoing reduction in banks reserve requirement ratio rrr as a result the yield curve is no longer inverted which used to be one of the major concerns of investors the pressure for rates to go up is now much less thanks to falling oil prices and the likelihood the us fed will cut rates note that after hitting a peak of 66 20 barrel in april the price of oil has gone down to 57 30 barrel as of this writing meanwhile economists are now anticipating the fed to cut rates twice by the end of this year this is a sharp contrast to the consensus view earlier that the fed would raise rates twice in 2019 despite the strong performance of the psei many investors remain cautious toward the stock market after all the outlook of the us economy is now much worse brought about by president trump s imposition of higher tariffs on a number of chinese imports he also threatened to expand tariffs on another 300 million worth of chinese goods trump s actions hurt business sentiment as reflected in several indicators advertisement for example the us markit manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi which measures the level of activity of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector deteriorated sharply to 50 1 as of june 21 although it still indicates expansion as it remains above the critical 50 level which separates growth from contraction the number is sharply lower from 55 7 at the start of the year and 52 6 in may after a rally earlier the price of copper has gone down from 6 415 metric tons as of end april to 5 960 mt currently given copper s numerous applications in cyclical industries the lower price of copper is viewed as an indicator of global economic weakness finally the yield on the us 10 year bond has fallen by 48 basis points from its end april level to 2 02 percent which is the lowest for the 10 year bond yield since november 2016 this could be an indicator of investors increasingly cautious outlook on the us economy prompting them to switch to bonds which are considered to be safe haven investments surprisingly despite the deteriorating outlook of the us economy the us market still went up in june after falling initially in may the s p 500 is now back to an all time high the latest rally was triggered by increasing hopes of a rate cut by the us fed earlier in june fed chair jerome powell said the federal reserve was ready to respond if the trump administration s ongoing trade war would hurt the us economy although the fed did not cut rates during its meeting two weeks ago eight out of the 17 participants on the fed s policy making board now believe that one or two rate cuts are needed this year to keep the economy strong up from only six as of march this year aside from the united states other emerging markets are performing well for example the benchmark equity indices of thailand and indonesia are both up by more than 7 percent compared to a month and a half ago after suffering from a steep sell off earlier in may even the shanghai stock exchange composite index in china is up by 0 8 percent in the same period despite the fact that the chinese economy is most vulnerable to the ongoing us china trade war admittedly lower rates are highly favorable for equity markets as they say don t fight the fed however nobody knows if lower rates are enough to drive markets higher even with the growing risk of a recession in the united states there is reason to be cautious especially since historically a weaker us market has negatively affected the performance of global markets including the philippines advertisement given the uncertainty on the sustainability of the us market s strong performance the best way to control risk is by managing exposure to the stock market to stay prudent make sure the amount you have invested is not too much allowing you to stomach any volatility that could take place assuming that the market fails to go up in a sustainable manner this should be an amount you can afford to keep invested over a long period of time also make sure to invest only in fundamentally sound stocks that are trading at attractive valuations as those stocks are expected to be more resilient to volatility

pakistan s security and economy have jostled closely as conjoined twins right from the country s inception as an independent state in 1947 pakistani historians and scholars might cavil at indian machinations to strangulate pakistan economically yet even indian writers like kamal davar concede that the unwillingness of indian leaders notably pm jawaharlal nehru and home minister sardar patel to be generous to the new state especially in the division of assets also made reconciliation difficult between the two states it was the fear of an implacably hostile foe on the east and a refractory neighbour on the west that compelled pakistan to seek us led military alliances leveraging its geostrategic location for economic gains pakistan as per kamal davar had received 30 per cent of british army 40 per cent of its navy and 20 per cent of its air force as a result the first prime minister of pakistan was forced in 1948 to allocate 75 per cent of the budget to defence forces this large expenditure due to country s security imperatives had to be balanced through aid commitment of strategic security agreements with the united states ostensibly to counter the looming shadow of communism in south asia pakistan became a frontline state of us war against communism in late fifties pretty much like her war against terrorism in 2001 pakistan s security needs forced a significant expenditure on the defence of the country that remained the barometer of security for very long time the dismemberment of the country and the fear psychosis generated thereby did little to assuage the insecurity bred in a high external threat environment the end of the bipolarity in global power relations with the demise of soviet union heralded a new age of unipolarity with a hyper power ruling the world like a colossus soon the proximate identities and socio political angularities that had lain dormant under the client patron inter state relationships of cold war era emerged out of the wood works to haunt the planners of the new world order geopolitics that was to give way to geo economics stood in the window gasping for one last breath before plunging to its natural death in this new age pakistan became a hotbed of internal as well as external machinations of forces inimical to its existence michael desch the us based scholar has propounded a theory about a combination of external and internal threats that determine the nature of civilian control of the military according to the author the civilian control should be best in times of high external and low internal threat and worst in times of low external threat and high internal threat the time has come to link our economic and security sinews through meaningful reforms and not just window dressing unrealistic tax target setting without winning the trust of the population and business community is a self defeating exercise according to above theory the security compulsions in high external threat environment should give the civilian leadership of pakistan better control of economic and foreign policies whereas in high internal threat environment the civilian control would pose problems in pakistan under the present government the civilian leadership is getting the fullest cooperation from the military which appears mindful of the linkage between the economic and security dimensions of statecraft in both high external as well as high internal threat environments what the military and civilian leadership both should be mindful is the changing nature of the security and the role played by the economics in it the notion of national security no longer remains confined to military threats it is the notion of human security that has gained salience in this age of geo economics human security is a very comprehensive term that includes personal economic political community and environmental security the concept is people centered and securitizes people s welfare instead of external threats only the role of economy in case of human security assumes even greater salience than the traditional military threats centered notion of national security our public policies should reflect this change and for the change to actually materialize we need a drastic reorientation of our national priorities now how to reorient our foreign and defence policies to reduce our external threats in order to focus more on human security threats the country first of all needs to reassess its defence policy if the reliance is to be kept on nuclear deterrence for national defence the maintenance of very large conventional forces act against that objective the credibility and effectiveness of our nuclear deterrence through a triad of nuclear delivery means should spare our conventional defence forces to save the national resources for expenditure elsewhere through cost cutting on lesser conventional component we could in fact have better trained and technologically equipped armed forces instead of a vast multitude of infantry heavy low tech military we should logically reap the dividends of a nuclear deterrence in terms of costs saved it makes no sense for a cash strapped economy in perpetual balance of payments crisis spending equally profligate amounts on nuclear as well as conventional defence a national security review by a balanced mix of civil and military experts led by the prime minister s office should carry out an appraisal of our defence needs and security response with focus on retaining an optimal balance between our nuclear and conventional components our diplomacy should break new frontiers instead of remaining mired in the age old rut of confrontational politics unfortunately in this we would be up against an obdurate and visionless indian leadership and an opportunist super power the deft diplomacy should offer both the detractors such attractive stakes that force both to view pakistan as an opportunity rather than a challenge in that cpec can act as an inclusive strand of an extra regional economic alliance including india us and gulf states besides roping in central asian regional economic cooperation forum after getting above fundamentals right our economic managers should focus on an internationally linked yet indigenous home spun and nationalistic economic planning instead of relying on imf experts that specialize in administering nostrums to sick economies like egypt pakistan specific solutions should be found by coopting local economic wisdom of which there is an abundance here one size fits all imf prescription that squeezes poor to subsidize the rich devalues currency with no visible advantages to exporters taxes the business community beyond its capacity hurts agriculture through removal of subsidies and fuels inflation through price hikes in gas and electricity prices is a sure recipe of failure for pakistan as in the past with disposable incomes down by 40 per cent and a rampant inflation riding the bandwagon of bretton woods wisdom a frustrated population gasping for breath is hardly an inspiring sight for national economic revival a time has come to link our economic and security sinews together through meaningful reforms and not just window dressing unrealistic tax target setting before winning the trust of the population and business community is a self defeating exercise the government should motivate people before clamping down on tax evaders in an environment where the ease of doing business is not a mere statistic but a facilitative reality of a new economic environment the writer is a phd scholar he

follow us on our malay and english whatsapp telegram instagram tiktok and youtube channels the nation needs to realise the full potential of the people so that they can contribute to the wellbeing of the nation says wh cheng when we ask the above question to many people many will definitely point their fingers at the present government for their failure to address and prevent the current economic downturn and rising inflation it is natural for people to vent their frustration and anger over the rising cost of living inflation and job losses under the current government many do not know exactly or do not even bother to want to know where such hardship originated from and why it happened in the first place according to economist prof jomo kwame sundaram malaysians should brace for tougher times ahead as the economy is beset mainly by the current trade war between the united states and china besides those external factors some also blame the current situation on the relentless attacks on the previous barisan nasional government by the then pakatan harapan opposition the bn had to stop their planning for our nation s economic future and spend most of their time defending the attacks from the then opposition force many have forgotten or failed to understand that the current downturn in our nation has its roots in the previous administration as well corruption mismanagement and abuse of power within the government cost the nation s coffers billions of ringgit worst of all funds from 1mdb were siphoned off a large sum landed up in the personal account of the then prime minister najib razak large large amounts from felda felcra tabung haji and national feedlot corp sdn bhd were allegedly swindled or siphoned away by the heavy borrowing by the previous government and unfavourable trade deals with china also resulted in our nation s debts soaring thus lowering the value of the ringgit substantially the rise of racial and religious extremism and unnecessary tensions created by umno and pas with the intention of provoking hatred and suspicion has also caused some instability all this corruption abuse of power and other misdeeds carried out by umno leaders along with the racial and religious tension created has resulted in investors losing confidence in the malaysian economy and now that both palm oil and crude oil prices have collapsed many are wondering why are all this is happening to us china india and europe are among largest importers of palm oil anytime a crisis arises like the global economic downturn the trade war europe s debt crisis and the slowing of demand for food from india and china it will lead to a decrease in demand for palm oil which will push the price of crude palm oil down moreover the demand and preference for other vegetable oils such as soybean oil sunflower oil rapeseed oil and corn oil has also affected crude palm oil prices in recent years western nations have campaigned hard to promote soybean oil as an alternative to palm oil oil prices also fell dragged by a weaker oil demand outlook and a rise in us crude inventories despite growing expectations of ongoing opec led supply cuts the outlook shows that the global economic slowdown and the commodities war coupled with the us china trade dispute are the major contributing factors to the entire situation if the global economy was good malaysia would have recovered even faster today after the new government took over on 10 may 2018 moreover the intense politicking and the lack of focus by the new government also created an uneasy situation the rising cost of living inflation and uncertainty also frustrated the people who were hoping that things would change when regime change took place last year the then very experienced ruling party had left an almost emptied treasury while the new and inexperienced ruling coalition took over when the nation was almost bankrupt during that period of transition last year all this was unexpected we never expected our nation s coffer to be almost dry neither did anyone expect that corruption by the previous ruling coalition was so rampant and pervasive the present ruling coalition must realise that these is no more space and time to look at race and religion anymore for survival in an increasingly competitive global market if there are still racial and religious extremists around trying to create havoc in our nation do not give them anymore space bring these pests to book if we continue to give them room to voice their extremism in public tensions will continue to rise and if this continues how are we going to rebuild this nation we need meritocracy and inclusiveness to allow the full potential of the people to be realised so that they can contribute to the wellbeing of our

robert samuelson washington we are now passing a significant milestone the current economic expansion has become the longest in u s history previously the record was the decade from march 1991 to march 2001 120 months when the present recovery enters july it will mark the 121st month of expansion just how much longer it will last is anyone s guess but politically this is the question that matters most upon the answer may hang the identity of the next president we are now at the point in the political cycle when swarms of democratic challengers are field testing their many policy proposals all the candidates seek to project an image that will impress the voting public yet the outcome may depend more on the state of the economy than the state of the debate if the economy remains strong for the next 16 months or so president trump s re election prospects would it seems be enormously enhanced and of course the opposite is also true if the economy slips into recession even a mild one trump s claim to extraordinary economic powers would be devalued all the political maneuvering and posturing may pale beside the visible state of the economy so it s trump against the economy if he can seem to control the economy whatever the reality he may overwhelm his opponent regardless of the case against him no one seems more aware of this than trump who has been building plan b just in case plan a a continuous boom fails plan b of course is to have the federal reserve take the blame if the economy falters he has been attacking jerome jay powell chairman of the federal reserve board for months accusing him and the fed of suffocating economic growth by raising short term interest rates too soon and too much in 2017 and 2018 the fed increased overnight rates seven times they now stand at a range of 2 25 to 2 50 if trump is so vitriolic when the economy is basically strong imagine what he would be like if a recession or a conspicuous slowdown occurred will a strong economy propel trump into a second term the job of predicting always difficult is especially hard now because the economy seems to be sending contradictory messages the stock market seems robust apparently reflecting confidence in the economy s underlying growth on the other hand bond markets seem to be telegraphing economic weakness evident in low interest rates and a lackluster demand for credit the unemployment rate of 3 6 in may the lowest monthly rate since the 1960s also seems to indicate a widespread need for more workers surely a sign of a healthy economy but the absence of sizable wage and price increases suggests the opposite the economy isn t growing fast enough to generate pervasive scarcities of workers or products that would increase inflationary pressures in may the consumer price index the government s best known inflation indicator was up only 1 8 from a year earlier then there s the uncertain impact of trump s trade wars which have affected not only exports but also business investments tied to trade in 2018 foreign direct investment fdi by multinational firms fell 13 reports the united nations conference on trade and development unctad it was the third consecutive annual decline fdi covers factories mergers and other forms of investment understandably attention is now focused on the first debates but the decisive showdown may be between trump and the economy robert j samuelson is a columnist for the washington post writers group
the central argument of amusing ourselves is simple there were two landmark dystopian novels written by brilliant british cultural critics brave new world by aldous huxley and nineteen eighty four by george orwell and we americans had mistakenly feared and obsessed over the vision portrayed in the latter book an information censoring movement restricting individuality emaciating state rather than the former a technology sedating consumption engorging instant gratifying bubble andrew postman so what would neil postman say about this fellow or the many fellows like bezos who have zero patience for a world without disrupting economies tied to their authoritarian business plan of more billionaires deserving sic more power disruptive and destructive and not just economies in the book sense but structural violence and community disintegration murdering people with debt lack of housing no medical care suicide that s bezos et al looking to capitalize on every penny gathered from every nanosecond in our individual human lives amazon ceo jeff bezos has seen his company grow into one of the world s biggest companies back in 1997 bezos told shareholders that employees at other companies can work long hard or smart but at amazon com you can t choose two out of three bezos acknowledges his high standards for employees every year telling shareholders that it s not easy to work here in the 24 years since amazon was founded ceo jeff bezos has seen his company grow from a modest online bookshop to one of the most valuable companies in the world back in 1997 bezos was already expecting big things out of his young company in his annual letter to amazon shareholders bezos described how much effort he expected from his employees when i interview people i tell them you can work long hard or smart but at amazon com you can t choose two out of three bezos wrote in the 1997 letter setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been and will continue to be the single most important element of amazon com s success the new york times reported in 2015 exactly how bruising the work environment at amazon could be employees were reportedly expected to routinely work late were encouraged to criticize coworkers ideas at meetings and were often found crying at their desks amazon disputed many of the claims in the times investigation though the newspaper defended its reporting god forbid we call amazon boss bezos a plantation owner of a different mother for sure that americans living in small and large cities far and wide depend on the amazon way as if amazon is sutured into all aspects of american culture sic and hardwired into every new born s head same day delivery a shopping cart that would be the envy of any rothschild or leona mindy roberts helmsley this essay first was going to address those other masters of the universe google guys and algorithm titans i barely criticized a billionaire in a dv article household income or higher planes of consciousness i criticized nick hanauer for his false balance contrived bifurcation and his new wind as a billionaire fighting what he calls the educationalism mindset that says that a good grounded deep and holistic education might be a thing of kings whereas nick says education backing and financing ain t worth diddly squat in capitalism until more people make more money to buy more things or just to survive in his nihilistic world taken with this story line i embraced education as both a philanthropic cause and a civic mission i co founded the league of education voters a nonprofit dedicated to improving public education i joined bill gates alice walton and paul allen in giving more than 1 million each to an effort to pass a ballot measure that established washington state s first charter schools all told i have devoted countless hours and millions of dollars to the simple idea that if we improved our schools if we modernized our curricula and our teaching methods substantially increased school funding rooted out bad teachers and opened enough charter schools american children especially those in low income and working class communities would start learning again graduation rates and wages would increase poverty and inequality would decrease and public commitment to democracy would be restored nick hanauer in my email box google of course i get an unsolicited email from an organization for which i have never associated with or even pursued it s the old surveillance state of google and the internet stasi for sure alas neil postman was correct in so far as what we say and do as writers really does not count we are only as smart and deep and truthful as our masters will allow in my college economics class we were taught that wages depend on productivity the more productive or skilled workers are my professors used to argue the more they will be worth on the labor market and therefore the higher their wages will be that s bunk under this logic the way to cure our economic woes whether poverty inequality underemployment or unemployment is through education by educating our citizens we increase their human capital making them more productive and therefore increasing their expected income it sounds good right this seductive myth of education as an economic cure all is something civic action founder nick hanauer calls educationism as nick writes in a recent article for the atlantic it s a myth he used to believe and it s a myth many wealthy elites still propagate it s what leads philanthropists to donate billions of dollars to public schools and educational institutions there s just one problem educationism doesn t work if it did our middle class would be much better off in the last 40 years while the real incomes of most americans have been stuck we ve gotten a lot more educated almost everyone has a high school diploma and the share of americans with a college degree has more than tripled since 1970 but all that education hasn t translated into higher wages in fact if our incomes had done what my college profs told me gone up with productivity the average family today would be earning 29 000 more a year an average of 105 000 of course it s true that getting an education is likely to increase your own income but that s not the same as raising incomes throughout the economy not when four out of five of the fastest growing jobs pay very low wages jobs like cashiers and health care assistants meanwhile the pay of most people who do have a college education barely keeps up with inflation what we do need to do is raise incomes for working families and the middle class throughout the economy that s how we build an economy that works for all of us not just the wealthy few as nick writes in short great public schools are the product of a thriving middle class not the other way around pay people enough to afford dignified middle class lives and high quality public schools will follow but allow economic inequality to grow and educational inequality will inevitably grow with it stephen paolini civic action email with an ask for support but then this essay takes a twist as they always seem to do when i deploy some ground truthing you see most of us in the usa the 80 percent of the population many of which are on the skids on the near skids or those of us barely scraping by and those of us who are unseen but are many short steps away from working for one of those sweatshops like we see with amazon there are so many warehouse jobs forklift gigs sorting careers and finding down time in the back seat of our cars so so tire of really the prognosticators writing away hard in semi secure status even the smartish ones on leftish magazines like the nation or digital forums like truthout or truthdig or the intercept they have no idea of what is real in the world and that rarefied realm of citing this study or making this or that prediction well it is bombast at best propaganda at worst denuded of humanity in many cases case in point tens of millions of men and women wandering the land us in some warped version of steinbeck s grapes of wrath really in a society that eats sleeps dreams believes the crap that huxley warned of and that which neil postman discussed oh the irony those that billionaire book salesman bezos dead to the world dead to us the 80 percent living barely in the middle of their hellish barbecue i was with three fellows two literally are sleeping in campgrounds and one fellow living with his parents a million miles away from what any social worker or sheryl sandberg or joe biden or elizabeth warren or any of the scions of holly dirt or anyone in the trump loony bin show or those clamoring around an obama or oprah or rachel maddow it s a triple sick experience even thinking about how vapid that so called debate was yesterday with half of the half wits of the democratic party wanting to play president so a life of men truly on the extinction block in several demographics these fellows i hired on to help my spouse and i move from a rental to a house we had the temerity to purchase in a time of climate heating oceans rising food wilting water draining economies imploding saber rattling and icbm immolating their lives broken down seem to hold the familiar life story of many people i have worked with as a non traditional social worker for the homeless the just out of prison returnees and chronically physically and mentally ill they work jobs stacking halibut packing shrimp pounding two by fours hauling goods sorting things cutting trees landscaping roofing both of these fellows are 50 living in campgrounds one with false teeth the other with nubs and rotting teeth child support for children they have never seen or can t see now felonies for this or that charge keeping them from even getting to first base on an apartment application vagabonds harassed by cops and living life in a constant move for my other helper brian he s a former marine working as a social services provider has a wonderful child on the spectrum autism and is currently living with aging and sickly parents all three fit the bill for zero tolerance in this society never reflected in the news stories in the mass murdering media never on the minds of the one percent point zero zero one percent i know for a fact though that those little eichmanns who populate the other 19 percent of the 20 percenters well many of them have one degree of separation when it comes to family members with substance abuse issues chronic mental or physical illness depression suicidal schizophrenic and homeless you get both barrels of human pain and human survival and some human triumphs when talking with real people albeit denigrated folk disenfranchised humans they are really rough around the edges but these fellows tommy and devon they are examples of struggle and defeat and some triumph as brian and i note and agree they are so far from any of the discourse going on around the world the complete irrelevance of all the trolling all the internet crap all the stuff that makes for an echo chamber that sucks humanity and human connection from the ether you look at tommy and you see a man on the skids big laughing screwed up face almost dickensian crazy might be one moniker hustling and wanting to have people know that there was once a time when he had some normalcy some sense of being a man in society not on the skids though tommy would not see himself on the skids brain injury 23 years ago when a van hit him head on as a pedestrian and he still works moves heavy furniture and hammers roofs devon a former truck driver someone who has a few years in the marines and as brian states people are only awakened to the level of how they have been able to access those tools necessary to be woken up yet brian states that he d much rather be in the company of these men than the msws and other graduate level punishers he s worked with as i have also worked with in the non profit arenas as supposed social services workers they probably know nothing about this movement which could affect tommy and devon when reporters for the international amazon workers voice interviewed part time amazon associates a cheap euphemism for employees used to disguise the exploitative relationship between workers and management at the company in baltimore to discuss their attitude toward bezos fortune they were met with a torrent of disgust calls for sharing the wealth and social anger tell mr bezos and the rest of management to come out of their offices and get on the shop floor said one worker who identified herself as a single mother of two at the end of the day they never feel what we go through in a day for 12 an hour they get to sit down in their offices and get paid more than we will see in a year she said bezos wealth typifies the way an increasingly small number of multi billionaire ceos and finance operatives extract ever more obscene sums from the international workforce this process of ever increasing wealth for the few and exploitation for the majority is reaching a political breaking point explaining her work environment during the holidays the working mother said they just had us move 100 000 packages in 5 hours and at the end we aren t even paid enough to take care of our kids i m a single mother i don t receive food stamps my rent is 850 a month i have to pay for gas electricity bus passes plus raise two kids if we decided to quit who would move these packages out of the door she said noting the social power of the workers employed by the company we are the ones making you rich brian and i talk about amazon and the nefarious nature of how the guy at the washington post attacks the fourth grader trump and others while he is part of the military industrial complex from the intercept amazon s extensive relationship with the nsa fbi pentagon and other surveillance agencies in the west is multi faceted highly lucrative and rapidly growing last march the intercept reported on a new app that amazon developers and british police forces have jointly developed to use on the public in police work just the latest example of third parties aiding automating and in some cases replacing the functions of law enforcement agencies and raises privacy questions about amazon s role as an intermediary then there s the patent amazon obtained last october as reported by the intercept that would allow its virtual assistant alexa to decipher a user s physical characteristics and emotional state based on their voice in particular it would enable anyone using the product to determine a person s accent and likely place of origin the algorithm would also consider a customer s physical location based on their ip address primary shipping address and browser settings to help determine their accent all of this is taking place as amazon vies for and is the favorite to win one of the largest pentagon contracts yet a 10 billion agreement to provide exclusive cloud services to the world s largest military cnn reported just last week that the company is now enmeshed in scandal over that effort specifically a formal investigation into whether amazon improperly hired a former defense department worker who was involved with a 10 billion government contract for which the tech company iscompeting bezos relationship with the military and spying agencies of the u s government and law enforcement agencies around the world predates his purchase of the washington post and has become a central prong of amazon s business growth back in 2014 amazon secured a massive contract with the cia when the spy agency agreed to pay it 600 million for computing cloud software as the atlantic noted at the time amazon s software will begin servicing all 17 agencies that make up the intelligence community given how vital the military and spy agencies now are to amazon s business it s unsurprising that the amount amazon pays to lobbyists to serve its interests in washington has exploded quadrupling since 2013 from 3 million to almost 15 million last year according to open secrets what would the house less tommy and devon say about this byzantine world of hyper billions of dollars and hyper trillions of human hours wasted on the things of capitalism of power and control consumption i know many friends who wonder why we people like me still live in the us many wonder what it will take young people to stand down the systems of oppression some believe the young people have it as in greta the carbon dioxide robin hood or aoc the new face sic of american politics this system we have now is one where a few voices count get read heard published followed and the majority of voices are just bursts of yelling in the woods in campgrounds in one s lovely home in the old sedan in our own bedlam people travelling from one insane place to another but in that realm a sanity sets in for guys like tommy and devon the world is pretty clear cut and on many levels these people have positive outlooks toothless no real estate or swelling investment accounts just that hard way forward cigarettes and bicycling miles a day places to shower places to get out of the rain without the bulldozers of misanthropy pushing them further and further into ditches or out on the periphery until they stare us all down face to face the coming of a new brave world is it the entertaining ourselves to death cycle or a little bit of the other big brother watching our every move holding every syllable mouthed in a cloud server every speck of mole cataloged and every word penned or typed collected to hold us at bay hold us as prisoners of our own faulty beliefs needless to say charles dickens grew to hate the system and rail against it in his works in his seminal novella a christmas carol ebenezer scrooge is visited by two portly men raising money for the poor at this festive season of the year mr scrooge said the taking up a pen it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute who suffer greatly at the present time many thousands are in want of common necessaries hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts sir are there no prisons asked scrooge plenty of prisons said the gentleman laying down the pen again and the union workhouses demanded scrooge are they still in operation they are still returned the gentleman i wish i could say they were not the treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour then said scrooge both very busy sir oh i was afraid from what you said at first that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course said scrooge i m very glad to hear it under the impression that they scarcely furnish christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude returned the gentleman a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink and means of warmth we choose this time because it is a time of all others when want is keenly felt and abundance rejoices what shall i put you down for nothing scrooge replied you wish to be anonymous i wish to be left alone said scrooge since you ask me what i wish gentlemen that is my answer i don t make merry myself at christmas and i can t afford to make idle people merry i help to support the establishments i have mentioned they cost enough and those who are badly off must go there many can t go there and many would rather die if they would rather die said scrooge they had better do it and decrease the surplus population charles dickens 1843 a christmas carol or updated for 2020 as illustrated by a commentator on an article about portland or once the rose city now the city of rocks

news national by staff reporter the government is fed up with unscrupulous businesses that are in the habit of wantonly increasing prices of basic commodities and will soon consider scrapping off import duty on various goods and foodstuffs to allow individuals with free funds to access affordable goods across the country s borders in addition the government will revoke licences of businesses that have shown affinity to frustrate efforts to stabilise the economy by increasing prices without justification the warnings come as the business sector which some analysts now think is bent on deliberately sabotaging efforts by government to revive the economy effected price increases last week following the announcement that the country was abandoning the multi currency basket for local transactions and adopting the local currency before last week s announcement business used to peg their prices in united states dollars or equivalent however after the government s announcement the rate of the zimbabwe dollar to the us dollar tumbled by more than 50 percent from 1 12 to about 1 6 on the black market while it remained at around 1 6 on the interbank instead of reducing prices basing on the exchange rates as the businesses have been doing whenever there was adjustment of the rate most businesses actually increased the prices raising fears that this was unjustified if not a deliberate attempt to create disharmony and kill off all the confidence on the local currency however some businesses in harare had started heeding the call to reduce prices as the new measures to adopt a local currency began to tame runaway speculative activities and upward movements of the parallel market exchanges rates that had become rampant in the economy there are expectations that there will be continued pressure for prices to come down as reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz governor dr john mangudya said yesterday the central bank would move in to support bureau de changes so that they can operate efficiently and effectively a snap survey by our harare bureau showed that cooking oil prices which breached the 20 price for a 2 litre bottle was retailing between 16 and 18 at various outlets yesterday the price of a 2kg packet of flour had also slipped to between 11 and 12 from the previous range of 15 to 30 a 2kg bag of rice was selling between 10 50 and 11 representing a downward revision from top prices of 24 also prices of a 1kg packet of washing powder had dived to 20 from between 34 and 38 industry and commerce minister nqobizitha mangaliso ndlovu told sunday news on friday that government was surprised by local businesses and the time to continuously treat them with kids gloves was running out we are considering a number of options including reviewing the tariffs regime i don t know if we need to be charging duty for people who go and buy groceries outside the country for use when local businesses are killing the same people with high prices if they continue with this we will remove duty and people can go and buy outside freely he said added minister ndlovu how do you justify a sofa that is selling at r2 500 in south africa going for 44 000 in our own shops and we say when you are coming into the country pay duty for it to try and protect the local industry that cannot be acceptable at all minister ndlovu said the government thought when the exchange rates started going down business would at least maintain the prices if not reduce we have seen that prices are going up even when exchange rates are going down businesses were increasing prices every hour because they were justifying it on the exchange rate but now the exchange rate has gone down and their prices still go up what then is the justification for this sometimes our businesspeople can disappoint and this is a classic example that we are seeing here it also shows you the kind of businesspeople we have now people who are after the bottom line and the bottom line is profits at any cost he said the minister said the calibre of some businessespeople that are there now belong to the old dispensation i don t know where it is coming from but it tells me that there is a lot of mischief going on it tells me that we do not have any discipline in the market and people are taking advantage of our openness to engagement and our drive to create a market based economy where market forces determine prices they are used to a strict kind of approach where there is a heavy hand controlling prices they belong to the old dispensation it tells me that we are still to create business people for this country the minister said government would not continue shielding the greedy businesspeople what is vital is that when they business people realise their mistake it will be too late but we will not continue protecting businesses at the expense of the people they do not realise that the bigger cost to this is the increased eradication of the consumers buying power we will have a situation where consumers will reject those products and it is the businesspeople who will suffer at the end of the day warned minister ndlovu meanwhile a prominent academic nust pro vice chancellor innovation and business development dr gatsha mazithulela defended the re introduction of the local currency dr mazithulela who emphasised that he was speaking in his own capacity said what is clear is that there was no way the multi currency system could have been sustained further the issue of timing should also not be argued on theoretical terms real world situations rarely give any perfect fit to economic or any other theory for that matter argued dr mazithulela managers and leaders all over the world in any field make the best decisions possible using prevailing variables and mainly those that they can control perfect market conditions and the very nice alignment to other decision making matrices is rarely experienced in real life

donald trump has broken with many political traditions unwilling to acknowledge his own fallibility or limitations or the constraints of checks and balances he declared nobody knows the system better than me which is why i alone can fix it more than halfway through his term as president that claim invites an assessment of his performance here is a scorecard limited for now to domestic policy 1 promise nobody builds walls better than me believe me and i ll build them very inexpensively i will build a great great wall on our southern border and i ll have mexico pay for that wall mark my words trump promised to build the wall along the entire 2 000 mile length of the border he later said that with mountains and rivers forming natural barriers his wall would only have to cover about 1 000 miles performance by the end of 2018 about 40 miles of replacement barriers had been built or begun on trump s watch construction was expected to start on an additional 61 miles in 2019 president trump had not asked congress to fully fund his beautiful border wall mexico had not agreed to pay for new or replacement barriers or any wall construction at all 2 promise trump pledged to deploy all legal means to address the crisis at the border and stop the flow of illegal immigrants into the united states performance trump inherited the lowest rate of illegal immigration at the southern border in more than two decades in the last 18 months however the traffic has increased dramatically with 99 000 individuals apprehended in april 2019 alone 3 promise as a candidate trump called for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on he promised to immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism performance after courts blocked his executive order temporarily suspending immigration from seven muslim majority countries and the u s refugee program president trump on his third try got a green light from five supreme court justices to restrict the entry of nationals from iran libya somalia syria yemen north korea and venezuela a policy that covers less than 12 percent of the world s muslim population and does not include saudi arabia the home of the 9 11 terrorists 4 promise in his first month in office president trump pledged to repeal and replace the disaster known as obamacare he said it will be done essentially simultaneously most likely on the same day or same week but probably the same day could be the same hour performance despite republican majority control of both the u s house of representatives and the u s senate in 2017 and 2018 congress did not repeal the affordable care act president trump has not presented a proposal to replace it 5 promise during the 2016 campaign trump vowed to eliminate the national debt in eight years performance under the budget plan he released in 2019 under the title promises kept the 2020 deficit due in no small measure to the trump tax cuts and military spending is projected at 1 1 trillion and the federal government would not begin paying down the debt for 15 years even according to the administration s rosy revenue scenario annual deficits would continue beyond 2035 adding to a total that has now reached 22 trillion 6 promise president trump declared that the 2017 tax reform package constituted a massive tax cut for working families and promised we will soon follow up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class the rich will not be gaining at all from this plan he insisted performance economists agree the vast majority of the tax cuts benefitted the rich and corporations and contrary to claims at the time the corporations did not for the most part drive their savings into raising salaries for workers only between 4 and 14 percent of corporations used their tax savings to increase workers base salaries the majority funneled the windfall to shareholders in 2027 when tax cuts for individuals but not corporations expire 83 percent of the cuts will go to the top 1 percent an october 2018 gallup poll revealed that 64 percent of americans had noticed no boost to their paychecks president trump has not proposed a middle class tax cut 7 promise if elected trump boasted he would surround himself only with the best and most serious people we want top of the line professionals performance midway through his term an unprecedented number of cabinet members and senior staff have left the administration many others including for example ronny jackson trump s pick for secretary of veterans affairs herman cain and stephen moore his choices for the fed have withdrawn as criticism of their character and qualifications by republicans as well as democrats made it unlikely they would be confirmed trump has overruled the recommendations of members of his own administration and granted security clearances to jared kushner and dozens of others most revealing perhaps is president trump s assessment of his own appointees the president described attorney general jeff sessions as very weak scared stiff missing in action mr magoo he derided commerce secretary wilbur ross as past his prime secretary of state rex tillerson didn t have the mental capacity needed he was dumb as a rock and i couldn t get rid of him fast enough he was lazy as hell trump asked what has done for me how has he done in afghanistan trump indicated he is not even a little bit happy with his selection of jerome powell as chairman of the fed he claimed he was never a big fan of white house lawyer don mcgahn who he accused of lying in testimony to robert mueller other targets of trump s ire include national security adviser h r mcmaster chief economic adviser gary cohn and chief white house strategist stephen bannon 8 promise pay to play collusion cover ups and now bribery so crooked i will draintheswamp performance following revelations of unethical behavior scott pruitt chief of the environmental protection agency secretary of the interior ryan zinke and secretary of health and human services tom price resigned national security advisor michael flynn has pled guilty to lying to the fbi and been accused of failing to register as a lobbyist for a foreign country michael cohen trump s personal attorney has pled guilty to violating campaign finance laws and making false statements to congress the president has declined to fire senior advisor kellyanne conway for violating the hatch act dozens of administration officials seem to be in bed with the corporations they are supposed to regulate president trump faces possible legal action for violating campaign finance laws and the emoluments clause of the constitution faced with criticism president trump tends to double down the one that matters is me he told fox news laura ingraham that said he also blames everyone but himself for failures to implement his policies he alone it appears cannot fix it
trade tension between the united states and china eased in the last few days although serious questions remain about the difficulties between the two largest economies of the world the us president donald trump announced via his twitter page a telephone conversation with his chinese counterpart xi jinping an extended meeting between officials of both countries will be held at the tokyo g20 gathering which will take place at the end of the month despite short term optimism differences remain after the twitter announcement stock markets around the globe cheered the latest news as it showed a decrease in tensions between the two economic superpowers people who trade with trade com and other brokers saw how the us markets were again on their way up towards the record highs yet we still don t know whether the meeting will end up with a truce like it did in argentine last december source www uscib org tariffs of 25 on 200 billion worth of chinese imports have gone into effect since the beginning of june and the rest of 300 billion in imports are at risk of being taxed in the not too distant future we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us none of the sides is willing to make any significant compromise and many analysts predict the conflict between the us and china could go on for decades negative implications on the global economy an increase in protectionism by the us is already having a damaging effect on the global economy so far inflation had remained low in the western world but as long as tariffs remain in place or new ones come along inflationary pressures could accelerate in the following months the chinese economy already shows signs of weakness despite strong financial stimulus from the government even though the pboc the ecb and the fed have already shifted to a more dovish tone signaling that interest rate cuts and financial stimulation could come in the near future a continuation of the trade conflict could reduce their potential to ease if companies decide to pass along to consumers the increase in prices inflation will start to pick up significantly meaning central banks will not be able to ease monetary policy as they are aiming right now on the other hand if companies sacrifice their profits to cover the tariffs the financial performance will weaken and thus diminish their ability to increase their spending in the quarters to come either way the only solution is to have the conflict solved and that seems very unlikely in the short term disclaimer this content does not necessarily represent the views of iwb
menafn gulf times us president donald trump said the us was right back on track with china after a high stakes meeting with xi jinping yesterday trump called the meeting with xi excellent and said it went better than expected we want to do something that will even it up with respect to trade trump told xi at the beginning of their meeting in japan on the sidelines of the group of 20 summit i think it s something that s actually very easy to do i actually think that we were very close and then something happened where we slipped a little bit and now we re getting a little bit closer but it would be historic xi opened the meeting with a reference to the ping pong diplomacy in the 1970s that paved the way for formal diplomatic ties between the us and china china and the united states both benefit from co operation and lose from confrontation xi said in prepared remarks a temporary freeze on further us tariffs as well as chinese retaliation while talks get back under way was discussed by negotiators before the leaders met for lunch according to people briefed on the talks who asked not to be identified after almost a year of trade war the stakes couldn t be much higher a return to the negotiating table would end a six week stalemate that s unnerved companies and investors and damp the threat of a further escalation failure to do so would likely upset financial markets already whipsawed by mounting risks to a slowing global expansion trump earlier yesterday signalled the us had made progress in trade discussions with china ahead of the lunch meeting in japan which comes amid growing hopes the two powers will hit the pause button in their trade war and resume the search for a longer term peace speaking with reporters yesterday trump said that he would be discussing the us blacklisting of huawei technologies co as well as a broader trade deal he also said the two leaders and their negotiators had made progress during preparatory discussions on friday evening a lot was accomplished actually last night trump said prior to meeting xi the relationship is very good with china as to whether or not we can make a deal time will tell but the relationship itself is really great trump said adding that he and xi continued to have a very good friendship trump s comments came after xi spent much of the summit s first day friday promising to open up the chinese economy and chiding though not naming the us for its attack on the global trading system in remarks to african leaders on friday xi took a not so subtle swipe at trump s america first trade policy warning against bullying practices and adding that any attempt to put one s own interests first and undermine others will not win any popularity any cease fire would at least temporarily reduce fears that the world s two largest economies are headed into a new cold war though a broader conflict is viewed as increasingly inevitable in both beijing and washington concern about the standoff has prompted investors to bet on central bank easing and pile into havens treasury yields have tumbled to their lowest level in years the japanese yen a traditional beneficiary of flight to quality has gained while the us dollar has slipped across the board including against china s yuan stocks have seesawed on each new twist in the trade tug of war in that fraught environment even a return to negotiations won t guarantee a deal since the talks collapsed on may 10 trump has raised tariffs on 200bn of chinese goods to 25 from 10 in recent days he s indicated that the next step could be a 10 tariff on all remaining imports from china some 300bn worth from smartphones to children s clothes another big hurdle is last month s us blacklisting of huawei on national security grounds which threatens to cut off the chinese giant s access to american technology his administration has been lobbying allies around the world not to buy huawei equipment which the us says could be used for chinese espionage xi on friday called out the us over huawei and said the g 20 should uphold the completeness and vitality of global supply chains china insisted this week that huawei must be removed from the blacklist under any deal trump used to cite the reduction of america s goods trade deficit with china which reached a record 419bn last year as his main aim but his administration s focus has shifted to limiting chinese access to us innovation china s government has responded with increasingly harsh rhetoric that underscores its readiness for a long battle other disagreements that caused talks to break down include how to enshrine the chinese reforms demanded by the us over intellectual property theft and industrial subsidies and when and how to lift the tariffs that trump has come to view as his most powerful economic tool menafn3006201900670000id1098704839
people are seen inside the lehman brothers headquarters in new york on september 16 2008 the day after the bank filed for bankruptcy people are seen inside the lehman brothers headquarters in new york on september 16 2008 the day after the bank filed for bankruptcy mary altaffer ap on july 1 this officially becomes the longest recovery in u s history ten years or 121 months exceeding the expansion of 1991 it s been quite a ride according to steve rattner who manages money for michael bloomberg and spoke at the aspen ideas festival this week economists call it the 3 3 3 expansion 3 percent growth 3 percent unemployment and 3 percent wage increases during the last ten years there have only been two quarters with negative growth according to the bureau of labor statistics the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent and is now at 3 6 percent rattner says it would be even lower if americans were more willing to relocate for jobs the average net worth of households is at an all time high consumer confidence is the highest it s been since the dot com bubble in the 1990 s inflation is low some economists argue that it s too low hovering below 2 percent or to use the metric many americans use at the depth of the 2008 9 recession the dow jones industrial average dropped below 6 500 in march 2009 recently it closed over 26 500 an increase of over 300 percent the real question is how much longer this can go on and what happens when it stops no one knows of course but there s nothing wrong with educated guesses so i spoke to large investors as well as executives and board members of financial institutions in a word the pros the ones who spend their days watching a bank of screens with numbers and charts scrolling by and who if they don t get it right find themselves out of work none of them wanted me to use their names two agreed to talk off the record then even backed out from that the reason for their nervousness in a moment on a not for attribution basis they all said the same thing there s reason to believe the recovery will end soon and there s a reasonable probability the landing will be hard although not nearly as hard as the crash of 2008 as one source put it president donald trump speaks to guest during a groundbreaking ceremony for the 10 billion foxconn factory complex on june 28 2018 in mt pleasant wisconsin president donald trump speaks to guest during a groundbreaking ceremony for the 10 billion foxconn factory complex on june 28 2018 in mt pleasant wisconsin scott olson getty images to understand why it s necessary to first understand what s underneath the current expansion interest rates government spending and tax cuts for the most part fiscal and monetary policy under the obama and trump administrations has been pretty consistent it s created what one expert called a perfect world for economic expansion and low unemployment interest rates have been near historic lows government spending has been at historic highs the tax cuts injected a huge amount of money into the system and by cutting back some of the regulation that built up during the latter part of the obama administration trump has seemed to buoy the psyche of small and medium sized business owners but to a large extent this expansion has been the result of how the government has managed the economy rather than the underlying strength of the economy it s a little bit like a race car that wins not because it s got the best engine but because it s got the best driver it still won and that s great but continuing to win depends on the driver being able to make up for a crappy engine and economically this expansion hasn t been so good again according to rattner underlying productivity increases have been low as has corporate investment and rattner says running up the national debt without investing in infrastructure is in essence eating our seed corn what to worry about maybe nothing just like a party the economy keeps going as long as people want it to shareholders haven t left the party yet they re putting their tax cut windfalls back into the economy just in different investments but there are a lot of reasons for this party to end we have an enormous government deficit with the highest debt load as a percent of the economy since the end of wwii rattner calls the government deficit intergenerational theft student debt he says is another ticking time bomb there s also a belief among the financial institutions that some of the bad habits that led to the 2008 crash are coming back there s a lot more regulation than there used to be said an executive said and that s good the core is sound now banks aren t doing stupid things but there s a lot going on outside the core perpetually low interest rates have driven investors to seek out higher yields and as a consequence take on higher risks it s whack a mole the money has to go somewhere and it s going to private equity folks are lending to private equity with little or no covenants or traditional protections it s an unregulated world out there president donald trump speaks in the oval office on december 25 some former economic officials have reportedly told the white house that trump s recent tweets are wreaking havoc on the stock market president donald trump speaks in the oval office on december 25 some former economic officials have reportedly told the white house that trump s recent tweets are wreaking havoc on the stock market zach gibson pool getty images another expert argued that given the size of the corporate tax cut the stock market should be even higher than it is the yield curve is inverted which means short term rates are higher than long term rates to put that in consumer terms that s like a 30 year mortgage being cheaper than a 15 year loan and while consumer confidence is still high the conference board says this month it took a dip dropping to its lowest level in 21 months and it was a big drop almost ten points to 121 5 well below what experts expected risk weighted asset scores a measure of how much risk is in the debt markets are creeping up said another well informed source the traditional measures of risk are flashing overall more corporate debate a far greater proportion of the lowest investment grade debt bbb and a greater amount of below investment grade debt things are getting loose again and if the economy hits a bump much of that bbb debt could be below investment grade none of that is in and of itself enough to make the experts run for the storm cellar but it is enough to make them jittery every expansion ends at some point but not all endings are the same this one could land softly simply because the economy runs out of steam perhaps because the tariffs begin to bite or hard because there s a shock to the system like a cyber attack or debt liquidity crisis like the mortgage loan crisis of 2008 although that s probably not the right comparison the banking system is stronger now so it s less likely that liquidity would dry up overnight as it did then and of course there could be a war the trouble is this if the economy does start to slow down the government doesn t have a lot it can do in response short of firing up the presses and printing money the deficit is so high already a trillion dollars a year that there s not a lot of room for another stimulus interest rates are already very low and any further tax cuts would likely be politically unfeasible not to mention fiscally irresponsible given the national debt but if you re looking for a real yellow flag when it comes to our economic future here you go when i asked one top executive what his personal plan b was he sheepishly admitted to keeping a box of gold coins in his bedroom closet i don t think he was kidding and that s why no one who runs a business would go on the record executives have shareholders and investors none of them wants to admit to their shareholders that they keep apocalypse money in the bedroom closet and no one wants to be the one that ends the party by leaving first gold nugget just the right size to hide in your bedroom closet gold nugget just the right size to hide in your bedroom closet getty correction 7 1 9 40 a m this story originally said the expansion was 120 months long matching an earlier expansion the recovery has lasted 121 months exceeding the previous expansion
osaka the group of 20 summit in osaka ended on saturday with lofty language from powerful world leaders but it was eclipsed by us president donald trump who agreed to restart trade talks with china and extended a surprise invitation for north korea s leader to meet him sunday despite the focus on trump the summit s host japanese prime minister shinzo abe declared the gathering a success the g20 nations as the countries that lead the world economy have a responsibility to squarely face global problems and to come up with solutions through frank dialogue abe said in concluding the meeting now with this osaka declaration we should try to tenaciously find not the differences but common ground among us and we hope to continue our effort to sustain global economic growth he said in striving for common ground however the summit declaration finessed differences and yielded no major new initiatives still german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the fact that the leaders managed to hold the line on the issue of climate change with 19 countries committing themselves to the paris climate accord only the us dissented reiterating trump s decision to withdraw from the paris agreement because it disadvantages american workers and taxpayers fast fact the g20 is an international forum for the governments and central bank governors of 19 countries and the eu established in 1999 merkel told reporters that this process cannot be turned around she said some leaders in osaka indicated they were willing to up commitments to curb greenhouse gases by aiming for net zero emissions by 2050 merkel also lauded the deal between the eu and the latin american bloc mercosur also struck on the g 20 sidelines to create the world s largest free trade zone after 20 years of negotiations the agreement includes a reference to the goals of the paris accord japan had pushed for the osaka summit to become a landmark for progress on environmental issues including tackling the global problem of plastic waste and recommitting to efforts to counter climate change leaders said they d look into a wide range of clean technologies and approaches including smart cities ecosystem and community based approaches the g20 leaders have long sought to present a united front in promoting open markets and calling for smart policies to fend off threats to global economic growth but the schisms over such issues as protectionism and migration are straining efforts to forge the usual consensus on a broad array of policy approaches and geopolitical issues the summit declaration did not take aim at protectionism but included a call for free fair non discriminatory and open markets weren t we originally seeking agreement on these principles we need to go back to the original point so that we can remember what it was we were initially seeking abe said this time we managed to go back to this original point to come to agreeing on these important principles much of the spotlight of the two day meeting focused on trump using twitter he raised a stir by inviting north korea s kim jong un to shake hands during a visit the he plans to make to the heavily armed demilitarized zone between the koreas on sunday if chairman kim of north korea sees this i would meet him at the border dmz just to shake his hand and say hello north korea s first vice foreign minister choe son hui responded by saying it was a very interesting suggestion and the meeting if realized would serve as another meaningful occasion in further deepening the personal relations between the two leaders and advancing the bilateral relations she said north korea still hadn t received an official proposal for the meeting from the us trump has at times found himself at odds with other leaders in such international events china meanwhile has sought support for defending global trade agreements against trump s america first stance in gatherings like the g20 at the outset of their meeting trump told xi he wants to even it up in respect to trade and that he thought it would be very easy to do the two sides have levied billions of dollars worth of tariffs on each other s products and talks on resolving the longstanding issues had stalled in may afterward trump said that the talks were back on track he said he had decided to hold off on imposing more tariffs on chinese exports while china planned to buy more american farm products china s official xinhua news agency said xi and trump had agreed to restart trade talks on the basis of equality and mutual respect it s unclear however if they have overcome the obstacles that brought the talks to a halt earlier i think that realistically that the two sides there are substantive issues that remain to be resolved subsidies state owned enterprise reform industrial policy in china that go to the core of china s economic system said jacob parker vice president of us china business council china operations these are not issues that are going to be resolved quickly or overnight and i think we have to expect that both sides are going to have to compromise a little bit they can t let perfect be the enemy of good parker said
islamabad prime minister imran khan saturday said the government will now launch a full fledged crackdown on money laundering and plug the loopholes left by the former ruling elite to commit the crime taking the floor after the national assembly passed 107 supplementary grants relating to different ministries divisions and departments on the last day of budget session he said the main reason for increase in devaluation of pak rupee was money laundering mainly by the ruling elite in the past how can others be stopped from money laundering when those sitting in the government themselves are involved in this illegal practice he asked the prime minister said in the last four to five years the properties of pakistanis in dubai had reached the figure of 5 billion while there was also information that resident pakistanis were keeping 10 billion abroad taken out of the country he said asif ali zardari also took foreign exchange out of pakistan through the omni group making a mention of hudaibiya paper mills and hill metal he asked how the opposition leader who himself was a money launderer could talk about devaluation of pak rupee he came down hard on his critics saying those calling him a selected prime minister had signed an nro with a military dictator to hide their corruption and were manufactured in the nurseries of military dictators he said murad saeed in his speech quoted former us secretary of state condoleezza rice who had mentioned in her autobiography that former military ruler pervez musharraf had been asked to drop corruption cases against members of the current opposition the americans collaborated to have the national reconciliation ordinance nro signed because it was in their interest khan said setting the record straight that person who signed the nro with musharraf to hide his corruption is now using the word selected he said adding that asif zardari also sent money abroad through the hundi and hawala without naming shahbaz sharif khan said he

budget be spent on development and uplift of balochistan and fata imran said amid a thunderous applause from the treasury benches khan said the incumbent government had taken special measures in the budget to check lopsided development in the past and develop those areas left far behind in development he said when the pti government took over it inherited current deficit of 19 5 billion and there was dollar crunch in the country it is a fact that the rate of dollar goes up when it is in short supply in the country and when there is current deficit he added he asked as to how those politicians who were facing charges of corruption and looting public money could deliver speeches in this house of public representatives how a person who has been facing billions of rupees corruption charges for the last 30 years can head the public accounts committee pac whose task is to protect public interests he regretted that the last parliament had passed a bill allowing a leader disqualified by the supreme court to head a political party imran congratulated his party and ministers chief whip and allies for their participation in the budget session saying quality speeches were delivered from the treasury benches imran particularly appreciated minister of state for revenue hammad azhar for conducting the budget session and his composure during the proceedings he has emerged as a young leader and earned the place of federal minister for himself he said the prime minister was happy to note that the budget was passed despite big slogans from the opposition and despite efforts of a politician

youth in his speech minister of state for finance and revenue hammad azhar said the government had substantially brought down the supplementary demands for grants as last year these stood at rs599 4 billion while this year these were standing at about rs200 billion he said the opposition parties should appreciate reduction in the supplementary budget the house also passed a resolution strongly condemning the language used by the ppp chairman bilawal bhutto zardari against the national assembly speaker the resolution was moved by minister for human rights shireen mazari demanding an apology

current situation when elections are not transparent he said adding that many members sitting in this house had not been elected through votes he said the finger is pointed at the last elections because the ecp had no role inside the polling stations he said nowhere in the world security personnel were deputed inside the polling stations now that the security situation has improved the
