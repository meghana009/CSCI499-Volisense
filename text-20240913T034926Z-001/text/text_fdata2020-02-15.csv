joining us today before ana graciela delves into key aspects of our earnings results for the fourth quarter and for full year 2019 i d like to discuss some important developments that took place this year and their impact on our perception of risk and financial results i will address the global macroeconomic context economic and business environment in latin america and other specific developments affecting our portfolio after ana graciela s review i will also address my successor as ceo reasons for my departure details of the transition and what us shareholders should expect from jorge salas administration of bladex during our last five quarter conference calls we mentioned that the credit quality of our portfolio cost structure and allowances for expected credit losses set the pace for our earnings generation capacity our fourth quarter and all of 2019 results are another step in that direction in 2019 the global economy experienced its weakest year of growth since the financial crisis weighed down by tensions that have significantly slowed international trade according to the imf global growth was only 2 9 significantly below potential which we estimated at 3 8 the main drivers for the lackluster performance of the world economy were the trade war between the us and china negative trade flows that disrupted supply chain and idiosyncratic risks in countries such as italy and turkey that along with brexit affected european growth and in particular germany the us economy grew by 2 3 in 2019 which did contribute to world growth but had a limited impact service sector trade and investment which have positive ripple effects throughout the world economy lagged nevertheless the us was a beacon of light in an otherwise grim world economic picture despite historically low unemployment and solid growth the fed lowered interest rates to counteract economic weakness elsewhere with inflation under 2 and inflation expectations under control the fed lowered its benchmark federal funds rate three times during the year to a level of 1 75 under normal circumstances the fed s actions would have been a headwind for the us dollar but in an overall low growth environment with the geopolitical flare ups around the world the us dollar strengthened always a negative development for commodity prices and foreign direct investments into emerging markets although forecast by the imf sea world trade flows expanding by just 3 in 2020 and global economic growth of 3 3 we believe that these modest estimates like in 2019 may be revised downwards ongoing swings at trade disputes social disturbances in key countries and climate change were key factors identified as risks to their forecast furthermore growth expectations are anchored on diminishing trade tensions between the us and china and the resumption of growth in trade flows we question these expectations particularly in light of the coronavirus outbreak and the impact it may have on both chinese and global commerce to summarize the global context we see the potential for more noise on the trade front despite the signing of the first phase of the chinese us agreement global growth below potential geopolitical risk coming from the middle east asia and latin america and what we call it idiosyncratic risks from countries such as argentina italy and turkey 2019 was a difficult year for latin america economic growth came in at 0 1 significantly below the 1 growth of 2018 and significantly below beginning of year expectations of 2 1 after other than 2016 when brazil experienced its sharpest recession in the last 70 years 2019 was the slowest growth year for latin america in a decade of the largest three economies of latin america which represent about 75 of the gdp of the region brazil was the only one that showed any signs of life growing tepidly at 1 2 mexico had zero growth a remarkable decoupling from a strong us economy and argentina s gdp shrunk by 3 3 trade flows for latin america overall declined 2 1 and are only expected to recover by 1 6 in 2020 we see a similar picture with respect to 2020 economic growth expectations after a difficult 2019 estimates are just for 1 5 growth despite these modest expectations we believe there are risks to downward revisions we regard brazil as the main potential driver for economic growth in the region that said colombia and peru should also perform well but with commodity prices depressed because of trade uncertainties and strong and a strong us dollar mexico stuck in a low growth or no growth mode due to needed fiscal restraint tight monetary policy to keep portfolio money flowing and fundamental lack of investment the potential for social unrest in chile and in smaller countries like costa rica which has merit in the fiscal rating or ecuador struggling to comply with the imf program we simply do not see other countries as significant contributors to regional growth brazil is about 36 of the gdp of latin america so while we are cautiously optimistic about its capacity to implement an aggressive privatization program pension and labor reform along with other free market friendly measures we re always watchful for political repercussions and their consequences our current expectations for economic growth are 2 4 for brazil we are looking to increase exposure there to the extent that we can identify growth in credit demand and can profitably lend to companies that meet our credit underwriting parameters as mentioned in our last call we continue to see medium term risks in mexico because of the prospect of political interference in state owned entities that for the last 20 years were run independently and professionally although the current administration has shown a willingness to keep mexico on the good side of the rating agencies maintaining a small primary fiscal surplus continued support for pemex in restoring production and a good relationship with the us challenges remain even after the signing of the us mca our base scenario remains that mexico will not be downgraded to below investment grade until 2021 as such we maintain a short term profile of 10 month of average life in our mexico portfolio a portion of the andean corridor stands out with peru and colombia exhibiting good growth prospects although lower commodity prices will temper growth expectations improved macro stability and a regeneration of consumer demand should power the peruvian and colombian economies forward to the tune of 3 2 and 3 respectively for 2020 we are increasing exposure to these countries in our portfolio in chile we expect very subdued growth of 1 3 in 2020 after the economy came to a halt in late 2019 because of social disruptions that call for a new constitution and a more equitable pension system the chilean economy is sound and should be able to withstand ongoing flare ups of social disturbances while maintaining a solid credit profile we will use these periods of uncertainty to maintain or increase our exposure at a profitable level most of central america and the caribbean continue to have solid economic growth prospects despite lower commodity prices for their exports and subdued demand from the developed world we are paying close attention to developments in costa rica as fiscal reform seems to have to be having little impact in improving the fiscal deficit it may be too early to judge the effectiveness of the reforms but we wanted to see by now some improvement in fixed fiscal accounts from the higher and broader vat and what we got was nearly a 7 deficit in 2019 therefore we keep our exposure in costa rica to short term with companies that have a significant presence in other countries in latin america what we call the multilatina we continue to pay close attention to ecuador its implementation or lack of the imf program and its capacity to raise the 9 billion it needs for 2020 so far the country may be able to count with only 4 billion from multilateral organizations while the capital markets may not be forthcoming given its inability to implement agree to reforms the contractionary elements of the imf prescriptions such as the elimination of fuel subsidies have encountered strong opposition from political groups argentina then suspended animation the new government refuses to submit an economic plan until it has clarity on debt negotiations while needless to say foreign debt holders are reluctant to agree to a debt restructuring without an economic program that underpins the sustainability of future debt obligations it is unclear what comes next in the meantime the argentinian treasuries are having trouble selling local debt having declared the last two options deserted raising the prospect of a further closing of the economy to prevent pesos that nobody seems to be willing to hold from being converted into dollars and leaving the country as you ll hear from ana graciela we have reduced our exposure to argentina significantly and are very comfortable with what remains concentrated in strategic industries and us dollar generators we continue to believe that the current macroeconomic context offers no room for complacency furthermore the combination of low growth and risk aversion is exacerbating liquidity for the top names in the region compressing their margin not always compensating for the risk these credits represent against this backdrop we continue to analyze the risk reward function on the country level adjusting our portfolio accordingly and maintaining a vigilant credit underwriting posture at 73 of our commercial portfolio has less than one year of remaining life bladex is in a privileged position to dynamically adjust exposures our book of business is solid we are adding new clients and identifying new prospects we re increasing share of wallet with our existing client base and we re structuring value added transactions our focus on high quality borrowers and pursuant us dollar liquidity in key markets puts some pressure on regeneration margin that said bladex has been able to maintain a relatively stable margin level in 2019 our syndicated and structured transactions tied to latin american integration have had a solid performance with a strong finish in the fourth quarter increasing our fee income deposits particularly from our class a shareholders represent 52 of our funding sources we appreciate the trust and commitment of the region central bank and the impact that these deposits have in improving our cost of funds that said we continue to diversify our funding sources we started a new yankee cd program that will complement our short term funding structure on the cost side expenses for the quarter continued to be under control and have been mostly impacted by the seasonal effects of the fourth quarter as you ll hear from ana graciela our credit impaired loans experienced a slight decrease from last quarter as well as a reduction in our watchlist category our credit reserve coverage and tier 1 capital ratio remained strong and our book value remained solid above 25 a share that is why our board of directors approved to maintain 0 385 a share dividend against this backdrop the management of bladex as well as its board of directors is cautiously optimistic for 2020 and looks for a continuation of the profitability path we embarked on in the last five quarters with these initial comments i will now turn the call over to our cfo ana graciela to provide you with more detail about our 2019 performance ana graciela de mendez executive vice president chief financial officer good morning to everyone thank you gabriel let me first say that it has been an honor having a company view in driving the bank through the strong opportunities today under your stewardship the bank has reinforced its business fundamentals on which to continue building and creating value i will now go through the results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 into more detail making reference to the presentation uploaded on our website first on page 4 let me highlight the bank s 2019 annual performance recording a profit of 86 million or 2 17 per share on five consecutive quarters of sustained profitability these results compared to an 11 million profit in 2018 while the bank recorded impairment losses on financial instruments and non financial assets totaling 67 5 million mostly related to impaired credit 2019 results were based on steady topline revenues year on year as the bank was able to maintain a nearly stable net lending margin with average commercial portfolio volumes slightly up while shifting its credit underwriting toward lower risk countries this is particularly quite an achievement in a context of virtually no economic growth and decreased trade activity across the latin american region coupled with a declining interest rate environment during the second half of the year during 2019 the bank improved its efficiency reaching a cost to income ratio of 32 on the account of a 17 reduction in its operating expenses evidencing its effective cost control management and overall enhanced structural and operational efficiencies also during 2019 the bank improved its risk profile not only by reshifting its portfolio origination toward lower risk countries but also evidenced by the decrease in its watchlist exposures and the fact that no new credits have been classified as npls since the third quarter of 2018 as a result credit provision charges recorded as impairment loss on financial instrument decreased substantially year on year to 430 000 compared to a 57 5 million charge in 2018 now on to quarterly results profit for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled 22 million or 0 56 per share representing a quarter on quarter increase of 8 and an annual increase of 7 on page 5 net interest income the bank s main revenue pool accounting for about 86 of total revenue was stable year on year at 110 million for 2019 net interest margin which represents the net yield of productive assets that is net interest income to average interest earning assets was 1 74 for 2019 an increase of 3 basis points year on year positively impacted by the net effect of increasing libor based market rates during 2018 which remained high through the first half of 2019 net interest spread which reflects the difference in average rates between assets and liabilities are indicative of the trends in net lending spread and remained nearly stable throughout the year at 1 19 for 2019 down 2 basis points year on year while average lending volumes decreased slightly by 2 year on year for the fourth quarter of 2019 net interest income of 27 million was up by 1 quarter on quarter and down 4 year on year the quarter on quarter increase relates to a 6 growth in average lending volume offsetting a 12 basis point decrease in net interest margin to 1 65 mostly related to lower lending spreads on increased origination in top quality countries the year on year quarterly net interest income decline is mostly attributable to a decline in lending spreads together with the net negative effect of decreasing market rates and an inverted yield curve during the second half of the year these were partly compensated by a decrease in low yielding average liquidity and its proportion to total interest earning assets now moving on to page 6 fees and commissions totaled 15 6 million in 2019 down 9 year on year due to a 12 decline in fees from the letters of credit business partly compensated by a 14 increase in loan syndication fees as the bank successfully closed six structured transactions during 2019 during the fourth quarter of 2019 fees totaled 5 4 million up 90 quarter on quarter and stable year on year the quarterly increase is related to two closed transactions in the structuring and syndication business in the fourth quarter while fees from letters of credit have experienced a positive quarterly trend throughout 2019 from pages 7 through 9 we present the evolution and composition of our commercial portfolio which includes loan and off balance sheet exposures such as letters of credit and guarantees our commercial portfolio totaled 6 5 billion at year end 2019 up 5 quarter on quarter and up 3 year on year as we experienced a pickup in credit demand and good risk reward opportunities during the fourth quarter our commercial portfolio remains short term in nature with 73 maturing in the next 12 months and an average remaining tenor of about 12 months while trade exposures constituted 53 of our short term origination financial institutions continue to be the largest industry exposure representing 56 of the total the remaining exposure is well diversified among several industry sectors throughout the region none of which exceeded 7 at year end throughout 2019 the bank improved the country risk profile of its portfolio being able to reduce its exposure to argentina by 385 million down to 3 of the total portfolio at year end 2019 from 10 the year before after successfully collecting maturities as planned at the same time the bank increased exposure to top rated countries such as chile representing 11 of the total portfolio compared to 3 the year before and to colombia above 4 points to 15 of the total portfolio at december 31 2019 the bank also increased exposures to non latam top rated countries in europe and north america which at year end 2019 accounted for 7 of total portfolio these exposures are related to transactions carried out in latin america mostly with multi nationals operating in the region other country exposure annual variations such as reductions in brazil panama mexico and costa rica relate to the bank s continued focus on optimizing its risk reward equation on to page 10 credit impaired loans or npl totaled 62 million at december 31 2019 stable quarter on quarter and down 3 million from the previous year the annual reduction is related to the sales and exposure back in the third quarter of 2019 which resulted in 0 5 million collection and a 2 5 million write off against existing individually allocated reserves as mentioned before no loans have been classified as npls or credit impaired under the ifrs 9 stage 3 category since september of 2018 npls represented 1 of total loans with a reserve coverage of 1 7 times and accounted for a single client exposure in brazil with an ifrs 9 stage 3 individually allocated allowance of 88 reflecting a book value of around 8 million ifrs 9 stage 2 exposure experienced a net decrease of over 130 million during 2019 mostly due to repayments of scheduled maturities this category incorporates exposures that have undergone some credit deteriorations in their origination some of which are related to internal country risk downgrades or to their incorporation in our watchlist all of the exposure in this category remains current origination in our stage 1 portfolio which relates to the performing portfolio with credit conditions unchanged since origination increased by close to 350 million during 2019 and accounted for 95 of total exposure at year end 2019 stage 1 collective credit reserve decreased by 2 million during 2019 reflecting the improved country risk profile on to page 11 operating expenses for the year 2019 decreased by 17 to 41 million which led to an improved efficiency level of 32 compared to 38 in the previous year the annual expense reduction was mostly related to a 14 decrease in personnel related expenses mainly associated to a restructuring back in 2018 reduction in other expenses partly related to the adoption of new accounting standard ifrs 16 in 2019 powered by the bank s office space lease expenses are now accounted for as depreciation and interest expense other expenses were also reduced on the absence of one time charges recorded in 2018 as well as other cost savings across the organization which reflect the bank s continued effort and focus on expense controls and process improvement fourth quarter 2019 expenses amounted to 11 million down 9 year on year and up 26 quarter on quarter the latter mostly related to higher employee related expenses and other seasonally high expenses related to year end activity finally on page 12 we present the positive trends in roe reaching 8 7 for the fourth quarter and 8 6 for the year 2019 on a sustained solid capitalization of 19 8 at year end 2019 total shareholder return above 7 was supported by 0 385 quarterly dividend payment announced today representing a 69 payout ratio over quarterly earnings i would now like to turn the call back to gabriel thank you n gabriel tolchinsky chief executive officer thank you ana it s been a true pleasure and privilege to have worked with you and the rest of the team ana graciela de mendez executive vice president chief financial officer thanks n gabriel tolchinsky chief executive officer after five years with working at bladex from consultant to chief operating officer and finally for the last two years as ceo i will be leaving the bank so i can be closer to my family in new york this was a consensual decision with the board of directors that gave us ample time to find the right candidate for the ceo position and to ensure a smooth transition when i took the chief operating officer job almost three years ago my wife and i were becoming empty nesters as our youngest child was leaving for college the plan was that both of us would move to panama but unfortunately and for the family reasons that couldn t happen and we have had to live apart for the last three years i thought me becoming bladex s ceo would be a job that would last a lifetime i have loved every day working at the helm when i took over two years ago there were significant challenges that i needed to take on i had with me an a team and together we accomplished so much in the last two years we took the bank from one of the most difficult credit cycles in latin america to solid and sustainable earnings tightened our credit underwriting standards to withstand challenging macroeconomic and industry environment designed and implemented an active portfolio management structure to optimize our exposure along the efficient frontier worked with our stakeholders with transparency and clarity as to what we were doing and why we were doing it the governance structure everything from board and management committees to key management roles data and compliance strengthened our operating model reviewed our processes and procedures and control structure wrote off obsolete operational and technology assets and instilled the culture of risk management and control i am pleased to say today that bladex s balance sheet is pristine the bank has been able to return to roes between 8 5 to 9 despite a very challenging environment over the past two years macroeconomic risks slow regional economic growth tepid trade flows and idiosyncratic country and industry risks have been the norm and all those risks were coupled with overwhelming liquidity chasing the same credit worthy client if bladex can deliver 8 5 8 6 roe with these headwinds we should be very well positioned to deliver more sizable returns in a more benign environment that will surely come we are keenly aware of the risks in the legion and the industries we finance and with confidence i can say that our team knows how to spot opportunities and deliver results i have been working on transitioning jorge salas for a few weeks and strongly believe that bladex is fortunate to have him he is a highly qualified professional who has been working in the financial sector for over 20 years in different countries and with diverse mandates including ceo for the past 10 years jorge recognizes that he is getting a well functioning bank with a strong presence and reputation in our region and he is cognizant of bladex s need for continuity i look forward to following bladex under his leadership finally i want to thank our board of directors and our shareholders for the trust you instilled in me these years and i m very grateful to the team and employees of bladex i now open the call for the q a session questions and answers operator our first question comes from yuri fernandes j p morgan yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst thank you gentlemen first of all i would like to wish the best luck to gab and also to jorge salas who was elected the new ceo so all the best of luck and my first question i guess is more to ana graciela regarding the asset quality it was very good this quarter but if you can provide more color on the brazilian exposure i think it s sugar industry related if you believe these may continue on the stage 3 or these may evolve how these loans evolving given its big exposure and i have a second one to gab regarding i know he is leaving but like what s his expectations for growth for 2020 it seems like he is optimistic brazil is doing better but we also have china now and i don t know like if you can provide any color on loan growth for 2020 like what is bladex s expectation for this year thank you ana graciela de mendez executive vice president chief financial officer thank you yuri thanks for your question first on the npl exposure in brazil that exposure hasn t changed since we recorded it as npl in back in september of 2018 and back then we also allocated a large amount of individually allocated reserve to that particular exposure which now accounts for 88 so even though in or in terms of nominal values the exposure is 62 million and yes it s related to the sugar exposure our book value when you take into account the allocated reserve is close to 8 million so that particular exposure it s undergone a long period of restructuring which is still in process and we do expect that during this year 2020 the restructuring process should finalize and then we would be able to record in our books the end result of that restructuring but i would like to stress that the book value of the exposure is about 8 million and we definitely think it s adequate at this point in time and under the restructuring that we are undergoing yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst sorry gabriel just a follow up to finalize ana graciela s points do you think there should be a reversal at this point like it s more likely to get a reversal or maybe you need more provisions here or hard to say ana graciela de mendez executive vice president chief financial officer no we accounting wise there s a very strict methodology and what we report in our book is precisely the value that we see in terms of recovery of that credit and if that changes well we will pay the necessary provisions or reversals as they may happen but as of today that is the value of the recovery that we are foreseeing yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst got it thank you n gabriel tolchinsky chief executive officer well first of all yuri thank you for your well wishes and question let me just add a tiny bit to what ana graciela was saying at this point in time beyond the exposure that ana graciela was mentioning we don t have any sugar exposure to brazil ana graciela de mendez executive vice president chief financial officer right n gabriel tolchinsky chief executive officer the remaining sugar exposure that we have which totals about 150 million is in countries with let s say very little or no exposure to international market that its exposure of a different dynamic than the one in brazil which is completely exposed to price the sugar price fluctuation so that s just to add a little bit more color on that particular exposure beyond that i if you can repeat your question because your line was not very clear and i just want to make sure that i address it correctly yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst no it s just how you are seeing loan growth how do you think it was a good acceleration quarter over quarter and now if you are seeing i don t know like a better dynamics for 2020 or is the china noise may be a headwind like how you re seeing your potential for growth for 20 n gabriel tolchinsky chief executive officer well we usually discuss objective parameters that kind of underpin the growth of our business and we don t give specific guidance on a for our performance but we will say that we have been able to navigate a very challenging low growth environment now for the past two years and we believe that we have again very good penetration with our existing client base have been able to source new clients and gain a larger share of wallet with our existing client base so and we are as i said cautiously optimistic the bank historically has grown some multiple of overall trade flows in the region being focused on trade finance but as i said we don t give specific guidance as to the growth in our balance sheet yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst super clear gab thank you and thank you gabriel for the next three years last three years in the ceo the partnership thank you n gabriel tolchinsky chief executive officer thank you ana graciela de mendez executive vice president chief financial officer thank you yuri operator our next question comes from jim marrone singular research jim marrone singular research analyst yes thank you for taking my question and first of all i just want to wish gabriel well it sounds like you did a very fine job over the past few years and i wish you continued health and happiness going forward my question is in regards to the n gabriel tolchinsky chief executive officer thank you so much jim marrone singular research analyst yes you re welcome my question is in regards to basically the interest environment and maybe interest expectations going for 2020 so i believe in the last conference call you mentioned i believe ana mentioned that the low interest environment actually negatively impacted results and it doesn t seem like interest rates are going to be going up in fact they re going to continue to stay low in regards to coronavirus exposure and global trade however i believe you mentioned that the results were going to be reversed and i was just hoping you comment on that if that expectation still exists and if there was a reversal when you would anticipate that reversal to happen ana graciela de mendez executive vice president chief financial officer okay i will take that jim thank you yes as you know our interest rate gaap profile is very short we both our assets and liabilities repriced in a very short tenure having said that our liabilities because of the deposit base that is 60 of total liabilities and very short tenure usually also reprice a little quicker so when the interest rates are going down depending on the provision that we have in our assets and liabilities we may have a short period of repricing that may be favorable or not in this last particular case since the interest rate decline was also accompanied with an inverted yield curve that ended up causing a negative impact in the last couple of quarters but that is very temporary so you should see now going forward and we have already started to see a reversal in that trend and basically the repricing almost on between assets and liabilities and at the end of the day that the net effect is pretty much neutral going forward on the other hand due to the fact that we have over 1 billion in equity which somehow provides financing for interest earning assets or a portion of as rates go down our nim gets pressured also because of the lower yield in the assets in general what we see going forward is with stable rates so we also see that for now for the time being the rates have seemed to be that are going to be remaining stable throughout 2020 and so business as usual for us in terms of maintaining our net interest spread more driven on the credit spread that we are able to get from lending in the region basically jim marrone singular research analyst in terms of net interest spread for 2020 are we anticipating any to stay the same or any uptick i believe in the last quarter it was 1 8 and the quarter before that was 1 9 are we anticipating to see the same type of spread going forward for 2020 ana graciela de mendez executive vice president chief financial officer like real estate we don t provide for estimates going forward but you can see the trend having to do with our incredible shift in country risk profile and it that speaks for itself we think we are in terms of loan portfolio the spreads went down in the fourth quarter of 2018 from 1 97 to 1 92 in this past quarter so the change was not dramatically high so we actually are seeing pretty stable trend jim marrone singular research analyst and perhaps just as a follow up question the profitability so it was a nice year over year in 2018 can you just provide a little bit of color in regards to why those impairments occurred in 2018 and what we could expect in 2020 i know it s very hard to estimate impairment losses but if you could just provide a little bit of color in that regard that would be great n gabriel tolchinsky chief executive officer yes thank you jim i will take that question i think that what we can say is that we ve done a significant shift in the composition of our asset base to lower risk exposure that is reflected if you see for example our overall stage 2 has been declining our stage 3 exposure has been completely stable and those are the trends that we ve seen throughout 2019 and those are the trends that we intend to keep on a go forward basis so yes there were some individually allocated reserves that needed to be allocated to problem credits in 2018 that was done the bank right now is in a very good position from a risk profile to continue with the path it embarked on for the past five quarters and the exposure in the portfolio and the exposure in the watchlist category show that so i m not sure if that answers your questions but stability is part of what we expect and primarily we think that is the right approach to what we believe is a challenging macroeconomic context and that is how the bank is planning to confront these environments now obviously these environments don t last forever and our expectations is that our returns can get better maybe even significantly better if instead of having an headwind we start having a little tailwinds and see a more uncertain growth picture from latin america and trade flows overall and the liquidity that seems to be flushing around chasing the name gets better distributed throughout the economy and margins start reflecting that overall increase in credit demand that really we have not seen in the last two years jim marrone singular research analyst great definitely that provides a lot more clarity thank you ana graciela de mendez executive vice president chief financial officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from robert tate global rational capital robert tate global rational capital analyst good day gabriel and ana gabriel thank you very much for being the ceo and for providing a good performance over the period that you ve been ceo and as well as providing useful information in the presentation quarterly basis n gabriel tolchinsky chief executive officer thank you robert robert tate global rational capital analyst i just have two questions the first question is related to the credit risk in the portfolio and the second question is related to the sources of funding and so just on the first question in the portfolio the credit risk which i think has been talked about quite a bit already but just the previous ceo mr amaral he resigned i think in the second quarter of 2019 and then a quarter later there was that the massive write off that sugar loan which caused quite a substantial drop in shareholder value i m pretty sure that was just a coincidence and i wouldn t expect that to happen again but nevertheless i just want to ask some questions on the credit risk in the portfolio specifically relating to the watchlist and stage 2 credit loans i was just wondering if you could just you ana expand on the nature of the loans in the watch list and in stage 2 sort of what industries they are what countries and whether you re seeing any increased risk there or not i know that the stage 2 loans have come down but if you could just give us a bit more color on that that would be great thank you n gabriel tolchinsky chief executive officer sure thank you robert let me just say that in our watchlist category our single largest exposure is 10 5 million so that should give you a sense of the risk and as you ve seen it s a category that has been constantly shown here robert tate global rational capital analyst yes ana graciela de mendez executive vice president chief financial officer yes and the total has so in the stage 2 category we may have exposures that on an individual basis have not we have not seen a deterioration in their indicators that we follow but they are in countries which the bank has decided to downgrade because of credit and risks that have increased and so the exposures that are originated in these countries are automatically put on our stage 2 category and those are not part of our watchlist but part of the reduction we have seen in that category relates to the maturity of exposures in argentina and costa rica for example that underwent credit downgrades internal downgrades country risk downgrades and so that exposure has been maturing and we have been collecting it and then the other part of the stage 2 exposure relates to this watchlist category which has also decreased significantly and that accounts for like gabriel mentioned the highest is 10 million and really the total is less than even 25 million as of december 31 so it has been decreasing significantly also and these are exposures that we do assess individually and because of the trends that we see not necessarily and actually they have not failed in the repayment schedule that they have with us but we see in the individual analysis that there is some deterioration in their indicators and so our credit risk area puts them in our watchlist and pretty much on the run off mode and so that has also decreased significantly over this past year n gabriel tolchinsky chief executive officer yeah thank you ana and just as a point of comparison 2018 the watchlist category was about 53 million so that is also an indication of the overall improved quality of our portfolio what was your second question robert please robert tate global rational capital analyst yes so the second question is just on the financing thank you by the way for the first question so you mentioned that you continue to diversify your funding sources beyond your typical central bank deposits and they the central bank deposits obviously make up the bulk of your funding and really good interest rates but do you see any do you foresee any difficulties in obtaining access to the central bank deposits going forward and do you foresee any pressure on the net interest spreads as a result of increases in the cost of interest bearing liabilities n gabriel tolchinsky chief executive officer i know robert we actually are very confident and we do analysis on the historical trends of central bank deposits and they are characterized for their stability over time even though they re very short tenure and cost effective for the bank so we do not foresee that line of funding source being reduced on the contrary they also represent our class a shareholders and there is a historical relationship there but the bank is also on a continued thirst to diversifying our funding sources and that s why as gabriel mentioned we announced a new program yankee cd program that we see actually as an alternative low cost funding source that we expect to start to build up robert tate global rational capital analyst okay great thank you n gabriel tolchinsky chief executive officer diversifying our funding so we have here with us eduardo vivone who is our treasurer and head of the portfolio management area so he can provide you with more specific color about our funding sources eduardo vivone executive vice president treasury and capital markets yes i mean in a few words the bank is always committed to diversify that funding base we are active in many different capital markets last year we issued in japan we issued in mexico we also participate in issued a significant loans we ve been pricing to asian and european investors and we also well we have a fairly wide range of multi national institutions from different continents and also depositors from different continents that complement the deposit base of the central bank provides so i mean when we say we re looking for diversification we look for diversification for the complementary funding base through the deposits the central bank provides because that allows us to always to keep on efficient and very competitive funding costs ana graciela de mendez executive vice president chief financial officer thank you eduardo robert tate global rational capital analyst okay thank you n gabriel tolchinsky chief executive officer thank you robert robert tate global rational capital analyst thank you very much yeah do you have time for just one more question n gabriel tolchinsky chief executive officer sure robert tate global rational capital analyst okay thank you just back onto the portfolio the exposure to financial institutions has grown in the last three years from 39 in 2016 to 56 in 2019 i was just wondering what s caused this trend why is there confidence in financial institutions and in which industries do you see the most risk n gabriel tolchinsky chief executive officer thank you robert let me just give you a little bit of a historical perspective bladex started as a bank of banks and the reason for bladex s founding was to be a conduit between the local financial sector and the international capital market for us financial institution is a core market segment that s a client base that we know and understand very well we finance underlying trade transactions that these local banks do in their respective countries so for us this is a very known exposure and an exposure that we understand and like quite a bit we have about we have a significant amount of financial institution clients throughout the region with a deep and long standing relationship with them so from our perspective this is an exposure we like and we understand and it s very much part and parcel of the core bladex s business so it may fluctuate when we see opportunities in the corporate sector down to 39 or 40 it may go up to exposure in the 60s as we see less opportunity in the corporate sector and more opportunity in the financial sector but we re very very comfortable with that exposure and as far as industry risk category we really have done a significant amount of derisking from industry categories that we consider not say it s like the sugar industry in brazil so what you are seeing right now is a portfolio that we believe meets our risk reward parameters and that reflects the risk appetite of every single industry sector obviously right now with sugar prices closer to 0 15 a pound the brazilian sugar industry becomes a bit more viable but we know that these things are highly volatile we have countries like india and thailand that overproduce and the price of sugar can go down to the single digits again so we decided as part of our tightening of our underwriting credit underwriting parameters that we will not take what we call make it commodity exposure which we d never as such simply that we didn t follow the prevailing wisdom of the rule of thumb for lending to the commodity industry which is you lend to the top quartile of efficiency and you think that that s going to protect you from the fluctuations of the underlying commodity prices as we ve been able to see with the price of sugar it can trade significantly below the marginal cost of productions even for the most efficient country producing country in the world which is brazil so what we look for when we lend to the commodity industries are more risk mitigations like vertical integration control over margin control over end markets where our company sell so those are the type of credit underwriting standards that we follow right now and as such are very comfortable with the resulting exposure robert tate global rational capital analyst okay excellent thank you that was very useful gabriel thank you so much gabriel and ana and good luck gabriel in your next venture thank you n gabriel tolchinsky chief executive officer thank you ana graciela de mendez executive vice president chief financial officer thank you robert operator there are no further questions in the queue at this time n gabriel tolchinsky chief executive officer thank you travis and thanks everyone for

on 21 november 2019 colombia experienced a social explosion unprecedented in the history of the country since the middle of the last century on that day the national strike directorate cnp comando nacional de paro called for a protest march against the announcement of regressive economic counter reforms the cnp is made up of the central trade unions central unitaria de trabajadores cut confederación general de trabajadores cgt confederación de trabajadores de colombia ctc and by organizations of students peasants indians pensioners and environmental activists who in recent years have led the resistance by these social sectors to the policies of the colombian state the call for mobilizations was launched by the trade union federations repeating the configuration of previous years routine marches at the end of the year aimed at hampering the negotiations for the minimum wage with the government which by legal obligation must be convened in this period limits on union capacity stem from the low rate of unionization they represent only 4 of the total number of employees this has its origin in part in reactionary employment legislation and also in the criminalization of union resistance in terms of internal structure this fragility in the capacity for social negotiation refers to the isolation resulting from a form of vertical and authoritarian organization this in terms of operation implies agreements at the top between bureaucratized union leaderships left parties and the non partisan social left in addition their platforms of action are limited to the most immediate demands everything suggested a routine demonstration however in the weeks leading up to 21 november the social tensions that have arisen in recent months in neighbourhoods universities the informal sector and the unemployed started to converge towards this deadline international news has contributed to this at the same time the ecuadorian indigenous movement was in the midst of attempting to impose an adjustment plan and in chile a country emblematic of latin american neoliberalism pointed to as an example by technocrats a gigantic social explosion erupted which is still keeping the piã era government at bay thus the contagion effect encouraged the desperate of one of the most unequal countries in the region the announcement of greater sacrifices imposed on an increasingly impoverished population reinforced the movement of indignation provoked by the routine of the daily assassinations of social leaders without anyone being found responsible for them and the corruption practiced by politicians and big crony tycoons in order to share the public wealth all this in the context of a justice system muzzled by the powerful and which obeys the principle of impunity for them for this reason 21 november became a massive mobilization incorporating large sections of the population who took to the streets to protest against the multiple forms of oppression produced by the established order and the cynicism of its political representatives for the first time in decades the streets of the country s major cities saw millions of people parade despite government blackmail despite curfew proclamations despite selective searches before the demonstrations in short despite the classic threats of state terrorism the mobilizations of november 21 had the nocturnal sound support of cacelorazos casserole concerts in the neighbourhoods a complicit noise of declarations and proclamations read in the street thus confirming the enormous social legitimacy of the strike the following days the marches and cacelorazos continued in the streets the districts and in the squares accompanied by the presence of musical and theatrical groups a show of collective joy combat and street art on sunday 8 december some 300 000 people attended the strike concerts in various places in central bogota in which youth orchestras took part in order to show solidarity with the demonstrators when the organizers asked for authorizations to hold the artistic day the town hall offered them the simón bolã var park a place in the city that allows the concentration of thousands of people designed for this type of spectacle but the organizers rejected the offer by taking over the city streets with fixed scenes or others installed on trucks it was a question of prolonging the joy throughout the public space they said they thus confirmed that there is a popular feeling of re appropriation of public space a feeling accompanied by the conviction that the time has come to abandon the fear that has condemned us for decades to be excluded from it a feeling of reappropriation which is expressed in daily conversations by this symbolic formula this country is not the same after 21 november the failure of the government s internal security policy traditionally the main justification of the elites for making social resistance illegal was to present the opponents as collaborators of the guerrillas thus utilising the internal civil war which started around the middle of the 20th century any protests by the people were considered to be linked to the guerrillas which served as a pretext to apply emergency legislation to arrest and prosecute leaders in court negotiations with the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc concluded in august 2016 prevented this argument from being used any longer opening up new perspectives for the popular movement these negotiations did not focus on the transition to democratic reforms which represented the aspirations of democratic parties organizations or figures who have supported the proposal for a political solution to the conflict for several decades the peace agreement was rejected in a referendum on 2 october 2016 by a right wing political alliance led by uribismo named after ã lvaro uribe president from 2002 to 2010 currently a senator which brought together the conservative party the majority of the catholic church and the preachers of the evangelical churches this refusal forced new negotiations between the parties with the presence of uribismo reducing the content of the agreements which passing through the congressional filter were subjected to additional restrictions the final version of these agreements envisaged a system of justice truth and reparation represented by the jurisdicción especial para la paz special justice for peace jep responsible for all judicial and non judicial measures to remedy the heavy legacy of human rights abuses in a society emerging from armed conflict or a dictatorial regime and the truth commission in the case of the jep the treatment of those who financed the war businessmen and large landowners was so benevolent that appearing before this judicial body was voluntary likewise the chain of command test that is the responsibility of the principals of both parties was ignored and in the case of responsibilities for human rights violations committed by members of the armed forces the possibility appeared of an amnesty by means of a legal device called renunciation to state action the economic agenda also did not indicate structural reforms given that the farc was a guerrilla group with a peasant tradition and that they were present in the so called colonato zones the peasants work land which does not belong to them but to which they are bound and for which they have to pay a rent under various forms to the owner and are taxed by the state the land issue was at the heart of this negotiation however the agreement did not include measures effectively calling into question the concentration of land in the hands of large landowners which had been reinforced during the war both by dispossession of peasants and by recycling and money laundering this meant the de facto ownership of seven million hectares was recognized to the big landowners in the colonato areas where the farc was historically present as for the creation of a land fund composed of three million hectares supposed to be distributed to the poor peasants of the country it has so far been unfulfilled another point in the deal was the state s commitment to invest in marginalized and conflict affected regions but the government also ignored this under the pretext of the current budget crisis as if that were not enough 170 demobilized farc members were killed inside the camps in which they are concentrated as provided for in the agreements after having surrendered their weapons despite these limitations in the design and implementation of the agreements themselves uribismo has tried to dilute their content even more the democratic centre party to which the current president iván duque belongs presented to the jep a series of objections to the peace agreement providing for the characterisation as special peace districts of 16 regions particularly affected by the armed conflict with a large number of individual or collective victims the goal to put a stop to the recognition procedure with regard to public order the current government implemented a policy designed according to obsolete internal enemy hypotheses it appointed general nicacio martã nez as head of the army the latter had been recognized by the attorney general s office as responsible for extrajudicial executions in the caribbean region departments of guajira and cesar in 2006 when he was the second commander and chief of staff of the brigade located in this region once appointed martã nez reintroduced into army protocols the guidelines that led to the widespread use of extrajudicial killings which was denounced by the new york times which obtained information from official sources of murders and arrests of so called suspects in this context the former farc guerrilla dimas torres was murdered in the municipality of convención region of catatumbo located in the northeast of the country he was arrested by soldiers while defenceless this assassination had the particularity of being known and having been denounced by the inhabitants of the locality which forced general diego luis villegas commander of the special forces of this region to publicly ask for forgiveness and to repeat this before the peace commission of the congress subsequently in early november 2019 during a parliamentary debate the public learned of the tragic result of the bombing of a so called dissident farc camp perpetrated at the end of august in san vicente del caguán in the department of caquetá which killed 18 people it became clear that the army had been informed before the bombing of the presence of children in the targeted area the brigade command had been officially informed by the representative of the public prosecutor in this municipality for months the military hid what really happened during the bombing the debate led to the resignation of the then minister of defence guillermo botero these tensions within the army and between the parliamentary factions of the government confirm the existence of a fissure within the elites between uribismo which defends the policy of internal security and those who supported former president santos in political negotiations with the farc in havana the latter believe that the army must adapt to the post conflict and gain legitimacy this is why they also demand the implementation of the agreements in their final version and have formed a political bloc called defenders of peace this bloc leads campaigns across the country that has been joined by all non uribist parties including the left and human rights movements they played an active role in the formation of alliances during the last regional elections which took place on 27 october and in which the candidates of the democratic centre were beaten in the chief towns of the provinces beyond these inter elite contradictions the erosion of the government which pursues the warmongering option is obvious popular rejection of the incessant assassination of social and environmental leaders and members of ethnic communities in peripheral regions is finding growing resonance in the cities the case of the children killed in the bombing of caquetá aroused collective indignation and found massive resonance during the mobilization on 21 november on this day of national mobilization the people had to face another form of state terror the esmad escuadron movil antidisturbios anti riot brigades a police force specializing in the suppression of demonstrations created in 2007 under the second uribe government these brigades are responsible for the deaths of several people and numerous arrests and beatings in the midst of a social explosion like the one we are currently experiencing this arbitrary behaviour has sparked an even greater rejection on 23 november in downtown bogota a member of this riot brigade seriously injured an 18 year old high school student dilan cruz shooting him at point blank range dilan died a few days later in a city hospital becoming a symbol of the current resistance on 11 december members of the same squadron using an unmarked car attempted to kidnap two students who were taking part in a rally outside the buildings of the national university a bystander alerted by the cries of the young people started to record the scene got into his vehicle and followed the ghost car until he was forced to stop he forced the occupants to identify themselves many demonstrators were beaten and brought to justice others like in chile lost an eye faced with these despicable acts one of the central and unifying demands of the strike as well as of the democratic movement as a whole is the dissolution of esmad which this time failed to put an end to mobilizations in the streets the economic package the current international economic crisis has highlighted the fragility of the extractive financial model in latin america the sharp fall in international commodity prices during the period 2013 2017 led to trade and budget deficits in the countries of the region leading to an increase in public and private debt under these conditions and as happens in peripheral economies in times of decline foreign direct investment fdi has decreased this downturn is directly linked to the fall in investments in the extractive sectors which are becoming less profitable and in that of portfolio investments because the risk premium increases causing capital flight like a self closing vicious circle the reduction in foreign investment produces a monetary devaluation and an increase in debt which by the standards of the macroeconomy of neoliberal domination leads to adjustment plans whose purpose is to contract demand but the people tired of enduring the constant deterioration of their living conditions rose up to reject them the october mobilizations in ecuador and chile are a demonstration of this those in colombia are part of the same discontent with neoliberal adjustments a few weeks before the strike the duque government presented to congress a proposal for tax reform in line with a policy which since the beginning of the implementation of neoliberalism in the early 1990s has increased tax exemptions on big capital while transferring most of the tax burden to the middle and poor layers this in a country which since 2000 has had to undergo 13 tax reforms of this type one every eighteen months and in a country where the concentration of wealth is one of the highest in the region the government added to this proposal a reform of the employment code which aims to introduce more flexibility to the point of establishing hourly contracts and wages a pension reform favourable to private pension funds on the recommendation of the oecd the creation of a state financial holding company which would centralize all the resources of the public financial sector in order to position itself as a competitor on the financial market the demands of transnational capital to stabilize an economy in crisis after the fall in the price of oil the main export explain the package proposed by the government colombia has a deficit exceeding 4 of gdp which increased considerably from 2013 with the fall in the international price of oil as well as the fall in fdi during the 2013 2017 period there was a sharp drop in international oil prices and as a result oil exports fell by 60 4 and fdi in this sector decreased by 41 3 despite the partial recovery in world oil prices in recent years the deficit continues to grow as does the reduction in fdi which has precipitated short term capital flight statistically represented in the decline in portfolio investments in this recessive scenario the devaluation of the currency has reached one of the highest levels of the international average with the exchange rate against the us dollar now at 3 500 pesos as against 1 800 in 2014 bringing with it the growth of foreign debt particularly serious in the case of public debt which is already reaching 51 of gdp with the aggravating circumstance that the country is subject to legislation imposed by the imf according to which the payment of interest is a priority in the establishment and execution of annual budgets according to neoliberal ideology economic adjustment would be inevitable therefore while protesters on the streets are calling for a fairer society the president and the parliamentary majority continue to introduce draft bills into congress that are demanded by transnational capital which highlights the divide between people and institutions as well as the narrowness of a representative democracy based on political clienteles business lobbies and secret negotiations like neoliberalism in colombia and south america in general we are witnessing not only the crisis of neoliberalism as an economic model based on dispossession but also the crisis of its forms of political representation the challenges posed by the new political situation since 21 november the country has seen the emergence of a pluralist movement involving workers residents of neighbourhoods the middle classes crushed by taxes and banking usury in the cities in this social convergence it is necessary to underline the role of the youth movements which asserted themselves in the confrontation to demand rights and to make explicit their distancing from a war which does not concern them anymore these expressions of youth have a history in the university resistance movements of a few years ago in 2011 the national students council mesa nacional estudiantil succeeded thanks to a very broad mobilization in defeating a university reform project promoted by the government of juan manuel santos and last year another movement of the same kind managed to obtain additional budgetary resources compared to those planned by the current government but today the range of youth engagement is much broader it includes the presence of young people who do not have access to university or those who having obtained a degree cannot find a job it also includes students from private universities forced to go into debt the same applies to those who in technical and vocational high schools have received offers of precarious employment contracts before the end of their studies as well as for young people who because of their poverty cannot complete secondary studies and do not have access to privatized health services and cannot aspire to a minimum of comfort in their life as has happened in other parts of the world with similar social movements this youth movement spontaneously takes to the streets to protest using social networks with the aim of denouncing the consequences of neoliberalism but without knowing its causes these young people reject the institutions and parties of the establishment but neither do they feel represented by the left parties or by traditional popular organizations this youth movement does not accept vertical decisions or authoritarian directions it seeks to democratize decisions which gives a lot of strength to its actions at the same time the movement expresses a broad ideological pluralism amidst the depoliticization to which neoliberalism has condemned them hence also their weakness within this ideological plurality it is necessary to underline two questions which highlight the crisis of civilization to which contemporary capitalism has condemned us that of the destruction of nature and that of the preservation of patriarchal society strongly contested by young female university students and employees the plural social movement which supported the demonstrations of 21 november could not establish a balance of forces allowing it to envisage institutional ruptures such as the resignation of the president or the convening of a constituent assembly as in chile however during its short existence it has already achieved the following objectives overcoming state terror which for decades has considered the actions of popular organizations to be illegal by enforcing the state of emergency and equating protesters with appendages of guerrilla warfare refocusing social resistance in the cities both by the way it started and by the themes it offers in its platform of demands strengthening a human rights movement that denounces the recurrent assassinations of social leaders and demands a democratic policy guaranteeing the definitive end of the armed conflict putting social inequality at the centre of the national political debate as an expression of the crisis that neoliberalism is going through on the international scale the national strike directorate which called the demonstration on 21 november maintains dialogue with the government but the sectors of the population which act spontaneously or which belong to an enormous diversity of social organizations do not submit to this organization however they are dispersed and do not have the capacity to become a different political option for the moment coordination is taking place in neighbourhood assemblies a territorial form of direct democracy that responds to the dispossession caused by neoliberal town planning described as urban extractivism these neighbourhood assemblies can become superior expressions of democracy if they manage to centralize and articulate with nationwide movements that resist government policies this will obviously depend on the continuation of the strike in the first weeks of 2020 which seems possible under the current circumstances and on the challenges that confrontation with the government poses to the movement the battle for a political alternative will continue but in a new context there is an urgent need for unitary coordination between those of us who are convinced of the need to preserve an anti capitalist strategy 15 december 2019
trump and federal reserve are pumping up the stock market non stop speculative sentiment is now out of control at some point this market will collapse the mississippi bubble of 1718 1720 the mississippi bubble was an economic bubble in france in the early 1700s that developed in parallel with britain s disastrous south sea bubble the mastermind behind the mississippi bubble was john law a scottish financier gambler and playboy who ascended into the upper echelons of french public finance through his friendship with the duke of orléans law became the french government s primary financial advisor and used this power to establish the banque générale a bank with the authority to issue paper money as well as the mississippi company later called the compagnie des indes which was granted a monopoly on the development of france s vast mississippi territory in north america when investors started salivating over the supposedly immense bounty of resources in the mississippi territory including gold and silver they bid compagnie des indes shares up to astronomical heights unfortunately the company s prospects turned out to be little more than empty promises and the shares crashed back down to earth taking down france s stock market and public finances with it events leading up to the mississippi bubble the mississippi bubble saga began in 1715 when the french government was teetering on the verge of insolvency under the burden of debts incurred during the war of spanish succession in time the government defaulted on a portion of its debt lowered its interest payments and raised taxes to very high levels all of which served to depress the french economy and caused the value of its gold and silver backed currency to fluctuate wildly the french government then led by a group of regents because king louis xv was only five years old desperately scrambled to find a solution to the nation s fiscal and economic woes the duke of orléans the leader of the group of regents soon decided to seek the council of his friend john law who was an early theorist of monetary economics john law hailed from fife scotland where he was born into an affluent family of bankers and goldsmiths law became his father s apprentice at age fourteen and studied the banking business until his father s death three years later soon after law travelled to london in pursuit of adventure and earned a living as a gambler thanks to his keen mathematical abilities in london the twenty three year old law became involved in a duel over a lady friend in which he swiftly killed his opponent and was charged with murder and sentenced to death john law spent a brief time in prison before he escaped to mainland europe where he studied high finance in cities such as amsterdam venice and genoa in 1705 law published an academic paper in which he argued against the use of precious metal backed currency in favor of paper or fiat currency claiming that the use of fiat currency would stimulate commerce smant 2001 due to these distinct views law is often considered to be an early keynesian style economist when the desperate duke of orléans came looking to john law for help law viewed it as an opportunity to put his monetary theory into action in 1716 law received the french government s permission to establish a national bank the banque générale which took in deposits of gold and silver and issued paper bank notes in return the bank notes issued by banque générale were not legal tender but were accepted as such by the french public because they were redeemable in official french currency banque générale built up its bank reserves through the issuance of stock and from profits earned through the management of the french government s finances in 1717 john law used his growing rapport within french society to acquire a struggling trading company the mississippi company which he renamed to the compagnie d occident the company of the west and was granted a monopoly on trade with and development of france s north american colonies along the mississippi river these territories see chart above spanned a wide swath of area from present day louisiana up to canada and were considered to be valuable for their abundance of resources such as beaver skins and precious metals which later proved to be untrue as law s influence continued to grow the compagnie d occident s name was changed to compagnie des indes company of the indies and according to david smant expanded to monopolize all french trade outside europe in july 1719 the compagnie purchased the right to mint new coinage in august 1719 the compagnie bought the right to collect all french indirect taxes and in october 1719 the compagnie took over the collection of direct taxes finally a plan was launched to restructure most of the national debt whereby the remainder of existing government debt would be exchanged for compagnie shares by this time john law had amassed an incredible amount of power as his companies now controlled both france s foreign trade and its finances the bubble phase in january 1719 the compagnie des indes offered shares to the public for 500 livres per share livres were france s currency at that time which were bought and paid for with banque générale bank notes or with government debt compagnie shares soared to an incredible 10 000 livres per share by december 1719 as investors began to lust over the company s potential value of trade with the supposedly gold and silver rich french colonies with share prices at such high levels john law had gone from a broke gambler to one of the wealthiest most powerful men in europe people of all social classes invested in compagnie des indes shares causing many paupers to become very rich in a short span of time incidentally the french word millionaire originated as a result of the many people that were made wealthy as compagnie shares soared moen 2001 explosive demand for compagnie des indes shares caused the total amount of paper money bank notes in circulation to increase 186 in one year due to the fact that banque générale issued as much bank notes as the public demanded this expansion of the money supply resulted in a powerful inflationary episode in which the price of goods doubled between july 1719 and december 1720 a good portion of compagnie des indes share price gains were due to this inflation as well smant 2001 paris experienced a bubble economy type boom as real estate prices and rents soared twenty fold and wealthy speculators clamored to buy luxury goods sebastian 2011 according to charles mackay new houses were built in every direction and an illusory prosperity shone over the land and so dazzled the eyes of the whole nation that none could see the dark cloud on the horizon announcing the storm that was too rapidly approaching soon banque générale had issued vast quantities of bank notes even though they did not have an equivalent amount of gold and silver based legal tender for everyone who eventually wished to redeem their notes it is likely that john law had expected to fulfill banque générale s precious metals deficit with gold and silver imported from north america by the compagnie des indes the crash in january 1720 compagnie des indes shares began to fall as some investors decided to take their profits in the form of gold coins john law tried to curb the sell off by limiting payments in gold of more than 100 livres moen 2001 a scandal ensued in may 1720 when john law decided that compagnie shares were overvalued causing him to start devaluing shares in addition banque générale notes were devalued by 50 presumably due to the bank s precious metals deficit which was unable to be fulfilled by compagnie des indes operations in north america because the mississippi valley region lacks meaningful deposits of precious metals the discovery of which resulted in major investor disappointment law s devaluation of shares and bank notes caused an intense public uproar which resulted in a compromise in which the bank notes value was restored but payment in precious metals was stopped despite the compromise the french public was outraged against the compagnie and its near worthless paper bank notes the combination of aggressive investor selling and law s devaluations caused compagnie des indes shares to collapse from 10 000 livres to 1 000 livres by december 1720 moen 2001 compagnie investors were financially ruined and many former millionaires became paupers by the end of 1720 john law was viewed as a scam artist and his rivals were given control over two thirds of his companies shares share prices further deflated to 500 livres in 1721 moen 2001 soon after john law escaped france disguised as a woman for his own safety and spent the rest of his life as an impoverished gambler in various parts of europe the collapse of banque générale and the compagnie des indes which coincided with the popping of britain s south sea bubble plunged france and other european countries into a severe economic depression and laid the groundwork for the french revolution that occurred later on in the century we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us although traditionally considered a bubble the mississippi bubble wasn t actually a bubble in a precise technical sense a bubble is

market is incredibly out of control it is a mind numbing exercise for investors who see the cognitive dissonance cio at guggenheim partners this market has been an astounding experience for people who ve traded through the prior stock market bubbles and the last three crashes who ve seen a national and several regional housing bubbles form and implode who ve seen the subprime auto loan asset backed securities bubble blow up in the mid 1990s and again during the financial crisis and now it s starting to head the same direction again but no one can remember ever having seen markets like these that have formed the everything bubble it s a phenomenon where nearly all asset prices are inflated it s not a secret there are signs all over the place yesterday the government sold 30 year bonds at a yield of 2 06 below the rate of inflation as measured by cpi 2 5 the fed is fixated on driving inflation higher but to beat the current cpi with a little bit of a margin that might evaporate over the next few months you have to take fairly big risks and go to the low end of investment grade corporate bonds to bbb rated bonds which are just above junk bonds here is my plain english cheat sheet for the corporate credit rating scales and their average yield is 2 96 earnings growth has been lousy for the companies that even have earnings and one issue after another comes along and markets just

investors buoyed by apparent deceleration it s been an eventful start to the year and not exactly in the way than anyone would have anticipated even two months ago once again once the initial panic has passed investors have taken the spread of covid 19 in their stride a little too much you could argue the initial panic was that it could be as bad as sars and yet it s been worse and it turns out investors aren t that worried after all the stock market can be a very strange place at times next week is typically among the quieter of the month which means news around the coronavirus will continue to dominate pmis later in the week will also be of interest as will minutes from the fed ecb and rba country uk this should have been a pretty normal week in the uk compared to what we ve become accustomed to but it didn t quite go according to plan the cabinet reshuffle was largely as boring as is to be expected until chancellor sajid javid resigned in a different time a different country perhaps that may be seen as bad news but investors in the uk were buoyed while there appears to be a number of reasons behind the resignation including demands by boris johnson that no self respecting minister would accept investors are considering what it means for the budget it s clear that at the very least the government will look to push the boundaries of their fiscal rules but perhaps this indicates something more so the market reaction suggests anyway us will wall street start pricing in the risk of a democratic president right now the answer seems to be no the democrats are in the very early stages of the primary season and right now bernie sanders and pete buttigieg are gaining momentum the focus shifts to the february 22nd nevada caucuses and the february 29th south carolina primary with super tuesday on march 3rd being the main event financial markets may start to get nervous if democrats start feeling the bern but if biden buttigieg or bloomberg get the nomination we may see optimism for a much higher stock market remain roughly in place china coronavirus and its global spread is still the hot topic thursday s review of the data methodology caused a mild downturn in risk appetite as case numbers spiked dramatically central bankers appear to be viewing the virus effect as a mere speed bump for local economies with the rbnz basing its current monetary policy outlook on the assumption it would last six weeks while the fed is still on track to remain on hold throughout this year after the so called good new up to wednesday was decimated by thursday s revision investors will require either a slowdown in the increase in the number of confirmed cases or a total decline to continue the relentless pursuit of returns via equities it has been pointed out by a colleague that it could be a win win outlook for equities going forward if the virus accelerates central banks will ease policy thus supporting equities while if the virus vanishes the global economy can get back on track which would again be supportive of equities a lack of good news on the spread and death toll from the wuhan virus this week and next would take the edge off risk appetite capping the equity rally and forcing flows into the usual safe havens of gold the yen swiss franc the us dollar and us treasuries it would again be negative for oil and industrial metals hong kong nothing to report from hong kong this week still only 50 virus cases reported to thursday but the second country in the league table behind china hong kong data is still dismal and tuesday s release of january s unemployment rate has probably got more upside potential than down the hong kong dollar is holding up well despite the coronavirus effect and a firmer us dollar usd hkd is trading close to the lower limit of its trading band and it s possible that any escalation in the coronavirus outbreak could push usd hkd back to the upper half of the trading band and pressure the hongkong33 index india india economic data continues to disappoint with industrial output dropping 0 3 in december india still has only three coronavirus cases should the rbi be forced into further easing it could pressure the rupee australia tuesday s release of rba minutes is unlikely to be a headline grabber while thursday s employment report for january will be the main event headline numbers have been bullish of late but most jobs added are only in the part time category another strong number with a full time bias and markets will consider a hawkish shift from the rba mean reversion to a lower jobs number would hurt the aussie new zealand a hawkish feel to the rbnz s unchanged rate announcement sent the kiwi soaring this week an extended virus period chinese are currently barred from entering nz would hurt the tourism sector and pressure the kiwi japan the week kicks off with q4 gdp data which is seen weaker overall according to the latest surveys the cruise ship quarantined off japan is getting more headlines than the economy boj or government a bigger than expected drop in gdp would hurt equities but could benefit the yen on safe haven flows singapore singapore s close links with china have brought the city state to the forefront of coronavirus news with 50 reported cases third behind hong kong the mas has already said there is room within the neer trading band to ease policy and we may see an inter meeting adjustment given the next policy meeting is not scheduled until april the singapore dollar weakened to the lowest level since september versus the us dollar this week policy easing amid rising virus cases would pressure the sgd further market usd the us economy will likely remain in a good place but we could start to see markets become nervous on a few fronts on friday february 21st the flash manufacturing pmi releases will show how much of a slowdown is hitting the us economy in february incremental updates with the us china trade war seemed destined for a sudden turn for the worse but so far all signs are pointing that may not be the case the third concern to the outlook is fed tightening the fed has started announcing cuts to the size of the overnight repo operations and as the balance sheet growth grinds to a halt sentiment for risky assets may take a blow oil the oil recovery is gathering momentum as the week draws to a close naturally any bounce was likely to be decent given the scale of the declines that preceded it but we re now on the fourth day of gains as optimism grows among traders that the fight against covid 19 has turned a corner despite the setback of the midweek spike the next test for brent comes around 58 with wti facing a similar test in the 53 50 54 50 region gold undeterred by its other failures already this year gold is creeping higher and approaching the heavily guarded 1 600 barrier the events in the middle east last month saw gold briefly break through the defence but this was short lived and it hasn t really come close since back at 1 580 now with the next test being where it fell at the last attempt earlier this month around 1 590 if it can get through here then perhaps the bullish case will grow bitcoin bitcoin has found its way above 10 000 and is holding above at the moment but that may not last it s been on an impressive run this year up around 45 already but as ever with this instrument it has the feel of buy now work out why later the list of reasons for the rally so far is endless from safe haven to halving and everything in between the only word that hasn t been used is hype and that s probably the most accurate explanation which is fine should it break above 11 000 interest may pick up 10 000 attracts a lot of attention for obvious reasons but 9 000 and 11 000 have arguably been more significant

i will now turn the call over to scott peters chairman and ceo of healthcare trust of america scott scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president good morning and thank you for joining us today for healthcare trust of america s fourth quarter and full year 2019earnings conference call joining me on the call today are robert milligan our chief financial officer amanda houghton our executive vice president of asset management and caroline chiodo our senior vice president of acquisitions and development as we begin 2020 hta has positioned itself to be the sector leader in the ownership leasing and operation of medical office buildings we have a key market focused portfolio that is irreplaceable with almost 25 million square feet our portfolio is comprised of a fully integrated full service operating platform and hta has positioned itself with a fortress investment grade balance sheet that positions us to uniquely pursue investments and deliver earnings growth and shareholder returns over the next three to five years as healthcare enters the new decade it continues to move toward an integrated outpatient experience that is cost effective and convenient for patients this delivery will take place in three settings one on campus where hta is the largest owner of mobs in the country two off campus in the community locations where all leading healthcare providers are focusing and growing their presence and three in academic university locations where academic and healthcare combinations are critical over the last 13 years we have built a portfolio of mobs that reflects these trends where they focus on finding core critical real estate in great markets that will deliver high levels of tenant retention and rental growth opportunities over future years our experience has demonstrated that properties with the strongest performance occur both on and off campus with the primary drivers more related to market quality patient demand building characteristics and increasingly critical tenant synergies strategically hta has targeted key fast growing markets that we believe will outperform other markets throughout the country our targeted market approach allows hta to maximize returns by creating size and scale in markets we now have 17 markets with over 500 000 square feet and 10 markets with approximately 1 million square feet or more this scale allows us to effectively create a deeper and more strategic local operating platform with relationships and operating capabilities that are unique this approach is a key pillar for our growth strategy going forward in 2019 we saw the positive attributes of our platform and portfolio start to work in ways that generates both internal and external growth opportunities led by one same store growth of 2 7 driven by rental revenue growth of 2 3 and margin expansion from increased utilization of our property management platform and certain expense savings this includes fourth quarter same store growth of 2 5 two leasing where we leased almost 15 of our portfolio or more than 3 6 million square feet with full year releasing spreads of 3 5 and same store tenant retention of 84 total acquisitions of 558 million and a blended cap rate of 6 1 after taking into account expected synergies from our asset management platform this includes over 330 million closed in the fourth quarter these are well located mobs located primarily in our existing markets where we are adding scale and will utilize our operating platform to drive additional value for shareholders although the acquisition markets remain very competitive for larger deals we are focusing on one off opportunities that fit in our portfolio but where we have been able to acquire at yields that allow for immediate accretion finally four development we have announced 110 million of development and redevelopments in 2019 including two on campus developments with hca and dignity now called commonspirit we have strong relationships with both of these entities over the years and continue to work with them for future developments we now have four developments in process with total investments of over 150 million that will start to be delivered in 2020 we ve also announced the redevelopment of two mobs on our st joseph health mission viejo campus in orange county california that will include up to 20 million of capital investment our balance sheet has never been stronger with leverage of 29 of total capitalization and 5 7 times debt to ebitda this leverage goes down to 5 times and 25 of total capitalization when factoring in the approximately 300 million in equity available to us to take down on a forward basis over the next six months we purposely built our capital availability in the fourth quarter of 2019 given the deal flow we are seeing and expect to deploy this capital over the next two quarters earnings growth as a result of our performance and acquisition activity we were able to grow our normalized funds from operations to 1 64 per share and 0 42 in the fourth quarter note that in 2019 we had more than 0 02 per share in costs that were capitalized that hta must now expense these costs were associated with our in house leasing teams as we look ahead of 2020 hta is focused on driving performance in a way that hits the bottom line from an asset management perspective we are focused on using our platform to drive occupancy growth to a 100 by 100 to 200 basis points while continuing to maintain releasing spreads that we achieved in 2019 from an investor perspective our focus continues to be on finding and closing on acquisitions and development opportunities that meet our discipline criteria in our key markets taking advantage over the increase in opportunities that we are seeing now to both our acquisition and development platforms that have been in place now for 5 to 10 years from a balance sheet perspective we are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet with leverage between 5 5 times and 6 0 times investing the equity we have raised on a forward basis from an accretive perspective from a guidance point of view for 2020 we are expecting normalized ffo per share to reach between 1 69 and 1 73 per share with growth of over 4 as the midpoint of the range we expect our same store growth to range between 2 to 3 for the year with a focus on growing occupancy to achieve the top side of the range we will fully deploy our existing equity capital with acquisitions projected between 500 million and 600 million for the year with expected yields after synergies of 5 5 to 6 25 finally we will start to deliver on the developments which with our first project in cary north carolina being delivered at the beginning of the third quarter robert will give some additional color in his comments finally i wanted to point out the healthcare trust of america s first sustainability report that was published in january since we started our operating platform in 2010 we have focused on the efficiency of our buildings and our footprint in the communities in which we invest i will now turn the call over to amanda amanda houghton executive vice president asset management thanks scott in 2019 our team remained focused on delivering high quality operating and leasing results in our existing portfolio while integrating new properties onto our platform and capturing the efficiencies and synergies anticipated as part of these acquisitions over the last decade our in house asset management team has shown repeatedly our ability to add between 25 and 35 basis points of incremental yield as we bring new properties into our platform the most visible example of this being the duke portfolio which we acquired in 2017 and over a 12 month period we generated savings between 7 million and 8 million largely as a result of replacing third party management and engineering staff with our own teams and capturing the markups and profits previously passed to third party managers this transition from third party management to our in house platform is seamless from a tenant perspective as they see no net financial impact that allows our shareholders to benefit from profits previously passed on to third parties with over 200 property management engineering and leasing staff across over 20 offices hta remains uniquely suited in the reit space to benefit from the synergies and savings a full service operating platform provides we believe as a company we are still in the very early stages of recognizing the full benefit of our platform as we grow in market we are able to hire more specialized and skilled staff to do additional services previously done by third parties by way of example at 500 000 square feet in the market and housing mechanical electrical and plumbing services begins to make sense from a cost standpoint with a focus on growing our key markets and continue training our in house staff we expect over the next three to four years investors will continue to see margin expansion and value creation from our platform turning now to the fourth quarter our same store growth this quarter came in at 2 5 driven by a 1 4 base revenue growth and 100 basis points of rental margin expansion on a year to date basis same store noi growth increased 2 7 driven by full year revenue growth of 2 3 during the quarter we signed approximately 1 million square feet of leases this included 180 000 square feet of new leases and almost 830 000 square feet of renewal our total tenant retention for same store portfolio was 77 while releasing spreads on renewals remained strong at 3 4 annual escalators for leases signed in the period were 2 9 continuing our trend of increasing escalators toward 3 as we continue to roll our leases tis remained consistent at 1 96 per square foot per year of term on renewals and 4 11 per square foot per year of term on new for the year we have now leased 3 6 million square feet or almost 15 of our total portfolio gla same store retention for the year is 83 while our releasing spreads and renewals are strong 3 5 further contractual increases on both new and renewal leases signed during the year averaged 2 6 strengthening our recurring revenue stream and quality growth our investors have come to expect new trends to note on our renewals we have seen a notable increase level of early renewals with over 1 million square feet of leasing for the year related to leases that expire in 2020 and beyond this is driven by tenants seeking to lock in their space for the long term as they consolidate practices and invest in their infrastructure we have also seen an increased interest in longer term renewals as evidenced by the average renewal term in 2019 of 7 2 years nearly 25 higher than our 2018 renewal term average of 5 8 years and these are both positive trends that we believe will continue into 2020 as tenants are trying to lock in key real estate for their healthcare delivery strategies on the expense front we continue to show the benefit of our economies of scale and specialty service offering for the quarter we were able to keep expenses relatively flat over the fourth quarter of 2018 and down over 2 sequentially despite an overall increase in property taxes during 2019 primarily in texas our teams have largely been able to offset this impact through efficiencies in our platform and continued focus on utility savings in the fourth quarter we did begin to see some of the favorable outcomes of our property tax appeals and believe we will continue to have success with our appeal efforts in the coming quarters 2019 performance is a great reflection of the resiliency of our portfolio and ability to continue to deliver quality noi growth through changing external and internal environment we came into 2019 with a slightly higher amount of expirations than in years past 12 8 of our portfolio versus our historical 10 average we also had several asset transitions the largest of which included our mission viejo medical office buildings four mobs that we owned fee simple on a st joseph health mission viejo campus in orange county california these buildings were constructed in 1972 and are coming off a 20 year hospital master lease we re moving forward with redevelopment on two buildings that will modernize the facilities and allow us to command rent significantly above their current rent and more in line with this market while these factors contributed to an overall decrease in year over year same store occupancy and lease percentage much of which was manifested in the third quarter our same store leased rates remained steady in the fourth quarter and occupancy grew 10 basis points to 90 9 over q3 as we look to 2020 we have approximately 9 of our portfolio expiring with another 6 in month to month status given current discussions with tenants we expect tenant retention to be around 80 with renewal spreads in the 2 to 4 range our new leasing efforts continue to be strong with over 40 of our pipeline comprised of large deals greater than 10 000 square feet while these deals do generally take longer to sign and ultimately build out we expect to see the benefits of these deals through meaningful increase lease and occupancy level toward the second half of 2020 with an overall outlook of moving occupancy between 100 and 200 basis points within the next 12 to 24 months i will now turn the call over to robert robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary thanks amanda 2019 ended up being a very active year for us in the investment and capital market front which when combined with our continued same store growth allowed us to demonstrate an accelerating level of earnings growth in the fourth quarter we generated same store growth of 2 5 with full year same store growth coming in at 2 7 this continues to be generated by both steady consistent revenue growth and margin expansion through increased performance and utilization of our operating platform from an infrastructure perspective we remain very efficient with g a for the quarter coming in at 10 2 million with the year over year increase driven primarily by the expensing of internal leasing cost on which we have capitalized 1 2 million in the year ago period for the year we came in at 41 3 million which remains extremely efficient relative to our peers as a result we generated normalized ffo per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 0 42 up 5 from prior year as we continue to generate same store growth and closing our acquisitions redeploying the capital raised in last year s greenville sale into better assets and markets funds available for distribution increased 72 3 million in the quarterm which includes 17 6 million of recurring capital expenditures or approximately 14 of noi our run rate for the year however remains around 12 5 of noi our recurring capex is slightly higher than normal given the relatively high amount of total leasing we ve entered into in 2019 close to 15 of our portfolio we re almost 25 more than we completed in 2018 we expect some of this will continue into 2020 given the lag in tenant improvement utilization from an investment perspective we re seeing an increased number of opportunities that meet our disciplined underwriting criteria and have an improved cost of capital that allows us to close and lock in attractive day one accretion for shareholders for 2019 we were able to find and close on over 550 million of investments at yields of over 6 1 including day one synergies from our operating platform in the fourth quarter we closed on 330 million in investments including a mix of sales from developers private owners and healthcare providers our investment criteria remain straightforward identifying assets that are positioned to grow over the next 5 to 10 years by focusing on core critical real estate that ll be in high demand as healthcare delivery continues to evolve mix of on and off campus buildings as well as those on academic medical center locations they re located in key markets that are growing faster than u s average where we can increase our scale and relevancy and assets where we can utilize our platform to drive additional value and yield to our investments and finally we re focused on achieving accretive opportunities to drive day one returns as well as long term growth our 2019 investments met all of these criteria s they were all located in our key markets in core critical locations with the opportunity to drive additional value over time through an increase in occupancy and the opportunity to push rents the properties were almost 60 on or adjacent to campus while still acquired entirely on fee simple basis which we think is critical to long term performance from a portfolio construction perspective we continue to grow our scale in key markets increasing that number of markets with more than 500 000 square feet to over 17 as we increase our geographic concentration we gain the brand relevancy with health systems academic universities and large physician groups and improve operational efficiencies as we leverage the platform our balance sheet philosophy has remained lowly levered and raise capital the time we make acquisitions to lock in the earnings accretion and ensure we are always in a position to pursue transactions opportunistically this is especially true in volatile markets where we have the ability to pursue growth accretively and drive quickly we financed our acquisitions in 2019 by raising approximately 637 million of equity including 585 million in the fourth quarter at average prices around 29 70 or an implied low 5 cap rate that is at least 65 basis lower than our acquisition price we raised the capital through our atm allowing for very efficient transactions and took slightly more than 300 million on a forward basis which will serve as dry powder for acquisitions as we head in 2020 i will note that we have a number of ways in which we can raise equity and are always evaluating the opportunities in any given market in the fourth quarter we chose to use a forward given the potential for market volatility in election year and the pipeline of opportunities that were seen this gives us the strength of a 5 times leverage balance sheet without the immediate earnings dilution that comes from raising the equity on a traditional basis something we believe will be valued by shareholders as a result our balance sheet continues to be in terrific shape to finance growth in 2020 we ended the year at 5 7 times debt to ebitda with 1 2 billion of liquidity including the equity forwards and very limited near term maturities in the third quarter we took the opportunity to extend these maturities at very attractive rates when you factor in the forward equity into our liquidity and our balance sheet standing at 5 0 times debt to ebitda we have the capacity by over 700 million in acquisitions while remaining within our targeted leverage range of 5 5 to 6 times turning to 2020 we have provided our initial earnings guidance that is in the range of 1 69 to 1 73 of normalized ffo per share this guidance assumes same store growth of 2 to 3 with the high end of the range based on achieving increasing levels of occupancy by the end of the year g a of 44 million to 46 million as we grow our platform capabilities to increase our occupancy acquisition of 500 million to 600 million at a blended cap rate of 5 5 to 6 25 including synergies the utilization of our 300 million of equity forward toward the end of the second quarter resulting in average shares of approximately 226 million with the remainder of our capital financed on our revolver and a 2 5 million to 3 million headwind as a result of our redevelopment of properties at mission viejo with the expectations that they will achieve positive cash flow toward the end of 2020 our maintenance capex for the year will be 13 to 14 of noi as a relatively higher levels of leasing in 2019 heads into 2020 we could also see nonrecurring capital increase slightly as we look to increase our occupancy levels by 100 to 200 basis points during the year which will position us for solid growth into 2021 in total we think 2020 will be the year we return to our normal levels of growth you should expect from hta and the mob sector i will now turn it back over to scott scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president thank you robert thank you amanda we will now open up for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from tayo okusanya with mizuho please go ahead omotayo okusanya mizuho analyst hi yes good afternoon solid quarter great guide question around same store guidance for 2020 i just kind of giving your goal of increasing occupancy of 100 basis points just a little bit surprised that the same store noi guidance has been higher robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary well i think as we look at how we should perform and how the mob sector should certainly perform we think 2 to 3 is a pretty consistent range that we re going out with our view is from an occupancy perspective we saw a slight decline in the third quarter from an occupancy perspective that s carried into the fourth we ll see that carry into the first certainly the first quarter of next year which will provide a little bit occupancy headwind to start which we anticipate will potentially lead to occupancy tailwinds by the time we get to the end of the year so there s a little bit of a balance from an occupancy perspective as to how it relates to same store omotayo okusanya mizuho analyst okay that s helpful and then i appreciate the commentary you made about your acquisition outlook and kind of what you re looking at relative to some other big transactions out there but again could you just generally talk about the overall kind of acquisition market where cap rates are whether there s a big difference between trying to buy on campuses versus off campus and things of that sort scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president sure this is scott i think that you know we have seen over the last certainly 24 months and maybe even a little longer than that that the quality of what we call community core or off campus buildings if they have the right synergies the right location and the right size and i don t mean size necessarily by a single building but by a group of buildings and the tenant occupancy is critical but we ve seen that cap rate compression come down and i think it continues to in certain cases get even closer to what traditionally has been on campus i think you re seeing if you look closely and if you know you never know what the future brings but i think we feel here we started community core almost 10 years ago we started academic university acquisition six seven years ago and if you look at the future of healthcare you re seeing on campus become far more selective i think when you buy something on campus you used to be able to just buy it and assume that it s going to perform or the demand was going to be there and the healthcare system was going to be fully cooperative i think the healthcare systems are now are focused out in communities they re focused into locations where they can generate the greatest patient mix and from an ownership perspective we ve seen many situations and i think our peers are seeing situations where traditionally what used to be called an off campus community core location from an noi perspective or a return perspective compares favorably if not more favorably to what may have been a traditional on campus so i think you re going to continue to see the evolution and migration of continued services from on campus to community core and i go back to the fact that if you pick your key cities and those key cities or those key communities are growing and the infrastructure of those cities are continuing to expand the only logical place for many of these healthcare systems to reach out to is back into the community core locations so they re doing that and we re very happy with our cities that we ve got some depth and breadth in and we can continue to see acquisition opportunities both on campus and in the community core setting omotayo okusanya mizuho analyst but what are those cap rate kind of around kind of what are those assets kind of trading for relative to maybe some other stuff you bought in the fourth quarter scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president i think the cap rate haven t moved i frankly haven t seen i thought we got extremely aggressive with cap rates maybe 12 months ago 16 months ago on some larger portfolio transactions and that got a lot of publicity and so therefore the perception was that my individual asset or my one or two assets can take that type of pricing that s backed off a little bit we re finding as robert talked about in this comments we re finding very good strong opportunities in the 5 5 to 6 25 and we like that that seems to fit right where we like to be and we re very optimistic about 2020 we ve got the balance sheet that allows us to be disciplined and execute so we like where we are and i frankly like the environment that we see right now omotayo okusanya mizuho analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from daniel bernstein with capital one please go ahead daniel bernstein capital one analyst hi i guess a follow up question to tayo on the occupancy and same store noi comp for 2020 so is the right way to think about it may be noi growth year over year will be roughly like 2 in the first half and then 3 3 5 in the second half of the year and that flows through into 2021 is that the right way you to think about the noi growth robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary well i think we certainly target our same store growth in each of the quarters above the 2 range but i think as we look at how the occupancy in the comparative periods lines out our view would certainly be the first quarter first half has a little bit more of the revenue year over year headwinds just given that occupancy with the potential for that to shift as you get into the back half of the year daniel bernstein capital one analyst okay and it should benefit 21 year over year growth you should see some acceleration in 2021 growth over 2020 robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary yes we re seeing when we look at this and i think we ve tried to be pretty forthright with investors is we ve positioned ourselves in 2020 for both the same store where we like to see it 2 to 3 we think we have occupancy and we re focused on occupancy and we ve focused on our leasing platform we ve got some redevelopment that s starting to take traction and as amanda pointed out in her comments we ve seen traction frankly with some large groups or large space and it s catch 2022 if we had smaller spaces adding up to the larger spaces i think they d be done by now but the larger spaces are just by the fact that who does them they have more processes they want to make sure that that this is the right location we re seeing good activity so we re very excited about the fact that we can see some occupancy gains we ve repositioned our portfolio and the development that we re doing i think is going to pay dividends from a pricing perspective and where we are with those assets daniel bernstein capital one analyst okay and then in terms of dispositions you only guided to 50 million i don t know if that s lower or not but it seems with cap rates fairly low and maybe slightly compressing and certainly technology of mobs the size of the mobs demands at the hospitals are changing as well are there is there a possibility that 50 million disposition number could be higher as you review the portfolio robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary i think that we re sort of fortunate i was talking to someone the other day and we were talking about healthcare trust of america we re 14 years old so we re not 30 40 years old we ve gone through a process over the last 10 years and we ve been public now about seven there is a huge focus on us as far as the quality of product when we went public and frankly as we got bigger and bigger we ve gone through a very diligent process with our investment committee our investment committee sees every acquisition that we buy whether it s for a 1 or whether it s for 2 billion so we ve been very selective in our cities we ve been selective in our assets and when you go through and you say every company should dispose of things that don t fit their portfolio but if you look at what we put together with the duke acquisition with the acquisitions that we ve done since then they re in our markets they re purposeful they re disciplined there s not something that we say okay we bought 20 assets and we don t like 5 of them so therefore we don t we re going to dispose of those 5 we ve been very diligent we ve been very disciplined and so i think the 50 million on average is probably the right number but we ve always said and i continue to say that everything is for sale at the right price and we were fortunate to have an opportunity to do greenville at the time that we thought it was good for both parties and so if somebody came about and said wow you just bought it again and should we think about that we would but we don t have what i would consider to be a lot of assets that we don t like what we do like is the opportunity for our platform to lease them up and to bring value to them if they re not 90 to 95 occupied daniel bernstein capital one analyst okay that s good i ll yield the floor thank you operator our next question comes from nick joseph with citi please go ahead nicholas joseph citigroup analyst thanks when you re underwriting an acquisition what additional benefit you typically bake in for putting an asset onto your offering platform scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president well everyone or not everyone but certainly our platform gets that immediate bump traditionally in most all cases we ve seen that there s been third party or there s been third party management of that asset and so we bring it in onboard and in most cases now we don t bring on extra people because we ve got our markets built out and we ve got them built out to a point where one or two assets in that market doesn t generate a huge change in how we re operating in fact it brings synergies and benefits so the first part of the equation is pretty clear pretty distinct and we ve proven it over the last three years certainly with the duke acquisition but second and more importantly and where we re focused on and what we ve talked to investors about and what we need to do a better job with is the benefits of managing your own assets when you have 500 000 square feet to 1 million square feet we re building out teams now of engineers property managers that are bringing the services that are traditional third party services we re bringing them in house for a number of years people said well how can you own a medical office building and what benefits can you bring to that building can you bring to the tenants well what you can do is you can do two things one you can train put in systems put in processes that make it consistent so that a tenant feels that they ve got consistency you get a reputation within the market because physician groups and physicians talk a lot but second from an investor perspective we can bring those synergies and get those benefits in bringing that third party services in house have our people do it have them do it quicker faster and of course we re in early process of doing that i mean that s the nice thing amanda talked about it i think we have years left where we can get more and more of these services in house and remove them from third party processes robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary and nick just to be clear on the cap rate disclosure the only thing that we re factoring into the year one cap rate to hta is really the elimination of the third party property management fee coming to us we do see additional benefits beyond that but we haven t factored that in so it s typically the 20 to 30 basis points that come from that that we ve included in the disclosure nicholas joseph citigroup analyst thanks that s very helpful and then maybe just on g a the increase expected in 2020 guidance can you give us more color on what s driving that robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary i think as we look across our platform you know that scott and amanda talked a lot about how we expect to and plan to build and grow the occupancy of the portfolio throughout the year we ve expanded the leasing team and the asset management team a bit as we head into this year partly as we ve gotten some more scale in our markets it makes sense to get more leasing people there to really dive into the depths of how do we grow those relationships and we expect it to pay off from an occupancy perspective really as well as a depth in relationships that leads to other acquisitions and developments as well nicholas joseph citigroup analyst thank you operator the next question comes from chad manticore with stifel please go ahead chad vanacore stifel analyst all right i m going to trod on some territory that tayo or dan asked about occupancy go a different direction since amanda mentioned about 100 200 basis points improvement potential that makes me think you might target some specific opportunities maybe give us an idea of what those would be on some of your maybe under occupied properties robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary well i think as we ve looked at our portfolio as amanda s talked through things certainly in the third quarter and this year there s couple of properties where we ve essentially acquired them we knew we were going to transition from a tenant perspective move some smaller tenants out make way for some of the larger tenants to come in place so we saw the occupancy decline take place in the third quarter now we expect it through the course of the year many of those same assets to get tenanted back up so she has mentioned properties in new haven some we ve got in charlotte that we bought that were low more lowly occupied some in houston as well that we ve kind of gone through this amanda houghton executive vice president asset management also our mission redevelopment campus we re expecting to gain some traction there so chad vanacore stifel analyst all right and then end of the year what s your property tax been experience been and how is that trending robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary well property taxes are certainly as we ve talked about and i m sure other folks have talked about a big issue you buy something and it gets revalued we go through a very diligent process and i don t think our process is any different than any of our peers we go through and we actively try to appeal and get the property tax to the fairest value we can so it is an issue we look at it when we do an underwriting we look at it when we do an acquisition and when we do an acquisition there s three or four things that we look at one of course is location synergies of tenants and synergies of healthcare systems we re assuming of course it s in our market so we have a pretty good depth of what that is second we look at rents because i think that right now there are when you see an asset and it may be overvalued i think it s less overvalued relative to the cap rate that someone is asking for is probably overvalued based upon the rent that you can get on roll over or you can get on a renewal so we look very carefully at the rent it is the rent proportionate to what we can see in escalator and what we can see in that growth over the next seven years and then third we look at the property taxes because you re going to eventually your relationship with the tenants your relationship and the ability to renew release that communication is something that s going to impact them whether it s the first year you own it or the second year that that comes through or so it is something that is a significant discussion point both with us internally but also with our investment committee chad vanacore stifel analyst all right one quick last one any notable lease expirations a year in 2020 we should be thinking about scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president we were pretty consistent i tend not to like to use that word much but with a portfolio of almost 25 million square feet you get ebbs and flows we re very diligent right now on when leases of 5 7 10 years are rolling we want to make sure the right tenant is there we want to make sure it s the right grant the right amount of ti both by us and by the occupant so we ve taken 2019 we re diligently focused in 2020 on putting the principles of our platform to play in decisions on both a one off basis but on a cumulative basis that adds up to focusing on the bottom line i mean we are focused as an organization in moving the results to the bottom line for hta chad vanacore stifel analyst all right that s it from me thanks operator our next question comes from connor siversky with berenberg please go ahead connor siversky berenberg analyst hey all thanks for having me just a quick question on redevelopment could you provide any color in regard to how you identify the properties that may need renovation or modernization and then in terms of execution on that end do you generally follow a preconceived strategy maybe in terms of mep modernization or is each project strictly addressed on a case by case basis robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary well i think as we go through our annual budgeting and asset management process we certainly identify kind of our strategic positioning of assets within the market and typically if we find assets that are of lower quality and lower rent but have the opportunity for a significant increase in either occupancy or rates we ll take a pretty hard look at that and evaluate our plans for the building and any capital required to go into that amanda has talked about mission viejo i think this is a perfect example we had some older buildings coming off long term leases the rents in those buildings relative to campus were probably 10 11 which is in this case 25 35 below where the potential could be so we did identify improvements within there and part of those improvements is typically going to be mep how do we make the buildings more efficient how do we drive more energy controls through the buildings then that just becomes part of the overall redevelopment process connor siversky berenberg analyst got you and then in terms of the development team in general any plan to bring on any more people and maybe increase your bandwidth in that area scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president well we re always looking to add truly competent and great people i mean this is we think hta is an opportunity for people to come aboard and really take a unique approach and improve their career and so forth so we re always looking in quite specifically as it relates to do we need to add anyone or do we need to add additional people for our bandwidth we re pretty well positioned we re always looking at opportunities we re very disciplined i mean we want to do development with medical office buildings that fit our criteria we don t just want to build a building we don t want to just build a building and have it pre leased and then five or seven years from now say okay what am i going to do with that building so we re being very diligent we ve got opportunities we continue to see development we also continue to see most of our opportunities with our existing relationships and i guess timing was pretty good for us with the duke acquisition we ve been around for 11 12 years the size helped us get to a place where we were more recognizable and then now it s been a year year and half and our introductions to folks that we ve already known and the completion of some of the development leads to the discussion of okay there s more development to be done and we d like you to consider doing it and we ll include you with the opportunity that s out there and so we re in a good place but again we re very disciplined in what we want to develop connor siversky berenberg analyst okay thanks for that have a good weekend everyone operator our next question comes from jonathan hughes with raymond james please go ahead jonathan hughes raymond james analyst hey good morning out there i was hoping you could walk us through the progression of how you get to the 2 5 same store noi growth in the quarter when i look at occupancy it was down 70 bps renewal spreads up mid 3 bps but at 75 retention so that gets you to the mid 1 revenue growth just where does this other 100 basis points come from to get to 2 5 robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary i think it s a combination of things one as we talked about there s just the normal progression of what we ve seen throughout the year of doing more within our property our operating platform i think we were able to achieve one of the focus areas we talked a lot about this year was focus on utility savings as we ve gone through and the teams gone through and recommissioned certain of the buildings we certainly saw some pretty good increases or pretty good improvements there within the fourth quarter that we got some additional margin out of we also got some property tax appeals that came back and as we go throughout that period we had a couple hundred thousand dollar benefit from both property tax appeals where we received refunds as well as just where we were able to get valuations and assessments lower that also drove probably another 20 basis point 20 basis points 30 basis point improvement there jonathan hughes raymond james analyst okay so mostly expenses but i mean if say like if you didn t have that opportunity and i realize it s part of the platform you built but if say expenses had been up like 2 i mean noi growth would ve been closer to flatter 1 is that right robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary well as you said i mean it s hard to discount the portfolio we ve over the last three years we ve outperformed our peers from expense perspective most expenses have been up in other platforms our platform has actually been lower we ve taken advantage of that we continue to think we can take advantage of that so it s fortunate that we take advantage of these things i don t think that we will continue to not be able to have those advantages as we go forward so sort of asking a question of negative negative so i wouldn t know how to answer that jonathan hughes raymond james analyst yes okay and then my one follow up you started last year with 75 million of expected dispositions ended up doing 5 million for the year you re starting this year with 50 million of expected dispositions can you remind us what s the definition of requirement for a property to be classified as held for sale and are all 50 million of expected dispositions in the intended for sale adjustments to same store noi ends up robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary yes the definition on that is simply that it s kind of a four step process to qualify for that first we have to have board approval to sell the assets so walk the board through the rationale for what and why and potential impact to that second thing is we have to have actively marketed it so it s got to be taken to market being shown to sellers typically through a brokered process sometimes on a direct basis the third thing is we actually have to receive an offer on it for us to at a price that we expect it to go through and actually proceed to sale on that so when you look at what s out in the intended for sale bucket in the fourth quarter there s only two properties that met that criteria both of that psa signed and have gone through various parts of the diligence to get there so it s a very disciplined and frankly limited process to fall in that bucket scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president and as you know we ve talked about this before we actually have a third party due diligences and signs off to our audit committee on both our same store growth and our disposition process so hta is probably the most disciplined diligent company that i ve been associated with from that perspective from an internal consistency and criteria and monitoring perspective but we have gone through situations where we have put things up for sale got an offer and try and folks have tried to retrade us and we don t retrade we tend to buy what we buy we tend to agree to sell what we sell and there s been a couple of examples where we ve seen opportunities where leases have come fruition and we wanted to get paid for them and the buyer has decided not to pay for them and so we said well then guess what that s something we re not going to sell so we make business decisions as you would expect where as i said our investment committees are reactive and so we are very cognizant of making the best decision that we can on a consistent basis for shareholders robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary and kind of just the final thing just on that point i think if you look and walk through the noi walk that we have if we had actually included our intended for sale properties into same store pool our same store growth would have actually gone up we would have reported i think a 2 6 versus 2 5 same store so it s a very defined process that we go through and it works both ways jonathan hughes raymond james analyst okay and so the 50 million in dispositions guidance right now i mean you have psas for that 50 million i think you said it s two properties right scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president yes we ve had psas or loi s on those yes jonathan hughes raymond james analyst okay all right that s it from me thanks for the time guys operator our next question comes from rich anderson with smbc please go ahead richard anderson smbc analyst thank you and happy valentine s day scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president yes richard anderson smbc analyst there s love in the air for hta today scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president it s just love in the air just period richard anderson smbc analyst so you guys mentioned amanda you mentioned longer lease duration in 2019 for leasing activity to seven over seven years i m wondering if you get by granting that do you get a bigger escalator out of it i m wondering if that s part of and i m sure it is and part of negotiation and how much more so that you allow for a longer stay amanda houghton executive vice president asset management are you talking about on the releasing spread or on the contractual annual escalators richard anderson smbc analyst on the contractual annual escalator amanda houghton executive vice president asset management it s determined by the market so we typically try to have our annual escalators near the growth in the market so that at the end of the lease term we don t have a significant roll up or roll down so generally we ve been right around that 3 to 4 regardless of the term richard anderson smbc analyst okay scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president rich i think in some situations what we have seen though is that the larger the space a 30 000 40 000 50 000 square feet the more cognizant the opportunity is that you re trying to get to negotiate the escalator the smaller leases you get the escalator a lot quicker than you do on the larger leases and that s just sort of the there s that feeling today in the market that larger groups larger healthcare systems recognize their prominence in that negotiation i think that is one of the things that has changed substantially both in the acquisition market and the leasing market is that medical office is no longer a surprise medical office is no longer something that is a distant asset group of brokers and healthcare system executives are very very competent have expertise and have knowledge about what s going on in the market richard anderson smbc analyst okay so 2018 you didn t do much in the way of acquisitions and of course you did a lot more this year is it as simple as a cost of capital conversation or is there something else that drove you to do much much more clearly your stock was has done much better in 2019 but nothing else has influenced this change in the external growth profile of the company last year and going into 2020 simply cost to capital scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president well i think there s three things and first and foremost cost to capital i mean it needs to be accretive we need to find opportunities to do that so first and foremost is that fact and the next one below that is probably a couple steps down but the next one is are we finding are we comfortable with where cap rates are are we comfortable where the cap rates that other folks are asking or bidding for assets if you remember 2018 first part 2019 i thought it got very very aggressive on certain cap rates for portfolios first of all they didn t necessarily meet what we wanted to buy but it was aggressive and therefore people kind of got themselves in a place where they started out at a cap rate that was oh my goodness i think that s mellowed out a little bit i think that now there s a little more rationality in the markets that we are in with the acquisitions that we re seeing so it s cost to capital it s then where cap rates and cap rates that we can find assets and then third it was where is the interest rate environment if i look back at 2018 and robert and i were talking about he thought it was going to four to 10 year and i thought it was going to one and it ended up in between robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary somehow scott won that one scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president but that was a big decision point and i think management teams boards of directors had conversations about how did they want to use their balance sheet and traditionally over the last 30 years if interest rates go up cap rates go up rich i mean i don t know that s i m not sure that works like that anymore but so we were very cognizant of not wanting to be on the wrong end of a move that maybe we didn t see or was projected to come i think that the feeling internally now is that interest rates are probably where they re going to be for a while cap rates become more consistent and our cost to capital is something that we can find accretive acquisitions for richard anderson smbc analyst yes good stuff thanks and then last from me how much does your external growth expectation for 2020 impact your per share guidance in other words if you did nothing this year how much growth would we not see if that makes any sense scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president it does and i ll let robert answer that robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary yes i think it s 0 01 or 0 02 and i think some of that s frankly factored into the range that we provided if we re unable to hit our acquisition targets not deployed capital i think we end at the low end of range if we re able to certainly meet our acquisition targets and exceed them i think we end up closer to the higher end of our earnings target range richard anderson smbc analyst okay and i got one more for you robert what are you assuming sort of the timing of the forward settle over the course of the year robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary yes no so we put in that our earnings estimates has an average of 226 million diluted shares which would imply that we settle it close to june 30 or spread it right around the midpoint of the year richard anderson smbc analyst okay perfect thanks very much operator our next question comes from todd stender with wells fargo please go ahead todd stender wells fargo analyst thank you my question piggybacks on that last one regarding the forward so that s all you have for the equity but when you look at your stock price right now relative to where you price the forward could you you can still tap your regular atm right but you still have to balance the good ffo guidance as you ve projected how you re kind of thinking about using more equity than maybe what you have in the forward scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president we ll go back to the we re fortunate right now i think we are seeing opportunities we started to see those in the last half of the year we wanted to put ourselves in 2020 2021 where you and i have actually talked about it where we focus on our ffo growth and we focus on getting shareholder value back to where not back to but to where we think it should be we re in a position to do that i always try to put us in a position that if nothing else happens we are at least successful from what we communicate to people when we talk to them and i think we re there now i think with the opportunities we have the balance sheet we have what we re seeing in our leasing pipeline 2020 is a year where we just need to execute and do a decent job on that if we see other opportunities or if there are opportunities where we can make it accretive make our ffo growth in addition to what we would normally have done then we would take advantage of that but right now we re very well positioned and we just need to execute todd stender wells fargo analyst thank you scott that s helpful because when you look at your debt to ebitda at 5 7 pro forma with the forward it gets you down to 5 but it may not necessarily go to 5 and that just assumes that you re going to have incremental debt coming with not new equities is that fair to say a little more debt maybe robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary well i think what it assumes is that we stay kind of at the 5 7 range so as we make acquisitions we ll draw down the equity that maintains our leverage in that 5 5 to 6 range that we re comfortable with but the important thing is we do have the dry powder the capital is already raised we ve got the certainty to pursue the acquisition pipeline that we see and the opportunities that we see despite any kind of volatility that we have that might come up throughout this year so we feel comfortable in how we re pursuing those todd stender wells fargo analyst okay thank you and the last question when you look at that when you look at the spread between ffo and fad you ve got a recurring capex in there that can chew away at some of your per share growth how are you guys thinking about capex for 2020 maybe on a percentage of noi basis maybe just talk about that thank you robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary what we think from a maintenance perspective that we ve outlined that we would expect it to be in call it 13 to 14 of noi consistently and we expect that to be the case in 2020 i think where the opportunity is for it to go higher is if we actually start to if and when we start to get occupancy growth associated with that you might see the capital associated with tick a little bit higher of course that s kind of a onetime item and then you see the noi increase on a corresponding basis so we expect 13 to 14 with anything above that really driven by occupancy growth todd stender wells fargo analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from sarah tan with jpmorgan please go ahead sarah tan jpmorgan analyst hi i m on for michael mueller just a question on development extensions i m wondering if there is a shadow pipeline of development and extensions that you have and how big is it in terms of dollars given the two recent announcements the additions you made to development pipeline the last quarter scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president well we the answer to that is as i mentioned yes we do have opportunities that we see now or that we have discussions with that are already inherent in our portfolio i don t want to talk about them specifically because we haven t either determined to move forward or transaction hasn t been concluded so we do have that opportunity now we also are looking for new opportunities that are out there that are more are competitive where there s two or three of us looking to do the development and it s in a major market and it s with the right healthcare system and so forth so we ve got a combination of those but we do have i always like to feel that we are we control our own success and in the development side of the equation now we have taken the last 18 months 12 months 6 months to find those opportunities to develop those opportunities that are inherent in our portfolio so certainly for the next couple of years we have the development that we can bring onboard to help us with that tool that adds on to our other abilities to generate earnings sarah tan jpmorgan analyst thank you operator our next question comes from lukas hartwich with green street advisors please go ahead lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst thanks on your yield guidance for 20 acquisitions what is that before synergies and how long do you think it takes to get to the number you quoted robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary we baked in the typical 20 to 30 basis points that we typically achieve when we buy in our markets on that so you can take about 25 basis points off to get what we had historically provided on just a straight cash arm s length transaction and for us to get those synergies like i said the only synergies were included are really the elimination of a third party property management fees so typically that happens within the first 90 days of a new acquisition in our key markets lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst great and then just one other quick one do you guys ever underwrite non mob acquisitions scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president can you be more clear on that lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst just other segments of healthcare real estate skilled nursing senior housing i know you guys have a smattering of that in your portfolio scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president we do lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst i m just curious if you underwrite new deals scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president well i think that we don t underwrite them i would tell you that we are we try to be as knowledgeable about the whole healthcare sector as we possibly can if you don t actually buy it i d step back and say those that do have far greater expertise than we do but internally and externally we try to be as in tune with transactions that happen across the whole spaces as i possibly can be caroline does the same thing robert amanda our people in the our leasing teams we ve got some what we call senior vice presidents of leasing they re very experienced they have been with us now mostly five six seven years so we try to keep ourselves very much aware of where healthcare systems are going what transactions are in the marketplace and what transitions may or may not be going on lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst perfect thank you operator our next question comes from vikram malhotra with morgan stanley please go ahead vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst thanks for taking the questions robert just to clarify so the 1 50 million to 1 3 million you have baked in were asset intended for sale how does that relate to the 50 million in dispositions i m assuming they re related but it just seems like they seem different numbers robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary i think there s a little bit of a difference here we put 50 million out there as a this is the normal run rate given our experience in getting things to market what ultimately closes really it translates to a handful of dispositions that we think will ultimately close given the process that scott mentioned we go through scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president it s 12 months vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst well let s say 5 million noi would sound like more disposition volume robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary i m not sure with the 5 million of noi you re taking our intended vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst just annualizing yes robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary i got you i understand what you re saying yes i think there s a probability that things ultimately close in there that we weigh in the disposition guidance if things dispositions go higher than that i think you d see a corresponding increase in expected acquisitions on that i think as you look at the intended for sale in the same store though i think the important thing is there we try to remain conservative and consistent with our guidelines again if we had included all the properties that are in the intended for sale bucket we would be reporting higher same store growth not lower vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst no no i m not focusing on the growth i m just wondering 5 million noi means a lot more volume than 50 million so i m just wondering like over what timeframe are you looking to sell the intended for sale robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary yes no i think the cap rates that we d see on the dispositions ends up being in that i think we put in there kind of a 6 type range 6 to 6 5 and i think just from a guidance perspective we re giving kind of the midpoint of what we ultimately expect will happen but again if it ends up being higher than that i think you ll see a corresponding increase in the acquisitions vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay so they could be really really high cap rate deals robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary no no i think this is what i would say is if you see us transact on the 1 2 million annualized you ll see us have cap rates in that 6 plus or minus range and you ll just see us increase the acquisition rate that we re doing vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay got it and then just to clarify the operating synergies you baked i m just i want to make sure with the platform today you are getting the synergy day one but you also reference that g a is going up and you re still building out the leasing and asset management folks so i guess they re different pieces but i m just wondering is it fair to assume you ve got that synergies day one as opposed to over time scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president well there s two buckets one is day one as robert pointed out where you just take the third party take it off and robert said you can get it in 90 days but traditionally now when you buy an asset the people go away the third party goes away and maybe there s a 30 day transition because you ve notified them and they come on to our platform the second bucket is when we put our engineers we put our property managers on the asset where we rebudget or take the opportunity throughout the year or throughout the next couple of quarters to put their service contracts onto our contracts within the marketplace that we see that tend to be much more favorable than the contract that they re on typically one off assets with local representation or smaller or national developers that their business is not property management their business is not owning 500 000 to 1 million square feet at the market so we can bundle i mean that s the opportunity that we get so there are two steps that we get in and we tend to get one right away and then we get the second one probably half the benefit in the first year and then we continue to get benefit the second year and then we continue after that to provide more and more services to the tenant at retail excuse me at wholesale not retail and we get the benefit of that vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay and then just last one robert you and i briefly talked about this but st vincent in downtown la is either closed or deciding to close i know you don t have an mob on campus but you have an mob close by can you talk about sort of your experience and kind of how you underwrote the original transaction and any puts and takes there given the potential closure robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary yes this is the acquisitions that we made earlier this year in downtown la and third street for an underwriting perspective we re always looking at what is the submarket what is the market what is the long term demand for healthcare that submarket is one that is just exploding if you look at downtown la and all the investment that s taking place you ve seen something like 20 billion of investment go in there from a real estate perspective over the last 5 years and expect over the next 5 10 years so it s really an area that s growing you re seeing a lot of the incomes come up and so we like that from just a demographic perspective from a straight healthcare perspective on asset we liked actually that none of the tenants are actually affiliated with the hospital it s really with competitive practices that wanted to be in that area from their ability to attract patients in there so when we did our underwriting we looked at it from that perspective understood where the physicians and practices of the building were getting their demand from saw that as an area that was going to continue not just where it is but really increase in value and demand there so the hospital being next door was actually if anything negative at the time because we didn t see that as being additive at the moment now the interesting thing is if the hospital closes we re actually going to likely benefit we re not subject to ground leases we re totally fee simple interest and some of the tenants that are actually on campus are looking for space and we might see them come into our building so we see no immediate impact we see the long term fundamentals of our underwriting playing out if not slightly outperforming where we thought we d be at this point in time scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president and i will just reinforce i went to the asset before we bought it i see all the assets we buy this is location location location and it s tenancy uclas in the building we ve got some major tenants they want to expand this is a building where we love for investors to look at to see it because what we bought it at and what it s going to be valued at today and what it s going to be valued at three five years from now i think our occupancies up 3 or 4 we re 95 guided at 90 guided at 89 90 it could get full here in the next couple of months which is what amanda is talking about i wish i had a lot more though that type of asset in our portfolio but you ve got to go look you ve got to make sure if we had occupancy from the hospital that would have been a problem if it would have been on campus with ground leases that would have been a problem but we ve checked the boxes and this particular case it s turned out better and it is ahead of our underwriting than when we bought it vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay great thank you scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president so thanks for bringing that one up operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to scott peters for any closing remarks scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president well thank you very much i know that there are some conferences coming up in the next month or next two or three weeks we ll be there and we look forward to talking to as many folks as we can and we re very excited about 2020 thank you operator duration 85 minutes

president good morning and thank you for joining us today for healthcare trust of america s fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call joining me on the call today are robert milligan our chief financial officer amanda houghton our executive vice president of asset management and caroline chiodo our senior vice president of acquisitions and development as we begin 2020 hta has positioned itself to be the sector leader in the ownership leasing and operation of medical office buildings we have a key market focused portfolio that is irreplaceable with almost 25 million square feet our portfolio is comprised of a fully integrated full service operating platform and hta has positioned itself with a fortress investment grade balance sheet that positions us to uniquely pursue investments and deliver earnings growth and shareholder returns over the next three to five years as healthcare enters the new decade it continues to move toward an integrated outpatient experience that is cost effective and convenient for patients this delivery will take place in three settings one on campus where hta is the largest owner of mobs in the country two off campus in the community locations where all leading healthcare providers are focusing and growing their presence and three in academic university locations where academic and healthcare combinations are critical over the last 13 years we have built a portfolio of mobs that reflects these trends where they focus on finding core critical real estate in great markets that will deliver high levels of tenant retention and rental growth opportunities over future years our experience has demonstrated that properties with the strongest performance occur both on and off campus with the primary drivers more related to market quality patient demand building characteristics and increasingly critical tenant synergies strategically hta has targeted key fast growing markets that we believe will outperform other markets throughout the country our targeted market approach allows hta to maximize returns by creating size and scale in markets we now have 17 markets with over 500 000 square feet and 10 markets with approximately 1 million square feet or more this scale allows us to effectively create a deeper and more strategic local operating platform with relationships and operating capabilities that are unique this approach is a key pillar for our growth strategy going forward in 2019 we saw the positive attributes of our platform and portfolio start to work in ways that generates both internal and external growth opportunities led by one same store growth of 2 7 driven by rental revenue growth of 2 3 and margin expansion from increased utilization of our property management platform and certain expense savings this includes fourth quarter same store growth of 2 5 two leasing where we leased almost 15 of our portfolio or more than 3 6 million square feet with full year releasing spreads of 3 5 and same store tenant retention of 84 total acquisitions of 558 million and a blended cap rate of 6 1 after taking into account expected synergies from our asset management platform this includes over 330 million closed in the fourth quarter these are well located mobs located primarily in our existing markets where we are adding scale and will utilize our operating platform to drive additional value for shareholders although the acquisition markets remain very competitive for larger deals we are focusing on one off opportunities that fit in our portfolio but where we have been able to acquire at yields that allow for immediate accretion finally four development we have announced 110 million of development and redevelopments in 2019 including two on campus developments with hca and dignity now called commonspirit we have strong relationships with both of these entities over the years and continue to work with them for future developments we now have four developments in process with total investments of over 150 million that will start to be delivered in 2020 we ve also announced the redevelopment of two mobs on our st joseph health mission viejo campus in orange county california that will include up to 20 million of capital investment our balance sheet has never been stronger with leverage of 29 of total capitalization and 5 7 times debt to ebitda this leverage goes down to 5 times and 25 of total capitalization when factoring in the approximately 300 million in equity available to us to take down on a forward basis over the next six months we purposely built our capital availability in the fourth quarter of 2019 given the deal flow we are seeing and expect to deploy this capital over the next two quarters earnings growth as a result of our performance and acquisition activity we were able to grow our normalized funds from operations to 1 64 per share and 0 42 in the fourth quarter note that in 2019 we had more than 0 02 per share in costs that were capitalized that hta must now expense these costs were associated with our in house leasing teams as we look ahead of 2020 hta is focused on driving performance in a way that hits the bottom line from an asset management perspective we are focused on using our platform to drive occupancy growth to a 100 by 100 to 200 basis points while continuing to maintain releasing spreads that we achieved in 2019 from an investor perspective our focus continues to be on finding and closing on acquisitions and development opportunities that meet our discipline criteria in our key markets taking advantage over the increase in opportunities that we are seeing now to both our acquisition and development platforms that have been in place now for 5 to 10 years from a balance sheet perspective we are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet with leverage between 5 5 times and 6 0 times investing the equity we have raised on a forward basis from an accretive perspective from a guidance point of view for 2020 we are expecting normalized ffo per share to reach between 1 69 and 1 73 per share with growth of over 4 as the midpoint of the range we expect our same store growth to range between 2 to 3 for the year with a focus on growing occupancy to achieve the top side of the range we will fully deploy our existing equity capital with acquisitions projected between 500 million and 600 million for the year with expected yields after synergies of 5 5 to 6 25 finally we will start to deliver on the developments which with our first project in cary north carolina being delivered at the beginning of the third quarter robert will give some additional color in his comments finally i wanted to point out the healthcare trust of america s first sustainability report that was published in january since we started our operating platform in 2010 we have focused on the efficiency of our buildings and our footprint in the communities in which we invest i will now turn the call over to amanda amanda houghton executive vice president asset management thanks scott in 2019 our team remained focused on delivering high quality operating and leasing results in our existing portfolio while integrating new properties onto our platform and capturing the efficiencies and synergies anticipated as part of these acquisitions over the last decade our in house asset management team has shown repeatedly our ability to add between 25 and 35 basis points of incremental yield as we bring new properties into our platform the most visible example of this being the duke portfolio which we acquired in 2017 and over a 12 month period we generated savings between 7 million and 8 million largely as a result of replacing third party management and engineering staff with our own teams and capturing the markups and profits previously passed to third party managers this transition from third party management to our in house platform is seamless from a tenant perspective as they see no net financial impact that allows our shareholders to benefit from profits previously passed on to third parties with over 200 property management engineering and leasing staff across over 20 offices hta remains uniquely suited in the reit space to benefit from the synergies and savings a full service operating platform provides we believe as a company we are still in the very early stages of recognizing the full benefit of our platform as we grow in market we are able to hire more specialized and skilled staff to do additional services previously done by third parties by way of example at 500 000 square feet in the market and housing mechanical electrical and plumbing services begins to make sense from a cost standpoint with a focus on growing our key markets and continue training our in house staff we expect over the next three to four years investors will continue to see margin expansion and value creation from our platform turning now to the fourth quarter our same store growth this quarter came in at 2 5 driven by a 1 4 base revenue growth and 100 basis points of rental margin expansion on a year to date basis same store noi growth increased 2 7 driven by full year revenue growth of 2 3 during the quarter we signed approximately 1 million square feet of leases this included 180 000 square feet of new leases and almost 830 000 square feet of renewal our total tenant retention for same store portfolio was 77 while releasing spreads on renewals remained strong at 3 4 annual escalators for leases signed in the period were 2 9 continuing our trend of increasing escalators toward 3 as we continue to roll our leases tis remained consistent at 1 96 per square foot per year of term on renewals and 4 11 per square foot per year of term on new for the year we have now leased 3 6 million square feet or almost 15 of our total portfolio gla same store retention for the year is 83 while our releasing spreads and renewals are strong 3 5 further contractual increases on both new and renewal leases signed during the year averaged 2 6 strengthening our recurring revenue stream and quality growth our investors have come to expect new trends to note on our renewals we have seen a notable increase level of early renewals with over 1 million square feet of leasing for the year related to leases that expire in 2020 and beyond this is driven by tenants seeking to lock in their space for the long term as they consolidate practices and invest in their infrastructure we have also seen an increased interest in longer term renewals as evidenced by the average renewal term in 2019 of 7 2 years nearly 25 higher than our 2018 renewal term average of 5 8 years and these are both positive trends that we believe will continue into 2020 as tenants are trying to lock in key real estate for their healthcare delivery strategies on the expense front we continue to show the benefit of our economies of scale and specialty service offering for the quarter we were able to keep expenses relatively flat over the fourth quarter of 2018 and down over 2 sequentially despite an overall increase in property taxes during 2019 primarily in texas our teams have largely been able to offset this impact through efficiencies in our platform and continued focus on utility savings in the fourth quarter we did begin to see some of the favorable outcomes of our property tax appeals and believe we will continue to have success with our appeal efforts in the coming quarters 2019 performance is a great reflection of the resiliency of our portfolio and ability to continue to deliver quality noi growth through changing external and internal environment we came into 2019 with a slightly higher amount of expirations than in years past 12 8 of our portfolio versus our historical 10 average we also had several asset transitions the largest of which included our mission viejo medical office buildings four mobs that we owned fee simple on a st joseph health mission viejo campus in orange county california these buildings were constructed in 1972 and are coming off a 20 year hospital master lease we re moving forward with redevelopment on two buildings that will modernize the facilities and allow us to command rent significantly above their current rent and more in line with this market while these factors contributed to an overall decrease in year over year same store occupancy and lease percentage much of which was manifested in the third quarter our same store leased rates remained steady in the fourth quarter and occupancy grew 10 basis points to 90 9 over q3 as we look to 2020 we have approximately 9 of our portfolio expiring with another 6 in month to month status given current discussions with tenants we expect tenant retention to be around 80 with renewal spreads in the 2 to 4 range our new leasing efforts continue to be strong with over 40 of our pipeline comprised of large deals greater than 10 000 square feet while these deals do generally take longer to sign and ultimately build out we expect to see the benefits of these deals through meaningful increase lease and occupancy level toward the second half of 2020 with an overall outlook of moving occupancy between 100 and 200 basis points within the next 12 to 24 months i will now turn the call over to robert robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary thanks amanda 2019 ended up being a very active year for us in the investment and capital market front which when combined with our continued same store growth allowed us to demonstrate an accelerating level of earnings growth in the fourth quarter we generated same store growth of 2 5 with full year same store growth coming in at 2 7 this continues to be generated by both steady consistent revenue growth and margin expansion through increased performance and utilization of our operating platform from an infrastructure perspective we remain very efficient with g a for the quarter coming in at 10 2 million with the year over year increase driven primarily by the expensing of internal leasing cost on which we have capitalized 1 2 million in the year ago period for the year we came in at 41 3 million which remains extremely efficient relative to our peers as a result we generated normalized ffo per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 0 42 up 5 from prior year as we continue to generate same store growth and closing our acquisitions redeploying the capital raised in last year s greenville sale into better assets and markets funds available for distribution increased 72 3 million in the quarterm which includes 17 6 million of recurring capital expenditures or approximately 14 of noi our run rate for the year however remains around 12 5 of noi our recurring capex is slightly higher than normal given the relatively high amount of total leasing we ve entered into in 2019 close to 15 of our portfolio we re almost 25 more than we completed in 2018 we expect some of this will continue into 2020 given the lag in tenant improvement utilization from an investment perspective we re seeing an increased number of opportunities that meet our disciplined underwriting criteria and have an improved cost of capital that allows us to close and lock in attractive day one accretion for shareholders for 2019 we were able to find and close on over 550 million of investments at yields of over 6 1 including day one synergies from our operating platform in the fourth quarter we closed on 330 million in investments including a mix of sales from developers private owners and healthcare providers our investment criteria remain straightforward identifying assets that are positioned to grow over the next 5 to 10 years by focusing on core critical real estate that ll be in high demand as healthcare delivery continues to evolve mix of on and off campus buildings as well as those on academic medical center locations they re located in key markets that are growing faster than u s average where we can increase our scale and relevancy and assets where we can utilize our platform to drive additional value and yield to our investments and finally we re focused on achieving accretive opportunities to drive day one returns as well as long term growth our 2019 investments met all of these criteria s they were all located in our key markets in core critical locations with the opportunity to drive additional value over time through an increase in occupancy and the opportunity to push rents the properties were almost 60 on or adjacent to campus while still acquired entirely on fee simple basis which we think is critical to long term performance from a portfolio construction perspective we continue to grow our scale in key markets increasing that number of markets with more than 500 000 square feet to over 17 as we increase our geographic concentration we gain the brand relevancy with health systems academic universities and large physician groups and improve operational efficiencies as we leverage the platform our balance sheet philosophy has remained lowly levered and raise capital the time we make acquisitions to lock in the earnings accretion and ensure we are always in a position to pursue transactions opportunistically this is especially true in volatile markets where we have the ability to pursue growth accretively and drive quickly we financed our acquisitions in 2019 by raising approximately 637 million of equity including 585 million in the fourth quarter at average prices around 29 70 or an implied low 5 cap rate that is at least 65 basis lower than our acquisition price we raised the capital through our atm allowing for very efficient transactions and took slightly more than 300 million on a forward basis which will serve as dry powder for acquisitions as we head in 2020 i will note that we have a number of ways in which we can raise equity and are always evaluating the opportunities in any given market in the fourth quarter we chose to use a forward given the potential for market volatility in election year and the pipeline of opportunities that were seen this gives us the strength of a 5 times leverage balance sheet without the immediate earnings dilution that comes from raising the equity on a traditional basis something we believe will be valued by shareholders as a result our balance sheet continues to be in terrific shape to finance growth in 2020 we ended the year at 5 7 times debt to ebitda with 1 2 billion of liquidity including the equity forwards and very limited near term maturities in the third quarter we took the opportunity to extend these maturities at very attractive rates when you factor in the forward equity into our liquidity and our balance sheet standing at 5 0 times debt to ebitda we have the capacity by over 700 million in acquisitions while remaining within our targeted leverage range of 5 5 to 6 times turning to 2020 we have provided our initial earnings guidance that is in the range of 1 69 to 1 73 of normalized ffo per share this guidance assumes same store growth of 2 to 3 with the high end of the range based on achieving increasing levels of occupancy by the end of the year g a of 44 million to 46 million as we grow our platform capabilities to increase our occupancy acquisition of 500 million to 600 million at a blended cap rate of 5 5 to 6 25 including synergies the utilization of our 300 million of equity forward toward the end of the second quarter resulting in average shares of approximately 226 million with the remainder of our capital financed on our revolver and a 2 5 million to 3 million headwind as a result of our redevelopment of properties at mission viejo with the expectations that they will achieve positive cash flow toward the end of 2020 our maintenance capex for the year will be 13 to 14 of noi as a relatively higher levels of leasing in 2019 heads into 2020 we could also see nonrecurring capital increase slightly as we look to increase our occupancy levels by 100 to 200 basis points during the year which will position us for solid growth into 2021 in total we think 2020 will be the year we return to our normal levels of growth you should expect from hta and the mob sector i will now turn it back over to scott scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president thank you robert thank you amanda we will now open up for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from tayo okusanya with mizuho please go ahead omotayo okusanya mizuho analyst hi yes good afternoon solid quarter great guide question around same store guidance for 2020 i just kind of giving your goal of increasing occupancy of 100 basis points just a little bit surprised that the same store noi guidance has been higher robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary well i think as we look at how we should perform and how the mob sector should certainly perform we think 2 to 3 is a pretty consistent range that we re going out with our view is from an occupancy perspective we saw a slight decline in the third quarter from an occupancy perspective that s carried into the fourth we ll see that carry into the first certainly the first quarter of next year which will provide a little bit occupancy headwind to start which we anticipate will potentially lead to occupancy tailwinds by the time we get to the end of the year so there s a little bit of a balance from an occupancy perspective as to how it relates to same store omotayo okusanya mizuho analyst okay that s helpful and then i appreciate the commentary you made about your acquisition outlook and kind of what you re looking at relative to some other big transactions out there but again could you just generally talk about the overall kind of acquisition market where cap rates are whether there s a big difference between trying to buy on campuses versus off campus and things of that sort scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president sure this is scott i think that you know we have seen over the last certainly 24 months and maybe even a little longer than that that the quality of what we call community core or off campus buildings if they have the right synergies the right location and the right size and i don t mean size necessarily by a single building but by a group of buildings and the tenant occupancy is critical but we ve seen that cap rate compression come down and i think it continues to in certain cases get even closer to what traditionally has been on campus i think you re seeing if you look closely and if you know you never know what the future brings but i think we feel here we started community core almost 10 years ago we started academic university acquisition six seven years ago and if you look at the future of healthcare you re seeing on campus become far more selective i think when you buy something on campus you used to be able to just buy it and assume that it s going to perform or the demand was going to be there and the healthcare system was going to be fully cooperative i think the healthcare systems are now are focused out in communities they re focused into locations where they can generate the greatest patient mix and from an ownership perspective we ve seen many situations and i think our peers are seeing situations where traditionally what used to be called an off campus community core location from an noi perspective or a return perspective compares favorably if not more favorably to what may have been a traditional on campus so i think you re going to continue to see the evolution and migration of continued services from on campus to community core and i go back to the fact that if you pick your key cities and those key cities or those key communities are growing and the infrastructure of those cities are continuing to expand the only logical place for many of these healthcare systems to reach out to is back into the community core locations so they re doing that and we re very happy with our cities that we ve got some depth and breadth in and we can continue to see acquisition opportunities both on campus and in the community core setting omotayo okusanya mizuho analyst but what are those cap rate kind of around kind of what are those assets kind of trading for relative to maybe some other stuff you bought in the fourth quarter scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president i think the cap rate haven t moved i frankly haven t seen i thought we got extremely aggressive with cap rates maybe 12 months ago 16 months ago on some larger portfolio transactions and that got a lot of publicity and so therefore the perception was that my individual asset or my one or two assets can take that type of pricing that s backed off a little bit we re finding as robert talked about in this comments we re finding very good strong opportunities in the 5 5 to 6 25 and we like that that seems to fit right where we like to be and we re very optimistic about 2020 we ve got the balance sheet that allows us to be disciplined and execute so we like where we are and i frankly like the environment that we see right now omotayo okusanya mizuho analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from daniel bernstein with capital one please go ahead daniel bernstein capital one analyst hi i guess a follow up question to tayo on the occupancy and same store noi comp for 2020 so is the right way to think about it may be noi growth year over year will be roughly like 2 in the first half and then 3 3 5 in the second half of the year and that flows through into 2021 is that the right way you to think about the noi growth robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary well i think we certainly target our same store growth in each of the quarters above the 2 range but i think as we look at how the occupancy in the comparative periods lines out our view would certainly be the first quarter first half has a little bit more of the revenue year over year headwinds just given that occupancy with the potential for that to shift as you get into the back half of the year daniel bernstein capital one analyst okay and it should benefit 21 year over year growth you should see some acceleration in 2021 growth over 2020 robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary yes we re seeing when we look at this and i think we ve tried to be pretty forthright with investors is we ve positioned ourselves in 2020 for both the same store where we like to see it 2 to 3 we think we have occupancy and we re focused on occupancy and we ve focused on our leasing platform we ve got some redevelopment that s starting to take traction and as amanda pointed out in her comments we ve seen traction frankly with some large groups or large space and it s catch 2022 if we had smaller spaces adding up to the larger spaces i think they d be done by now but the larger spaces are just by the fact that who does them they have more processes they want to make sure that that this is the right location we re seeing good activity so we re very excited about the fact that we can see some occupancy gains we ve repositioned our portfolio and the development that we re doing i think is going to pay dividends from a pricing perspective and where we are with those assets daniel bernstein capital one analyst okay and then in terms of dispositions you only guided to 50 million i don t know if that s lower or not but it seems with cap rates fairly low and maybe slightly compressing and certainly technology of mobs the size of the mobs demands at the hospitals are changing as well are there is there a possibility that 50 million disposition number could be higher as you review the portfolio robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary i think that we re sort of fortunate i was talking to someone the other day and we were talking about healthcare trust of america we re 14 years old so we re not 30 40 years old we ve gone through a process over the last 10 years and we ve been public now about seven there is a huge focus on us as far as the quality of product when we went public and frankly as we got bigger and bigger we ve gone through a very diligent process with our investment committee our investment committee sees every acquisition that we buy whether it s for a 1 or whether it s for 2 billion so we ve been very selective in our cities we ve been selective in our assets and when you go through and you say every company should dispose of things that don t fit their portfolio but if you look at what we put together with the duke acquisition with the acquisitions that we ve done since then they re in our markets they re purposeful they re disciplined there s not something that we say okay we bought 20 assets and we don t like 5 of them so therefore we don t we re going to dispose of those 5 we ve been very diligent we ve been very disciplined and so i think the 50 million on average is probably the right number but we ve always said and i continue to say that everything is for sale at the right price and we were fortunate to have an opportunity to do greenville at the time that we thought it was good for both parties and so if somebody came about and said wow you just bought it again and should we think about that we would but we don t have what i would consider to be a lot of assets that we don t like what we do like is the opportunity for our platform to lease them up and to bring value to them if they re not 90 to 95 occupied daniel bernstein capital one analyst okay that s good i ll yield the floor thank you operator our next question comes from nick joseph with citi please go ahead nicholas joseph citigroup analyst thanks when you re underwriting an acquisition what additional benefit you typically bake in for putting an asset onto your offering platform scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president well everyone or not everyone but certainly our platform gets that immediate bump traditionally in most all cases we ve seen that there s been third party or there s been third party management of that asset and so we bring it in onboard and in most cases now we don t bring on extra people because we ve got our markets built out and we ve got them built out to a point where one or two assets in that market doesn t generate a huge change in how we re operating in fact it brings synergies and benefits so the first part of the equation is pretty clear pretty distinct and we ve proven it over the last three years certainly with the duke acquisition but second and more importantly and where we re focused on and what we ve talked to investors about and what we need to do a better job with is the benefits of managing your own assets when you have 500 000 square feet to 1 million square feet we re building out teams now of engineers property managers that are bringing the services that are traditional third party services we re bringing them in house for a number of years people said well how can you own a medical office building and what benefits can you bring to that building can you bring to the tenants well what you can do is you can do two things one you can train put in systems put in processes that make it consistent so that a tenant feels that they ve got consistency you get a reputation within the market because physician groups and physicians talk a lot but second from an investor perspective we can bring those synergies and get those benefits in bringing that third party services in house have our people do it have them do it quicker faster and of course we re in early process of doing that i mean that s the nice thing amanda talked about it i think we have years left where we can get more and more of these services in house and remove them from third party processes robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary and nick just to be clear on the cap rate disclosure the only thing that we re factoring into the year one cap rate to hta is really the elimination of the third party property management fee coming to us we do see additional benefits beyond that but we haven t factored that in so it s typically the 20 to 30 basis points that come from that that we ve included in the disclosure nicholas joseph citigroup analyst thanks that s very helpful and then maybe just on g a the increase expected in 2020 guidance can you give us more color on what s driving that robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary i think as we look across our platform you know that scott and amanda talked a lot about how we expect to and plan to build and grow the occupancy of the portfolio throughout the year we ve expanded the leasing team and the asset management team a bit as we head into this year partly as we ve gotten some more scale in our markets it makes sense to get more leasing people there to really dive into the depths of how do we grow those relationships and we expect it to pay off from an occupancy perspective really as well as a depth in relationships that leads to other acquisitions and developments as well nicholas joseph citigroup analyst thank you operator the next question comes from chad manticore with stifel please go ahead chad vanacore stifel analyst all right i m going to trod on some territory that tayo or dan asked about occupancy go a different direction since amanda mentioned about 100 200 basis points improvement potential that makes me think you might target some specific opportunities maybe give us an idea of what those would be on some of your maybe under occupied properties robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary well i think as we ve looked at our portfolio as amanda s talked through things certainly in the third quarter and this year there s couple of properties where we ve essentially acquired them we knew we were going to transition from a tenant perspective move some smaller tenants out make way for some of the larger tenants to come in place so we saw the occupancy decline take place in the third quarter now we expect it through the course of the year many of those same assets to get tenanted back up so she has mentioned properties in new haven some we ve got in charlotte that we bought that were low more lowly occupied some in houston as well that we ve kind of gone through this amanda houghton executive vice president asset management also our mission redevelopment campus we re expecting to gain some traction there so chad vanacore stifel analyst all right and then end of the year what s your property tax been experience been and how is that trending robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary well property taxes are certainly as we ve talked about and i m sure other folks have talked about a big issue you buy something and it gets revalued we go through a very diligent process and i don t think our process is any different than any of our peers we go through and we actively try to appeal and get the property tax to the fairest value we can so it is an issue we look at it when we do an underwriting we look at it when we do an acquisition and when we do an acquisition there s three or four things that we look at one of course is location synergies of tenants and synergies of healthcare systems we re assuming of course it s in our market so we have a pretty good depth of what that is second we look at rents because i think that right now there are when you see an asset and it may be overvalued i think it s less overvalued relative to the cap rate that someone is asking for is probably overvalued based upon the rent that you can get on roll over or you can get on a renewal so we look very carefully at the rent it is the rent proportionate to what we can see in escalator and what we can see in that growth over the next seven years and then third we look at the property taxes because you re going to eventually your relationship with the tenants your relationship and the ability to renew release that communication is something that s going to impact them whether it s the first year you own it or the second year that that comes through or so it is something that is a significant discussion point both with us internally but also with our investment committee chad vanacore stifel analyst all right one quick last one any notable lease expirations a year in 2020 we should be thinking about scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president we were pretty consistent i tend not to like to use that word much but with a portfolio of almost 25 million square feet you get ebbs and flows we re very diligent right now on when leases of 5 7 10 years are rolling we want to make sure the right tenant is there we want to make sure it s the right grant the right amount of ti both by us and by the occupant so we ve taken 2019 we re diligently focused in 2020 on putting the principles of our platform to play in decisions on both a one off basis but on a cumulative basis that adds up to focusing on the bottom line i mean we are focused as an organization in moving the results to the bottom line for hta chad vanacore stifel analyst all right that s it from me thanks operator our next question comes from connor siversky with berenberg please go ahead connor siversky berenberg analyst hey all thanks for having me just a quick question on redevelopment could you provide any color in regard to how you identify the properties that may need renovation or modernization and then in terms of execution on that end do you generally follow a preconceived strategy maybe in terms of mep modernization or is each project strictly addressed on a case by case basis robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary well i think as we go through our annual budgeting and asset management process we certainly identify kind of our strategic positioning of assets within the market and typically if we find assets that are of lower quality and lower rent but have the opportunity for a significant increase in either occupancy or rates we ll take a pretty hard look at that and evaluate our plans for the building and any capital required to go into that amanda has talked about mission viejo i think this is a perfect example we had some older buildings coming off long term leases the rents in those buildings relative to campus were probably 10 11 which is in this case 25 35 below where the potential could be so we did identify improvements within there and part of those improvements is typically going to be mep how do we make the buildings more efficient how do we drive more energy controls through the buildings then that just becomes part of the overall redevelopment process connor siversky berenberg analyst got you and then in terms of the development team in general any plan to bring on any more people and maybe increase your bandwidth in that area scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president well we re always looking to add truly competent and great people i mean this is we think hta is an opportunity for people to come aboard and really take a unique approach and improve their career and so forth so we re always looking in quite specifically as it relates to do we need to add anyone or do we need to add additional people for our bandwidth we re pretty well positioned we re always looking at opportunities we re very disciplined i mean we want to do development with medical office buildings that fit our criteria we don t just want to build a building we don t want to just build a building and have it pre leased and then five or seven years from now say okay what am i going to do with that building so we re being very diligent we ve got opportunities we continue to see development we also continue to see most of our opportunities with our existing relationships and i guess timing was pretty good for us with the duke acquisition we ve been around for 11 12 years the size helped us get to a place where we were more recognizable and then now it s been a year year and half and our introductions to folks that we ve already known and the completion of some of the development leads to the discussion of okay there s more development to be done and we d like you to consider doing it and we ll include you with the opportunity that s out there and so we re in a good place but again we re very disciplined in what we want to develop connor siversky berenberg analyst okay thanks for that have a good weekend everyone operator our next question comes from jonathan hughes with raymond james please go ahead jonathan hughes raymond james analyst hey good morning out there i was hoping you could walk us through the progression of how you get to the 2 5 same store noi growth in the quarter when i look at occupancy it was down 70 bps renewal spreads up mid 3 bps but at 75 retention so that gets you to the mid 1 revenue growth just where does this other 100 basis points come from to get to 2 5 robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary i think it s a combination of things one as we talked about there s just the normal progression of what we ve seen throughout the year of doing more within our property our operating platform i think we were able to achieve one of the focus areas we talked a lot about this year was focus on utility savings as we ve gone through and the teams gone through and recommissioned certain of the buildings we certainly saw some pretty good increases or pretty good improvements there within the fourth quarter that we got some additional margin out of we also got some property tax appeals that came back and as we go throughout that period we had a couple hundred thousand dollar benefit from both property tax appeals where we received refunds as well as just where we were able to get valuations and assessments lower that also drove probably another 20 basis point 20 basis points 30 basis point improvement there jonathan hughes raymond james analyst okay so mostly expenses but i mean if say like if you didn t have that opportunity and i realize it s part of the platform you built but if say expenses had been up like 2 i mean noi growth would ve been closer to flatter 1 is that right robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary well as you said i mean it s hard to discount the portfolio we ve over the last three years we ve outperformed our peers from expense perspective most expenses have been up in other platforms our platform has actually been lower we ve taken advantage of that we continue to think we can take advantage of that so it s fortunate that we take advantage of these things i don t think that we will continue to not be able to have those advantages as we go forward so sort of asking a question of negative negative so i wouldn t know how to answer that jonathan hughes raymond james analyst yes okay and then my one follow up you started last year with 75 million of expected dispositions ended up doing 5 million for the year you re starting this year with 50 million of expected dispositions can you remind us what s the definition of requirement for a property to be classified as held for sale and are all 50 million of expected dispositions in the intended for sale adjustments to same store noi ends up robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary yes the definition on that is simply that it s kind of a four step process to qualify for that first we have to have board approval to sell the assets so walk the board through the rationale for what and why and potential impact to that second thing is we have to have actively marketed it so it s got to be taken to market being shown to sellers typically through a brokered process sometimes on a direct basis the third thing is we actually have to receive an offer on it for us to at a price that we expect it to go through and actually proceed to sale on that so when you look at what s out in the intended for sale bucket in the fourth quarter there s only two properties that met that criteria both of that psa signed and have gone through various parts of the diligence to get there so it s a very disciplined and frankly limited process to fall in that bucket scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president and as you know we ve talked about this before we actually have a third party due diligences and signs off to our audit committee on both our same store growth and our disposition process so hta is probably the most disciplined diligent company that i ve been associated with from that perspective from an internal consistency and criteria and monitoring perspective but we have gone through situations where we have put things up for sale got an offer and try and folks have tried to retrade us and we don t retrade we tend to buy what we buy we tend to agree to sell what we sell and there s been a couple of examples where we ve seen opportunities where leases have come fruition and we wanted to get paid for them and the buyer has decided not to pay for them and so we said well then guess what that s something we re not going to sell so we make business decisions as you would expect where as i said our investment committees are reactive and so we are very cognizant of making the best decision that we can on a consistent basis for shareholders robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary and kind of just the final thing just on that point i think if you look and walk through the noi walk that we have if we had actually included our intended for sale properties into same store pool our same store growth would have actually gone up we would have reported i think a 2 6 versus 2 5 same store so it s a very defined process that we go through and it works both ways jonathan hughes raymond james analyst okay and so the 50 million in dispositions guidance right now i mean you have psas for that 50 million i think you said it s two properties right scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president yes we ve had psas or loi s on those yes jonathan hughes raymond james analyst okay all right that s it from me thanks for the time guys operator our next question comes from rich anderson with smbc please go ahead richard anderson smbc analyst thank you and happy valentine s day scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president yes richard anderson smbc analyst there s love in the air for hta today scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president it s just love in the air just period richard anderson smbc analyst so you guys mentioned amanda you mentioned longer lease duration in 2019 for leasing activity to seven over seven years i m wondering if you get by granting that do you get a bigger escalator out of it i m wondering if that s part of and i m sure it is and part of negotiation and how much more so that you allow for a longer stay amanda houghton executive vice president asset management are you talking about on the releasing spread or on the contractual annual escalators richard anderson smbc analyst on the contractual annual escalator amanda houghton executive vice president asset management it s determined by the market so we typically try to have our annual escalators near the growth in the market so that at the end of the lease term we don t have a significant roll up or roll down so generally we ve been right around that 3 to 4 regardless of the term richard anderson smbc analyst okay scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president rich i think in some situations what we have seen though is that the larger the space a 30 000 40 000 50 000 square feet the more cognizant the opportunity is that you re trying to get to negotiate the escalator the smaller leases you get the escalator a lot quicker than you do on the larger leases and that s just sort of the there s that feeling today in the market that larger groups larger healthcare systems recognize their prominence in that negotiation i think that is one of the things that has changed substantially both in the acquisition market and the leasing market is that medical office is no longer a surprise medical office is no longer something that is a distant asset group of brokers and healthcare system executives are very very competent have expertise and have knowledge about what s going on in the market richard anderson smbc analyst okay so 2018 you didn t do much in the way of acquisitions and of course you did a lot more this year is it as simple as a cost of capital conversation or is there something else that drove you to do much much more clearly your stock was has done much better in 2019 but nothing else has influenced this change in the external growth profile of the company last year and going into 2020 simply cost to capital scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president well i think there s three things and first and foremost cost to capital i mean it needs to be accretive we need to find opportunities to do that so first and foremost is that fact and the next one below that is probably a couple steps down but the next one is are we finding are we comfortable with where cap rates are are we comfortable where the cap rates that other folks are asking or bidding for assets if you remember 2018 first part 2019 i thought it got very very aggressive on certain cap rates for portfolios first of all they didn t necessarily meet what we wanted to buy but it was aggressive and therefore people kind of got themselves in a place where they started out at a cap rate that was oh my goodness i think that s mellowed out a little bit i think that now there s a little more rationality in the markets that we are in with the acquisitions that we re seeing so it s cost to capital it s then where cap rates and cap rates that we can find assets and then third it was where is the interest rate environment if i look back at 2018 and robert and i were talking about he thought it was going to four to 10 year and i thought it was going to one and it ended up in between robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary somehow scott won that one scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president but that was a big decision point and i think management teams boards of directors had conversations about how did they want to use their balance sheet and traditionally over the last 30 years if interest rates go up cap rates go up rich i mean i don t know that s i m not sure that works like that anymore but so we were very cognizant of not wanting to be on the wrong end of a move that maybe we didn t see or was projected to come i think that the feeling internally now is that interest rates are probably where they re going to be for a while cap rates become more consistent and our cost to capital is something that we can find accretive acquisitions for richard anderson smbc analyst yes good stuff thanks and then last from me how much does your external growth expectation for 2020 impact your per share guidance in other words if you did nothing this year how much growth would we not see if that makes any sense scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president it does and i ll let robert answer that robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary yes i think it s 0 01 or 0 02 and i think some of that s frankly factored into the range that we provided if we re unable to hit our acquisition targets not deployed capital i think we end at the low end of range if we re able to certainly meet our acquisition targets and exceed them i think we end up closer to the higher end of our earnings target range richard anderson smbc analyst okay and i got one more for you robert what are you assuming sort of the timing of the forward settle over the course of the year robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary yes no so we put in that our earnings estimates has an average of 226 million diluted shares which would imply that we settle it close to june 30 or spread it right around the midpoint of the year richard anderson smbc analyst okay perfect thanks very much operator our next question comes from todd stender with wells fargo please go ahead todd stender wells fargo analyst thank you my question piggybacks on that last one regarding the forward so that s all you have for the equity but when you look at your stock price right now relative to where you price the forward could you you can still tap your regular atm right but you still have to balance the good ffo guidance as you ve projected how you re kind of thinking about using more equity than maybe what you have in the forward scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president we ll go back to the we re fortunate right now i think we are seeing opportunities we started to see those in the last half of the year we wanted to put ourselves in 2020 2021 where you and i have actually talked about it where we focus on our ffo growth and we focus on getting shareholder value back to where not back to but to where we think it should be we re in a position to do that i always try to put us in a position that if nothing else happens we are at least successful from what we communicate to people when we talk to them and i think we re there now i think with the opportunities we have the balance sheet we have what we re seeing in our leasing pipeline 2020 is a year where we just need to execute and do a decent job on that if we see other opportunities or if there are opportunities where we can make it accretive make our ffo growth in addition to what we would normally have done then we would take advantage of that but right now we re very well positioned and we just need to execute todd stender wells fargo analyst thank you scott that s helpful because when you look at your debt to ebitda at 5 7 pro forma with the forward it gets you down to 5 but it may not necessarily go to 5 and that just assumes that you re going to have incremental debt coming with not new equities is that fair to say a little more debt maybe robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary well i think what it assumes is that we stay kind of at the 5 7 range so as we make acquisitions we ll draw down the equity that maintains our leverage in that 5 5 to 6 range that we re comfortable with but the important thing is we do have the dry powder the capital is already raised we ve got the certainty to pursue the acquisition pipeline that we see and the opportunities that we see despite any kind of volatility that we have that might come up throughout this year so we feel comfortable in how we re pursuing those todd stender wells fargo analyst okay thank you and the last question when you look at that when you look at the spread between ffo and fad you ve got a recurring capex in there that can chew away at some of your per share growth how are you guys thinking about capex for 2020 maybe on a percentage of noi basis maybe just talk about that thank you robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary what we think from a maintenance perspective that we ve outlined that we would expect it to be in call it 13 to 14 of noi consistently and we expect that to be the case in 2020 i think where the opportunity is for it to go higher is if we actually start to if and when we start to get occupancy growth associated with that you might see the capital associated with tick a little bit higher of course that s kind of a onetime item and then you see the noi increase on a corresponding basis so we expect 13 to 14 with anything above that really driven by occupancy growth todd stender wells fargo analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from sarah tan with jpmorgan please go ahead sarah tan jpmorgan analyst hi i m on for michael mueller just a question on development extensions i m wondering if there is a shadow pipeline of development and extensions that you have and how big is it in terms of dollars given the two recent announcements the additions you made to development pipeline the last quarter scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president well we the answer to that is as i mentioned yes we do have opportunities that we see now or that we have discussions with that are already inherent in our portfolio i don t want to talk about them specifically because we haven t either determined to move forward or transaction hasn t been concluded so we do have that opportunity now we also are looking for new opportunities that are out there that are more are competitive where there s two or three of us looking to do the development and it s in a major market and it s with the right healthcare system and so forth so we ve got a combination of those but we do have i always like to feel that we are we control our own success and in the development side of the equation now we have taken the last 18 months 12 months 6 months to find those opportunities to develop those opportunities that are inherent in our portfolio so certainly for the next couple of years we have the development that we can bring onboard to help us with that tool that adds on to our other abilities to generate earnings sarah tan jpmorgan analyst thank you operator our next question comes from lukas hartwich with green street advisors please go ahead lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst thanks on your yield guidance for 20 acquisitions what is that before synergies and how long do you think it takes to get to the number you quoted robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary we baked in the typical 20 to 30 basis points that we typically achieve when we buy in our markets on that so you can take about 25 basis points off to get what we had historically provided on just a straight cash arm s length transaction and for us to get those synergies like i said the only synergies were included are really the elimination of a third party property management fees so typically that happens within the first 90 days of a new acquisition in our key markets lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst great and then just one other quick one do you guys ever underwrite non mob acquisitions scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president can you be more clear on that lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst just other segments of healthcare real estate skilled nursing senior housing i know you guys have a smattering of that in your portfolio scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president we do lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst i m just curious if you underwrite new deals scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president well i think that we don t underwrite them i would tell you that we are we try to be as knowledgeable about the whole healthcare sector as we possibly can if you don t actually buy it i d step back and say those that do have far greater expertise than we do but internally and externally we try to be as in tune with transactions that happen across the whole spaces as i possibly can be caroline does the same thing robert amanda our people in the our leasing teams we ve got some what we call senior vice presidents of leasing they re very experienced they have been with us now mostly five six seven years so we try to keep ourselves very much aware of where healthcare systems are going what transactions are in the marketplace and what transitions may or may not be going on lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst perfect thank you operator our next question comes from vikram malhotra with morgan stanley please go ahead vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst thanks for taking the questions robert just to clarify so the 1 50 million to 1 3 million you have baked in were asset intended for sale how does that relate to the 50 million in dispositions i m assuming they re related but it just seems like they seem different numbers robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary i think there s a little bit of a difference here we put 50 million out there as a this is the normal run rate given our experience in getting things to market what ultimately closes really it translates to a handful of dispositions that we think will ultimately close given the process that scott mentioned we go through scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president it s 12 months vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst well let s say 5 million noi would sound like more disposition volume robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary i m not sure with the 5 million of noi you re taking our intended vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst just annualizing yes robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary i got you i understand what you re saying yes i think there s a probability that things ultimately close in there that we weigh in the disposition guidance if things dispositions go higher than that i think you d see a corresponding increase in expected acquisitions on that i think as you look at the intended for sale in the same store though i think the important thing is there we try to remain conservative and consistent with our guidelines again if we had included all the properties that are in the intended for sale bucket we would be reporting higher same store growth not lower vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst no no i m not focusing on the growth i m just wondering 5 million noi means a lot more volume than 50 million so i m just wondering like over what timeframe are you looking to sell the intended for sale robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary yes no i think the cap rates that we d see on the dispositions ends up being in that i think we put in there kind of a 6 type range 6 to 6 5 and i think just from a guidance perspective we re giving kind of the midpoint of what we ultimately expect will happen but again if it ends up being higher than that i think you ll see a corresponding increase in the acquisitions vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay so they could be really really high cap rate deals robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary no no i think this is what i would say is if you see us transact on the 1 2 million annualized you ll see us have cap rates in that 6 plus or minus range and you ll just see us increase the acquisition rate that we re doing vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay got it and then just to clarify the operating synergies you baked i m just i want to make sure with the platform today you are getting the synergy day one but you also reference that g a is going up and you re still building out the leasing and asset management folks so i guess they re different pieces but i m just wondering is it fair to assume you ve got that synergies day one as opposed to over time scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president well there s two buckets one is day one as robert pointed out where you just take the third party take it off and robert said you can get it in 90 days but traditionally now when you buy an asset the people go away the third party goes away and maybe there s a 30 day transition because you ve notified them and they come on to our platform the second bucket is when we put our engineers we put our property managers on the asset where we rebudget or take the opportunity throughout the year or throughout the next couple of quarters to put their service contracts onto our contracts within the marketplace that we see that tend to be much more favorable than the contract that they re on typically one off assets with local representation or smaller or national developers that their business is not property management their business is not owning 500 000 to 1 million square feet at the market so we can bundle i mean that s the opportunity that we get so there are two steps that we get in and we tend to get one right away and then we get the second one probably half the benefit in the first year and then we continue to get benefit the second year and then we continue after that to provide more and more services to the tenant at retail excuse me at wholesale not retail and we get the benefit of that vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay and then just last one robert you and i briefly talked about this but st vincent in downtown la is either closed or deciding to close i know you don t have an mob on campus but you have an mob close by can you talk about sort of your experience and kind of how you underwrote the original transaction and any puts and takes there given the potential closure robert a milligan chief financial officer treasurer and secretary yes this is the acquisitions that we made earlier this year in downtown la and third street for an underwriting perspective we re always looking at what is the submarket what is the market what is the long term demand for healthcare that submarket is one that is just exploding if you look at downtown la and all the investment that s taking place you ve seen something like 20 billion of investment go in there from a real estate perspective over the last 5 years and expect over the next 5 10 years so it s really an area that s growing you re seeing a lot of the incomes come up and so we like that from just a demographic perspective from a straight healthcare perspective on asset we liked actually that none of the tenants are actually affiliated with the hospital it s really with competitive practices that wanted to be in that area from their ability to attract patients in there so when we did our underwriting we looked at it from that perspective understood where the physicians and practices of the building were getting their demand from saw that as an area that was going to continue not just where it is but really increase in value and demand there so the hospital being next door was actually if anything negative at the time because we didn t see that as being additive at the moment now the interesting thing is if the hospital closes we re actually going to likely benefit we re not subject to ground leases we re totally fee simple interest and some of the tenants that are actually on campus are looking for space and we might see them come into our building so we see no immediate impact we see the long term fundamentals of our underwriting playing out if not slightly outperforming where we thought we d be at this point in time scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president and i will just reinforce i went to the asset before we bought it i see all the assets we buy this is location location location and it s tenancy uclas in the building we ve got some major tenants they want to expand this is a building where we love for investors to look at to see it because what we bought it at and what it s going to be valued at today and what it s going to be valued at three five years from now i think our occupancies up 3 or 4 we re 95 guided at 90 guided at 89 90 it could get full here in the next couple of months which is what amanda is talking about i wish i had a lot more though that type of asset in our portfolio but you ve got to go look you ve got to make sure if we had occupancy from the hospital that would have been a problem if it would have been on campus with ground leases that would have been a problem but we ve checked the boxes and this particular case it s turned out better and it is ahead of our underwriting than when we bought it vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay great thank you scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president so thanks for bringing that one up operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to scott peters for any closing remarks scott d peters chairman of the board ceo and president well thank you very much i know that there are some conferences coming up in the next month or next two or three weeks we ll be there and we look forward to talking to as many folks as we can and we re very excited about 2020 thank you operator duration 85 minutes

by matthew ehret for vt canada in ellen brown s brilliant new article mexico s amlo shows how it s done the researcher and national banking advocate made the powerful point that the only way to properly fight the neo liberal order is for nations of the west to follow the lead of mexico s current president lopez obrador who recently announced the creation of a new network of national banks of which over 3238 branches will be in operation by 2021 obrador s stated aim is to have 13 000 branches built across mexico which would far outnumber the total number of all private banks and will also provide a vital tool for the economic liberation of mexico this act is nothing short of heresy in the corridors of the neoliberal priesthood of our modern age the economic foundation upon which today s globalized world are premised asserts that nation states may not participate in the marketplace no price controls no protective tariffs no bank regulation and certainly no national banks following this gospel nations are permitted to do war and promote various forms of population control but nothing that pollutes the purity of the supposedly free market of course simply utilizing national banking practices by themselves is not a full solution a fascist regime can of course use national banks for destructive ends just as a democratic republic can use them for positive ends and as we have seen over the years the financial oligarchy has no problem supporting fascist regimes such as hitler s germany or mussolini s italy nor do they have any problem supporting national keynesian initiatives so long as they are done under an anti human green new deal framework so what makes president obrador s current efforts different as brown states in her paper the new president has held to his campaign promises in 2019 his first year in office he did what donald trump pledged to do drain the swamp purging the government of technocrats and institutions he considered corrupt profligate or impeding the transformation of mexico after 36 years of failed market focused neoliberal policies other accomplishments have included substantially increasing the minimum wage while cutting top government salaries and oversize pensions making small loans and grants directly to farmers guaranteeing crop prices for key agricultural crops launching programs to benefit youth the disabled and the elderly and initiating a 44 billion infrastructure plan lópez obrador s goal he says is to construct a new paradigm in economic policy that improves human welfare not just increases gross domestic product if you haven t figured it out the answer is morality what gave the establishment of modern nation states their power and legitimacy in the wake of the golden renaissance was the fact that they are premised upon the common good of the people against the interests of private oligarchs and elite families those feudal orders dominated by hereditary institutions during most of human history placed the natural order upside down with the welfare of the talking cows aka peasants granted to them by the fancy of the master class of landlords under a true sovereign nation state elected leaders derive their legitimacy and support of the people through their mandate to defend the inalienable rights of people through internal improvements which increase the socio physical spiritual well being of the people this used to be recognized in past ages as an elementary idea of natural law which saw the laws of morality as intertwined into the fabric of objective reality as the laws of gravity and electricity ben franklin s electric insight into economics it is here no coincidence that the leading proponent of national banking and productive credit in america was also the leading scientist who trumped all elite scientific minds of europe when he discovered the principle of electricity in 1752 benjamin franklin and his vast network of leading collaborators across europe and america never saw a distinction between subjective moral sciences and objective a moral physics the foundational documents and also the first national banking system of america upon which other republics in south and central america modeled themselves in the coming years were based upon this idea of natural law this insight was the basis for franklin s 1727 opus on the necessity for a paper currency where franklin argued that value was not located in gold or silver or land or even demand per se but rather in the creative powers of a people the consolidation of america s revolutionary war debt incurred by each of the 13 colonies into a unified federal credit transformed the unpayable debt into a national blessing as ben franklin s protégé alexander hamilton first treasury secretary laid out in his famous reports on a national bank and on manufactures in 1791 in opposition to the early free traders and monetarists who wished america would end its protective tariff stay agrarian and allow britain to maintain its global monopoly on the industry hamilton and franklin understood this would undo the entire revolutionary cause resulting in america s eventual re absorption back into the empire although slandered by generations of anti american propaganda as a rothschild tool hamilton was in fact a great patriot who argued that once the new federal debt was consolidated the behaviour of the debt would be turned from a passive burden which held the nation underwater into an active fuel of investments into infrastructure and manufacturing by doing this the nation was able to transform from an agricultural slave society of cash cropping into a full spectrum society capable of producing for itself and trading surplus finished goods to other nations in its first 40 years this program allowed america s population to quadruple overcoming all malthusian limits to growth unfortunately starting with the 1804 killing of alexander hamilton at the hands of aaron burr the father of today s wall street banking syndicates much of america s history has been contaminated by either slave loving traitors who attacked national banking such as presidents van buren andrew jackson and polk or great statesmen who too often died in office before their efforts to revive the constitution could be consolidated in this list we find presidents harrison 1840 taylor 1851 lincoln 1865 garfield 1880 mckinley 1901 harding 1923 fdr 1945 jfk 1963 mexico and america by 1865 lincoln s use of national banking practices the greenback was instrumental in saving the union from the british orchestrated civil war although his assassination hampered this momentum to full industrial reconstruction of the south during this time britain french and spanish hapsburg empires had initiated parallel wars to destroy the newly emerging mexican republic then led by lincoln admiring president benito juarez first with the 1858 1860 war of reform and then 1862 1867 french invasion in spite of this existential challenge juarez succeeded in driving out the imperialists with political and military support from lincoln patriots in america while also imposing tariffs which encouraged the build up of the industry liberating mexico from its status as cash cropping exporter social and educational reforms elevating the health and welfare of the people grew enormously under juarez s leadership although lincoln republicans supported mexico s sovereign in opposition to foreign empires using a healthy interpretation of the monroe doctrine the death of mckinley in 1902 saw a grievous abuse of the monroe doctrine which too often became an imperial hammer to subdue banana republics as seen under the brutal leadership of teddy roosevelt franklin roosevelt was the first president to push back against the pro empire wall street crowd since mckinley s murder which he brought in with the good neighbor policy stating in the field of world policy i would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and because he does so respects the rights of others the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors fdr broke from his puppet predecessors by supporting mexico s rights to control its own oil and resources after president cárdenas expropriated foreign oil holdings and also vastly expanded credit from the us export import bank to fund massive mexican infrastructure projects with a focus on water energy and transport this served as one of the earliest international extensions of the new deal which fdr intended would liberate all nations of the earth from colonialism franklin roosevelt inspires mexico s amlo upon his election in 2018 president obrador announced the first phase of his new deal with an every young person to work program inspired by fdr which he described saying i have had this idea since i read how president franklin delano roosevelt pulled the united states out of the 1930s crisis what did he do in a tremendous economic crisis he decided to put the whole u s people to work and he decided to put young people to work and he paid them a dollar a day for every young person but his idea was full employment that is a job for everyone that idea stuck in my head because roosevelt lifted the united states out of the crisis and for me he was therefore if not the best president one of the best that the united states has had franklin delano roosevelt by that action by that decision now we are going to do something similar all young people to work under nafta mexico was kept down by acting as a cheap labor market to do the work once done by high paid americans and canadians this policy ultimately hurt mexico since free trade s obsession with low costs resulted in keeping quality of life and production dismally low the formula low prices low paid workers better slaves weakened nations is as true today as it was 250 years ago when the british empire commissioned adam smith to write his 1776 wealth of nations obrador s efforts are moving in the right direction however the 13 000 national bank branches which he intends to have built will have to go beyond merely sending money to the poor as the plan is currently constituted and he knows it responding to the monetarist priests howling at the sacrilege of national banking obrador stated we re going to speak with those from the bank of méxico respecting the autonomy of the bank of méxico we have to educate them because for them this is an anachronism even sacrilege because they have other ideas but we ve arrived here after telling the people that the neoliberal economic policy was going to change thus taking over responsibility from the usurious private banking network and mexican central bank which have converted mexico into an indebted colony of crime and despair since the overthrow of president portillo in 1982 is a vital next step in the fight luckily china has made great strides in this direction which will likely be of great assist to mexico to this point brown ended her report with the following astute analysis today the best model for that approach is china which funds infrastructure by borrowing from its own state owned banks like all banks they create loans as bank credit on their books which is then repaid with the proceeds of the projects created with the loans there is no need to tap up the central bank or rich investors or the tax base government banks can create money on their books just as central banks and private banks do for mexico however using its public banks as china does would be something for the future if at all meanwhile amlo has been a trailblazer in showing how a national public banking system can be initiated quickly and efficiently the key it seems is just to have the political will along with massive support from the public the legislature local business leaders and the military the irony here is that the american system of national banking productive credit and protective tariffs which were innovated by alexander hamilton and applied by every great leader from harrison to lincoln to mckinley to fdr both internally and across to international allies in mexico is now most clearly embodied by the country which few people associate with america the peoples republic of china while china uses its debt as an active asset to invest in great long term infrastructure projects which thus extinguish the original debt while increasing the productive powers of labor america s private central banking system under the federal reserve merely creates debt for speculation and turning poor americans into slaves just look at the 14 trillion the treasury printed to bail out failing speculators in 2008 2010 or look at the 9 trillion printed by the fed to do the same nothing was invested in the real economy during this time what a different world we could have created had this money been invested into a new non green new deal of the 21st century such as china s belt and road initiative has ushered in nafta s long awaited death is a start as are obrador s vital reforms however a fight needs to still occur before a north american belt and road initiative can finally break colonized nations including the usa out from the clutches of the financial oligarchy and their self imploding deep state managers
u s review overarching economic themes remain in place retail sales increased for a fourth straight month in january underscoring the resiliency of the u s consumer fundamentals are solid and support our expectations for healthy consumer spending gains in coming months the industrial sector remains challenged however as total production declined for the fourth time over the past five months the u s economy remains firmly on its expansion path yet we are mindful of the risks to the outlook including the ongoing coronavirus threat amid what should be a soft start we look for u s real gdp to increase 2 0 this year mildly easing momentum as coronavirus hits as the ongoing coronavirus outbreak understandably continues to capture financial markets attention this week offered a wideranging release of instructive economic indicators that continue to extend overarching themes we have seen in the overall economy in recent months the first theme highlights the primary strength of the ongoing economic expansion the resilient u s consumer retail sales increased for the fourth consecutive month in january up 0 3 spending gains were broad based as nine of the 13 major categories increased on the month led by building materials and eating drinking establishments not all was rosy however as control group sales which feed directly into personal consumption in the gdp report remained flat weighed down by a 3 1 drop in clothing that said the consumer remains in good shape at the start of the year resilient hiring gains and solid wage growth have buoyed consumer sentiment and spending while the coronavirus presents a risk we look for this consumer resilience to continue with spending increasing at a healthy 2 5 pace in q1 the second theme highlights the ongoing struggles in the industrial sector industrial production fell 0 3 month overmonth in january marking the fourth decline over the past five months mining rose 1 2 while unseasonably mild winter weather resulted in utilities plunging for the second straight month manufacturing output fell 0 1 largely due to a 10 7 drop in aircraft parts a result of the boeing 737 max production shutdown outside of the boeing impact solid gains were seen in motor vehicles and computers electronics looking ahead headwinds should continue to plague the sector in the near term as concerns now center on supply chain disruptions emanating out of china as a result of the coronavirus outbreak the third theme highlights the steady yet tame performance of consumer inflation the consumer price index cpi rose 0 1 month over month in january taking the year over year pace up to 2 5 core cpi inflation remained steady at a 2 3 year over year pace for the fourth consecutive month suggesting that the underlying trend while in line with the fed s target is still not running at levels that would materially change its outlook as such we continue to expect the fed to remain on the sidelines for the foreseeable future so what does this all mean for the u s outlook on balance the u s economic data have broadly shown a more positive trend over the past few months and this week s indicator performance supports that trend that said gdp growth in q1 is nonetheless set for a slowdown to a 1 5 annualized pace as another sizeable drag from inventories alongside a modest drag from trade are poised to weigh on the pace of overall growth until there is a greater understanding of the magnitude of the economic impact the coronavirus poses downside risk to the outlook however our base case is that the virus does not become a full blown pandemic and that the short term u s economic impact is noticeable yet manageable as such we look for the u s economy to remain in expansion with real gdp increasing at a 2 0 pace this year u s outlook housing starts wednesday the seasonally adjusted january housing starts numbers will likely show a decline but only because the december numbers were boosted by unusually warm weather one of the warmest decembers on record saw non seasonally adjusted starts actually rise 3 2 activity typically falls sharply during winter months which translated into a 16 9 seasonally adjusted surge to a 1 61 millionunit pace the highest since december 2006 while weather boosted the level of starts above its trend that trend is undeniably strong we expect continued gains supported by elevated builder optimism rising price appreciation and solid consumer fundamentals what s more last month was the fifth warmest january on record meaning the seasonal adjustment may shoot the number above trend again the january jobs report already showed this effect with construction employment reportedly surging by 44 000 jobs previous 1 608k wells fargo 1 523k consensus 1 400k fomc meeting minutes wednesday the fed left rates on hold in january as was widely expected but markets now expect a cut before the end of the year with the fed making it clear that it needs to see a material change to the outlook we continue to think it will remain on the sidelines however the minutes will provide greater clarity on just how close committee members view various factors the coronavirus effect on domestic growth and persistent below target inflation for example come to being material the minutes may also expand on the fed s plan to wind down its t bill purchases we expect 60 billion per month until mid april falling to 30 billion by mid june and then a non predetermined amount going forward to match organic balance sheet growth the minutes will also reiterate that the committee views its balance sheet expansion as a technical measure to prevent dislocations in money markets rather than a form of stimulus leading economic index thursday the leading economic index lei should bounce back from negative territory in january aided by a strong month for equity markets the december reading was the first negative year over year print since november 2009 which led to some overly bearish headlines in our view the lei overweights manufacturing which had a particularly bad december as the ism manufacturing index fell to 47 2 the lowest since 2009 the ism in turn has also been overstating the extent of manufacturing weakness relative to hard data on orders and production therefore we would think the negative print last month was a false flag but the trend clearly is one of moderating growth for january specifically the ism manufacturing rebounded nicely to 50 9 indicating growth again after five straight contractionary readings we expect the lei rose 0 4 in january and will watch for coronavirus fears feeding through survey data in coming weeks previous 0 3 wells fargo 0 4 consensus 0 4 global review china near term outlook remains challenging a revision to diagnosis methodology led to a nearly 30 jump in new reported cases of coronavirus in china and while many of those cases are days or weeks old the revision only raises further questions over the extent to which china s economy will be affected by the outbreak still the country s top officials have been resolute that the country can still hit its 2020 gdp targets the eurozone is among the more exposed major developed economies bad news for its already struggling manufacturing sector especially in germany which is the most exposed to china of the eurozone s major economies markets still in the dark on full virus effect it was not a particularly busy week for global economic data and events and much of the attention remained on the fallout from the coronavirus chinese authorities abstained from the large liquidity injections they resorted to the prior week but remained resolute in their pledge to meet their growth target of around 6 for this year despite the significant economic disruption from the virus outbreak as a reminder we downgraded our china gdp outlook to 5 5 for full year 2020 while we look for growth of just 5 1 on a year over year basis in q1 2020 top chart new reports this week suggest that china had previously underreported the number of coronavirus cases by around 30 only adding to the downside risks for chinese economic growth and the growth of its key trading partners among the first official data of note that will provide insight into the extent of economic damage in china are the pmi figures for february scheduled for release on february 28 that said we will not receive hard data from china on february retail sales and industrial output until march 15 suggesting markets will remain largely in the dark on the full extent of any economic effect until then among the major developed economies the eurozone and particularly germany may be among the most exposed to weakness in chinese demand and are certainly much more exposed than the united states middle chart the eurozone factory sector was already struggling long before the virus outbreak and data this week confirmed that the weakness in the sector continued into december industrial output in the eurozone declined 2 1 during the month the sharpest decline since 2016 with broad based declines in all the region s largest economies meanwhile data showed that german real gdp was flat on a sequential basis in q4 suggesting the eurozone s largest economy carried little momentum into q1 even before the virus outbreak meanwhile in the united kingdom growth and activity data for q4 were hardly encouraging real gdp essentially stagnated during the quarter with consumer spending rising just 0 1 not annualized on a sequential basis and fixed investment spending declining 1 6 not annualized perhaps a bright spot in the data were signs that the economy picked up some momentum in december as services and manufacturing output both rose a healthy 0 3 during the month following sharp declines in november those figures bode well for the q1 gdp figure while solid january pmi data released a few weeks ago also suggest the u k economy likely bounced back into the new year on a separate but related note u k chancellor finance minister sajid javid stepped down this week raising hopes of more aggressive fiscal stimulus from the u k government another upside risk for u k economic growth in 2020 as we discuss in the global outlook section on the next page next week will be a big one for u k economic data particularly the retail sales figures for january the first hard data for the post election period and likely a key indicator for the bank of england boe officials as they decide whether stimulus is warranted global outlook canada cpi wednesday among the g7 central banks the bank of canada boc is arguably the most successful at present in achieving its inflation target indeed an average of three core inflation measures tracked by the boc is currently running just above the 2 target and averaged exactly 2 in full year 2019 that has likely been a major reason the boc has bucked the trend of global easing over the past year keeping rates steady throughout 2019 looking ahead we expect the boc will remain on hold throughout 2020 but that forecast is predicated on inflation remaining near the 2 target recent boc communications have been a bit more dovish and tilted the risks further toward easing and thus the central bank will likely be particularly sensitive to any downside surprises on inflation should they occur in addition to january cpi figures retail sales data for december are also slated for release next week previous 2 2 wells fargo 1 9 consensus 2 3 year over year u k retail sales thursday next week is a crucial one for u k economic data arguably most important will be retail sales for january as this will be the first significant piece of hard data released for the u k economy that entirely reflects activity after the december general election the boe has stated that it has refrained from easing policy because sentiment indicators have pointed to a post election bounce in activity but critically it noted that if the hard data did not confirm this bounce it may resort to rate cuts to support growth thus the boe may be particularly sensitive to any downside surprises in next week s retail sales figure also on the docket next week are employment figures for q4 cpi inflation for january and the february pmis all of which could be considered tier one data for the u k economy and will likely be closely watched

january suggest the economy remained sluggish at the start of q1 the question now is whether the manufacturing sector will finally start to gain more traction and catch up with its services counterpart or whether it will continue to languish and drag down services with it february pmi data will be crucial in that sense and we would note that there may be some downside risks to these figures given the outbreak of the coronavirus may have weighed on manufacturing sentiment in particular the eurozone economy and specifically the german economy is quite reliant on china as an export market and thus we may see further weakness in manufacturing sentiment in next week s release previous 47 9 and 52 5 consensus 47 4 and 52 3 manufacturing and services point of view interest rate watch sticking to the script it was a busy week on capitol hill when it came to fed testimony chair powell gave his semi annual testimony to congress his remarks echoed those of the most recent fomc meeting powell signaled rates were unlikely to be changed in the near term as policy was currently appropriate but the committee stood ready to adjust if there was a material change to the outlook including more widespread effects of the coronavirus hints that officials are increasingly willing to let inflation run above 2 for a time suggested that the fed s overall policy bias remains dovish a fully staffed board of governors also testifying this week were nominees to the board of governors christopher waller and judy shelton if both were to be confirmed the board of governors would be fully staffed for the first time since 2013 waller has served as the research director of the st louis fed for the past 11 years while considered mainstream his views fall on the dovish side of the spectrum having questioned traditional inflationary drivers like labor market slack notably however he has come out against the use of negative rates it appears likely his nomination will make it out of committee and he will eventually be confirmed less certain is shelton s confirmation shelton has advocated returning to the gold standard and questioned the existence and mandates of the central bank more recently she has advocated the central bank take explicit efforts to weaken the dollar shelton s confirmation would add to concerns about the fed s independence from political pressure over the past decade she has moved from hawkish views on inflation and interest rates to wanting to cut rates expeditiously while serving as an advisor to president trump a number of republican senators have expressed concerns putting her candidacy up in the air given the typical timeline between hearings and confirmations it will likely be months before the full senate takes up the vote if her nomination makes it out of the senate banking committee credit market insights mortgage originations soar the mortgage market ended a busy year with a 224 billion jump in new mortgage balances according to the new york fed s household debt and credit report this increase brought the total amount of mortgage originations for the quarter t0 752 billion the highest since 2005 see bottom chart home purchases have been picking up though refinances continue to drive the bulk of mortgage demand accounting for roughly 60 of mortgage applications in recent quarters despite the pick up in new mortgages credit quality has not appeared to deteriorate sixty four percent of the new mortgages in q4 went to borrowers with a credit score of 760 or better the highest share since 2000 when the series started tighter lending standards along with the healthy economy have also pushed down delinquency rates the mba s latest national delinquency survey reported a drop in the delinquency rate to 3 77 the lowest on record while these metrics highlight the financial health of homeowners debt growth over the past decade has come primarily from consumer credit delinquencies rates for student auto and credit card loans which comprise the bulk of consumer credit have drifted up in prior quarters although banks have responded by tightening standards for 2020 banks expect higher demand for credit card loans but lower demand for auto loans existing borrowers ability to keep current will like the rest of consumer spending largely depend on the continued resilience in the labor market topic of the week a primary primer in our preview of the iowa caucus and its economy we highlighted the fact that it resembles several swing states with its reliance on manufacturing 14 of employment well above the 8 national average and agriculture iowa is the second largest agricultural producer after california given this dual emphasis on globally exposed sectors iowa has been one of the most affected states by the trade war it is also one of the whitest states leading some to criticize its perennial spot at the front of the primary schedule new hampshire is the 41st smallest state with around 40 of its 1 4 million residents living in the greater boston area in addition to being 93 white it is also the second oldest state a demographic challenge which has resulted in sluggish labor force growth health care is its fastest growing sector while manufacturing 10 of payrolls has shed 1 200 jobs over the past year for comparison bernie sanders margin of victory over pete buttigieg was only 3 867 votes nevada is next in line and is the first primary state with a sizable non white population nevada was hit extremely hard by the housing bust and ensuing recession and did not recover all the jobs lost until the end of 2015 it is now growing rapidly however and has added 321 000 jobs since 2010 across a broader array of industries including logistics distribution health care and advanced manufacturing low taxes and business friendly regulations have boosted the professional business services and tech sectors which have also benefitted from an affordability migration out of california the influx of businesses has in turn spurred rapid population growth we will be publishing a preview of south carolina which has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country aided by its success attracting manufacturers and foreign direct investment its population is growing rapidly as job seekers and retirees move in but there are major differences between the state s largest metro areas and the surrounding rural areas three days after the south carolina primary brings super tuesday when voters in california utah colorado texas oklahoma minnesota arkansas alabama tennessee north carolina virginia massachusetts vermont and maine head to the polls these 14 states comprise 40 of the u s population and their economies run the gamut from rapidly growing to stagnant it is therefore difficult to assess the economic backdrop of these primaries but it may also be less necessary the primary schedule inherently overweights the first few states and the idiosyncrasies of their economies with momentum often compounding behind the candidate who nabs the early victories this dynamic will resurface in the general election which often comes down to just a few swing states indeed a key to trump s victory was his outperformance in some midwestern states which he was able to narrowly flip michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin were all decided by less than one percentage point but trump claimed all their electoral votes in other words while iowa new hampshire nevada and south carolina are disproportionately important for the nomination process other states will be disproportionately important for the general election in terms of the general election we have previously published 1 an overview 2 a primer on the leading candidates major proposals and 3 an outline of how those proposals might or might not be implemented

chapter 42 microeconomics and macroeconomics updated 4 13 20 praise the lord blessed is the man who obeys the lord who greatly delights in his commandments his descendants will be powerful on earth the descendants of the godly man will be blessed wealth and riches are in his house his righteousness will endure forever light shines in the darkness for the godly person he is gracious merciful and just it goes well for the man who deals graciously and lends money who conducts his affairs with honesty psalm 112 1 5 he fed you in the wilderness with manna that your ancestors had never known so that he might humble you and test you to do you good in the end but you may say in your heart my power and the might of my hand acquired all this wealth but you will call to mind the lord your god for it is he who gives you the power to get wealth that he may establish his covenant that he swore to your fathers as it is today it will happen that if you will forget the lord your god and walk after other gods worship them and reverence them i testify against you today that you will surely perish like the nations that the lord is making to perish before you so will you perish because you would not listen to the voice of the lord your god deuteronomy 8 16 20 analysis the bible teaches that there is a predictable cause and effect relationship between covenantal obedience and success including wealth ethics and economics are covenantally related this relationship applies to individuals and families it also applies to entire societies christian economics is therefore both microeconomic and macroeconomic it applies to individual decision making micro and corporate decision making macro this god imposed correlation between ethics and wealth is supposed to give hope to covenant keepers this is part of god s providential administration of the affairs of men it is an aspect of cosmic personalism this is reflected in the famous aphorism of benjamin franklin in the late 1700s honesty is the best policy the new testament makes it clear that this covenantal structure of ethical effects in history is dominant the positive sanctions of individual covenantal faithfulness accumulate into the hands of covenant keepers this is the basis of paul s optimistic eschatology regarding history doctrine of last things then will be the end when christ will hand over the kingdom to god the father this is when he will abolish all rule and all authority and power for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet the last enemy to be destroyed is death for he has put everything under his feet but when it says he has put everything it is clear that this does not include the one who put everything in subjection to himself when all things are subjected to him then the son himself will be subjected to him who put all things into subjection under him that god may be all in all i corinthians 15 24 28 the language is clear there will be a corporate victory of christendom in history this victory is not restricted to individuals neither was the original dominion covenant to adam restricted to individuals in the great commission we are given the theological foundation of this joint dominion the doctrine of the trinity god is a single god made up of three persons father son and holy ghost matthew 28 18 20 the dominion covenant will be extended in history this fulfillment will not be perfect that is because sin exists in history it will not be fulfilled in the new heaven and new earth that is because god is infinite and the creation reflects god man will never have exhaustive knowledge the extension of the dominion covenant is therefore eternal but there is a temporal dividing line between history and eternity that dividing line is the last judgment individuals participate in this program of kingdom extension during their lifetimes their covenantal heirs will also participate individuals live and die but the kingdom of god does not die individuals are told to seek first the kingdom of god and all things will be added to them matthew 6 33 but this inheritance is also corporate it will eventually be transferred to christ who will in turn transfer it to god the father that is the message of i corinthians 15 there is covenantal consistency between ethics based individual success and ethics based corporate success this means that there is consistency between ethics based microeconomics and ethics based macroeconomics it is a conceptual error to separate microeconomics from macroeconomics methodological individualists are microeconomists the most consistent of them deny the conceptual legitimacy of macroeconomics in contrast methodological holists deny the conceptual legitimacy of microeconomics methodological covenantalism affirms both but only on this assumption the trinity which is both one and many autonomous man refuses to accept the biblical covenant as the means by which god structures the economy he therefore cannot reconcile logically methodological individualism and methodological holism microeconomics and macroeconomics remain in conflict they may appear as separate sections of a college level textbook but these sections are taught as separate one semester courses a the dualism of micro and macro analyses this has been a continuing debate going back to classical economics 1 adam smith vs karl marx in the wealth of nations 1776 adam smith argued that the basis of increasing national wealth is the free market which is the product of what he called the natural system of liberty he did not speak of ethics either personal or corporate as the foundation of wealth but he did in his earlier book theory of moral sentiments 1759 this book has had no impact on economic theory economists have never relied on the ethical analysis in the 1759 book to explain the economic logic of the 1776 book they have built their defenses of the free market in terms of a hypothetical ethical neutrality socialists and defenders of the welfare state have long complained that smith made a conceptual error he explained the economic success of nations in terms of the economic successes of individuals this is an illegitimate argument critics said it is not possible conceptually to go from individual successes to national success there is no cause and effect connection between the successes of individuals and the success of a nation karl marx argued that the profits of the rich come at the expense of the poor a theory of exploitation he argued that this would lead to an inevitable proletarian revolution in industrialized nations the laws of profit that apply to one segment of the economy do not apply to the whole his was an early version of the distinction between microeconomics and macroeconomics i must now deal with economic theory as it has been taught in universities beginning in 1948 this focus is unfortunate in a book that i hope will still be read in a century or even longer this discussion dates this book i do not think that the keynesian approach to economic theory will maintain its grip on economists a half century from now other interpretations of economic theory will replace it its fundamental error is that it is committed to methodological holism or collectivism although not to the degree that socialist economics was socialists preached the state s ownership of the means of production that intellectual tradition is now defunct the visible failure of the communist economic experiment in mainland china 1948 1978 and its replacement with a government regulated system of private ownership beginning in 1979 produced the fastest rate of economic growth in a large nation in history the subsequent failure of the soviet economy in the late 1980s and the replacement of soviet union by the russian federation in december 1991 ended the appeal of socialism for most economists that left keynesianism as the dominant heir to the tradition of methodological holism this is called macroeconomics 2 keynes and samuelson academic economics distinguishes between microeconomics and macroeconomics this distinction is built into christian economics it is the implication of the doctrine of the trinity academic economics did not clearly make the distinction between macroeconomics and microeconomics until the era of the great depression the 1930s the first economist to use the term macroeconomics was a norwegian ragnar frisch in 1933 the concept is usually associated with the work of john maynard keynes beginning with his book the general theory of employment interest and money 1936 the concept did not begin to gain wide acceptance in academia until the fall of 1948 the publication date of what soon became the most widely assigned college textbook in the united states paul samuelson s economics economics as taught in college textbooks today is overwhelmingly keynesian the few textbooks that are not keynesian do not show students why keynesianism is incorrect they remain silent keynesianism teaches that economists who advise politicians and central bankers can devise scientifically valid policies that will avoid national recessions this is not central planning according to socialism where the state owns the means of production rather it is central planning in the form of specific kinds of economic incentives these incentives are provided by the national government s policies of spending more money than it collects through taxation i e borrowing from the private capital markets and also by the expansion of the monetary base of the nation s central bank when it purchases the debts of the national government with newly created fiat money keynesian theory depends on an unstated assumption that politicians actually pay attention to the specific policy recommendations of economists there is little historical evidence that politicians adopt specific spending and taxing policies in terms of advice from economists they adopt spending and taxing policies in terms of getting re elected thus causation is reversed in macroeconomic theory politicians make spending decisions in terms of specific budget expenditures when these decisions produce a government deficit as they usually do a few incumbent national politicians feel the need to justify their corporate spending decisions they invite a few keynesian economists to testify publicly in favor of the politicians deficit spending policy these economists vocally support the politicians policies and thereby they indirectly support the politicians re election campaigns this practice began in the 1930s western national governments ran huge deficits beginning in 1931 keynes famous book published in 1936 offered an arcane theoretical justification for these policies he gained the support of british politicians and also a hard core of younger economists the following explanation is not a scientific one it is surely not one found in any college textbook on economics nevertheless it will help you understand the relationship between microeconomics and macroeconomics in civil government this will in turn help you to understand the relationship between microeconomics and macroeconomics in economic theory imagine a group of people who agree to the following arrangement each of them is given a credit card there are no limits on individual spending at the end of the year the total bill of all the cards macroeconomics will be paid for in equal shares by each credit card holder microeconomics in this arrangement there is no economic incentive for anyone to reduce his spending every participant s goal is to spend more than his share of the bill every participant tries to outspend each of the others therefore the total bill macroeconomics is larger at the end of the year than it would have been if each participant had been required to pay all of his own bill but none of the others bills microeconomics now apply this logic to the spending policies of politicians this is why national governments deficits never end as long as interest rates on government bonds do not rise politicians prefer to have the government borrow money from the capital markets which most voters ignore rather than pay for all of the government s expenses through taxation which taxpayers resent and may decide to resist politically at the next election keynesian economic theory would not have been plausible prior to world war i peacetime government spending was a small percentage of any national economy this was because the taxation powers were limited by law therefore running a deficit in a government s budget would have had no politically manageable effect on any national economy taxes were low spending was low in 1911 three years before world war i began great britain established an income tax in 1913 in the united states the constitution was amended in order to allow an income tax within months after the war began in august 1914 taxes were raised in great britain but most of the war s expense was funded by government borrowing not taxation rising taxes took place in the united states as soon as the united states entered the war in 1917 rates of income taxation on the rich rose to unprecedented levels around 70 during world war i european nations funded the war by massive increases of income taxation and massive expansions of fiat money by the respective national central banks the war established a triple precedent of high taxation high borrowing and central bank monetary expansion this triple precedent was never abandoned it remains dominant in the world today 3 irreconcilable approaches a major problem with microeconomics and macroeconomics as taught in the textbooks is this they cannot be reconciled microeconomics begins with individual purposes and decisions this is methodological individualism mises was adamant in his rejection of methodological collectivism he wrote this in his book on epistemology the ultimate foundation of economic science 1962 in studying the actions of individuals we learn also everything about the collectives and society for the collective has no existence and reality but in the actions of individuals it comes into existence by ideas that move individuals to behave as members of a definite group and goes out of existence when the persuasive power of these ideas subsides the only way to a cognition of collectives is the analysis of the conduct of its members p 81 he referred to the mythology of methodological collectivism this perspective is the logical outcome of all forms of nominalism nominalism begins with the individual it ends with the individual there is no way to add up objective economic value given the premises of nominalism there is no such thing as objective economic value given the premises of nominalism mises was a philosophical nominalist so was carl menger the founder of the austrian school in contrast macroeconomics treats the national economy as a separate autonomous force on the first page of the preface of the first edition 1948 of his economics textbook keynesian paul samuelson wrote this national income provides the central unifying theme of the book his analysis was based on methodological collectivism these are rival concepts of economic causation they lead to rival policies of government intervention this conceptual separation is a stumbling block in modern economic thought is not some minor academic issue it lies at the very heart of the rival views of the economy that are held by keynesians and austrian school economists the other schools of economics can be found somewhere in between austrianism and keynesianism in first year college courses in economics one semester is devoted to microeconomics the other semester is devoted to macroeconomics students are allowed to take either course first that is because there is no logical connection between the two courses they really are separate academic enterprises you do not learn microeconomics by studying macroeconomics and you do not learn macroeconomics by studying microeconomics this is an operational academic schizophrenia in modern economic theory textbooks attempt to paper over this schizophrenia students wind up either confused or taking sides most of them take sides with keynesian economics because this is the dominant outlook of most of the textbooks never really understanding the logic of keynesianism and unable to remember the formulas most first year students retain a political proclivity for deficit spending but this not an outlook based on comprehension keynesianism accepts the free market for the bulk of economic production and exchange keynesians insist however that the market s pricing system is insufficient to avoid economic recessions in order to avoid recessions central planners meaning politicians who do not actually plan anything except their re election campaigns supposedly must expand government spending most politicians applaud this advice keynesianism was invented overnight in 1936 this was at least six years into the great depression when the entire western world had already adopted the policies that keynes recommended deficit spending and central bank monetary expansion keynesianism was a belated academic justification for interventionist policies that had already been adopted by national governments throughout the west that remains its function today policy justification not policy formation there is no scientific budgetary planning at the national level politicians simply spend as much money as they can to support projects that will keep people in their districts employed there is nothing scientific about this there has never been anything scientific about this keynesianism provides the fig leaf of what is said to be science to justify increased spending by national governments 4 three hypothetical ifs keynesianism rests on three ifs these ifs apply to what keynes said his theory could accomplish if governments would adopt them as if governments had not universally adopted them over half a decade earlier with few positive results in overcoming the great depression he ignored this background as do his disciples in chapter 24 the concluding notes of the general theory he wrote this i highlight the ifs our criticism of the accepted classical theory of economics has consisted not so much in finding logical flaws in its analysis as in pointing out that its tacit assumptions are seldom or never satisfied with the result that it cannot solve the economic problems of the actual world but if our central controls succeed in establishing an aggregate volume of output corresponding to full employment as nearly as is practicable the classical theory comes into its own again from this point onwards if we suppose the volume of output to be given i e to be determined by forces outside the classical scheme of thought then there is no objection to be raised against the classical analysis of the manner in which private self interest will determine what in particular is produced in what proportions the factors of production will be combined to produce it and how the value of the final product will be distributed between them again if we have dealt otherwise with the problem of thrift there is no objection to be raised against the modern classical theory as to the degree of consilience between private and public advantage in conditions of perfect and imperfect competition respectively thus apart from the necessity of central controls to bring about an adjustment between the propensity to consume and the inducement to invest there is no more reason to socialise economic life than there was before pp 378 79 these three ifs are the theoretical foundations on which mainstream academic economic theory rests its case they are hopes regarding the wisdom of central planners and also the wisdom of politicians who will take the advice of the central planners but economic recessions still come despite the dominance of keynesianism in academic institutions and government agencies also price inflation never goes away for central banks never go away b reconciliation as i have already written reconciliation is found theologically in the doctrine of the trinity the bible s ethical and judicial policies favor the free market social order they are the basis of collective prosperity the clearest statement of this is found in deuteronomy 8 moses announced he fed you in the wilderness with manna that your ancestors had never known so that he might humble you and test you to do you good in the end but you may say in your heart my power and the might of my hand acquired all this wealth but you will call to mind the lord your god for it is he who gives you the power to get wealth that he may establish his covenant that he swore to your fathers as it is today deuteronomy 8 16 18 the positive and negative sanctions that are found in leviticus 26 and deuteronomy 28 apply to individuals and the nation the covenant applied to individuals and the nation the nation had sworn allegiance to this covenant in exodus 19 immediately thereafter god announced the ten commandments exodus 20 then he announced the case law applications of the ten commandments exodus 21 35 these laws are detailed my comments on them fill two volumes of my commentary on exodus authority and dominion as a trinitarian i affirm the moral and judicial legitimacy of both the one and the many i therefore affirm the moral and ethical legitimacy of both macroeconomics and microeconomics but the macroeconomics that the bible affirms is not the macroeconomics of keynesian economists keynesian economists believe that the national civil government should intervene into the affairs of the market in order to thwart the outcomes of the voluntary market process keynesian macroeconomics is a form of central economic planning keynes admitted this in the foreword to the german language edition of the general theory which targeted german economists living in hitler s germany this would have included economic advisors to the national government and the central bank the theory of aggregated production which is the point of the following book nevertheless can be much easier adapted to the conditions of a totalitarian state than the theory of production and distribution of a given production put forth under conditions of free competition and a large degree of laissez faire this is one of the reasons that justifies the fact that i call my theory a general theory since it is based on fewer hypotheses than the orthodox theory it can accommodate itself all the easier to a wider field of varying conditions although i have after all worked it out with a view to the conditions prevailing in the anglo saxon countries where a large degree of laissez faire still prevails nevertheless it remains applicable to situations in which state management is more pronounced the bible does not affirm either the legitimacy or the efficacy of central economic planning the macroeconomics of the bible affirms the existence of positive and negative economic corporate sanctions in history that come as a result of widespread individual allegiance or disobedience to the economic laws that god has established with respect to property personal responsibility legal liability and ethics there is no evidence of central economic planning in the mosaic law or the new testament s laws the main example of central economic planning in the old testament comes from joseph in egypt joseph used the famine to make permanent bondservants of the egyptians to the pharaoh he saved their lives but only at the cost of their freedom this was god s judgment against egypt and joseph was the enforcer i call my position methodological covenantalism i distinguish it from both methodological individualism and methodological holism collectivism my position is not based on the autonomy of the individual human imputer or the autonomy of the representative imputers who act as agents of the national government the bible does not affirm that the central government has any legitimate authority to plan the economic outcomes of individual owners non violent and non fraudulent use of their property civil government is required by god to enforce a few laws against violence theft slander accidental damage and fraud dishonest weights and measures the outcome of such enforcement will be god s blessing in the form of national economic growth moses wrote if you listen carefully to the voice of the lord your god so as to keep all his commandments that i am commanding you today the lord your god will set you above all the other nations of the earth all these blessings will come on you and overtake you if you listen to the voice of the lord your god blessed will you be in the city and blessed will you be in the field blessed will be the fruit of your body and the fruit of your ground and the fruit of your beasts the increase of your cattle and the young of your flock blessed will be your basket and your kneading trough blessed will you be when you come in and blessed will you be when you go out deuteronomy 28 1 6 this is why it is possible to measure national economic growth this is why statistical aggregation is possible if it were not possible then it would be impossible to assess whether a nation is advancing economically economists proclaim the legitimacy and desirability of economic growth but this assumes that there is some way to aggregate prices in such a way that the aggregation will reflect either national economic prosperity or national economic recession such techniques exist sampling and data correlation conclusion people do have an awareness of whether their economy is getting richer or getting poorer people who lived during the great depression were well aware that the world economy was in a massive slump unemployment rose bankruptcies rose there were signs all around of economic malaise these negative economic factors were measured statistically by governments during this era this was the era in which such measurements became more sophisticated this was also the era in which macroeconomics first began to be developed as a separate academic subdiscipline of economic theory the statistical aggregates confirmed the widespread subjective evaluation of millions of citizens people believed the economy was in a slump and they were correct this does not justify governments collection of economic data the collection of past data provides the illusion that government bureaucrats can somehow wisely guide the future economy by means of widespread government interventions in contrast there is nothing illegitimate about the use of privately collected data to gain an assessment of the economic performance of the nation these data may also confirm the biblical idea that god s benefits for individuals are also benefits for collectives the fact that the free market enables individuals to prosper is an argument in favor of the free market s benefits to the nation the national one and the market s many are in agreement the visible success and the statistical success of the free market in the final third of the twentieth century plus the first two decades of china s economic growth in the twenty first century have silenced socialist critics everywhere the economic success of the market order has been demonstrated around the world nevertheless it is not illegitimate for humanistic defenders of the free market to use such statistics as evidence against socialist central planning pure nominalism denies this but pure nominalism is conceptually incorrect regarding collectives pure nominalism is the philosophy of polytheism it insists that there is no unified god who imputes value including economic value to collectives ___________________________ the full manuscript is posted here

and its subsidiaries all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation the unaudited interim financial information as of december 31 2019 and for the nine months ended december 31 2019 and 2018 have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission the sec certain information and footnote disclosures which are

segments the company s chief executive officer is the chief operating decision maker codm the codm bears ultimate responsibility for and is actively engaged in the allocation of resources and the evaluation of the company s operating and financial results 4 summary of significant accounting policies significant accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u s gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period the company s critical accounting estimates included but are not limited to allowance for estimated uncollectible receivables inventory valuations allowance for deferred tax assets lease assumptions impairment of long lived assets impairment of intangible assets and income taxes actual results could differ from those estimates accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of uncollected amounts from customer purchases primarily from the company s two distribution operations credit card receivables and food stamp vouchers and are presented net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts the company periodically assesses its accounts receivable for collectability on a specific identification basis if collectability of an account becomes unlikely an allowance is recorded for that doubtful account once collection efforts have been exhausted the account receivable is written off against the allowance inventories inventories consist of merchandise purchased for resale which are stated at the lower of cost or market the cost method is used for wholesale and retail perishable inventories by assigning costs to each of these items based on a first in first out fifo basis net of vendor discounts the company s wholesale and retail non perishable inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market using weighted average method leases on april 1 2019 the company adopted accounting standards update asu 2016 02 for all leases that were entered into prior to the effective date of asc 842 we elected to apply the package of practical expedients based on this guidance we will not reassess the following 1 whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases 2 the lease classification for any expired or existing leases and 3 initial direct costs for any existing leases the adoption of topic 842 resulted in the presentation of 59 839 700 of operating lease assets and 66 554 892 operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2019 see note 12 for additional information the company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception operating leases are included in operating lease right of use rou assets current portion of obligations under operating leases and obligations under operating leases non current on the company s consolidated balance sheets finance leases are included in property and equipment net current portion of obligations under capital leases and obligations under capital leases non current on our consolidated balance sheets 7 operating lease rou assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date adjusted by the deferred rent liabilities at the adoption date as most of the company s leases do not provide an implicit rate the company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments the operating lease rou asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred the company s terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise that option lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term deferred financing costs the company presents deferred financing costs as a reduction of the carrying amount of the debt rather than as an asset deferred financing costs are amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method and reported as interest expense in the consolidated financial statements fair value measurements the company records its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the framework for measuring fair value in accordance with u s gaap this framework establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value level 1 quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets level 2 quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets level 3 valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and non financial liabilities are primarily used in the impairment analysis of intangible assets and long lived assets cash and cash equivalents restricted cash accounts receivable prepaid expenses and other current assets advances to related parties accounts payable deferred revenue and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments based on comparable open market transactions the fair value of the lines of credit and other liabilities including current maturities approximated their carrying value as of december 31 2019and march 31 2019 respectively the company s estimates of the fair value of line of credit and other liabilities including current maturities were classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy revenue recognition in accordance with topic 606 revenue is recognized at the time the sale is made at which time our walk in customers take immediate possession of the merchandise or delivery is made to our wholesale customers payment terms are established for our wholesale customers based on the company s pre established credit requirements payment terms vary depending on the customer based on the nature of receivables no significant financing components exist sales are recorded net of discounts sales incentives and rebates sales taxes and estimated returns and allowances we estimate the reduction to sales and cost of sales for returns based on current sales levels and our historical return experience topic 606 defines a performance obligation as a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is considered the unit of account the majority of our contracts have one single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual goods is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and is therefore not distinct 8 we had no material contract assets contract liabilities or costs to obtain and fulfill contracts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2019 and march 31 2019 for the nine months ended december 31 2019 and 2018 revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods were 802 392 and 326 459 respectively revenue expected to be recognized in any future periods related to remaining performance obligations is insignificant the

supermarket inc ming s supermarket inc ming the subsidiary of the company is a tenant at a building located at 140 148 east berkeley street boston ma the property pursuant to a lease dated september 24 1999 the lease the lease had a 10 year initial term followed by an option for two additional 10 year terms ming has exercised that first option and the lease has approximately 15 years remaining to run if the second option is also exercised the lease also gives ming a right of first refusal on any sale of the building on february 22 2015 a sprinkler pipe burst in the property this caused the inspectional services department of the city of boston isd to inspect the property the isd found a number of problems which have prevented further use of the property the isd notified both landlord and tenant that the property was only permitted for use as an elevator garage and that its use as a warehouse was never permitted and that a conditional use permit must be obtained from the city of boston to make such use lawful moreover the property was found to have major structural issues requiring repair as well as issues with the elevator and outside glass the result of the isd s findings are that ming was ordered not to use the property for any purpose unless and until the structural and other repairs are completed and its use as a warehouse is permitted by the boston zoning board while the lease provides that the elevator approximate cost 400 000 and glass repairs approximate cost 30 000 are the responsibility of the tenant the structural repairs approximate cost 500 000 are the landlord s responsibility under the lease unless the structural damage was caused by the tenant s misuse of the property in this regard ming has retained an expert who testified the structural damage to the building was caused by long term water infiltration and is not the result of anything ming did ming initially sought for the landlord to perform the structural repairs and agreed that upon completion of those repairs ming would repair the elevator and the broken glass in addition ming asked the landlord to cooperate in permitting use of the property as a warehouse 21 the landlord refused to either perform structural repairs or to cooperate on the permitting as a result as of april 2015 ming began withholding rent since ming was barred from using the property by order of the isd the landlord then sued ming for breach of the lease and unpaid rent and ming counterclaimed for constructive eviction and for damages resulting from the landlord s breach of its duty to perform structural repairs under the lease the case was tried before a jury in august 2017 the jury awarded ming judgment against the landlord in the amount of 795 000 plus continuing damages of 2 250 per month until the structural repairs are completed the court found that the landlord s actions violated the massachusetts unfair and deceptive acts and practices statute and therefore doubled the amount

markets and two wholesale facilities ifresh plans to strategically expand along the i 95 corridor and its goal is to cover all states on the east coast ifresh provides unique products to meet the demands of the asian chinese american market ifresh has established a merchandising system backed by an in house wholesale business and by long standing relationships with farms ifresh maintains an in house cooling system with unique hibernation technology that is has developed over 20 years to preserve perishables especially produce and seafood ifresh capitalizes on economies of scale allowing strong negotiating power with upstream vendors downstream customers and sizable competitors and ifresh has a proven and replicable track record of management operation acquisition and organic growth ifresh s net sales were 66 6 million and 92 7 million for the nine months ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively in terms of sales by category perishables constituted approximately 58 of the total sales for the nine months ended december 31 2019 ifresh s net loss was 6 3 million for the nine months ended december 31 2019 a decrease of 1 5 million or 19 4 from 7 8 million of net loss for the nine months ended december 31 2018 adjusted ebitda was 3 1 million for the nine months ended december 31 2019 a decrease of 1 8 million or 36 3 from 4 9 million for the nine months ended december

transaction and the company s receipt of a valuation opinion demonstrating that the fair market value of the interest is equal to or greater than the aggregate fair market value of the consideration to be paid by the company factors affecting ifresh s operating results seasonality ifresh s business shows seasonal fluctuations sales in its first and second fiscal quarters ending june 30 and september 30 respectively are usually 5 to 10 lower than in third and fourth quarters ending december 31 and march 31 respectively in its third fiscal quarter customers make holiday purchases for thanksgiving and christmas in its fourth quarter customers make purchases for traditional chinese holidays such as the spring festival chinese new year in january or february competition the company faces competition from other asian supermarkets in the fiscal year 2019 two of our stores located in boston and new york experienced significantly decreased sales due to competition from newly opened grocery stores in first quarter of fiscal year 2020 the company contracted these two stores to third party to operate and are collecting contracting fees the gross margin was low in these stores since the company s distribution center in new york area could not lower the purchase cost of the stores in ma the company s retail sales decreased significantly due to the change of operations of these two stores 26 payroll minimum wage rates in some states increased for example the minimum wage rose from 13 to 15 per hour in new york city payroll and related expenses decreased by 1 2 million or 7 7 for the year ended march 31 2019 compared the year ended march 31 2018 due to close of one store and change of operations in 2 stores in ma see discussion in net sales section below payroll and related expenses decreased by 2 5 million or 24 for the nine months ended december 31 2019 as compared to the same period of last year as a result of workforce reduction to reduce costs vendor and supply management ifresh believes that a centralized and efficient vendor and supply management system are the keys to profitability ifresh operates its own wholesale facilities which supplied about 19 6 and 12 8 of its procurement for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 and nine months ended december 31 2019 respectively ifresh believes that its centralized vendor management enhances ifresh s negotiating power and improves its ability to turnover inventory and vendor payables any changes to the vendor and supply management could affect ifresh s purchasing costs and operating expenses starting from q4 of fiscal year 2019 the company s wholesale business gradually slows down and the retail stores are heavily relied on third party vendors for inventory supplies instead of centralized supply system store maintenance and renovation from time to time ifresh conducts maintenance on the fixtures and equipment for its stores any maintenance or renovations could interrupt the operation of our stores and result in a decline of customer volume and therefore sales volume but will in the opinion of management boost sales after they are completed significant maintenance or renovation would affect our operation and operating results as of december 31 2019 two ifresh stores are under renovation and have not opened yet ifresh incurred 449 948 in expenses for these stores for the year ended march 31 2019 one store was under renovation for 10 months in the year of 2019 and incurred 871 709 in expense because these stores are being renovated sales are affected store acquisitions and openings ifresh expects the new stores it acquires or opens to be the primary driver of its sales operating profit and market share gains ifresh s results will be materially affected by the timing and number of new store additions and the amount of new store opening costs for example ifresh would incur rental utilities and employee expenses during any period of renovation which would be recorded as expenses on the income statement and would decrease ifresh s profit when a store opens ifresh may incur higher than normal employee costs associated with setup hiring training and other costs related to opening a new store operating margins are also affected by promotional discounts and other marketing costs and strategies associated with new store openings primarily due to overstocking and costs related to hiring and training new employees additionally promotional activities may result in higher than normal net sales in the first several weeks following a new store opening a new store builds its sales volume and its customer base over time and as a result generally has lower margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores a new store could take more than a year to achieve a level of operating performance comparable to our existing stores 27 how to assess ifresh s performance in assessing performance ifresh s management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including principal growth in net sales gross profit and adjusted ebitda the key measures that we use to evaluate the performance of our business are set forth below net sales ifresh s net sales comprise gross sales net of coupons and discounts we do not record sales taxes as a component of retail revenues as it considers it a pass through conduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes gross profit ifresh calculates gross profit as net sales less cost of sales and occupancy costs gross margin represents gross profit as a percentage of its net sales occupancy costs include store rental costs and property taxes the components of our cost of sales and occupancy costs may not be identical to those of its competitors as a result our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors cost of sales includes the cost of inventory sold during the period including the direct costs of purchased merchandise net of discounts and allowances distribution and supply chain costs buying costs and supplies ifresh recognizes vendor allowances and merchandise volume related rebate allowances as a reduction of inventories during the period when earned and reflects the allowances as a component of cost of sales as the inventory is sold shipping and handling for inventories purchased are included in cost of goods sold selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses primarily consist of retail operational expenses administrative salaries and benefits costs marketing advertising and corporate overhead adjusted ebitda ifresh believes that adjusted ebitda is a useful performance measure and can be used to facilitate a comparison of nym s operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than gaap measures alone can provide ifresh also uses adjusted ebitda as one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expected performance and for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations and as a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain compensation programs and plans for employees including senior executives other companies in the industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than ifresh does limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure ifresh s management defines adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization expense store opening costs and non recurring expenses all of the omitted items are either i non cash items or ii items that we do not consider in assessing its ongoing operating performance because it omits non cash items ifresh s management believes that adjusted ebitda is less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation amortization and other non cash charges and more reflective of other factors that affect its operating performance ifresh s management believes that the use of these non gaap financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the company s financial measures with other specialty retailers many of which present similar non gaap financial measures to investors 28 results of operations for the nine months ended december 31 2019 and 2018 for the nine months ended december 31 changes 2019 2018 net sales third parties 65 005 079

december 31 2018 net retail sales to third parties decreased by 24 4 million or 31 from 78 7 million for the nine months ended december 31 2018 to 54 3 million for the nine months ended december 31 2019 the decrease resulted mainly from our quincy zen store and boston ming store massachusetts stores ming and zen contributed 16 2 million of retail sales for the nine months ended december 31 2018 starting from the fiscal year 2019 these two stores experienced significantly decreased sales due to competition from newly opened grocery stores on april 1 2019 the company entered into an agreement for the two stores with third parties to operate those stores and the company is collecting management fees from the third parties management fees are 40 000 per month for the first six months and 50 000 after the first six months and the term of the agreements is 36 months in addition the company bills the other party for rent and utilities expense incurred and the other party will be responsible for payroll and employee benefits the company sold all inventory at net book value of 1 5 million but retains ownership of all property and equipment the depreciation and amortization expense were approximately 420 000 for the nine months ended december 31 2019 in addition sales from our stores in new york city decreased by 8 9 million because 1 we closed store in avenue u2 in early september which contributed 5 8 million of sales for the nine months ended december 31 2018 compared to 2 9 million of sales for the nine months ended december 31 2019 2 we contracted part of vegetables and fruits business to third parties in our store to improve our margin our total net wholesale sales decreased by 1 7 million from 13 9 million for the nine months ended december 31 2018 to 12 3 million for the nine months ended december 31 2019 attributable that our sales to related parties decreased by 1 6 million from the nine months ended december 31 2018 to the nine months ended december 31 2019 attributable to that new york mart group inc is going out of business 29 cost of sales occupancy costs and gross profit for the nine months ended retail segment december 31 changes 2019 2018 cost of

of sales decreased by 20 4 million from 58 9 million for the nine months ended december 31 2018 to 38 5 million for the nine months ended december 31 2019 the decrease was consistent with the decreased sales and mainly due to changes we made to ming and zen store in ma and close of store in avenue u2 mentioned above costs decreased by 34 6 compared to a sales decrease of 31 leading to a higher margin which was calculated before adding the occupancy cost to the total cost this is expected when the strategic decision was made to contract the stores to third parties to operate occupancy costs consist of store level expenses such as rental expenses property taxes and other store specific costs occupancy costs decreased by approximately 1 1 million which was mainly attributable to the decreased rent from ming and zen stores which are operated by third parties as mentioned above and cancellation of one of the lease signed between new york market group with the company s affiliates since new york market group is going out of business gross profit was 10 8 and 13 7 million for the nine months ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively gross margin was 19 9 and 17 4 for the nine months ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the gross margin for the nine months ended december 31 2018 was lower than usual is because in the last summer our retail stores increased purchases from local farms instead of purchasing directly from our wholesalers which increased our cost of sales for the nine months ended wholesale segment december 31 changes 2019 2018 cost of sales 9 213 881

million or 12 from 10 5 million for the nine months ended december 31 2018 to 9 2 million for the nine months ended december 31 2019 the decrease is consistent with the significant decrease of sales from the wholesale segment in 2019 gross profit for the nine months ended december 31 2019 decreased by around 423 000 or 12 2 from 3 5 million for the nine months ended december 31 2018 to 3 1

million for the nine months ended december 31 2019 a decrease of 4 6 million or 18 6 compared to 24 6 million for the nine months ended december 31 2018 which was mainly attributable to the 3 5 million expense decrease from two stores in ma since we contracted these two stores in ma and we do not operate these two stores ourselves as well as close down of one store in new york city in addition one of our wholesale company is going out of business and selling general and administrative expenses decreased by 1 2 million interest expense interest expense was 1 3 million for the nine months ended december 31 2019 an increase of 0 3 million or 28 3 from 1 0 million for the nine months ended december 31 2018 attributable to the increased average outstanding loan balance from 19 4

5 6 million of retail sales for the three months ended december 31 2018 starting from the fiscal year 2019 these two stores experienced significantly decreased sales due to competition from newly opened grocery stores on april 1 2019 the company entered into an agreement for the two stores with third parties to operate those stores and the company is collecting management fees from the third

u s review overarching economic themes remain in place retail sales increased for a fourth straight month in january underscoring the resiliency of the u s consumer fundamentals are solid and support our expectations for healthy consumer spending gains in coming months the industrial sector remains challenged however as total production declined for the fourth time over the past five months the u s economy remains firmly on its expansion path yet we are mindful of the risks to the outlook including the ongoing coronavirus threat amid what should be a soft start we look for u s real gdp to increase 2 0 this year mildly easing momentum as coronavirus hits as the ongoing coronavirus outbreak understandably continues to capture financial markets attention this week offered a wideranging release of instructive economic indicators that continue to extend overarching themes we have seen in the overall economy in recent months the first theme highlights the primary strength of the ongoing economic expansion the resilient u s consumer retail sales increased for the fourth consecutive month in january up 0 3 spending gains were broad based as nine of the 13 major categories increased on the month led by building materials and eating drinking establishments not all was rosy however as control group sales which feed directly into personal consumption in the gdp report remained flat weighed down by a 3 1 drop in clothing that said the consumer remains in good shape at the start of the year resilient hiring gains and solid wage growth have buoyed consumer sentiment and spending while the coronavirus presents a risk we look for this consumer resilience to continue with spending increasing at a healthy 2 5 pace in q1 the second theme highlights the ongoing struggles in the industrial sector industrial production fell 0 3 month overmonth in january marking the fourth decline over the past five months mining rose 1 2 while unseasonably mild winter weather resulted in utilities plunging for the second straight month manufacturing output fell 0 1 largely due to a 10 7 drop in aircraft parts a result of the boeing 737 max production shutdown outside of the boeing impact solid gains were seen in motor vehicles and computers electronics looking ahead headwinds should continue to plague the sector in the near term as concerns now center on supply chain disruptions emanating out of china as a result of the coronavirus outbreak the third theme highlights the steady yet tame performance of consumer inflation the consumer price index cpi rose 0 1 month over month in january taking the year over year pace up to 2 5 core cpi inflation remained steady at a 2 3 year over year pace for the fourth consecutive month suggesting that the underlying trend while in line with the fed s target is still not running at levels that would materially change its outlook as such we continue to expect the fed to remain on the sidelines for the foreseeable future so what does this all mean for the u s outlook on balance the u s economic data have broadly shown a more positive trend over the past few months and this week s indicator performance supports that trend that said gdp growth in q1 is nonetheless set for a slowdown to a 1 5 annualized pace as another sizeable drag from inventories alongside a modest drag from trade are poised to weigh on the pace of overall growth until there is a greater understanding of the magnitude of the economic impact the coronavirus poses downside risk to the outlook however our base case is that the virus does not become a full blown pandemic and that the short term u s economic impact is noticeable yet manageable as such we look for the u s economy to remain in expansion with real gdp increasing at a 2 0 pace this year u s outlook housing starts wednesday the seasonally adjusted january housing starts numbers will likely show a decline but only because the december numbers were boosted by unusually warm weather one of the warmest decembers on record saw non seasonally adjusted starts actually rise 3 2 activity typically falls sharply during winter months which translated into a 16 9 seasonally adjusted surge to a 1 61 millionunit pace the highest since december 2006 while weather boosted the level of starts above its trend that trend is undeniably strong we expect continued gains supported by elevated builder optimism rising price appreciation and solid consumer fundamentals what s more last month was the fifth warmest january on record meaning the seasonal adjustment may shoot the number above trend again the january jobs report already showed this effect with construction employment reportedly surging by 44 000 jobs previous 1 608k wells fargo 1 523k consensus 1 400k fomc meeting minutes wednesday the fed left rates on hold in january as was widely expected but markets now expect a cut before the end of the year with the fed making it clear that it needs to see a material change to the outlook we continue to think it will remain on the sidelines however the minutes will provide greater clarity on just how close committee members view various factors the coronavirus effect on domestic growth and persistent below target inflation for example come to being material the minutes may also expand on the fed s plan to wind down its t bill purchases we expect 60 billion per month until mid april falling to 30 billion by mid june and then a non predetermined amount going forward to match organic balance sheet growth the minutes will also reiterate that the committee views its balance sheet expansion as a technical measure to prevent dislocations in money markets rather than a form of stimulus leading economic index thursday the leading economic index lei should bounce back from negative territory in january aided by a strong month for equity markets the december reading was the first negative year over year print since november 2009 which led to some overly bearish headlines in our view the lei overweights manufacturing which had a particularly bad december as the ism manufacturing index fell to 47 2 the lowest since 2009 the ism in turn has also been overstating the extent of manufacturing weakness relative to hard data on orders and production therefore we would think the negative print last month was a false flag but the trend clearly is one of moderating growth for january specifically the ism manufacturing rebounded nicely to 50 9 indicating growth again after five straight contractionary readings we expect the lei rose 0 4 in january and will watch for coronavirus fears feeding through survey data in coming weeks previous 0 3 wells fargo 0 4 consensus 0 4 global review china near term outlook remains challenging a revision to diagnosis methodology led to a nearly 30 jump in new reported cases of coronavirus in china and while many of those cases are days or weeks old the revision only raises further questions over the extent to which china s economy will be affected by the outbreak still the country s top officials have been resolute that the country can still hit its 2020 gdp targets the eurozone is among the more exposed major developed economies bad news for its already struggling manufacturing sector especially in germany which is the most exposed to china of the eurozone s major economies markets still in the dark on full virus effect it was not a particularly busy week for global economic data and events and much of the attention remained on the fallout from the coronavirus chinese authorities abstained from the large liquidity injections they resorted to the prior week but remained resolute in their pledge to meet their growth target of around 6 for this year despite the significant economic disruption from the virus outbreak as a reminder we downgraded our china gdp outlook to 5 5 for full year 2020 while we look for growth of just 5 1 on a year over year basis in q1 2020 top chart new reports this week suggest that china had previously underreported the number of coronavirus cases by around 30 only adding to the downside risks for chinese economic growth and the growth of its key trading partners among the first official data of note that will provide insight into the extent of economic damage in china are the pmi figures for february scheduled for release on february 28 that said we will not receive hard data from china on february retail sales and industrial output until march 15 suggesting markets will remain largely in the dark on the full extent of any economic effect until then among the major developed economies the eurozone and particularly germany may be among the most exposed to weakness in chinese demand and are certainly much more exposed than the united states middle chart the eurozone factory sector was already struggling long before the virus outbreak and data this week confirmed that the weakness in the sector continued into december industrial output in the eurozone declined 2 1 during the month the sharpest decline since 2016 with broad based declines in all the region s largest economies meanwhile data showed that german real gdp was flat on a sequential basis in q4 suggesting the eurozone s largest economy carried little momentum into q1 even before the virus outbreak meanwhile in the united kingdom growth and activity data for q4 were hardly encouraging real gdp essentially stagnated during the quarter with consumer spending rising just 0 1 not annualized on a sequential basis and fixed investment spending declining 1 6 not annualized perhaps a bright spot in the data were signs that the economy picked up some momentum in december as services and manufacturing output both rose a healthy 0 3 during the month following sharp declines in november those figures bode well for the q1 gdp figure while solid january pmi data released a few weeks ago also suggest the u k economy likely bounced back into the new year on a separate but related note u k chancellor finance minister sajid javid stepped down this week raising hopes of more aggressive fiscal stimulus from the u k government another upside risk for u k economic growth in 2020 as we discuss in the global outlook section on the next page next week will be a big one for u k economic data particularly the retail sales figures for january the first hard data for the post election period and likely a key indicator for the bank of england boe officials as they decide whether stimulus is warranted global outlook canada cpi wednesday among the g7 central banks the bank of canada boc is arguably the most successful at present in achieving its inflation target indeed an average of three core inflation measures tracked by the boc is currently running just above the 2 target and averaged exactly 2 in full year 2019 that has likely been a major reason the boc has bucked the trend of global easing over the past year keeping rates steady throughout 2019 looking ahead we expect the boc will remain on hold throughout 2020 but that forecast is predicated on inflation remaining near the 2 target recent boc communications have been a bit more dovish and tilted the risks further toward easing and thus the central bank will likely be particularly sensitive to any downside surprises on inflation should they occur in addition to january cpi figures retail sales data for december are also slated for release next week previous 2 2 wells fargo 1 9 consensus 2 3 year over year u k retail sales thursday next week is a crucial one for u k economic data arguably most important will be retail sales for january as this will be the first significant piece of hard data released for the u k economy that entirely reflects activity after the december general election the boe has stated that it has refrained from easing policy because sentiment indicators have pointed to a post election bounce in activity but critically it noted that if the hard data did not confirm this bounce it may resort to rate cuts to support growth thus the boe may be particularly sensitive to any downside surprises in next week s retail sales figure also on the docket next week are employment figures for q4 cpi inflation for january and the february pmis all of which could be considered tier one data for the u k economy and will likely be closely watched in addition to the retail sales data previous 0 6 consensus 0 7 month over month eurozone pmis friday recent hard economic data from the eurozone have been somewhat disappointing including outsized weakness in retail sales and industrial output in december which led to softer than expected q4 gdp growth of just 0 1 on a sequential basis signals from the manufacturing and services pmis for january suggest the economy remained sluggish at the start of q1 the question now is whether the manufacturing sector will finally start to gain more traction and catch up with its services counterpart or whether it will continue to languish and drag down services with it february pmi data will be crucial in that sense and we would note that there may be some downside risks to these figures given the outbreak of the coronavirus may have weighed on manufacturing sentiment in particular the eurozone economy and specifically the german economy is quite reliant on china as an export market and thus we may see further weakness in manufacturing sentiment in next week s release previous 47 9 and 52 5 consensus 47 4 and 52 3 manufacturing and services point of view interest rate watch sticking to the script it was a busy week on capitol hill when it came to fed testimony chair powell gave his semi annual testimony to congress his remarks echoed those of the most recent fomc meeting powell signaled rates were unlikely to be changed in the near term as policy was currently appropriate but the committee stood ready to adjust if there was a material change to the outlook including more widespread effects of the coronavirus hints that officials are increasingly willing to let inflation run above 2 for a time suggested that the fed s overall policy bias remains dovish a fully staffed board of governors also testifying this week were nominees to the board of governors christopher waller and judy shelton if both were to be confirmed the board of governors would be fully staffed for the first time since 2013 waller has served as the research director of the st louis fed for the past 11 years while considered mainstream his views fall on the dovish side of the spectrum having questioned traditional inflationary drivers like labor market slack notably however he has come out against the use of negative rates it appears likely his nomination will make it out of committee and he will eventually be confirmed less certain is shelton s confirmation shelton has advocated returning to the gold standard and questioned the existence and mandates of the central bank more recently she has advocated the central bank take explicit efforts to weaken the dollar shelton s confirmation would add to concerns about the fed s independence from political pressure over the past decade she has moved from hawkish views on inflation and interest rates to wanting to cut rates expeditiously while serving as an advisor to president trump a number of republican senators have expressed concerns putting her candidacy up in the air given the typical timeline between hearings and confirmations it will likely be months before the full senate takes up the vote if her nomination makes it out of the senate banking committee credit market insights mortgage originations soar the mortgage market ended a busy year with a 224 billion jump in new mortgage balances according to the new york fed s household debt and credit report this increase brought the total amount of mortgage originations for the quarter t0 752 billion the highest since 2005 see bottom chart home purchases have been picking up though refinances continue to drive the bulk of mortgage demand accounting for roughly 60 of mortgage applications in recent quarters despite the pick up in new mortgages credit quality has not appeared to deteriorate sixty four percent of the new mortgages in q4 went to borrowers with a credit score of 760 or better the highest share since 2000 when the series started tighter lending standards along with the healthy economy have also pushed down delinquency rates the mba s latest national delinquency survey reported a drop in the delinquency rate to 3 77 the lowest on record while these metrics highlight the financial health of homeowners debt growth over the past decade has come primarily from consumer credit delinquencies rates for student auto and credit card loans which comprise the bulk of consumer credit have drifted up in prior quarters although banks have responded by tightening standards for 2020 banks expect higher demand for credit card loans but lower demand for auto loans existing borrowers ability to keep current will like the rest of consumer spending largely depend on the continued resilience in the labor market topic of the week a primary primer in our preview of the iowa caucus and its economy we highlighted the fact that it resembles several swing states with its reliance on manufacturing 14 of employment well above the 8 national average and agriculture iowa is the second largest agricultural producer after california given this dual emphasis on globally exposed sectors iowa has been one of the most affected states by the trade war it is also one of the whitest states leading some to criticize its perennial spot at the front of the primary schedule new hampshire is the 41st smallest state with around 40 of its 1 4 million residents living in the greater boston area in addition to being 93 white it is also the second oldest state a demographic challenge which has resulted in sluggish labor force growth health care is its fastest growing sector while manufacturing 10 of payrolls has shed 1 200 jobs over the past year for comparison bernie sanders margin of victory over pete buttigieg was only 3 867 votes nevada is next in line and is the first primary state with a sizable non white population nevada was hit extremely hard by the housing bust and ensuing recession and did not recover all the jobs lost until the end of 2015 it is now growing rapidly however and has added 321 000 jobs since 2010 across a broader array of industries including logistics distribution health care and advanced manufacturing low taxes and business friendly regulations have boosted the professional business services and tech sectors which have also benefitted from an affordability migration out of california the influx of businesses has in turn spurred rapid population growth we will be publishing a preview of south carolina which has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country aided by its success attracting manufacturers and foreign direct investment its population is growing rapidly as job seekers and retirees move in but there are major differences between the state s largest metro areas and the surrounding rural areas three days after the south carolina primary brings super tuesday when voters in california utah colorado texas oklahoma minnesota arkansas alabama tennessee north carolina virginia massachusetts vermont and maine head to the polls these 14 states comprise 40 of the u s population and their economies run the gamut from rapidly growing to stagnant it is therefore difficult to assess the economic backdrop of these primaries but it may also be less necessary the primary schedule inherently overweights the first few states and the idiosyncrasies of their economies with momentum often compounding behind the candidate who nabs the early victories this dynamic will resurface in the general election which often comes down to just a few swing states indeed a key to trump s victory was his outperformance in some midwestern states which he was able to narrowly flip michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin were all decided by less than one percentage point but trump claimed all their electoral votes in other words while iowa new hampshire nevada and south carolina are disproportionately important for the nomination process other states will be disproportionately important for the general election in terms of the general election we have previously published 1 an overview 2 a primer on the leading candidates major proposals and 3 an outline

china continues to pull ahead in the central bank digital currency race as more details on its secretive digital yuan project intermittently surface as a result more countries are beginning to worry about the potential implications over the past few weeks a number of japanese lawmakers have publicly expressed their preference for a cbdc controlled by the bank of japan the general idea is to counter the soon to be released digital yuan from neighbouring china and prevent it from disrupting the global economy according to a senior ruling party lawmaker the development of a japanese cbdc might take two to three years will it come too late to serve as a challenge for beijing what might a boj issued currency look like bank of japan vs cbdc a preference for cash the bank of japan s relationship with cbdcs can be traced back to april 2018 when the agency s deputy governor masayoshi amamiya first addressed the topic publically although the tone of his comment was predominantly negative the official did not rule out the possibility of considering the bank s own cryptocurrency specifically amamiya argued that issuing a cbdc for general use would undermine the existing financial system as that would allow consumers to open accounts directly at the central bank and hence abandon private banks altogether putting them at a major disadvantage the issuance of central bank digital currencies for general use could be analogous to allowing households and firms to directly have accounts in the central bank this may have a large impact on the aforementioned two tiered currency system and private banks financial intermediation the central bank s representative concluded that although his agency was not considering issuing its own virtual currency it nonetheless realized that the application of emerging technologies was a possibility half a year later in october 2018 amamiya reiterated his mostly negative stance toward cbdcs he claimed that such digital currencies are unlikely to improve the existing monetary systems adding that the central bank does not plan to issue a cbdc that can be widely used by the public for settlement and payment purposes during his speech amamiya panned the idea of cbdcs as a tool for central banks to control the economy once interest rates fall to zero according to this theory a state controlled digital currency can empower central banks to charge more interest on deposits from individuals and firms which would in turn induce them to spend more money thereby stimulating the economy notably japan was one of the first countries to introduce negative interest rates back in 2016 along with the european central bank thus the boj deputy governor claimed that charging interest on cbdcs would only work if central banks eliminate fiat money from the financial system which is not an option for japan where cash is still a popular method of payment otherwise the public will still continue converting digital currencies into cash in order to avoid paying interest amamiya went on to add in order for central banks to overcome the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates they would need to get rid of cash from society in february 2019 the bankof japan published an extensive report covering cbdcs the document authored by a boj official and a university of tokyo professor studied different ways to implement a cbdc and the hypothetical consequences of those approaches specifically the report focused on two types of cbdcs that had been previously categorized by the bank for international settlements one type accessible to the general public for daily transactions like banknotes and the other used for large value settlements central bank deposits only echoing amamiya s concerns the paper s authors argued that cbdcs of the latter kind wouldn t improve the current monetary system and focused primarily on the first kind in their analysis the report also noted that blockchain could be used for a token based cbdc finally in july 2019 amamiya once again said that countries issuing cbdcs with a negative interest rate would force the public toward cash while eliminating physical money is not an option chinese threat new wave of interest in cbdcs among japanese politicians in 2020 a year that has already been remarkably eventful in terms of global crypto adoption japanese lawmakers returned to the idea of a cbdc the wave of renewed interest was started by a parliamentary group comprised of around 70 members of the ruling liberal democratic party who are alarmed about the prompt development of the digital yuan in neighbouring china earlier in january the people s bank of china reportedly accomplished the top layer design and joint testing of its soon to be released cbdc the idea that china could compel other countries to digitize their currencies has been widely discussed since libra s announcement in summer 2019 apparently prompted beijing to speed up the development of its digital yuan a common theory is that china can jumpstart its cbdc via its belt and road initiative using it to maintain trade relations with a number of friendly developing economies norihiro nakayama parliamentary vice minister for foreign affairs and a key member of japan s liberal democratic party said on jan 24 china is moving toward issuing digital yuan so we d like to propose measures to counter such attempts on jan 30 the bank of japan s amamiya continued the discussion by stating that the central bank must be ready to issue a cbdc if public demand spikes due to rapid technical developments amamiya did not retract his previous claims about such digital currencies as he stressed that the issuance of cbdcs would not drastically impact the effectiveness of monetary policy and its effect on interest rates asset prices and bank lending however the boj official focused on technical innovations within settlement systems that cbdcs might entail the transmission mechanism could become more complicated and difficult to break down if settlement systems change amamiya clarified that the institution still has no imminent plans to issue a digital currency as it continues to assess potentially overlooked implications for monetary policy as well as security issues it is very important for boj to continue studying the possibility of issuing cbdcs he added on feb 7 akira amari former economy minister and a member of the ruling liberal democratic party led a group of lawmakers calling on their government to push for digital currencies to be placed on the g 7 s agenda this year the 2020 g 7 summit will be held on june 10 through june 12 in camp david washington notably amari and his allies specified the source of their concern the chinese cbdc we live in a stable world led by dollar settlement how should we respond if such a foundation collapses and if china s move gives rise to a struggle for currency supremacy three days later on feb 10 yet another japanese lawmaker stepped forward to support the idea of a boj issued digital currency the head of the banking and finance system s research commission at the liberal democratic party kozo yamamoto said that japan should create a digital yen currency hopefully within two to three years is japan too late to the party experts think not jeff wentworth co founder of tokyo based blockchain tooling startup curvegrid believes that issuing a digital yen would be a logical step for the local central bank he told cointelegraph that every economy needs a cbdc much as almost every economy made the move from paper money to electronic banking in the 1980s however in wentworth s view amari might overestimate the influence of a china issued cbdc as its performance will likely depend on the currency s design cbdcs in general will upset the current status quo but it s hard to say what impact the digital yuan in particular will have on the global currency balance a key consideration is how decentralized the yuan and other cbdcs will aim to be if kept mostly centralized they will be cbdcs in name only and not much different from the current state of electronic money greater change is likely to be driven by cbdcs which adopt a more decentralized approach maurizio raffone chief financial officer of blockchain firm credify who is also based in tokyo shared a similar sentiment arguing that the digital yuan might fail to dethrone the american dollar in the near future at least in the next few years i don t see a digital yuan replacing the usd china would need to remove currency controls on the yuan as it would be pegged to the digital yuan implying some degree of loss of control over monetary policy which is something the chinese government simply won t do nonetheless raffone added that the boj is overdue for a cbdc since its loose monetary policy has run out of room and that a cbdc could be a great way to improve monetary velocity in the japanese economy and provide a boost to gdp growth he added that japan should take in the technical and financial consideration into account elaborating technically japan s cbdc would be a great tentpole for digital transformation and innovation for all japanese financial services firms and a way for them to piggyback on the bank of japan s digital currency to push their own product development financially a cbdc could be a huge money saver for banks as well as an effective tool to protect against tax evasion and money laundering both experts agree that albeit the people s bank of china is considered the frontrunner in the cbdc race it is not too late for the japanese central bank to start its own digital currency project as two to three years in global financial market terms is still quite fast as for the united states its officials recognize that the prospect of the digital yuan could be a threat to the usd s dominance but prefer to stay on the sidelines for the time being earlier this week congressman bill foster questioned a federal reserve official on the matter and was told that the institution is not yet sure whether deploying such a digital currency would benefit the u s economy meanwhile china continues to finalize its cbdc project leaving other countries behind on feb 12 the financial times reported that the chinese central bank has filed more than 80 patents related to its undisclosed plans to launch the digital yuan and the way it integrates with the banking system

updated 4 35pm with pn response malta s economic growth is gradually reaching cruising speed and is now increasingly reliant on domestic demand the international monetary fund has noted in an assessment that warns that slow progress in addressing structural weaknesses could threaten the country s financial stability imf staff noted that malta must tackle a series of key challenges if it is to sustain the strong economic performance of the past years which included high gdp growth low unemployment and strong fiscal buffers the recommendations are part of an imf mission s concluding statement during imf missions a team of economists from the international organisation visit member states to assess their economies meeting with government and central bankers in the process in a statement the finance ministry noted that the imf s praise of the maltese economy s strong performance came just days after the european commission had said that it expected malta to continue to perform strongly in 2020 and after rating agency moody s had confirmed the country s rating the imf highlighted three key issues which the country must tackle 1 anti money laundering framework deficiencies the imf said it was of critical importance that aml legislation was strengthened and enforced noting recommendations made by the council of europe s moneyval moneyval has warned that malta risks being blacklisted unless concerns are addressed and finance minister edward scicluna has also acknowledged the need to score more goals when it comes to financial crime weaknesses in this sector could lead to further problems with acquiring correspondent banks make malta less attractive to foreign investment and threaten financial stability the imf noted local banks most notably bank of valletta have struggled to keep hold of correspondent banks in recent years the mfsa has registered commendable progress but remains under significant strain the imf said slow progress in addressing structural weaknesses including in the aml cft framework may undermine long term growth prospects and potentially threaten financial stability the visiting imf mission said the imf said malta s focus should be on improving and demonstrating the effectiveness of its aml cft framework with a particular focus on strengthening the understanding of risks related to banks and high risk sectors such as gaming cryptocurrencies or the cash for passports iip scheme malta s financial regulator the mfsa was registering commendable progress the imf said but would need to have its resources bolstered and long term independence assured the regulator also needed to introduce better frameworks for bank insolvency and liquidating failing banks the imf said 2 infrastructural pressures due to inflows of foreign labour imf experts noted that economic growth had relied on large inflows of foreign labour which brought with it pressures on housing infrastructure and natural resources the country has added tens of thousands of foreign workers to its population over the past years with more needed to fill labour gaps malta would need to improve access to affordable housing to relieve bottlenecks and ensure sustainable growth the imf said and it encouraged the government to complement housing benefits with such policies workers in attard imf analysts warned that infrastructural investment would need to be adequately managed as it increased the imf noted progress in upping public investment in infrastructure and said that focusing on waste renewable energy and public transport were all important as public investment increased the country s challenge would now be to improve management of these investments to ensure better efficiency the imf said the imf gave some examples of what it meant by that appraisals of public investment projects ensuring cost benefit analyses for major projects and addressing weaknesses in public procurement systems 3 fiscal risks and a reliance on corporate taxes malta has significantly improved the state of its public coffers in recent years the imf said with public debt coming down and the country registering consecutive annual surpluses the imf also noted that malta s banking system was well capitalised and it praised the central bank s decision to tighten home loan criteria last summer saying it should consider going a step further and refining the measures to reduce expemtions in the most speculative part of the real estate market once it had enough data to assess the impact of the 2019 changes but malta remains exposed to external risk factors such as changes in international tax regimes with the country heavily reliant on corporate income tax revenues and substantial contingent liability risks imf headquarters in washington d c photo shutterstock the country needs to actively review options to reduce its reliance on corporate taxation the imf said it should also implement a new legal framework for managing government guarantees and work to make fragile public corporations more financially sound malta s aging population continues to be a concern and the imf said that measures to boost the number of women and elderly in work should be sustained but that might not be enough the imf also recommends a pension age increase saying the ongoing periodic review of the pension system should comprise new measures to increase the effective retirement age report confirms opposition concerns in a statement the pn said the report reflected the opposition s concerns on foreign labour dependency and failure to address money laundering concerns despite government s continous promises that it has taken moneyval s recommendations seriously the imf issues another critical assessment of malta s approach towards the criminal activity of money laundering the pn said the imf warns government that if not tackled in a timely manner deficiencies in malta s aml framwork could result in fruther presurres on correspondent banking damage the country s attractiveness for investment and threaten financial stability to this end the imf calls government and regulatory authorities to urgently address the shortcomings identified by moneyval improve the supervision of banks and other high risk sectors and ensure that measures taken in the sector are properely enforced
by natalia gurushina economist emerging markets fixed income for vaneck global what s going on with emerging markets inflation we saw several surprises in the last 24 hours with the biggest downside surprise coming from argentina yup you heard me right argentina the first reaction in our corner was are they cooking the books while the imf is actually in town however a closer inspection revealed that monthly inflation was pulled down by lower increases in regulated tariffs many of which were frozen after the presidential elections monthly food prices were still up 4 7 so things there are normal one region where inflation goes up in what looks like leaps and bounds is central europe czech headline inflation accelerated unexpectedly to 3 6 year on year vs 3 2 expected fully justifying the central bank s decision to hike its key rate earlier this month polish headline inflation also went ballistic in january a whopping 4 4 year on year prompting concerns that the central bank nbp is falling asleep at the wheel a 16 minimum wage hike explains a big portion of the increase but several other components also surprised to the upside the wage hike will undoubtedly be considered a transitory factor by the nbp but today s release should give more ammunition to the central bank s hawkish dissenters south africa s state of the nation address wasn t that bad actually many commentators appreciated the renewed focus on electricity self generation and independent power producers i personally liked the emphasis on spending wage bill cuts as well as the drive to conduct

the united states has a problem the share of american adults who work is low compared to other developed nations economists say this holds the nation back the economy and wages should grow faster when more people are working experts have been trying to figure out why so many adults remain on the sidelines especially in a good economy according to the latest labor department data about 83 percent of american adults in their prime worker years ages 25 54 are participating in the labor force meaning they have a job or are actively looking for one that s up from a few years ago but still below the levels of the late 1990s and way below the rates of germany japan canada france and the united kingdom so what the heck is going on u s senators asked federal reserve chair jerome powell about labor force participation this week especially after powell said getting more people in the labor force is a national priority in response powell told senators to blame the education system and the opioids epidemic not welfare it isn t better or more comfortable to be poor and on public benefits now it s actually worse than it was powell said when sen john neely kennedy a republican from louisiana asked powell if the richness of our social programs makes people less inclined to look for work because they can get a government check for not working powell dismissed that idea the vast majority of economists agree with the fed chair a republican who worked for president george h w bush before embarking on a career in private equity and later at the central bank it s very hard to make that connection and i ll tell you why powell told kennedy if you look in real terms adjusted for inflation at the benefits that people get they ve actually declined during this period of declining labor force participation advertisement economists across the political spectrum agree with powell since the major bipartisan effort to revamp welfare in 1996 it s become much harder to receive money from the government unless you are either working or disabled the spirit of what the fed chair was saying is you can t blame lagging or declining labor force participation on the welfare benefit system said matt weidinger the rowe fellow in poverty studies at the right leaning american enterprise institute benefits really haven t been growing what we have been doing is subsidizing people who go to work since the 1990s the united states has focused on expanding tax credits to help the working poor the catch people have to be working at least a bit to get the benefits the earned income tax credit eitc only kicks in after your first dollar of pay similarly it has become harder in most states to receive government payments or food stamps snap for more than a few weeks unless you re an unemployed adult who is actively looking for work a 2018 analysis by economists hilary hoynes university of california at berkeley and diane whitmore schanzenbach northwestern university found that virtually all gains in spending on the social safety net for children since 1990 have gone to families with earnings and to families with income above the poverty line the dollars are no longer going to the very bottom hoynes told us they re going higher up the income distribution the benefit that most people think of as welfare is now known as temporary assistance for needy families or tanf the typical recipient of that program now gets far less than they did in 1996 especially after adjusting for the rising cost of living danilo trisi a senior research analyst focusing on child poverty at the left leaning center on budget and policy priorities pointed out that u s labor force participation has been falling since 2000 but many european nations that have more generous safety nets have seen labor force participation rise over that same time period international data suggest being more generous when people have a rough time does not decrease labor force participation trisi said the fact the u s has weak support for people falling on hard times should not be celebrated it s a key reason the u s has higher child poverty than many of our competitors johns hopkins university economist robert moffitt said he agrees with powell that safety net programs do not discourage people from finding work according to research he said the one exception might be programs for the elderly or disabled moffitt pointed to his 2015 analysis in the journal demography which shows that the elderly and disabled receive much higher benefits his study also found that low earners have seen their benefits decline the u s has gotten very stingy on giving support to people who aren t working moffitt said so what is actually keeping u s labor force participation rates so low many economists say they expected labor participation to fall as baby boomers retire but that s a problem many nations face and u s participation remains relatively low even in prime working ages ages 25 to 54 when retirement shouldn t be a factor others have pointed out it s really a different problem for men and women female labor force participation has edged down since 2000 although it s come back a bit lately but male labor force participation has been falling since the 1950s here s powell s explanation it s a combination of things no doubt it is that educational attainment in the united states which was once the highest has really fallen relative to our peers and particularly among lower and middle income people the level of educational attainment has really plateaued and that s the key thing for keeping in the labor market these days i would say the opioid crisis isn t helping he added top economists in the obama administration put out a big report focusing specifically on this issue in june 2016 they concluded that jobs for men without college degrees are declining and pay has also been falling making work less attractive in many ways this problem was at the heart of president donald trump s 2016 campaign pitch to aid the forgotten man it s likely to be a key issue again on the 2020 presidential campaign trail
cnn president donald trump made 31 false claims last week and 55 the week before including 22 at a campaign rally in des moines iowa in late january and 13 in an official speech at a community college in charlotte north carolina in early february trump spread the dishonesty around a variety of subjects over this period stretching from january 27 to february 9 he made 17 false claims about health care 15 about the economy 15 about democrats and five or more about each of six additional topics trade energy impeachment china immigration and the military we counted five blatant false claims in trump s state of the union address other claims in that speech were misleading lacking in key context or questionable predictions we don t include such claims in this false claims only tally but you can read fact checks on them here trump is now averaging about 59 false claims per week for the 31 weeks we have checked at cnn since july 8 so both of these two weeks were better than his usual they were still of course highly dishonest by any non trump standard trump is now up to 1 816 false claims since july 8 the most egregious false claim saving social security trump is a dishonesty maximalist he often seems to prefer an egregious lie told confidently to spin that might be more accurate but might also make him seem defensive or evasive asked in a fox news interview on january 30 about allegations that he plans to take away people s social security he had vaguely mused in a cnbc interview about tackling entitlement programs at some point trump could have responded in any number of factual or semi factual ways instead he offered up this fiction i m the one that saved it the democrats wanted to do it last time the democrats did not want to take away or even cut social security in 2016 trump did not save it there was no follow up question the most revealing false claim pelosi and the speech trump is not only a relentless fabricator of his own nonsense but a gleeful purveyor of nonsense he has heard from others the white house made a fair argument about house speaker nancy pelosi s decision to publicly rip up her copy of trump s state of the union address saying she was disrespecting the heroes victims and other citizens trump had mentioned in the speech but trump allies like florida rep matt gaetz and charlie kirk the executive director of conservative group turning point usa went further suggesting pelosi may have broken a federal law prohibiting the destruction of government records legal experts said this claim was nonsense since pelosi s copy of the speech never qualified as an official government record that did not stop the president from telling reporters first of all it s an official document you re not allowed it s illegal what she did she broke the law the most absurd false claim bloomberg and the box when trump tweeted on february 2 that democratic presidential candidate michael bloomberg was negotiating to have the right to stand on boxes or a lift during the debates it seemed like a mocking joke that wasn t worth fact checking but then we watched trump s super bowl interview with fox news sean hannity later that day in which the president made clear in tone manner and content that his allegation about bloomberg trying to obtain a height aid was absolutely serious so we had to do our solemn duty and look into it and as so often we found no evidence for it whatsoever here is the full list of false claims for these two weeks starting with the ones we haven t previously fact checked in one of these weekly roundups democrats and the 2020 election michael bloomberg and the debates mini mike is now negotiating both to get on the democrat primary debate stage and to have the right to stand on boxes or a lift during the debates this is sometimes done but really not fair february 2 tweet you know now he wants a box for the debates to stand on okay it s okay there s nothing wrong you can be short why should he get a box to stand on okay he wants a box for the debates why should he be entitled to that really does that mean everyone else gets a box february 2 super bowl interview with fox news sean hannity facts first there is no evidence bloomberg has requested a box to stand on to make him seem taller during debates bloomberg campaign spokesperson julie wood told cnn that trump is lying she called trump a pathological liar a democratic national committee official said on condition of anonymity that no there have been no discussions about bloomberg getting any height aid for a debate trump s polling against democrats trump said of bloomberg michael s doing very poorly you look at his poll numbers he s spending a lot of money and what can i say he s doing poorly i think they re all doing poorly because according to every poll i m leading every one of them by a lot january 30 interview with fox news peter doocy facts first it s not true that every poll on potential election matchups shows trump leading every democratic candidate let alone leading them by a lot some recent polls show trump leading some democrats but some other polls in late january and early february have shown trump trailing multiple democratic candidates including bloomberg both nationally and in key states you can see a list of recent polls here the emoluments lawsuit trump hailed a federal appeals court s decision to toss out a lawsuit filed against him by democratic members of congress then said this was brought by 230 democrats in congress on emoluments february 7 exchange with reporters before marine one departure facts first the lawsuit was brought by 215 democratic members of congress not 230 the numbers matter here the lawsuit which alleged that trump violated the constitution by obtaining financial benefits from foreign government officials who stay at his properties was tossed out by the three judge panel precisely because the lawsuit had not been brought by a sufficient number of members of the house or the senate the judges wrote our conclusion is straightforward because the members 29 senators and 186 members of the house of representatives do not constitute a majority of either body and are therefore powerless to approve or deny the president s acceptance of foreign emoluments two hundred thirty democrats would be a majority two hundred fifteen is not pelosi ripping up the state of the union well i thought it was a terrible thing when she ripped up the speech first of all it s an official document you re not allowed it s illegal what she did she broke the law and that was on display the other night when she ripped up the speech that was terrible it was a terrible so disrespectful to our country and actually very illegal what she did february 7 exchange with reporters before marine one departure facts first it was not illegal under government records laws for pelosi to rip a copy of trump s address since pelosi s copy of the speech does not qualify as a government record experts have told various news and fact checking outlets trump did not invent this claim himself charlie kirk executive director of conservative group turning point usa and republican rep matt gaetz among others said pelosi may have broken the law and donald trump jr amplified the claim still the president was wrong when he repeated it himself democrats and social security asked about allegations he wants to take away social security trump vaguely told cnbc the week prior that entitlement programs will be on his plate at some point he said i m the one that saved it the democrats wanted to do it last time january 30 interview with fox news peter doocy facts first trump wasn t clear what he meant by do it but prominent democrats did not want to cut social security much less take it away when trump was running in 2016 democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton proposed to increase social security benefits obama and aids we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america in less than 10 years we ve already started it should have been started in the last administration incredible it should have been started earlier but we started in less than 10 years the aids epidemic will be eradicated will be gone january 30 campaign rally in des moines iowa we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic can you believe this in america in 10 years or less we ve already started the process and it could have been started sooner by the past administration they chose not to do it i chose to do it january 28 campaign rally in wildwood new jersey facts first it s not even close to true that the obama administration did not try to stop hiv aids in the united states experts say and budget data proves the obama administration spent more than 5 5 billion per year on the three primary domestic programs to combat hiv aids according to figures provided by the kaiser family foundation which closely tracks health care spending that s in addition to billions in spending on international anti hiv aids initiatives obama also introduced a comprehensive national strategy on combating hiv aids and experts note that the affordable care act also known as obamacare helped people with hiv gain health insurance coverage it s outrageous to say that president barack obama did nothing on hiv said jesse milan jr president and ceo of aids united a non profit dedicating to ending the epidemic in 2019 trump issued a plan called ending the hiv epidemic a plan for america which aimed to reduce the number of new hiv infections in the us by 75 within five years and by at least 90 within 10 years experts said trump s plan builds on obama s 2010 national hiv aids strategy and a 2015 update to that strategy in fact trump s administration itself had said prior to trump issuing his own plan that it was being guided by the obama era strategy the domestic policies and programs of the federal government continue to be guided by the national hiv aids strategy and we are focused on working toward achieving the strategy goals for 2020 jen kates senior vice president and director of global health and hiv policy at the kaiser family foundation said trump deserves credit for his bold 2019 plan and for proposing a funding increase for the 2020 fiscal year after proposing cuts in previous years though she said trump s attempts to eradicate obamacare including its protections for people with pre existing conditions would hurt the effort but president obama also did much on hiv kates said bringing domestic hiv back into the spotlight launching the first ever comprehensive national strategy upon which the ending the hiv epidemic initiative builds and supporting programs that led to an increase in coverage and access particularly the aca the crowd outside trump s rally in wildwood new jersey trump said rep jeff van drew had told him there were 175 000 people outside his rally venue in wildwood new jersey and he asked van drew if this was a fact van drew standing beside him on stage responded that it was a fact trump soon added we have tens of thousands of people outside january 28 campaign rally in wildwood new jersey facts first trump was relying on van drew s figures so this is perhaps less egregious than when trump makes his own inflated claims about crowds but nonetheless both men were way off ben rose director of marketing and public relations for the greater wildwoods tourism improvement and development authority told cnn that the authority estimates there were between 3 000 and 3 500 people in the parking lot outside trump s rally venue and between 2 000 and 2 500 people at a park across the street wildwood mayor pete byron told cnn that after speaking with the city s fire chief and police chief he estimated there were 14 000 or 15 000 people in town for the rally including people inside the venue rose said there were 7 725 people inside the venue for the rally he said trump was correct that this was an all time record for the wildwoods convention center trump has repeatedly exaggerated the size of the overflow crowd outside his rallies hunter biden s career trump said hunter biden the son of democratic presidential candidate and former vice president joe biden made millions of dollars from foreign countries after he went from having no job no income he had nothing february 2 super bowl interview with fox news sean hannity facts first trump didn t specify when precisely he was alleging hunter biden was unemployed and without income but it s not true that hunter biden did not have a job or income either in the years before joe biden ran for vice president or before hunter biden was appointed to the board of directors of ukrainian natural gas company burisma holdings before joe biden became vice president in 2009 hunter biden a lawyer who graduated from yale law school worked as a lobbyist he became a partner at a law and lobbying firm in 2001 he stopped lobbying late in the 2008 election before that he had worked for financial services company mbna rising to senior vice president and for the us commerce department hunter biden was appointed to the board of burisma in 2014 at the time he was a lawyer at the firm boies schiller flexner an adjunct professor at georgetown university s foreign service program chairman of the board of world food program usa and chief executive officer and chairman of rosemont seneca advisors an investment advisory firm he also served on other boards this is not to say that hunter biden s name was not a major factor in his getting the role at burisma hunter biden has acknowledged that he would probably not have been asked to be on the board if he were not a biden but trump s portrayal of him as a desperate unemployed man making no money without foreign income is inaccurate we don t know exactly how much money hunter biden a private citizen earned from his work in ukraine and with other countries he was paid up to 50 000 per month for his burisma role according to the new york times the johnson amendment our great faith leaders so many great people i ve met you know we got rid of the johnson amendment so they can speak their will right right february 7 speech at north carolina opportunity now summit facts first trump has not gotten rid of the johnson amendment a 1954 provision of the tax code that prohibits tax exempt religious organizations and other tax exempt nonprofits from supporting or opposing political candidates trump issued an executive order in 2017 promoting free speech and religious liberty but that order did not eliminate the amendment experts and activists said the order did not do much at all eliminating the amendment would require a vote of congress trump has sometimes seemed to acknowledge at least implicitly that he has not permanently eliminated the amendment in a january campaign speech to evangelicals he said we re going to get rid of the johnson amendment and we did it s no longer effective and we re going to put it through and make it permanent too a fourth grader in philadelphia trump told a story in his state of the union address about philadelphia fourth grader janiyah davis using davis as an example of a child trapped in failing government schools he announced she would be receiving a scholarship to the school of her choice he repeated a version of the story at the north carolina opportunity now summit suggesting davis had been trapped in a poorly performing school facts first janiyah davis had not been stuck in a failing school she was attending fourth grade at a new highly sought after charter school the philadelphia inquirer reported after attending a private christian school from first grade through third grade though davis did transfer out of the private school because tuition was too expensive for her family even with a partial scholarship according to the inquirer her mother stephanie davis said they do not view the charter school an independently run school paid for by the public as a failing entity they want to flee i don t view mast as a school you want to get out of at all i view it as a great opportunity it is likely that trump s staff not trump himself was primarily responsible for this error but nonetheless what he told the country was not true net farm income in the eight years before my election net farm income plummeted by 20 you know that i got here if you look at a chart for 15 years actually not eight for 15 years it s like a roller coaster ride down for the farmer trump drew a line downward with his hand january 30 campaign rally in des moines iowa facts first trump is half right half wrong he s correct even conservative when he says net farm income was 20 lower in 2016 than it was eight years prior in inflation adjusted 2020 dollars net farm income fell from 94 6 million in 2008 to 67 3 million in 2016 a decline of about 29 but he s wrong when he suggests 2016 net farm income was lower than net farm income 15 years prior it was about 23 higher in 2016 than it was in 2001 and when he suggests net farm income fell for 15 straight years in fact net farm income was higher in 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 than it was in 2008 peaking at an inflation adjusted 139 1 million in 2013 that was the best performance since 1973 the congressional research service reported in february 2018 u s farm income experienced a golden period during 2011 through 2014 due to strong commodity prices and robust agricultural exports 401 k s before trump for years you ve been losing your ass with 401 k s now you re making a fortune right right now you re making a fortune january 28 campaign rally in wildwood new jersey facts first trump didn t precisely define losing your ass and can t speak about every individual 401 k retirement plan but there is no evidence most people were suffering major losses in their 401 k s before trump came along workers 401 k plans can include a mix of stocks and other assets us stock markets rose significantly under obama the dow jones industrial average for example increased 148 from the day after obama s inauguration in 2009 to his last full day in office in 2016 fidelity investments issues a quarterly report on the balances of 401 k s in fidelity accounts of which there are now about 30 million in the first quarter of 2009 when obama took office the average 401 k balance was 46 300 by the fourth quarter of 2016 obama s last full quarter it had increased 100 to 92 500 the average balance has increased an additional 14 under trump to 105 200 in the third quarter of 2019 the relative size of trump s electoral college margin but we had a tremendous landslide electoral college victory like people haven t seen in a long time january 30 speech on the usmca in warren michigan facts first aside from trump s dubious characterization of his 306 to 232 electoral college margin 304 to 227 after defections from faithless electors as a landslide the winning candidate has earned a larger share of electoral votes in 45 of 58 presidential elections the new york times has noted it s not true that people haven t seen such a margin of victory in a long time obama had a bigger margin in both of the two previous elections the obamacare website the democrat caucus is an unmitigated disaster nothing works just like they ran the country remember the 5 billion dollar obamacare website that should have cost 2 of that february 4 tweet remember the obamacare right remember it was going to cost 5 million it cost 15 no 5 billion right five billion it still didn t work it still didn t work february 7 speech at north carolina opportunity now summit facts first the obamacare website healthcare gov did have major problems when it was unveiled in 2013 and it was expensive but 5 billion is an exaggeration in may 2014 the obama administration said the website cost 834 million a september 2014 analysis by the information service bloomberg government which looked at contracts related to the website put the total at 2 1 billion the fact check website politifact reported in july 2015 we asked the bloomberg government study s author peter gosselin whether he thought the number could have more than doubled to 5 billion since the study was released 10 months ago he was skeptical saying that even if you add on a five year follow up contract with the firm accenture it should only get you about halfway to 5 billion the steele dossier trump complained about a controversial research dossier compiled by former british spy christopher steele calling it the fake dossier then added and now christopher steele admits that it s a fake because he got sued by rich people i should have sued him too february 6 speech on senate impeachment acquittal facts first steele has not admitted that his dossier is fake in a court filing for a defamation lawsuit against him and in a deposition steele acknowledged that some of the information in the dossier is raw intelligence he had not verified but that is not the same as acknowledging that the dossier is fake steele s company orbis business intelligence said on twitter that trump s claim was false contrary to his claims we have never stated any of our reporting is fake we stand by the integrity of our research on kremlin interference in the 2016 election and support for trump the chinese and american economies you know if you remember it goes all the way back for years i heard that china will take over as the largest economy in the world in 2019 i kept hearing that i hated it because i said if i run 2019 is not so far away we are so far ahead we are so far ahead now we became a rocket ship february 7 speech at north carolina opportunity now summit facts first the us economy remains much bigger than china s economy in terms of total output but china has continued to close the gap even though its own growth has slowed in other words it s not true the us is only now so far ahead because of growth during trump s time in office in fact the us lead has continued to shrink under trump china reported 6 1 gdp growth in 2019 its slowest rate since 1990 the us reported 2 3 growth in 2019 and 2 9 growth in 2018 both up from 1 6 in 2016 during president barack obama s last full year in office but the highest trump era growth tying the 2 9 in 2015 while china s official figures are widely seen as unreliable there is no doubt china has still grown faster than the us during trump s tenure nonetheless china is still nowhere near the total size of the us economy in terms of raw output china says its 2019 gdp was about 14 4 trillion the us says its 2019 gdp was about 21 4 trillion it s not clear where trump heard china would pass the us as the largest economy in 2019 derek scissors a resident scholar at the conservative american enterprise institute and an expert on the chinese economy told cnn in 2019 that there were some predictions at the beginning of that decade that china would pass the us around 2019 but that experts were not saying this when trump took office contrary to a trump claim in october 2019
most countries exhibit large and persistent geographical differences in income and employment kline and moretti 2014 place based policies attempt to reduce these differences by targeting underdeveloped or economically distressed regions research has given relatively little attention to payroll tax incentives a place based policy commonly used in finland norway and sweden korkeamäki and uusitalo 2009 johansen and klette 1997 bennmarker et al 2009 this tax finances the social insurance system in these countries payroll taxes levied on firms also constitute about 15 of the total tax revenue in oecd countries as payroll taxes are proportional to worker earnings they are an additional labour cost for firms beyond the wages they pay to stimulate employment in remote areas and reduce regional disparities in labour market opportunities as a result the governments of finland sweden and norway have a long history of applying geographically differentiated payroll tax rates in norway for instance tax rates in five different tax zones ranged from 0 in the northernmost regions to 14 1 in central areas figure 1 figure 1 tax zones and regional labour market regions in norway 2003 source ku et al 2020 the case of norway in a recent paper ku et al 2020 we look at norway s experience to investigate whether place based payroll tax incentives boost employment in these remote low tax areas the key challenge when evaluating geographically differentiated payroll taxes is that the prevailing tax rates in different regions likely reflect regional economic conditions or developments this makes it difficult to separate the impacts of different payroll tax rates on local employment and wages from the effects of local labour market conditions or business cycles to overcome this challenge we exploit an unusual policy setting in norway in the mid 2000s at this time the system of geographically differentiated payroll taxes was suddenly abolished prior to the reform the government of norway allowed lower payroll tax rates in remote areas to stimulate employment and business activity and to avoid depopulation of sparsely populated areas of the country in 1999 however the european free trade association surveillance authority esa ruled that the norwegian system of geographically differentiated payroll tax rates did not comply with eu trade regulations the result was a tax rate harmonisation reform between 2004 and 2006 the reform was adopted and implemented independently of the local labour market developments and so created arguably exogenous variation in the payroll tax rates faced by firms in different regions over time in 2007 another esa ruling allowed norway to re introduce the system of differentiated payroll taxes after an appeal case tax rates were reduced to their pre 2004 levels our analysis takes advantage of the eu induced payroll tax changes at the level of the local labour market or commuting zone there are 45 commuting zones in norway excluding oslo we compare employment and wages before 2000 2003 and after 2004 2006 the abolition of geographically differentiated payroll taxes between commuting zones that are differentially exposed to the policy we find a significant decrease in local employment in response to the payroll tax rise a one percentage point increase in the payroll tax rate reduces employment in the local labour market by 1 37 the employment decline is largely driven by employed workers becoming unemployed or non employed rather than out migrating to different commuting zones we also find that a one percentage point increase in the payroll rate tax leads to a decline in wages in the local labour market of 0 32 which means that firms were able to shift some of their increased payroll costs to workers wages while the pass through rate is lower than that found for the us e g anderson and meyer 1997 it is comparable to that found by holmlund 1983 and johansen and klette 1997 for earlier periods in sweden and norway the effectiveness of payroll tax incentives the effectiveness of these place based incentives in stimulating local employment depends on how flexibly wages can adjust to a tax change in settings in which rising labour costs for firms are easily shifted to worker wages we would expect no changes in employment levels in response to payroll tax hikes anderson and meyer 1997 2000 gruber 1997 in contrast in situations in which wages cannot fully adjust employment levels may be responsive to payroll tax changes kugler and kugler 2009 cruces et al 2010 saez et

cristina fernández de kirchner raised the ante in argentina s debt restructuring talks with the international monetary fund this week slamming the fund s officials as they arrived in buenos aires for crucial negotiations while economy minister martín guzmán s report to congress on wednesday was supposed to be the official update on argentina s debt situation this week he was in many ways upstaged the previous day by vicepresident fernández de kirchner who became the first senior argentine official to inject the word haircut into the panoply of solutions a haircut was in order insisted fernández de kirchner from cuba because the imf had broken its own rules in granting the mauricio macri administration the biggest loan in its history us 56 billion of which us 44 billion was transferred in order to finance capital flight this assertion was swiftly and emphatically denied by both imf spokesman gerry rice and various argentine economists and politicians but it was upheld by president alberto fernández who called her diagnosis highly pertinent while neither accepting nor rejecting the vice president s claim that the mega credit had been used for capital flight rice insisted that what would be a violation of imf statutes would be a haircut which is expressly ruled out for any loan recipient the outgoing macri administration has reported that us 37 15 billion of the us 44 billion had gone on repaying debt the former president was the first official to introduce the word haircut into the debt debate but not the first person the idea of a haircut had been trailed previously by none other than guzmán s mentor the 2001 nobel economics prize winner joseph stiglitz who last month said the reality is there will have to be significant haircuts it would be fantasy to think otherwise when commenting on argentina s debt situation during an interview at the world economic forum in davos the government is attempting to restructure a foreign debt of more than us 100 billion argentina s total external debt is us 311 billion according to the latest figures of which it owes us 44 billion to the imf mission arrives on the same day guzmán was addressing congress an imf mission team headed by western hemisphere assistant director julia kozack and argentina specialist luis cubeddu arrived for its first formal talks with the fernández administration it did not receive the friendliest of welcomes either inside or beyond congress in congress guzmán while speaking positively about the imf s new leadership after meeting kristalina georgieva in rome earlier this month said that the monetary institution was co responsible for argentina s economic crisis implying that it should be more flexible in consequence and the same day an antiimf demonstration organised by picket groups and some trade unions converged on congress after assembling along the 9 de julio thoroughfare the organisers claimed a turnout of 60 000 which did not seem too exaggerated from the photographic evidence the imf was also given scant hope for a rapid return of their money when guzmán told congress that argentina would not be returning to fiscal surplus until 2023 with no deficit reduction at all this year which would thus be the earliest date on which debt repayment could resume but guzmán was guarded even about 2023 saying it would be imprudent to make any long range fiscal forecasts while argentina s debt remains unsustainable offering at least three different scenarios major debt restructuring would be needed guzmán also said without actually using the h word haircut pioneered by his mentor but disappointment would not be limited to the imf he declared it s clear that there s going to be frustration on the part of bondholders he said adding in a fiercer tone we re not going to allow foreign funds to set the guidelines for macro economic policy ruling out any austerity such comments set a tone for tense negotiations with bondholders including major investment funds such as blackrock and fidelity with a formal offer due in mid march with the talks due to finish by the end of next month according to the government s tight timeline but at least he gave investors assurance that argentina s bonds under new york laws will not be treated differently than bonds under local law on tuesday the latter took a hit when the government failed to talk af20 bondholders into an unfavourable bond swap by the deadline all capital payments superior to us 20 000 were deferred until september 30 but the totality of interest and all capital under that sum accounting for 91 5 percent of bondholders were repaid costing the treasury 15 3 billion this national reprofiling came just a week after buenos aires province was forced to repay its bp 21 bond in full funds organise investors have been fearing an aggressive debt restructuring since august when fernández defeated ex leader mauricio macri in august s paso primary elections by a far wider margin than any poll had forecast the peso and sovereign bonds prices have since plunged on friday bloomberg reported that monarch alternative capital lp is spearheading a group of hedge funds who are organising ahead of debt restructuring talks with argentina
a t 128 months and counting america s economic expansion is the longest on record longevity has not come easily the expansion trundled along despite global manufacturing downturns in 2016 and 2019 conflicts over trade and a bout of monetary tightening by the federal reserve the recovery ploughed ahead last year even as business investment decelerated and residential construction investment shrank thanks to rock steady growth in personal consumption the durability of spending is a testament to one of this expansion s more unusual features faster growth in wages for workers at the bottom of the income distribution than for high earners improved fortunes for low wage workers may it seems be an underappreciated contributor to the sustainability of economic booms listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element since the turn of the millennium demand not supply has been the binding constraint on economic growth quiescent inflation suggests that spending has only rarely bumped up against the economy s production capacity over this period annual inflation has been just 1 8 on average down from about 3 5 during the preceding 20 years and 4 5 in the two decades before that economists have offered several explanations for chronically weak demand from the ageing of the workforce to a suppression of investment appetites caused by a slowdown in technological progress inequality is also thought to have played an important role richer households are far more likely to save an additional dollar earned than poorer ones rising inequality by raising the income share of the well off thus tends to drain the economy of demand between 1979 and 2018 the real wages of workers in the 90th percentile of the income distribution rose by 34 according to a recent analysis by jay shambaugh and ryan nunn of the brookings institution a think tank pay for those at the tenth percentile in contrast rose by less than 5 and wages for those at the fifth percentile declined spending suffered accordingly in an analysis published in 2012 alan krueger a labour economist reckoned that were it not for the increase in inequality between 1979 and 2007 consumption across the american economy would have been 5 higher that would add stimulus of about 700bn to today s economy as ever more of the income generated in the economy flowed to thrifty households the fed found itself working ever harder to coax enough spending to keep job growth and inflation from falling the average level of the fed s main policy interest rate which was just under 10 in the 1980s dropped to below 1 in the 2010s purchasing power eventually made its way into the hands of those more likely to spend but through the extension of credit rather than through fatter pay packets household debt in america as a share of gdp roughly doubled between 1979 and 2007 it leapt by nearly 30 percentage points between 2000 and 2007 alone when the flow of money from savers to spenders was turned into a gush by low interest rates soaring house prices and a collapse in mortgage lending standards without so much borrowing america s economy might well have only stumbled along in a state of permanent sluggishness the recent recovery looks very different from the pattern established in the 1990s and 2000s from 2014 to 2018 pay in low wage industries grew about as quickly as that in other parts of the economy according to a recent analysis by economists at indeed hiring lab a labour market research group and over the past two years wage growth at the bottom has been substantially faster than that in better paying industries see chart rising pay for low earners has put more cash in the hands of those most likely to spend supporting consumption and helping the economy weather a soft patch at the same time household debt which plunged immediately after the global financial crisis has continued to fall as a share of gdp over the past few years lower debt levels have in turn contributed to a more durable expansion one that is less likely to be choked off by changing credit conditions or higher borrowing costs stemming from interest rate increases like those imposed by the fed from 2015 to 2018 more for your money rising wages reflect the gradual tightening of the labour market over the past decade as the recovery proceeded the unemployment rate dropped to its lowest level in half a century forcing firms to search ever harder to find the worker they needed and as employment growth has continued the share of working age adults participating in the workforce has risen people on the margins of the labour market have been lured in by firms offering more generous wages much of the unusually rapid growth in the pay of low wage workers however is probably due to increases in minimum wage rates although the federal minimum wage has been stuck at 7 25 an hour for over a decade many state and local governments have in recent years passed increases that push the rate far above it as a consequence ernie tedeschi an economist at evercore isi a research firm found in 2019 that the average person working at the minimum wage actually earns close to 12 per hour this effective wage once adjusted for inflation has jumped by roughly a third over the past ten years continued strength in wage growth for low earners cannot be taken for granted for now companies are still keen to hire more staff and political enthusiasm for minimum wage rises continues to grow most democratic presidential candidates favour a federal minimum wage of at least 15 an hour but the forces pushing in the direction of higher inequality are mulishly persistent an analysis published in december by the congressional budget office projects that the share of pre tax income flowing to the top 1 will have begun rising once more by 2021 strikingly and in part due to president donald trump s tax reforms growth in income after taxes and transfers are taken into account is forecast to be even more skewed in favour of the rich but policy can change and the prospect of a strong and sturdy expansion ought to prove powerfully persuasive

talkin bout my generation photo joe raedle getty images the kids are all left or almost all democratic voters under 30 are anyway blue america s gaping chasm of a generation gap has been a if not the defining feature of the democratic primary race thus far an economist yougov poll released this week found that 60 percent of democrats younger than 30 support either bernie sanders or elizabeth warren among those 65 and older the progressive candidates combined total was 27 percent before the vermont senator s strong showings in iowa and new hampshire surveys showed an even wider age divide in late january quinnipiac had joe biden leading the field nationally even as he trailed bernie sanders among voters 35 and younger by a margin of 53 to 3 percent exit polls from new hampshire affirmed this generational split with sanders winning 47 percent of voters 18 to 29 but just 15 percent of those over 65 that young people are clamoring for radical left wing reform in such exceptional numbers would be noteworthy enough were it confined to the united states but the phenomenon is apparent throughout the anglophone world millennial leftists lifted jeremy corbyn to the leadership of britain s labour party and their peers would have put him in 10 downing street if they d had their druthers exit polls of the 2019 british election found corbyn s party winning voters under 30 by roughly 55 percent even as it claimed just 14 percent of those over 70 and just this week young irish voters propelled their nation s leftwing party sinn féin to a surprise popular vote victory in ireland s parliamentary elections so what s the matter with kids these days america s glibbest pundits have attributed sanders s youth support to the perennial idealist naïveté of the post adolescent but it isn t actually the case that young voters have forever and always been left wing in exit polls of the 1984 election ronald reagan won voters under 25 by a margin of 61 to 39 percent developmental psychology can t tell us why so many of pete buttigieg s peers pine for class war others attribute millennials aberrant fondness for socialism to the soviet union s disappearance into the dustbin of history americans who were either unborn or barely sentient during the cold war s denouement were bound to find egalitarian economic ideas more appealing than their forebears many of whom spent their formative years cowering beneath their classroom desks in anticipation of nuclear annihilation at the hands of the reds and this is surely part of the story but even if the cold war s end was a necessary condition for youth leftism it was scarcely a sufficient one after all the first post soviet decade witnessed the opposite of socialist revival across the western world as center left parties moved right and stock markets shot up for this reason most competent commentators give the great recession a starring role in their narratives about the sanders phenomenon their story is straightforward americans under 35 saw capitalism discredit itself in world historic fashion while their worldviews were still taking shape they proceeded to watch a putatively liberal government bail out the very financial institutions whose malfeasance had birthed the crisis and then preside over a historically weak recovery that left many a millennial college graduate debt burdened and underemployed this created a burgeoning market for market skeptical critiques of democratic politics as usual and progressives and socialists ably served it i think this narrative is largely right but incomplete the 2008 crash was central to the radicalization of the millennial and gen z cohorts but the broader economic system that both enabled and survived that crash is also implicated vox s matthew yglesias is among those who ve entertained the opposite view during an interview with economist karl smith last year yglesias suggested that american policymakers may have accidentally engineered a marxist revival in the wake of the great recession by refusing to supply the economy with the scale of fiscal and monetary stimulus necessary for promptly restoring full employment and yglesias is doubtlessly correct that congress superstitious fear of deficits and the federal reserve s paranoia about inflation conspired to needlessly prolong mass unemployment and wage stagnation during the post 2008 recovery it seems likely that this policy failure expanded the audience for radical critiques of the existing order but the tentative conclusion that yglesias draws from these premises that a swift return to full employment would have rendered millennial and zoomer leftism a marginal phenomenon is probably wrong to see why consider three remarkable data points from this column by bloomberg s alexandra tanzi and katia dmitrieva 1 the unemployment rate among recent college graduates in the u s is now higher than our country s overall unemployment rate for the first time in over two decades 2 more than 40 percent of recent college graduates are working jobs that do not traditionally require a bachelor s degree while one in eight are stuck in posts that pay 25 000 or less and 3 the median income among the bottom half of college graduates is roughly 10 percent lower than it was three decades ago that last point is illustrated in this exceptionally revealing chart photo courtesy of bloomberg thanks to a combination of the obama era s slow but steady wage and employment gains and the trump presidency s bonanza of deficit spending and loose money america has returned to something resembling full employment the percentage of americans who are looking for a job but can t find one is now near half century lows and yet the full employment economy that awaits this year s graduating class looks quite different than the one that welcomed their gen x and boomer predecessors in earlier boom times the labor market evinced an insatiable demand for white collar workers today s by contrast has more aspiring professionals than it knows what to do with and the same can be said of the economy that greeted matriculating corbynites in the u k put differently even as the price of a college diploma has risen nigh exponentially thereby forcing the rising generation of college graduates to saddle themselves with onerous debts the value of such diplomas on the u s job market has rapidly depreciated and there is little reason to believe that this state of affairs will change no matter how long the present boom is sustained according to the labor department s estimates the five fastest growing occupations in the united states over the next ten years will be solar panel installers wind turbine technicians home health aides personal care aides and occupational therapy assistants not a single one of those jobs requires a four year college diploma only occupational therapy assistants need an associate s degree throughout my 1990s childhood and adolescence leaders in both major parties heralded the arrival of a knowledge economy and attributed rising income inequality to a skills gap our economic system was still capable of providing a broad middle class with high wage high quality jobs it just needed more americans to accrue the levels of skill and education that the jobs of tomorrow required there was an endless supply of cushy professional class posts awaiting those who answered our economy s demand for highly educated workers economic security would come to those who did their homework but this story has proven to be little more than a self flattering delusion of our highly educated political class our economy only needs so many lawyers consultants and financial analysts let alone journalists nor as presently structured can it sustain an ever growing caste of well remunerated coders we have a lot of elderly people who need help going to the bathroom and a lot of manual labor that our robots aren t dexterous enough to perform most of the work that our society truly needs to get done every day doesn t require elite academic or intellectual capacities and thanks to the collapse of the american labor movement most that blue and pink collar work pays terribly the two occupations poised to add the most jobs to our economy over the next ten years home and personal care aides pay an average salary of about 24 000 a year a vulgar marxist looking at bloomberg s chart might predict that the college students and graduates of less prestigious public universities who have been most disserved by the knowledge economy myth would be even more inclined toward left wing politics than their ivy league peers and the results of the new hampshire primary lend credence to that view while pete buttigieg held his own in the town of hanover home to dartmouth sanders cleaned his clock in the precincts surrounding the university of new hampshire to be sure college graduates still account for a minority of americans under 35 but whereas this white collar subsection of previous rising generations was predisposed to view the market economy more favorably than their less educated peers millennial matriculators largely don t in fact the overeducated precariously employed college graduate is the modal millennial socialist which makes sense tell a subset of your population that they are entitled to economic security if they play by certain rules provide them with four years of training in critical thinking and access to a world class library then deny them the opportunities they were promised while affixing an anchor of debt around their necks and you ve got a recipe for a revolutionary vanguard
promises made promises kept has been one of president donald trump s frequent boasts in his campaign for a second term so it was a little awkward when his own proposed budget acknowledged in the fine print that several of his key promises haven t been kept at all when trump ran in 2016 he promised that if congress enacted big tax cuts for corporations economic growth would soar to 4 or more i actually think we can go higher he said he promised to balance the federal budget in eight years a longstanding republican aim that those economic growth rates could make possible neither goal is being met not even close in 2017 a republican congress approved trump s corporate tax cut it gave the economy a boost but only a temporary one growth reached 2 9 in 2018 but slowed to 2 3 last year it s running about 2 now according to private sector economists that has extended the long economic expansion that began under president barack obama as well as reduced unemployment and raised wages all good things but it s far short of trump s initial 4 promise and it s done nothing to balance the federal budget quite the contrary trump s tax cut ballooned the deficit by about 1 trillion a year and his new budget forecasts that pace to continue to which trump s budget chief said as he unveiled the new budget this week never mind this president is a promises made promises kept kind of president russell vought the acting director of the office of management and budget told reporters the promises are still there he said they ve just been scaled back they re also still wildly unrealistic trump s proposed budget forecasts 2 8 growth this year growing to a steady 3 after that those numbers are way above reputable economists estimates with 3 growth vought said the federal budget could come into balance 15 years from now in 2035 that s 10 years later than trump promised but who s counting his pie in the sky growth number is what budgeteers call a magic asterisk a statistical device that allows a president to claim that he s meeting his goals even when he s not obama and earlier presidents used them too but trump s election year budget plan uses a second magic asterisk to make the deficit look better it assumes that the federal reserve will keep interests low for the next 10 years which will reduce the cost of interest on the national debt that s a wish more than a forecast and a third magic asterisk maybe the biggest it assumes congress will enact all of trump s proposed cuts in domestic spending from obamacare and medicaid to environmental protection and the centers for disease control and prevention that s not going to happen house democrats have promised to resist draconian cuts in the social safety net health and the environment just as they did last year and the year before republicans in the senate have rejected many of trump s proposals too including cuts in farm subsidies and foreign aid many of his domestic spending proposals represent other broken promises when he ran last time trump pledged he would not touch medicaid he promised to replace obamacare with a better cheaper health insurance plan he vowed to protect clean air and clean water he s done none of those things presidents budgets are often little more than wish lists that congress politely ignores but trump s new budget with that mountain of magic asterisks is wholly untethered from reality but maybe that s not the point as trump reportedly told campaign donors last month who the hell cares about the budget his 2016 campaign promises were always unrealistic you can t cut taxes and balance the budget at the same time without cutting spending so deeply that even republicans will blink so trump blames democrats for failing to embrace the republican agenda of gutting domestic programs we have not been able to make progress because democrats in congress have opposed his previous budgets vought said we hope that changes we probably need to have a national election before it does translation if trump wins a second term and the gop takes control of the house those budget cuts will begin to look possible many moderate democrats want to be fiscally responsible just as republicans once were and still might be under a different president but if a democrat wins the white house the first thing gop leaders in congress will do is demand a balanced budget and claim that democrats are responsible for the 1 trillion deficit trump bequeathed them all the democratic presidential candidates say they would reverse trump s tax cuts republicans will say it s bad for growth and unfair to hardworking corporations they ll claim the only way to reduce the deficit is to cut domestic spending don t listen trump s fantasy budget proposal shows how cynical that argument is doyle mcmanus is a columnist for the los angeles times back to top

by joe foster portfolio manager and strategist for vaneck global geopolitical events support gold gold started the year driven by risks associated with geopolitical events on january 3 a u s drone attack on an iranian general in iraq led to a retaliatory strike by iran on a u s iraq military base on january 8 this enabled gold to briefly reach the 1 600 per ounce level for the first time since 2013 gold pulled back to its low for the month on january 14 but then trended higher with news of the coronavirus outbreak in china metals and crude oil prices fell sharply as the virus spread and markets worried about impacts on economic growth in china and beyond u s treasuries rallied and gold finished the month with a 71 89 per ounce 4 7 gain at 1 589 16 meanwhile gold stocks underperformed gold probably due to some mean reversion following strong outperformance in december gold price not indicative of physical demand the world gold council wgc reported that total gold demand fell 1 in 2019 consumer demand for jewelry bars and coins was especially weak falling 11 to a decade low mainly due to weakness in india and china given the decline in demand how is it that the gold price was able to advance 18 in 2019 it s because gold behaves more like a financial asset than a commodity physical demand drives commodities prices whereas financial demand drives gold prices strong buying from bullion exchange traded products and central banks for gold as a financial and currency hedge drove the price even though the volumetrically larger consumer demand was very weak investment demand in the paper market futures and over the counter also contributed to gains in 2019 we expect the same demand and price relationships to persist in 2020 if gold price strength continues it currently looks like gold is poised to trend through 1 600 per ounce in the first half of the year esg movement emerges as lifestyle demands fuel pollution around the world most people organizations corporations and governments have finally come to realize that there is too much pollution of all types and that the planet would be a better place if there was less of it our lifestyles are the fundamental drivers of pollution the cartoon below shows the average american will consume over 3 million pounds of the minerals metals and fuels needed to manufacture and build virtually everything around us europeans and japanese consume a similar amount while there are billions of others who aspire to attain the same wealth and conveniences as people in developed countries extracting and consuming such quantities creates pollution but who is willing to give up his or her flat screen car or vacation in order to reduce their carbon footprint there is a tremendous amount of discussion controversy and politics around the impact that pollution will have on the environment in the future out of this has emerged a broad based movement to mitigate the threat that pollution poses in finance this movement is known as esg environment social governance investing according to bloomberg assets invested using a broad definition of this approach reached 30 7 trillion at the start of 2018 esg investing has the best intentions however within the gold industry we believe it carries many shortcomings as it is currently being used esg ratings agencies score and rank companies based on their esg performance these agencies are becoming powerful gatekeepers as a growing number of investors use esg ratings to screen companies for further consideration unfortunately the precious metals industry ranks among the riskiest due to its environmental and social exposure unlike most industries mining companies cannot choose the climate community or location that is best suited for their business they must build in and around their ore deposits which are essentially scattered randomly around the world and usually in very remote places mining is also capital intensive requiring more heavy equipment material and energy than most businesses therefore we believe for an investor to compare the esg performance of a mining company to a retailer aerospace or semiconductor company is disingenuous generally the closer a sector is to the consumer or end user the lower the esg risk however in our view no other sector could exist without the basic materials that mining provides gold industry sets global esg principles each gold operation has hundreds of environmental and social criteria and many are unique to each operation gold companies we have spoken to engage regularly with the ratings agencies however they are concerned that the huge volume of esg information is overwhelming and that the agencies lack the capacity or expertise to do an adequate evaluation there are also concerns that ratings agencies have an over reliance on press and internet articles and non governmental organizations ngo reports for information we believe these often carry a negative bias against mining and lack a balanced third party perspective in addition there is a black box aspect and lack of standardization as to how each agency arrives at their rankings for example sustainalytics describes the core of their model as a list of subindustry beta indicators that generate so called beta signals that finally get added to the subindustry default beta value of 1 together with the qualitative overlay and the correction factor we doubt there are many investors that can relate to this description current esg ratings analysis also ignores the contribution mining has made to thousands of communities around the world mining creates jobs and brings health care and education to lesser developed countries where we believe few businesses or charities would operate in places like nevada western australia or canada mining supports much of the rural economy lifestyle and culture we believe that any esg analysis must incorporate on the ground performance in addition to the checklists and public information used by ratings agencies the gold industry has recognized the need for rigor and standardization in esg reporting to accomplish this in 2019 the industry backed wgc published responsible gold mining principles rgmp the rgmp sets ten esg principles containing 51 items for companies to report on the principles are a synthesis of a number of global standards already in use as well as input from a range of stakeholders and agencies they are aimed at providing investor and consumer confidence that gold is ethically sourced conformance with the principles will be insured annually through public reporting and a third party independent assurance conducted at both the mine site and corporate level companies that participate will be allowed a three year period of implementation with independent assurance beginning in the third year we expect all of the gold producers in which we invest to adopt rgmp the wgc has also set a lofty goal of net zero emissions by 2050 through process enhancement decarbonization of transport and electricity self sufficient energy and emissions off sets while the industry is already reducing emissions where it makes the most economic sense in our opinion meeting the 2050 goal will require further technical advances in renewable energy battery storage and electric vehicles that are beyond the gold industry s control companies stand ready to test and adopt new technologies but we believe widespread implementation is years from becoming reality managing environmental and social risk is nothing new to gold companies in fact it is among the most important aspects of their business we do not invest in companies that fail to strive for esg excellence however if investors avoid the broader mining industry due to what we see as unrealistic or misguided esg expectations the industry may become starved of capital needed to maintain production if taken to extreme we believe a lack of capital creates shortages and rising prices that could bring an unwanted inflationary cycle with world wide economic hardship download commentary pdf with fund specific information and performance

many medicines and medical tests are unaffordable to most of humanity owing to the ability of typically transnational pharmaceutical giants to abuse their monopoly powers enforced by intellectual property laws to set prices to maximise profits over the long term most basic research is funded by government grants and in recent years by philanthropic initiatives when a profitable opportunity

to be sure the city of delhi â a cossetted child of emperors starting with the great mughals â is spoilt silly on top of the bjpâ s rudderless leadership to get the national economy out of a rut or very possibly because of it comes a humiliating political defeat in the delhi assembly elections with arvind kejriwalâ s broom sweeping the congress completely out of the capitalâ s politics and limiting the bjp to single digits in the 70 member delhi assembly the dynamic gujarati narendra modi amit shah duo who rule india from delhi must be feeling the pinch of the thumbs down they got from 54 per cent of 10 million delhiites out of 15 million potential voters who cast their votes on february 8 coming as it does despite desperate efforts to play divisive politics â the signature winning political tune perfected since l k advaniâ s 1990 rathyatra to build a ram mandir â surely points to the need for a considerable rethink especially now as ram lalla rests easy in ayodhya admittedly delhi is an outlier it ties with goa for the highest per capita income in the country has high literacy levels and is a grab bag of domestic high achievers attracted to the capital by the opportunities offered â ranging from abundant well paid low skilled daily work to highly overpaid top echelon professionals and savvy business folk performance counts in delhi on that parameter the bjp has little to show while the aap merely points to the â positive lived experienceâ of delhi citizens in public services â electricity water the management of sewage education and health services the bjp rules at the municipality level but it has nothing much to show for it more important land management and the police which are under the lieutenant governor and through him the union government have remained pools of public dissatisfaction and discontent with none of the spiffy governance anticipated when narendra modi became prime minister in 2014 to be sure the city of delhi â a cossetted child of emperors starting with the great mughals â is spoilt silly it expects the earth from those who rule without cooperating in the least to give something back to the city but it is an international and a national bellwether purely because of its strategic location at the political and economic crossroads of domestic and global matters if the bjp is to recover from the series of recent body blows â rajasthan jharkhand and now delhi â some directional changes are needed over the next four years till 2024 first the bjp has retained around 39 per cent of the votes cast but reliance on the â modi magicâ to get past the post without a second line of credible and competent north indian leaders has cost it heavily delhi is used to a long line of emperors who conquer and then choose to settle down here and adopt it as their own the bjp has anticipated this need now by appointing j p nadda as party president â a himachali born and brought up in bihar but this is little more than a palliative in the face of an absent layer of high ranking north indian leaders â beyond rajnath singh â in key cabinet positions second the abnormal delay in firing on all three engines â private consumption public investment and exports â is felt keenly in delhi where new projects high consumption and exports drive the economy the budget for 2021 failed to provide the lift so eagerly awaited by urban india â jobs cheaper loans and incentives for investment the reserve bank has erred in not bringing the repo rate below the psychological five per cent level the initiative to free investment loans for specified purposes from the crr requirement are welcome but too timid between the statutory liquidity ratio and cash reserve ratio crr 22 25 per cent of a bankâ s assets are compulsorily sequestered in low return government debt which earns barely two percentage points more than the cost of bank term deposit rates the state bank of india has reduced its deposit rates now to lower its cost of funds sadly no thought was spared for the hapless lower middle class for whom a bank deposit is also a saving instrument for profits banks look to private lending at usurious rates ranging between nine house loan to 15 per cent car or commercial loan this is far too high to encourage spending unless accompanied by high inflation to deflate the real interest rate to a bearable 1 5 per cent per annum â which has not been the case since 2015 pulling the plug on fiscal restraint was the only way to go but arun jaitleyâ s legacy of â fiscal proprietyâ â as defined by the washington consensus â still rules like a staid aunt third l k advaniâ s rathyatra gambit seems to have come to its end divide and rule makes sense only if you retain a core group of supporters who stand to benefit from you this group has rapidly shrunk industry and business â once the rally boys of the bjp â now look a worried lot as delhi acquires undertones of imperious beijing indian entrepreneurs areâ well indian in their rambunctiousness they dislike too much restraint unless it is aimed at their competitors the governance style emerging out of delhi is far too authoritarian to assuage the average businessperson long used to a laidback wink wink nod nod non competitive environment this explains the overtures made recently by the government to raise tariff walls for the import of a range of goods expect many more similar actions to reach out to the core base of the bjp â hindu voters from the upper and middle castes in the belt stretching from rajasthan to bihar across north and central india with a focus on urban and peri urban areas dalits rural india and contested territories in the south and east are likely to be reduced to collateral political reserves to be accessed on a transactional basis when beneficial this does not augur well in the immediate future for strategic fiscal reforms in inter state governance â devolution decentralisation and enhanced federalism or for structural reforms in labour land management and agriculture consequently growth will remain sluggish till the financial sector outgrows the drag of its stressed assets public debt levels may breach prudential levels and government allocations are likely to become even more skewed to benefit specific interest groups â like big farmers â as the bjp gears up for state elections in predominantly agricultural bihar in october this year and later in uttar pradesh in february 2022

funding transportation projects has become a major problem for illinois as it has for many other states profligate spending is an issue that has long plagued transportation funding inflated labor costs and big bureaucracy often increase the costs of infrastructure projects far above initial estimates as more fuel efficient vehicles enter the market gasoline tax revenues will continue to decline consequently state lawmakers need to consider more modern and effective ways to fund road construction and traffic infrastructure any proposal increasing the gas tax ignores the mounting evidence showing gasoline levies are a regressive form of taxation that have increasingly left transportation systems shortchanged in recent years the rise of fuel efficient cars has decreased motor fuel tax coffers and disproportionately shifted the burden to low income drivers a group that typically owns older less fuel efficient vehicles illinois took a step in the wrong direction in 2019 when lawmakers passed legislation that doubled the motor fuel tax set at the state level to 38 cents from 19 cents per gallon this hike which went into effect in july 2019 will increase each year based on a formula tied to inflation a mechanism known as indexing the increases are limited to a maximum of 1 cent per year the 2019 fuel tax hike moved illinois from having the 10th highest overall gas tax burden in the nation to the third highest according to the tax foundation the illinois policy institute ipi expects the gas tax will take 1 2 billion more from illinois drivers or an average of 100 more per driver in the first year alone one of the main reasons the prairie state s gas taxes are amongst the highest in the nation is because illinois is one of only seven states that also applies a sales tax to gasoline purchases which is added on top of state and local motor fuel taxes in addition to the state tax the 2019 legislation also allow chicago and the collar counties around chicago to increase their local gas taxes chicago by 3 cents dupage kane mchenry lake and will counties to 8 cents per gallon these additional hikes could make illinois average gas tax burden the highest or second highest in the nation a new bill recently proposed in the illinois general assembly would compound this mistake by allowing non home rule local governments to create a municipal gas tax on top of state and federal gas taxes the new bill senate bill 2978 would allow municipal governments to impose an extra 3 cent per gallon gas tax on consumers local municipalities would be able to impose a tax only in one cent increments at a rate not to exceed 0 03 per gallon these taxes would be especially difficult to administer because gas retailers will have to track and impose several different local taxes in 2015 daniel vock writing for governing analyzed state gas tax data reported to the u s census bureau and found two thirds of state fuel taxes failed to keep up with inflation leading to dramatic reductions in fuel tax revenue in a maryland public policy institute study wendell cox and ronald utt argue gas taxes have a significantly greater detrimental effect on lower and middle income families than they do on the wealthy moreover americans for prosperity estimates lower gas prices amount to approximately 100 in additional income per month for an average family ipi argues legislators should consider the inflated cost of public construction projects in illinois before they allow any tax or fee hikes austin berg director of content strategy for the illinois policy institute points to high compensation costs for illinois workers illinois has the highest workers compensation costs in the midwest and prevailing wage requirements as key cost drivers for illinois transportation projects as an example berg compared illinois to indiana and found indiana s average workers compensation insurance premium costs made up only 4 percent of an average payroll compared to 22 percent in illinois it is not appropriate to add the burden of additional tax or fee increases on households that are already cash strapped even worse a gas tax hike would raise prices on goods and services throughout the economy because virtually all consumer goods are transported using gasoline powered vehicles in fact nearly 70 percent of all freight transported annually in the united states accounting for manufactured and retail goods worth 671 billion is transported by truck according to truckinfo net businesses will simply pass the added costs on to consumers illinois will have to explore more efficient ways to fund road construction and traffic infrastructure these include privatizing roads and expanding toll systems in several cities transportation agencies are using congestion pricing varying toll prices based on congestion to manage demand and limit traffic problems the following documents provide additional information about how motor fuel taxes are applied and their effect on the economy hosed at the pump illinois gas taxes this article from the illinois policy institute discusses the state gasoline sales tax how it harms illinois drivers and why this high tax is inefficient and unnecessary illinois is one of only seven states charging a sales tax at the gas pump illinois should follow the lead of the 43 states that don t charge a sales tax on gasoline and end this practice saving taxpayers millions of dollars senate bill would double illinois state gas tax vincent caruso of the illinois policy institute examines the proposed gasoline tax hike and how it would add a substantial burden to illinois drivers and the economy dispelling the myths toll and fuel tax collection costs in the 21st century in this reason foundation policy study daryl s fleming examines all electronic tolling its basic operations plan and business model the primary factors affecting toll collection costs and a number of reforms states can make to reduce the cost of toll collection 23rd annual highway report on the performance of state highway systems in this report the reason foundation ranks the performance of state highway systems in 11 categories including spending per mile pavement conditions deficient bridges traffic congestion and fatality rates state motor fuel taxes the american petroleum institute documents each state s current motor fuel taxes both gasoline and diesel alternatives to the motor fuel tax this report prepared by the center for urban studies at portland state university and submitted to the oregon department of transportation evaluates potential alternatives to motor fuel taxes the report also identifies the economic and technological problems that must be addressed when designing alternative revenue sources designing alternatives to state motor fuel taxes writing in transportation quarterly anthony m rufolo and robert l bertini consider the future of motor fuel taxes in a world in which more fuel efficient vehicles are rapidly becoming available they also report on the economic effects of road pricing as a substitute for fuel taxes paying at the pump gasoline taxes in america in this paper from the tax foundation jonathan williams argues gas taxes can be an effective means of funding transportation improvements in many cases however governments exploit the taxes for political reasons spending them on projects unrelated to roads and other transportation projects research commentary congestion traffic pricing congestion pricing an alternative to gasoline taxes uses market principles to address traffic congestion under a congestion pricing model road operators charge a variable price based on congestion thereby managing demand and limiting congestion heartland senior policy analyst matthew glans examines several proposals for implementing pricing systems to alleviate traffic congestion raising gas taxes won t fix our bridges in this paper adrian moore of the reason foundation argues

bloomberg brazil s latest activity indicators are casting fresh doubt that latin america s largest economy will finally take off in 2020 after years of disappointing growth the economy expanded by just 0 89 in 2019 following a contraction of 0 27 in december according to the central bank s activity index which is a proxy for gross domestic product while the weak full year figure reported friday comes as no surprise signs that activity didn t keep pace with already muted expectations at the end of 2019 may impact estimates for this year which some analysts have already started to trim since assuming power over a year ago president jair bolsonaro s administration has pulled out all the stops in efforts to jump start growth policy makers have cut the benchmark interest rate to a record low amid tame inflation embarked on unprecedented sales of state controlled assets and enacted a long awaited pension reform that s set the stage for gdp growth to rise to 2 3 this year according the latest central bank survey of economists read more third time may be a charm for brazil s upbeat growth forecasts amid such optimism many analysts were taken aback by retail and industrial production figures that missed estimates in both november and december drops in closely watched categories such as food and beverage sales and capital goods production laid bare barriers including shaky confidence high unemployment and rising family indebtedness what our economist says the contraction in industrial output and retail sales at the margin do suggest a weak economic activity in december it is too soon to decree that monetary policy is not working but it is important to acknowledge that most of the monetary easing effect will come through an increase in demand adriana dupita a latin america economist with bloomberg economics new headwinds coming from half a world away are exacerbating growth concerns an outbreak of coronavirus is rattling china which is brazil s top trading partner and a key buyer of goods including soy cellulose and iron ore this week brazil s central bank warned that the virus may hit commodity prices and important financial assets read more brazil central bank adds to global warnings over coronavirus brazil s national statistics institute will publish the official fourth quarter and full year 2019 gdp figures on march 4 slow at first brazil central bank president roberto campos neto has said the pace of recovery tends to be slower at first given that growth is now being driven by the private sector following years of loose public spending in an interview late wednesday with globonews he reiterated that this year s gdp expansion will be around 2 to be sure there are some signs that the economy is gaining traction outstanding loans recently posted their largest monthly jump in five years and government officials expect job creation to accelerate further brazil s services sector has consistently outperformed others such as industry for paulo gala economist at fator asset management such disparities point to an uneven and slow recovery industry is creating very few jobs and as a whole a lot of the positions being created are in services with low productivity and technology said gala who is also a professor at fundacao getulio vargas a business school many of the government s proposed reforms don t tackle this situation we are not overcoming the slump in productivity with high tech bakeries with assistance from rafael mendes to contact the reporter on this story mario sergio lima in brasilia newsroom at mlima11 bloomberg net to contact the editors responsible for this story juan pablo spinetto at jspinetto bloomberg net matthew malinowski julia leite 2020 bloomberg l p
a week ago at an emergency meeting of the opec s joint technical committee russia refused to agree to the cartel s proposal to reduce production by an additional 600 000 barrels per day bpd explaining russia s position energy minister alexander novak said that in order to make such a decision it takes time to evaluate the effect of coronavirus on the oil market it is really not yet clear how much the coronavirus will reduce global demand for crude oil in february amid the unfolding epidemic opec lowered its demand growth forecast for 2020 by 230 000 bpd to 0 99 million bpd the oxford institute for energy studies is more pessimistic according to its estimates in china alone demand in q1 2020 will decrease by at least 500 000 bpd russian energy minister novak on the other hand retains moderate optimism believing that the global decline will not exceed 200 000 bpd an elusive asian market however even if the coronavirus turns out to cause more damage than the most pessimistic estimates russia should still not further reduce its oil production on the contrary it s time to start preparing for a phased exit from the opec deal this is first of all due to increasing competition in the asian market where russian companies have redirected exports in recent years according to bp from 2016 to 2018 russia reduced oil supplies to europe by 14 percent from 177 4 million to 153 3 million tons while increasing exports to china and india by more than a third from 52 8 million to 73 8 million tons a similar strategy was employed by saudi arabia which over the same period managed to compensate for the reduction in supplies to europe by 1 7 million tons with their total increase to india and china by 4 7 million tons the same applies to the united states which last year reduced its exports to china by more than twice their original value due to trade war 5 8 million tons compared to 12 6 million tons in 2018 according to refinitiv in the next couple of years the u s will inevitably increase exports as a result of the phase 1 trade deal in which china pledged to purchase 52 4 billion worth of oil liquefied natural gas lng and other energy products from the united states by the end of 2021 the increasing competition will complicate entry into asian markets for russian companies that intend to monetize east siberian oil reserves through exports this is not only the kuyumbinskoye field of gazprom neft and the yurubcheno tokhomskoye field of rosneft but also the lodochnoye tagulskoye vankorskoye and payakhskoye fields which are the basis of the vostok oil project which in itself is worth 10 trillion rubles over 157 billion which will increase russian gdp by 2 annually according to the estimates of rosneft ceo igor sechin the increase in production at these fields will inevitably lead to non compliance with the opec output cut deal which the cartel hopes will keep oil prices above 60 per barrel however such a price level is disadvantageous for the chinese and indian economies which in 2019 showed the lowest growth rates over the past 30 and 11 years respectively 6 2 and 4 8 according to data from ihs markit this in turn slows down oil demand the international energy agency predicted a quarterly decline for china back in december from 13 84 million bpd in q4 2019 to 13 53 million bpd in q1 2020 when the coronavirus had not yet affected the commodity markets the us market a dangerous alternative in this regard the fall in oil prices will certainly spur demand in india and china and may therefore be beneficial for russia for which the asian market is the only reliable alternative to supplies to europe the american market can hardly claim the role of being such an alternative in the long run even if in 2019 russia entered the top three largest suppliers of oil and petroleum products to the united states increasing exports from 9 9 million bpd in january to 20 9 million bpd in october according to the us energy information administration eia this jump in exports can be credited to the u s sanctions on venezuela which since july 2019 has not delivered a single barrel of oil or petroleum products to the united states the same applies to iran whose crude exports fell from 1 2 million bpd in january 2019 to 0 1 million bpd in january 2020 according to refinitiv if the geopolitical situation changes traditional suppliers will surely return to the american market which is a risk for russian companies and at the same time they will face a decrease in us dependence on commodity imports in reality this is already happening in september american exports of oil and petroleum products exceeded imports for the first time since 1973 when statistical observations began in november net exports exports minus imports reached 771 000 bpd in the united states in 2020 it will increase to 790 000 bpd according to the february forecast by the eia and in 2021 this number is expected go up to 1 16 million bpd it is likely that the actual figures will exceed forecasts as consolidation has already begun in the american shale industry which will in turn contribute to its financial recovery this is evidenced not only by the acquisition of anadarko by occidental 57 billion which agreed to take over the debt of its former competitor but also by the recent transactions between relatively small oil producing companies in the permian basin callon and carrizo 2 74 billion wpx and felix 2 50 billion as well as parsley and jagged peak 2 27 billion coronavirus as a catalyst for change improving financial stability will not only support the growth of oil production but also future exports besides consolidation in the shale patch increasing investment in the u s gulf coast export facilities is expected to boost exports to 8 4 million bpd by 2024 according to last year s iea forecast this will help the united states come closer to russia and saudi arabia in terms of export volume 5 5 million and 7 2 million bpd according to the bp data for 2018 for opec and russia it is better to prepare for such a turn ahead of time than to wait for the moment when the policy of reducing production will finally lose its economic meaning in this context the coronavirus is just a catalyst for processes that have been taking place in the market for a long time it is self evident for russia that it should move towards a phased exit from the opec deal in order to prevent losing market share to its competitors for opec this is nothing new it has seen its share in global oil production fall from 38 6 percent in q4 2016 when the first opec agreement was signed to 34 1 percent in q4 2019 according to refinitiv while the share of oecd countries grew from 27 6 percent to 32 4 percent a further decrease in market share will inevitably reduce the cartel s influence on oil prices therefore it is reasonable for russia to shift the responsibility for reducing oil production entirely to saudi arabia which within the framework of existing agreements can expand its own quota for reducing production by 400 000 bpd up to 900 000 bpd to the level of october 2018 such a decision could be a first step towards a gradual suspension of the agreements which will allow russia to compete in the global oil market and not just remain a passive witness by dr fared kilzie for oilprice com
the us currency is having its best start to a year since 2015 defying the expectations of many forecasters and potentially adding global growth headwinds the bloomberg dollar index has climbed 1 9 since the end of december spurred in part by demand for havens as the global spread of the wuhan coronavirus and other uncertainties dent investor appetite for riskier assets the greenback which is up against all of its group of 10 peers in 2020 has also benefited from stable us economic data and bond yields that remain high relative to the rest of the world even as interest rates

it s a 4 8 trillion whopper of a budget which reflects generally conservative priorities like cuts to foreign aid environmental protection federal education programs and transportation it also would slow growth in medicaid from an automatic increase of 5 percent to a more modest 2 percent in dc when you reduce the rate of automatic growth of a government program the reduction is denounced as a cut the president has proposed a budget for 2021 as is his duty but don t expect it to pass unscathed the left is already pronouncing it doa and there is enough in the proposal to make just about everybody mad at him the fundamental flaw which stands out immediately is that it requires 3 percent economic growth for the next 15 years to have even the slimmest hope of balancing itself and reducing the deficit recalling reforms to welfare state programs under the clinton administration which were ended under the obama administration trump s budget calls for work requirements for public assistance programs will not be popular with democrats putting your mortgage on your visa card most of the budget s deficit reduction measures come from cuts to discretionary spending which amounts to only about 40 percent of the total budget while mandatory spending programs like social security medicare and medicaid reach now almost 60 percent it wasn t always that way in the 1960s mandatory spending was only 33 percent of the budget but ever since then it has been swallowing more and more of the total it is projected to be 80 percent of the budget by the next 10 years and that is the real problem the country is facing eventually entitlement programs like these will take over the entire budget and discretionary spending on things like the national defense will be added to a deficit that is expected to become 80 percent of our gdp imagine paying all your bills with cash but putting your mortgage on your visa card and you get the idea there is an argument that goes if the economy is prosperous then fewer people need social welfare programs and we can reduce their burden that way there is some merit to that but it s offset by demographics the babyboomer generation is aging out of the workforce at a rate of 10 000 a day that means that 3 650 000 boomers are reaching age 65 and become eligible for benefits from social security and medicare all the boomers will have reached age 65 by 2030 that s over 36 million people eligible for these mandatory spending programs the largest number of americans ever eligible in history this means that the automatic spending needed to fund these programs will dramatically increase even as the number of people paying into these programs in the workplace decreases as far as i can tell the budget does not account for the demographic bomb falling on these programs it seems to assume that the demand will remain a flat line which it could if the retirees were denied the benefits or the healthcare that would allow them to live much past retirement age and if you don t think that denying care to the elderly would not be a method of controlling costs in a one payer healthcare system you are kidding yourself it will be a feature of that kind of system just as it is in other countries where it has been used in 2016 then candidate trump had promised that he would eliminate the entire national debt in eight years by growing the economy by 8 percent a year which would produce a corresponding increase in tax revenue that would be used to pay off that debt economic growth has averaged about 3 percent and long term projections expect that two to three percent is as good as it will get rather than reduce the debt president trump added over 1 trillion a year to it in the past three years the president has a reasonable track record for keeping the promises he made to get elected and the budget deficit was definitely one of them but this budget doesn t even come close

venezuelan leader nicolas maduro s quiet move to restore elements of free enterprise to his nation s economy should serve as a cautionary tale for anyone listening to sen bernie sanders siren song of socialism in the democratic primaries or who is still tempted by promises of socialist bliss maduro s move represents a desperate attempt to dampen public outrage and thus maintain his grip on power in the midst of an astonishing economic collapse that economists view as the world s worst in decades in the absence of war venezuela s tale is hardly a unique one in recent decades socialist nations across the world have scrapped their doctrinaire visions and incorporated elements of free enterprise to rescue their ailing economies perhaps most striking a post mao china opted for a more market based economy as deng xiaoping conceded that his nation could not otherwise compete with the united states maduro s bow to reality is particularly instructive it comes a decade after the great recession and financial collapse of 2008 and 2009 shook confidence in capitalism and emboldened the proponents of socialism and other alternative models with that crisis long over however capitalism has again proved its mettle by nourishing more prosperity and higher living standards while venezuela s economy continues shrinking at an alarming rate the fight for survival has forced the government to become pragmatic ramiro molina an economist at caracas andres bello catholic university told the new york times only the narrative is still socialist it is a striking departure for maduro for he was the like minded successor to hugo chavez a hard core socialist who sought to ignite a bolivarian revolution across the region until his death in 2013 chavez was elected in 1998 on a wave of public revulsion at government corruption he quickly nationalized industries seized farms and businesses pushed through constitutional changes to enhance his power and as an emboldened and petty despot cracked down on dissent of any kind though he first nourished populist support by using oil revenues to fund programs for the poor the socialist vision that drove his economic mismanagement led to soaring inflation exploding public debt and shortages of such necessities as food medicine water and electricity maduro who took over after chavez died doubled down on that socialist vision exacerbating the economic problems today venezuela is a basket case of epic proportions its economy has shrunk by more than two thirds since 2013 incomes have fallen to their lowest levels in decades hyperinflation wreaks havoc with savings and purchasing and people scavenge for food and collect firewood to survive while food medicine water and gas remain in short supply across the country public services have collapsed gangs control entire towns looters ransack businesses spotty electricity leaves towns without banking cellphone and other services for days at a time store owners try to stay in business by repairing power lines on their own butchers sell offal fat shavings and calves hooves because consumers can t afford meat and at least three million venezuelans have fled the country after years of nationalizing businesses and setting consumer prices however maduro is now changing course while retaining his socialist rhetoric to encourage business activity he s cutting red tape with the nation s currency the bolivar essentially worthless he s welcoming dollars back into currency nowhere are his efforts more striking than in the oil sector long considered the jewel of venezuela s economy generating the revenues that in good times could finance public needs private companies are now essentially running the oil business from pumping the oil to paying the workers maduro s move toward free enterprise is having an impact stabilizing oil exports bringing the city of caracas back to life and giving the nation s upper crust new opportunities to stash and spend money whether that will be enough for him to retain power however is an open question maduro s outreach to private oil companies has raised complicated issues for president donald trump who sanctioned venezuela s state owned oil company petroleos de venezuela s a or pdvsa in january of 2019 after maduro declared himself the victor in an election that many viewed as rigged washington quickly recognized opposition leader juan guaido as the nation s legitimate ruler called for maduro s ouster and imposed sanctions to weaken his grip on power nevertheless the u s oil giant chevron is among the oil companies which include russia s state run rosneft as well as european and chinese companies that are reviving venezuela s oil sector while expressing concern about chevron s activities the administration has given the company exemptions from sanctions recognizing that chevron s exit would simply leave the playing field to non u s companies as it mulls its next move washington should do nothing to discourage maduro s dalliance with free enterprise that s because a world of freer economies offers more u s trade and investment opportunities creating more prosperity back home lawrence j

in the observer of 26th january fintan o toole of the irish times wrote the central idea of brexit is part of the 18th and 19th century european culture the nation state as the primary locus of political loyalty and as the collective manifestation of a unified people but here is the irony britain is not and never has been a nation state for most of its history as a state it has been at the heart not of a national polity but of a vast multinational and polyglot empire and the uk is itself a four nation amalgam of 4 countries england scotland wales and northern ireland there is no single pre eu uk nation to return to publicité on the other hand dean acheson the secretary of state under truman 1949 1953 said great britain has lost an empire and failed to find a role in 1973 the uk joined the eec and in the 2016 referendum the majority although a small one voted to come out of the eu britain s itinerary in europe has been punctuated with many problems with integration into the european system within that space therein lies the brexit problematique and the dilemmas of going forward taking back control became the main brexit slogan although britain played a major part in enacting european legislation huge discontents after ww2 the whole economic configuration of the world changed the usa free from the carnage and destruction that europe had witnessed came out of it the strongest and fearing a soviet takeover of western europe launched the marshall plan for the reconstruction of the war ravaged countries britain was going to lose india and other colonies later the commonwealth could not replace the same kudos as all the members are theoretically equal wanting to avoid future wars germany france italy and the benelux countries created the european coal and steel community later to be called the european economic community britain still angst ridden with the loss of empire was initially ambivalent about joining to such an extent that french president de gaulle opposed their application to join several times in the uk there was always strong opposition to join although ted heath took them in in 1973 and that was confirmed by a later referendum in 1975 a strange way to do things one would say when margaret thatcher took over opposition to europe became more vociferous and niggly although thatcher did support the enlargement of the union britain kept its aloofness from any developments thereby creating frustration on the part of the europeans who wanted more integration during that time the eurosceptics were getting stronger in the tory party and labour was becoming more europhile the big dilemma was control or influence those who wanted to join the whole system with its institutions wanted to control and those who wanted to keep a distance although being a member were quite happy to influence decisions for british interests therein lay the roots of brexit the uk wanting to steer a relatively independent course opted out of several sectors the social chapter schengen etc to be fair other countries had similar opt outs whereby they did not participate fully in certain policy areas the various treaties did create several opt outs for various countries later with the adoption of the euro there was the european central bank which was taking decisions affecting the eu and the uk felt left out in the cold there was a two speed europe the gulf became wider and in britain there were huge discontents the europhiles wanted to get in deeper so as not to miss any opportunities and the eurosceptics wanted more separation driving that euroscepticism was a harking back to the colonial days or some sort of union of all the white dominions canada australia new zealand also they are trying to find friends in the ex colonies as relations have been kept through the creation of the commonwealth recently the uk organised a seminar with representatives from africa to look at economic cooperation but not much came out of it especially as china has started to make its presence felt there while those same eurosceptics are not known for their warmth for immigrants from the new commonwealth their suddenly found internationalism beggars belief big store is being made of a treaty with the usa but then every country would look after its own interests first and foremost a new era has started for the uk outside the eu but not much is going to change during the transition period until the end of 2020 the 11 remaining months of 2020 will see the uk and the eu negotiating deals in several areas the main one being a trade deal given that both sides have a big stake in the trade between them they are very keen to keep what they have i e friction free trade as that would be less disruptive pm johnson would opt for a canada style agreement which means no tariff on physical goods but not on services as london is a major financial centre financial services would have to be negotiated separately for the uk to have that it would have to have the same standards as the eu in terms of the environment workers rights consumer rights if theresa may s government had been able to work with the labour opposition on those issues we would have had brexit much earlier and no johnson s government of course there are also the questions of fishing rights security and military cooperation and various forms of collaboration like the european space agency but the uk would not be able to have the same terms as before as that would also encourage other states to come out if they are not happy with certain things vide grexit brinkmanship during the transition period the uk will be able to conduct trade negotiations with other countries although they are already trading with countries who have negotiated terms with the eu who have used their 500 million market to get better terms in today s world protectionism is a big threat to so called free trade donald trump in his trade war with china has already imposed tariffs on goods coming from china and china has retaliated while free trade has lifted people out of poverty as some economists believe protectionism would take the world backwards and that would seriously cause problems for some countries being stuck among big economic blocs and not being able to dictate terms could prove difficult for the uk china with the belt and road initiative the eu with its 27 countries nafta mercosur it does not look promising the russian foreign minister sergei lavrov once referred to britain as a small island off the coast of western europe it cannot get worse than that with boris johnson threatening a hard brexit which is going out without a trade deal and on wto terms using this as a strategy could seriously backfire already honda is closing down its swindon car factory nissan is thinking of relocating some processes on mainland europe standard life insurance and investments has moved to ireland how many more will follow suit there have been articles looking at how the eu could peel off like an onion layer by layer over the years to get production companies to relocate to mainland europe would that then lead to low taxes and low wages to encourage companies to locate in the uk with both sides involved in brinkmanship the future does not look certain negotiating trade and other deals would demand compromises and at this moment both sides are adopting hard positions given that northern ireland which voted to remain in the eu by a good majority is being treated as being in the eu customs area with a customs line in the irish sea between great britain and the island of ireland the break up of the united kingdom is not an impossible outcome as scotland too through the scottish national party which holds a big majority of seats in scotland could move away and join the eu something the eu has been said to welcome in the future trying to fathom the exact reasons why the majority voted to leave the eu confirmed by the last general elections although one might say that the opposition through its naïvety in its lack of strategy helped johnson apart from the xenophobia or disengagement with the political process one cannot help thinking that this is the longest suicide note in history only the future can tell

four scenarios for 2020 by ing think economic and financial analysis general elections are an important arena for wrangling in american politics and a weather vane for observing the policy orientation of the u s this year the last full year of trump s first term there will be not only a presidential election but a congressional election in which the entire house of representatives and one third of the senate will be on the ballot with the abortive impeachment effort republicans offer strong support for trump s bid for re election even as there have been plenty of new faces among democratic candidates the policy proposals of both parties candidates have been conspicuously radical though china has yet to become a focus in the upcoming campaign the influences and challenges for china u s relations should not be underestimated first judging from past experience what the general public is most concerned about remains the economy which involves economic growth and the state of the stock market but arguably has more to do with strong public dissatisfaction with income disparities inequality and widening income gaps not to mention the perennial hope for election outcomes that bring practical benefits the present state of the world economy allows for little optimism cyclical and anti cyclical factors have joined forces to mar global growth prospects trade protectionism is rising uncertainties are increasing and downward pressures press more heavily oscillation could become the new normal in 2020 the international monetary fun has projected global gdp growth for 2020 at 3 percent the lowest since 2009 according to the world trade organization global trade in the first six months of last year grew 1 percent the lowest since 2012 trade tensions have only increased since the beginning of this year and negative growth is inevitable experts predict that in 2020 the probability of bubbles in global assets as well as stock markets going bust so the probability of economic recession is high should that be the case the u s economy and stock market cannot escape adversity to make matters worse the novel coronavirus outbreak is adding new variables to the chinese and global economies since the 2008 financial crisis the u s has maintained monetary easing and low interest policies and the marginal effects of such policies have steadily dwindled more than 30 central banks have lowered interest rates and the world economy has entered an era of zero even negative interest rates brewing financial risk no less than before 2008 in this general election year the u s will continue to stick to the beggar thy neighbor america first policy with respect to china and it will likely weaponize its financial advantages to suppress chinese scientific and technological progress via economic and financial sanctions against chinese high tech firms though the two governments have signed a phase one trade agreement what implementation looks like and how they would approach the sensitive next stage of negotiations remain unknown trying to score against china in the economic and financial sectors and leave voters the impression that the u s is winning is standard procedure for the trump administration and candidates of both parties will support it the u s commerce secretary has just claimed the epidemic in china will facilitate the return of american manufacturers back home such extremely selfish thinking is astounding this year china will make bolder strides in financial opening up with its economic interdependence with the rest of the world deepening it will see a massive influx of capital from the u s and others in chinese state bonds and stock markets as well as in banking insurance asset management services and the extension of new international cooperation through the belt and road initiative the overseas pool of funds in renminbi will continue to expand the impacts of international capital flow and interest rates changes on chinese finance will grow to test the chinese financial sector as well as the determination for internationalizing the renminbi second given that ideological mudslinging is standard practice in u s general elections china bashing will undoubtedly be used as a tool by the candidates of both parties to woo voters u s secretary of state mike pompeo has called the communist party of china a core threat to his country vice president mike pence and other ranking officials have made similar remarks fully revealing the deep rooted ideological prejudices against china by radicals in the u s and their fear of the advantages of the chinese system china s progress and success on its chosen path has again demonstrated the collapse of the u s theory of the end of history naked u s attempts to interfere in chinese domestic affairs and violate its sovereignty such as the u s directed color revolution in hong kong and successive legislative acts related to hong kong taiwan and tibet all indicate the u s objective to label china as a main strategic competitor and carry heavy overtones of a clash of civilizations the politics of u s general elections is seriously vulnerable to identity politics and populism helpless in the face of wealth gaps and expanding inequality neither party s candidates ever come up with objective analyses explanations or solutions the institutional crises of u s capitalism is on the horizon it will further tear apart social structures sharpen domestic contradictions and render domestic politics particularly general election politics even more radical meanwhile the crises will have spillover effects as the government tries everything possible to create crises scapegoats and imagined enemies foreign policies will become extremely forceful and military adventurism will continue its rise as a main strategic competitor of the u s china may easily become an election year scapegoat for various domestic troubles in the u s china is the largest trading partner of nearly 130 countries and regions it has contributed more than 30 percent of global annual growth for more than a decade and is an important engine of global economic growth that china needs the world and the world needs china has become the international community s consensus it is only after seeing the chinese people s growing confidence in their system and national strength uniting around the cpc to build a modern beautiful china that the u s has made up its mind to engage in high intensity strategic competition and gaming even though it may sink both countries in the so called thucydides trap third in a general election year the u s presence in international affairs drops conspicuously it often overreacts to state to state issues and global challenges withdraws from international cooperation and organizations at the same time its geopolitical impulses strengthen and tensions escalate in relations with major countries creating disorder in global governance international strategic stability has been weakened seriously in recent years security conditions in europe the asia pacific and the middle east are very fragile and harsh major power competition continues to be prominent worldwide regional powers face power vacuums and disorder competition for regional dominance remains complex and fierce and regional hotspots have become even more dangerous conditions are becoming increasingly chaotic u s russia contradictions are deepening as seen in their wrangling over ukraine syria and iran the harsher sanctions against iran involve russian interests in iran and the middle east the u s is also imposing extra territorial sanctions on nord stream 2 the natural gas pipeline featuring cooperation between europe and russia as well as the turkstream natural gas pipeline project any european companies that participate in these projects will be subject to economic and financial sanctions and their assets in the u s will be frozen although u s russia wrangling is dramatically different in nature from what it was during the cold war the u s attempt to prevent russia from coming back as a major power is equally tough given the ferocity of their competition regional conflicts may be inevitable since china u s relations today are highly complex and sensitive as they involve prominent competition over taiwan and the south china sea both of which concern chinese national security and sovereignty so u s strategic pressure on china will increase and military provocations will become more frequent and direct touching china s bottom lines global challenges and flare ups in regional hotspots will also complicate chinese foreign policy especially thos involving the u s and make them even more difficult to handle the u s withdrew from the inf treaty in mid 2019 and immediately restarted research and development as well as tests of surface based intermediate range missiles it declared it woule re deploy such missiles in asia and europe and has also insisted that china participate in negotiations for a new missile treaty in order to weaken and offset some of china s asymmetric advantages meanwhile the u s will withdraw from the arms trade treaty and the u s russia outer space treaty and it openly says it will never approve the comprehensive test ban treaty it is accelerating its pace of modernizing and miniaturizing nuclear weapons as it attempts to press china into a nuclear arms race and hence contain china s development in the middle east by killing a key iranian military leader the u s nearly triggered a military conflict with the islamic republic bilateral contradictions will inevitably intensify how that situation evolves will make a decisive impact on regional conditions israel palestine contradictions surrounding the status of jerusalem and the land for peace proposal have suffered a heavy blow from the u s decision to move its embassy to jerusalem and is intensifying once again china is a major importer of middle east oil and as the u s strives to disturb the region and create ups and downs in the oil market china will be exposed to greater economic and political pressures since the political candidates of both parties in the u s elections are becoming more seriously inward looking and as populism and protectionism gain popularity the current international order and global governance regime will become even more disordered making it more difficult for the international community to reach consensus on such global challenges as climate change energy security cybersecurity and geopolitical conflicts the world will be even less peaceful and the probability of black swan and grey rhino incidents will rise dramatically the trend of globalization comes with the formation of global production chains a worldwide consumer market flattens the commodity production and service industries and a strong push from the tech revolution all provide important support for continuing globalization globalization will not be reversed however the wrangling between globalists and anti globalists will continue to escalate enlarging governance deficits have torn apart the rules based governance regime remaking international rules especially those surrounding the role of the world trade organization and will be a focus of major power competition in this year of u s general elections global governance will face more severe tests on such topics as climate change wto reform preservation of the global nuclear nonproliferation regime and the handling of various regional hotspots china and the u s will face some difficult choices over whether to cooperate or go their own way to sum up the u s general election this year will be a special one in american politics bilateral ties will see greater uncertainty and relations will be even more difficult to handle all of this suggests china needs to maintain strategic calm think from a long term perspective adhere to principles observe developments with a cool mind and avoid jumping to rash conclusions about certain matters as they suddenly crop up
special note the expansion to the panama canal was completed in 2016 as i noted a few years ago and some of the traffic that used the ports of los angeles and long beach is probably going through the canal this might be impacting teus on the west coast also most of this traffic was prior to the widespread outbreak of covid 19 in china container traffic gives us an idea about the volume of goods being exported and imported and usually some hints about the trade report since la area ports handle about 40 of the nation s container port traffic the following graphs are for inbound and outbound traffic at the ports of los angeles and long beach in teus teus 20 foot equivalent units or 20 foot long cargo container to remove the strong seasonal component for inbound traffic the first graph shows the rolling 12 month average click on graph for larger image on a rolling 12 month basis inbound traffic was down 0 3 in january compared to the rolling 12 months ending in december outbound traffic was down 0 2 compared to the rolling 12 months ending the previous month the 2nd graph is the monthly data with a strong seasonal pattern for imports usually imports peak in the july to october period as retailers import goods for the christmas holiday and then decline sharply and bottom in february or march depending on the timing of the chinese new year january 25th in 2020 in general imports both imports and exports have turned down recently and will probably be negatively impacted by covid 19 over the next couple of months

live in milwaukee with my wife ericka and our three daughters i m running for milwaukee county executive to ensure that residents across this county no matter their zip code have access to opportunity and receive the quality of services they deserve the county is operating at a structural deficit estimated to be 15 to 20 million per year how would you balance milwaukee county s 2021 budget the budget shortfall is not a new problem we have been dealing with it for over a decade and it won t get fixed before the 2021 budget we must do all that we can to secure the 1 sales tax increase but we also need to be realistic about the fact that it is not going to pass through the current legislature and even if it does it isn t going to immediately fix all of our problems we must get creative about generating revenue this means focusing on getting all of our residents counted in the census and going after money that we are currently leaving on the table i will create an office at the county that is dedicated to seeking out federal state and foundation grant dollars that other municipalities are taking advantage of crowley says he rises above partisanship the county s taxpayer contribution to support its pension fund will total nearly 100 million in 2020 how would you address this issue much like the budget the pension issue is not a new issue and will not be fixed overnight two years ago the milwaukee county retirement sustainability taskforce was established to address issues with milwaukee county s pension system i believe that we must continue to build on the work they have done and explore the recommendations that were made in late 2018 i will continue to work with the county board the taskforce and other community stakeholders to come up with a solution that makes fiscal sense for the county but also protects the benefits of our retirees most importantly we have to bring everyone to the table to address this issue especially the residents that will be most affected by changes to the current system milwaukee county will be outsourcing its behavioral health division s inpatient services the future of psychiatric crisis services is undetermined what is your plan for pcs i will make sure that all residents have access to mental health care this means having these resources available in neighborhoods across the county not just at one centralized location in times of crisis it s not always possible to travel to a facility for care having these resources available in the community will make it more likely that residents will seek out the help they need it is my strong preference that all county services are performed by county employees as county executive i will do everything that i can to work towards that however in our current situation we have to make sure that our private provider is held accountable and is providing our residents with the high quality service they deserve learn more about crowley county

with governor evers and get fair revenue sharing along with applying to state and federal grants as well as working with local businesses in developing long lasting partnerships for county programing we will need to be creative and see what other local governments have done successfully larson says his experience sets him apart the county s taxpayer contribution to support its pension fund will total nearly 100 million in 2020 how would you address this issue in 2020 milwaukee county s pension obligations represent 37 of the property tax levy in recent years a number of reforms have been enacted to alleviate the cost to the taxpayer such as increasing employee contributions to 6 5 as well as eliminating the buyback and backdrop programs as county executive i will seriously consider handing over the pension program to the wisconsin retirement system for administration working with the state we can alleviate county stresses as well as having the added benefit of rolling in our pension program into a larger network of payers to stabilize the fund milwaukee county will be outsourcing its behavioral health division s inpatient services the future of psychiatric crisis services is undetermined what is your plan for pcs milwaukee county is struggling with mental health because hospitals don t see these services as being advantageous to their bottom line we can get money for these services by pushing the state to take the full medicaid expansion and using potential money from lawsuits filed against drug companies that make opioids we will need both government funds as

recent data releases show rather poor income growth common sense would tell you these numbers are averages and this would mean more and more new hires are being paid near minimum wage and or pay increases are barely keeping up with inflation a recent post from the conversation at first glance the latest data which came out on feb 7 look pretty good they show nominal hourly earnings rose 3 1 in january from a year earlier from december 2016 to september 2019 nominal wages rose 6 79 from 22 83 to 24 38 but after factoring in inflation average wages barely budged climbing just 0 42 in the period and from sentier research on real median household income median annual household income has displayed a somewhat erratic pattern over the past several years more broadly there has been a general upward trend in median household income since the post recession low point reached in june 2011 this upward trend was initially marked by monthly movements both up and down many monthly changes were not statistically significant by the summer of 2014 however that uneven trend became dominated by a series of significant monthly increases the cleveland fed asked is the middle class worse off than it used to be in this post the authors have tried to identify certain changing demographics that are affecting income one of the main reasons real median family income growth is relatively poor has been caused by an increase in single person households and a decline in two person households and once one adjusts real median middle class household incomes by the number of household heads one sees that single person households are dragging household income down the reasons are many why this is true with one adult household tend to be younger and therefore earning lower income two adult households many times contain two people with equal incomes and therefore have twice the income this analysis concluded in comparing household incomes of the middle class in the united states in 1980 to today we conclude that real incomes for today s middle class are somewhat higher than they used it to be particularly for households headed by two adults it is also clear that failing to adjust for demographic shifts in the population relating to age race and education can indicate a more positive outlook than is truly the case and what was not mentioned in this cleveland fed analysis was that the costs of maintaining a two adult household are not twice the cost of a one adult household two adult household cost of living are not much higher than one adult households and the other side of the coin two adult household discretionary spending should be proportionately higher than the one adult household as they have more money left over after household expenses economic forecast the econintersect economic index february 2020 forecast marginally improved this month but still shows the lowest level of growth since the economic slowdown in 2016 the current reading still remains marginally below the 2016 minimum the ongoing weakness of manufacturing transport and imports continues to weigh on our economic forecast but what is changing is the trend direction which is showing a leveling off or possible improvement although our index is now in negative territory similar to 2016 this penetration into negative territory is not yet severe or persistent and our opinion is that our index is not suggesting an economic contraction at this point but any continuing decline might be enough to suggest it is possible a recession is coming our employment forecast is continuing to forecast poorer employment growth than in the first half of 2019 economic releases this past week the following table summarizes the more significant economic releases this past week overall this week consumer confidence improves manufacturing growth remains weak weak employment growth suggested inflation remains subdued transport continues weak but

board s employment trends index which forecasts employment for the next 6 months improved with the authors saying the improvement in the eti along with friday s job report and other indicators suggest that employment growth has been accelerating after several weak quarters in 2019 econintersect evaluates the year over year change of this index which is different than the headline view as we do with our own employment index the year over year index growth rate accelerated by 2 3 month over month and up by 0 7 year over year the econintersect employment index improved both of these indices are predicting soft job growth 6 months from now but with economic dynamics supporting increased employment december jolts continues to predict a drop in employment the bls job openings and labor turnover survey jolts can be used as a predictor of future job growth and the predictive elements show that the year over year growth rate of unadjusted private non farm job openings declined and dropped further into contraction the unadjusted data this month remained well below average for the rate of growth seen in the last year with this low average rate of growth jolts is predicting lower employment growth than we have seen over the past year jolts predicted the slowing of employment growth january container counts improving trend in play but remains in contraction the container counts for the ports of los angeles and long beach show export and import container counts in contraction but the rolling averages are showing a clear improvement a significant reason for the soft container trade data for west coast ports is the trade war with china and now the effects of the coronavirus however it is not the only reason as the global economy is weak simply looking at this month versus last month this month was an improvement over last month the year over year rate of growth improved for imports and improved for exports the three month rolling averages for exports and imports are in contraction but improved january consumer price index inflation creeping up according to the bls the consumer price index cpi u inflation rate was 2 5 year over year up from the reported 2 3 last

of the increase of the cpi u medical care services cost inflation was unchanged at 5 1 year over year january retail sales sales a little soft this month retail sales improved according to us census headline data the three month rolling average improved there was a downward adjustment to last month s data the real test of strength is the rolling averages which improved overall this report is considered worse than last month and inflation ate away much of the gain please consider that this data is not adjusted for inflation there is no year over year growth in employment in this sector january import and export prices very little inflation in this sector year over year import price indices inflation slowed but export prices are now growing year over year import prices slowed from 0 5 to 0 3 whilst export pricing grew from 0 9 to 0 5 import oil prices were down 2 2 month over month and export agricultural prices up 2 0 year over year change import prices blue line and export prices red line january industrial production the downward trend remains in play the headlines say seasonally adjusted industrial production or ip declined month over month and remains in contraction year over year our analysis shows the three month rolling average declined the best way to view this is the 3 month rolling averages which declined industrial production remains in a downtrend note that manufacturing is in contraction year over year and capacity utilization remained in expansion year over year consider this report similar to last month december business sales and inventories at least its trend is no longer down headlines say final business sales data retail plus wholesale plus manufacturing improved month over month the rolling averages improved inventories remain elevated but they declined our primary monitoring tool the 3 month rolling averages for sales improved as the monthly data has significant variation the 3 month averages are the way to view this series overall

manufacturing and services surveys remain weak but generally improved small business optimism the small business optimism index started the new year in the top 10 of all readings in the 46 year

the united states u s gaap that management believes are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods management believes that this is especially true since these measures exclude real estate depreciation and amortization expense and management believes that real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight line basis over time the company believes such a presentation also provides investors with a meaningful measure of the company s operating results in comparison to the operating results of other reits adjusted ebitda is useful to investors to further supplement affo and ffo and to provide investors a performance metric which excludes interest expense in addition to non cash items the company adjusts affo and adjusted ebitda for acquisition related expenses while we do not label these expenses as non recurring infrequent or unusual management believes that it is helpful to adjust for these expenses when they do occur to allow for comparability of results between periods because each acquisition is and will be of varying size and complexity and may involve different types of expenses depending on the type of property being acquired and from whom ffo ffo per unit affo affo per unit and adjusted ebitda do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by u s gaap should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by u s gaap and are not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs investors are also cautioned that ffo ffo per unit affo affo per unit and adjusted ebitda as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other reits due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions

the people s republic of china one of sri lanka s closest friends is currently engaged in a battle against novel coronavirus following first infection was diagnosed in wuhan in december 2019 the epidemic has become a common concern of the international community in view of the coronavirus epidemic the institute of global governance at shanghai institutes for international studies siis a government affiliated institution conducting policy oriented studies in world politics economics foreign policy and international security has compiled a report few days ago detailing the economic political and social aspect of the china this report was co authored by chen dongxiao president of shanghai institutes for international studies liu kan m d associate professor institute of global governance siis lu chuanying and several other experts at siis were the contributing authors to this report the report is envisaged to address following pertinent questions relating to the novel coronavirus epidemic why has the chinese government taken such strong measures as quarantine of wuhan how effective are they can the chinese government and people manage to contain the epidemic what are the short mid and long term effects of the epidemic on china s economy and how can the international community work together to tackle the international public health emergency chen dongxiao the president of shanghai institutes for international studies stated that his colleagues believe that despite the daunting tasks faced by china such strong measures as quarantine of key areas are still the most effective means to contain the epidemic otherwise the whole nation and even the world would be subject to greater public health risks mr dongxiao stated that public morale has been boosted across the nation in fighting against the epidemic with such measures under the leadership of the central government and with dedicated efforts from local governments and the whole society the nationwide emergency management system is beginning to take full effect it is believed that at a critical moment for international political and economic dynamics and china s economic transformation the 2019 ncov epidemic will have much negative impact on china s economy especially in the short run as well as on world economy in many ways however in the mid and long term china s economy will manifest strong surprising resilience with the support of the international community the chinese government and people will ultimately conquer the epidemic and china s economy will remain robust siis president said he further stated that in the globalized era such epidemics as 2019 ncov have become common threats for humanity that demand joint efforts from the whole international community following are the answers given by the experts from the institute of global governance at shanghai institutes for international studies siis to several key questions relating to corona epidemic 1 why were mass quarantines exercised on wuhan and other epidemic areas quarantine is a traditional and yet the most effective measure to contain a deadly epidemic although it may bring unforeseen risks and consequences because there is no specific cure or vaccine against virus caused infections including 2019 ncov standard public health emergency measures usually prove most efficient including isolating the sources of infection cutting off or interrupting transmission routes and special care for the most susceptible people available medical evidence shows that humans regardless of gender age or race are all susceptible to this deadly new coronavirus thus in the absence of specific cure or vaccine source isolation and transmission chain interruption are by far the only reliable and effective methods the unprecedented exercise of a full quarantine on wuhan the heart of the outbreak reflects china s dedication as a responsible great power in fact since the quarantine began the number of confirmed cases in all regions has grown at a much lower speed than that in the epicentre hubei province and wuhan remains the only city with concentrated infections of all the confirmed cases outside hubei province the majority of patients have either lived in or travelled to wuhan or other areas of hubei recently and the rest have been in close contact with the above mentioned patients so far there has been no reported incident of local community transmission or any new epicentre of outbreak based on these facts we can conclude that strict control over population outflows from hubei province is an effective way to contain the spread of the deadly virus at present high level emergency alerts have been activated all across china and vigorous public health measures taken to identify diagnose and isolate infections or suspected cases at the earliest possible moment at the same time the lunar new year holidays have been extended to keep the nation wide migration of population at the minimum level and travellers from wuhan and other epidemic areas are advised to report their travel records and to self quarantine for two weeks to prevent community transmission the reported five million people who had left wuhan before the lockdown announcement are not panicky evacuees but migrant workers seeking family reunions back in their hometowns or holiday travellers taking their leisure time around china and even abroad what would happen if china had not closed off wuhan and other epidemic areas according to credible analysis highly connected global transport networks may enable contagious pathogens to spread from backwater villages in unknown corners of the world to major cities on six continents in less than 36 hours and trigger outbreaks or cause epidemics yet in china by january 30 2020 more than a month after the first confirmed case was reported and eight days after the wuhan lockdown there had been 18 countries reporting 98 scattered cases of infection altogether according to the latest who report had the chinese government not taken determined efforts to quarantine the places with concentrated confirmed cases the deadly virus may have spread all over the world and generated devastating impact on the global economic and public health systems as who director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesuson correctly pointed out at a press conference on january 30 the chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to contain the outbreak despite the severe social and economic impact those measures are having on the chinese people beijing is doing everything possible to ensure sustained supplies of daily necessities and medical materials hubei province is abundant in natural resources and basic supplies have never fallen short the ministry of commerce has activated a material supplying mechanism involving nine provincial authorities through which basic items including medical materials steadily flow into hubei it is a long running tradition for the chinese to store more than enough food and other items for the spring festival season and many households in wuhan have already accumulated ample supplies before the lockdown so there is not a general shortage of food or other life necessities wuhan citizens are not left in a deserted city to their own devices food supplies and basic social services are fully ensured although wuhan s public transport has been suspended local residents personal freedom has not been restricted and most households have opted for self quarantine to avoid potential infection those who have to travel are offered vehicles by community level organisations public mood is improving as local residents lives begin to come back to normal with regular information disclosure and stepped up personal hygienic measures 2 can the chinese government manage to contain the epidemic china has adopted a whole of government approach coupled with full social mobilization in the fight against the 2019 ncov epidemic at the central level beijing has been on high alert since the early days and activated the public health emergency response mechanism as soon as confirmed cases rose to 200 on january 20 president xi jinping and premier li keqiang instructed governments at all levels to pay highest attention to the development of the epidemic the national health commission and local authorities were ordered to activate all round emergency response mechanisms on january 25 premier li was designated chair of a newly established central leading small group on battling the 2019 ncov epidemic and visited wuhan two days later to inspect the latest progress and boost public morale rapid mobilization at the top level catapulted the whole nation into instant reaction at present more than 52 batches of medical staff of 6 097 professionals are working in wuhan and other places in hubei medical supplies including face masks protective suits and medicines are arriving in epidemic areas the ministry of industry and information technology has urged medical suppliers across china to restore to their full productive capacity to ensure sustained provision of all necessary items the ministry of finance has allocated 1 billion rmb in emergency funds for wuhan and hubei vegetables food and other life necessities have been sent from other places to wuhan for the nine million residents there local authorities are taking every measure in epidemic control and prevention at the moment most of the confirmed cases reported in regions other than hubei are imported infections patients have either travelled to or lived in wuhan or come into close contact with infected victims there has been no epicentre of outbreak except wuhan due to early government intervention for now top priorities for local governments include identifying and caring for symptomatic patients and advising and monitoring people with wuhan travel records to self quarantine restrictive measures such as migration control and mass quarantine may give rise to social disorder which requires appropriate responses from local authorities price control and quality supervision are also necessary as demands for face masks and liquid soap have soared enterprises and the general public are also contributing to the combat against the epidemic financial and material donations from chinese enterprises have been growing since the onset of the deadly virus charities and red cross agencies in hubei have received up to 4 26 billion rmb and 5 29 million pieces of materials in donation by the end of january corporate giants like alibaba and fosun international limited have made overseas purchases to supply urgently needed medical equipment to wuhan what is worth noting is that chinese tech firms have proven that the internet plays a special role in china s social governance for example tencent has set up eleven platforms providing online services such as information disclosure and medical advice one platform offers online medical clinical services aimed to reduce feverish patients exposure to virus in hospital another platform helps calm down the public by debunking rumours and conspiracy theories didi a car hailing service firm has set up a dedicated convoy to ferry medical staff amid wuhan s traffic shutdown another firm has devised a search app whereby users can check whether they have been the fellow travellers of an infected victim from the sars outbreak to the 2019 ncov epidemic internet companies have shouldered increasing corporate responsibilities in times of crisis 3 what effect is the epidemic likely to have on china s economy there are three major views both in china and abroad about the negative impact of the 2019 ncov epidemic on china s economy the critical impact theory tends to think that it will have serious effect on the already slackening chinese economy even causing a slide of its growth rate and handicapping global economy based on data about the economic impact of sars in 2003 the manageable impact theory believes that the epidemic will have only limited and controllable effect on china s economy and that china s economic performance of the whole year will not be much influenced despite a declining growth rate in the first season the uncertain impact theory holds that historical evidence does not tell much about the future economic trajectory but the actual economic impact depends on how long the epidemic will last after all china s economic size 99 trillion rmb in gdp is 9 times that of 2003 11 7 trillion rmb indeed it would be imprudent to judge the economic impact of the epidemic by historical experience the new millennium has witnessed the outbreak of a number of epidemics natural disasters or other acute incidents in china yet the chinese government has managed to contain and tackle them one by one including sars in 2003 which caused the biggest short term effect on economy h1n1 swine flu in 2009 and h7n9 bird flu as well as the wenchuan earthquake in 2008 even in face of the rampant global financial crisis in 2009 china was able to maintain steady growth of economy with a strong stimulus package and collective international efforts led by the group of twenty g20 it is worth noting however that the potential impact of the 2019 ncov epidemic can be different from all the previous epidemics and other incidents for one thing it occurs when china s economy in the midst of a transition from high speed growth to highquality development faces three daunting tasks domestically i e guarding against systemic financial risks control of pollution and poverty eradication externally with globalization under unprecedented challenges and china u s trade frictions only starting to ease china s economy will be further hit if the country is labeled as an epidemic area for another thing the current epidemic has influenced larger areas and to greater degrees not only are the complete quarantine of wuhan city and first level response applied by more than 30 provinces or municipalities the first time in history but the epidemic has impacted all economic fields across the nation its effect on small and medium sized enterprises is yet to be seen while china s employment local government debt issue and stability of the rmb value are all under severe test it is widely forecast that china s economic growth will be down by 1 to 1 5 percentage point some even doubt if china s economy can achieve a 5 percent growth in 2020 4 how can the international community cope with the epidemic for common human security in our globalized world the 2019 ncov epidemic will inevitably have global impacts committed to promoting the building of a community of shared future for mankind china has been striving to undertake its due international responsibilities and obligations in countering the epidemic above all with utmost openness and promptness the chinese government is working closely with the world health organization who on every step of the epidemic exemplified by president xi s meeting with who director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesuson on january 28 after the director general declared the 2019 ncov epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern pheic china s mainstream media like people s daily and xinhua news agency reported the news instantly indicating that the chinese government has nothing to hide from the public and that the chinese people are fully confident in conquering the epidemic next the chinese government has given full understanding and assistance to other governments actions to prevent the epidemic such as some countries evacuation missions from wuhan and their decisions to halt airlines to china all such requests will continue to be met with utmost efficiency and generosity from the chinese government furthermore the chinese government has remained open and grateful to all kinds of assistance from other countries in countering the epidemic at the same time china is considering promoting such cooperation in future epidemics of the world finally both the chinese government and public opinion are quite concerned about the impact of the epidemic on the world for example the government has been trying to minimize the spread of the epidemic to other countries by increasing control of overseas travels by the population in worst hit regions and calling on the public to take social responsibilities in preventing the dissemination of the virus with regard to the global concern over the 2019 ncov epidemic we suggest the following joint actions by the international community for our common security first optimize the existing epidemic information disclosure mechanisms china s daily epidemic bulletin broadcast in multiple languages plays the key role in particular the languages of neighbouring countries such as russian japanese korean and english so that related information and data can be accessible to the public before fake news and rumours begin to spread successful actions of the chinese government in preventing the spread of the epidemic can be introduced in detail in the bulletin too the real time bulletin in multiple languages should be put on the websites of the ministry of foreign affairs and chinese embassies and consulates abroad meanwhile we strongly hope that international media and thinktanks maintain an objective comprehensive and humane stance in conducting reports or analyses of the epidemic and avoid hyping unconfirmed information or even rumours second strengthen international exchange of experience in epidemic control it is important for china to translate the latest guidelines for preventing the 2019 ncov into different languages and pass it over to neighbouring countries swiftly and in multiple forms such as by social media it will not only help those countries counter the epidemic with chinese experience but also contribute to china s image as a kind neighbour and responsible great power we call for more support from the united states eu and other developed countries in medical equipment and supplies as well as their best practices in epidemic control third oppose discrimination against epidemic struck regions and people the epidemic must not become a new fence between countries but it should be turned into a new bridge across nations at present china s ministry of foreign affairs as well as embassies and consulates abroad are in close contact with the governments and health and epidemic prevention agencies of other countries updating them with the latest progress in countering the epidemic chinese communities abroad also keep a close eye on the health conditions of chinese living in their neighbourhood and they are ready to help local epidemic prevention agencies if necessary to provide certifications for healthy chinese or those proven healthy through self quarantine so as to prevent ugly anti chinese events due in large part to incomplete information we hereby advocate that the public in all countries remain calm about the epidemic and avoid discrimination against chinese or any infected persons for we as human beings are one family and no ethnic group can stand immune to our common challenge

remains cool except for housing costs inflationary pressures remain muted according to the latest cpi report released this week from the bureau of labor statistics housing costs continue to be the

retreated by 33 basis points since the start of the year and is roughly 170 basis points below peak levels of 2018 of 3 25 on monday we published the taxman cometh reit tax myths with tax season unfortunately upon us we address some of the most common questions and respond to some of the outright myths that we hear related to reits and taxes reit investors were big winners from recent tax reform functionally from a tax reporting perspective an investor s experience with reits shouldn t be any different than a typical dividend paying stock reits report using the standard 1099 div not a k 1 for reits dividend distributions for tax purposes are heavily weighted to ordinary income the majority of which qualifies for a 20 qualified business income qbi deduction with the balance coming from capital gains and return of capital each of which are typically taxed at lower rates last week we published vnq a david vs goliath story our etf spotlight series has taken us across the fund landscape from high yield reit etfs and cefs to newer innovative funds offering a more growth oriented approach to real estate the plain vanilla core reit etfs still rule the day from an aum perspective however led by goliath vnq core reit etfs are distinguished by their market capitalization weighting system exposure across most equity reit property sectors and ultra low expense ratio which averages roughly 20 basis points a fraction of the typical actively managed mutual fund or cef we took a look at the property sector breakdown of these six funds last week we also published real estate cefs satisfying a high yield fix we examined the most popular cefs with an average dividend yield of 7 0 while we believe etfs are the more suitable option for the vast majority of investors cefs can make sense for certain investors seeking access to leverage active management and are willing to pay a steep expense premium for it for investors who absolutely need the 6 7 yield from their real estate allocation we like the cohen steers suite of levered cefs rqi and rnp and believe that these may indeed be slightly better options for sophisticated investors than the high yield reit etfs covered in the last report especially for tax advantaged accounts that wouldn t benefit quite as much from the substantially superior tax efficiencies of etfs next week s economic calendar a busy two

bombardier inc has given up trying to compete in the commercial aerospace market by selling its remaining stake in the 100 150 seat a220 programme to its joint venture partner airbus se the 1 4 billion euro full year net loss that airbus announced alongside that deal is a painful reminder of why bombardier s own large jet ambitions always looked doomed in theory building commercial jets is a fantastic business there aren t many competitors airbus and boeing co essentially have a duopoly in large aircraft and demand is booming as people in emerging markets get richer they want to travel more and climate worries haven t dissuaded most people from flying yet the trouble is that designing and launching a new commercial airliner consumes massive amounts of capital and that s if all goes to plan typically it doesn t cash flow bleeding the delayed a220 then known as the c series ended up costing bombardier at least 6 billion to develop and caused its debts to balloon to an unsustainable level airbus came to the rescue in 2017 by taking a majority stake in the programme but even now long after the plane entered service it is a burden on airbus s cash flow another reason why bombardier sought airbus s help back in 2017 was that boeing persuaded the us to impose punitive import tariffs thereby hurting the canadian manufacturer in comes the defender trade and tariff threats are multiplying in the era of donald trump and brexit the better capitalised airbus is more able to withstand these problems than bombardier but it s not immune because of its world trade organisation dispute with boeing the americans have also imposed tariffs on the planes airbus exports from europe to the us unlike bombardier airbus and boeing both have large defence business whose cash flows help fund their massive development costs even that s no guarantee of success pension costs a function of the large workforces needed to build big planes are a challenge airbus s pension deficit has swelled to about 8 billion euros because of low interest rates hit from all over and then there s stuff that just seems to come out of the blue airbus disclosed an astonishing 5 6 billion euros of negative adjustments to its annual results much of that relates to the fines airbus must pay to settle bribery charges brought by various international authorities but the company also suffered yet another 1 2 billion euro charge on the troubled a400m military transporter programme more than 200 million euros of costs related to defence export restrictions plus various other one off costs pulling down profits for a while it seemed as though boeing had cracked the financial alchemy of commercial aerospace soaring cash flows were returned to shareholders via a massive share buy back programme after two fatal crashes involving its 737 max we now know that success came at the cost of squeezing suppliers browbeating regulators and neglecting safety in 2019 boeing reported its first yearly loss in two decades following the disappointments of the a380 superjumbo programme a seemingly bottomless money pit and various production difficulties involving new narrow body aircraft airbus shareholders were hopeful that it too would start converting its massive order book into cash that could be returned to them airbus s performance has certainly improved yet that windfall never seems to arrive airbus s 2020 production and profit guidance was weaker than expected it should generate 4 billion euros of free cash flow this year but once the corruption fines and several hundred million euros of tax and legal costs are paid there will be precious little left the coronavirus could yet cause unexpected setbacks struggling airlines might have to cancel orders and there could be an impact on the supply chain while airbus is raising the dividend by 9 per cent share buy backs will have to wait

members of the media watch the broadcast of the democratic presidential primary debate friday feb 7 2020 at saint anselm college in manchester n h ap photo charles krupa with dozens of debates a caucus and a primary behind them local democratic voters are reassessing their favorite candidates in the winnowing field day reporters conducted email interviews this week with registered voters who had agreed to share their thoughts on the presidential race this story concentrates on the democratic field future articles will include interviews with supporters of president donald trump if you d like to join the conversation fill out the form at the end of the online version of this story while many of those who contacted the day have settled strongly behind a candidate particularly sen bernie sanders and former south bend mayor pete buttigieg the top two finishers in iowa and new hampshire others are still considering two or more of the democratic candidates nevada democrats will caucus and south carolina will hold a primary this month the primaries and debates have helped to narrow my choices said mark j bancroft of pawcatuck bancroft said he is leaning toward moderate candidates buttigieg amy klobuchar and mike bloomberg his top reasons for voting include one big one among democratic voters removing president trump from office and returning respect and decorum to the presidency but he also is making a choice based on candidates stance on climate change the environment and healthcare the candidates at this point have yet to discuss to my satisfaction a road to recovery on any of the topics he said michael j gaffey of old lyme another voter leaning toward bloomberg and klobuchar cited pragmatism as a key consideration he wants to remove trump and the gop control of the u s senate but he is also concerned about improving obamacare changing america s diplomatic policies reducing the deficit and addressing global warming bob salen of niantic said he believes trump should be defeated at all costs he is leaning toward joe biden and buttigieg though he thinks bloomberg is a possibility as well at this point i have some leanings he said but ultimately they have to be able to defeat trump salen s top issues include getting real about taxes and spending including the national debt nobody is addressing these issues honestly he said he also wants to make sure the next president protects the social security and medicare safety nets restores trade and global political alliances and aggressively addresses climate change i am an unaffiliated voter who now feels that the gop is completely gone into the trump camp and becoming as corrupt as he is salen said in an email the democrats are too busy attacking each other instead of coming up with policies and plans they come together on a practical progressive john w bill sheehan a member of the waterford board of finance said he is planning to vote for klobuchar if she s still in the race at the time of the connecticut primary which will be held april 28 senator klobuchar is a practical progressive who has won votes in trump favorable districts and works across the aisle in the senate sheehan said she has also shown the grit to stand up to the incumbent during the campaign sheehan said he met klobuchar who finished a strong third in new hampshire in new london when she made a local appearance for hillary clinton s 2016 campaign another waterford resident ed pellegri jr said he considers himself an independent but registered as a democrat to be able to vote in the primary republican primaries are usually a foregone conclusion he said pellegri said he hasn t made up his mind on a candidate to support but has eliminated biden and sanders issues of importance to him include gun control medical costs and wage disparity he d also like to see reins on congress including term limits and job benefits more in line with what other federal workers receive susan menghi of waterford said her top issues include combating climate change humane immigration policies gun safety and healthcare humanity has been broken by our current political state led by a complete narcissist she said and we need to re learn to treat others how we want to be treated menghi said she is still deciding between sanders and elizabeth warren i feel that these two candidates best understand how our american citizens need to be taken care of she said we all deserve an adequate piece of the american pie of all the issues being raised in the campaign menghi said her no 1 priority would be free universal healthcare under a single payer system there s plenty of government waste that can be cut to pay for it as well as rolling back tax cuts on the wealthy and corporations she said healthcare is a basic human right because it s something that everyone will need as some point staunch sanders supporters front running sanders has plenty of support locally greg kotecki of new london said medicare for all is one of his top policy priorities as are labor rights a higher minimum wage and less radical supreme court appointments bernie has covered all these issues throughout his campaign kotecki said still he worries that sanders faces an uphill battle clearly the corporate democratic machine fears the changes proposed by sanders and has attempted to stop him and his campaign he said george blahun of waterford another sanders supporter said he would like to see social security put on sound financial footing he also wants medicare for all and a greater spotlight on climate change i will support anyone the democratic party nominates he added some advocates of sanders said that they were surprised by how well he is doing in the polls and that they were pleased he challenged the iowa results while critics have said sanders is too liberal to win a general election william keating of new london contends he is the most electable option and the best hope for defeating trump he is a candidate voters can invest their hope in and therefore he is a candidate for whom voters will actually organize around and most importantly show up to vote for keating wrote in an email i think he will continue to do well as the primaries go on but i do not think it is a given race he has the ability to galvanize the independent voter but as trump hysteria ramps up during the primaries democrats may not give him the chance jason morris of norwich said he s content with sanders performance thus far akin to other sanders supporters his appreciation for the vermont senator is driven by policy i m a navy veteran that used to write off all politics saying they re all puppets and bought by the rich and corporate but that was changed forever when occupy wall street began in september of 2011 morris wrote in an email i agreed strongly that we are struggling under socialism for the rich and rugged capitalism for the 99 that our education system is also being guided by money and profit motive with charters and technology that our healthcare and pharmaceutical industries are preying on the sick and poor and money in politics is a root cause to a lot of this corruption and suffering sanders calling card is economic inequality and most everyone who provided answers to the day mentioned it in some form including patricia vener saavedra of hamden who touched on both economic and environmental topics climate change needs to be addressed because on a dead planet no one can survive vener saavedra wrote wealth comfort health disparities need to be addressed as a socialist i don t believe that there should be haves and have nots aside from climate change reformed public education economic inequality money in politics and healthcare likely sanders voters said their most important issues are a higher minimum wage jobs women s reproductive freedom and personal choice student loan debt investment in infrastructure reinstatement of former president barack obama s wall street reforms and reinstatement of the trump rollbacks on wildlife protections vener saavedra also mentioned what other sanders backers hold up as the main difference between him and not only the democratic presidential field but all politicians integrity voters argued that sanders integrity stems from his conviction to them he s had the same moral and political stances on all of his policies for decades and he s never bent to outside pressure to change those stances adam rose of mystic said as much the issues most important to me are healthcare particularly medicare for all making college more affordable the environment particularly the green new deal and the economy ensuring corporations and wealthy individuals pay their fair share rose wrote in an email both bernie sanders and elizabeth warren talk about these issues but bernie has been on message for the past 30 40 years and the candidate i trust the most to stick to his agenda buttigieg supporters stress health care integrity norwich resident bill kenny said buttigieg first attracted his attention because the candidate was a mayor buttigieg talks extensively about empowering middle class and working americans so they can thrive which when i look to my left and right on my street in my neighborhood and across my city is what i have for neighbors kenny said i think we ve had enough government by and for the 0 1 kenny noted that as a retiree he has private insurance from his former employer but too many people don t have insurance he called buttigieg s support for what the candidate calls medicare for all who want it a balanced and thoughtful position between those who would eliminate private insurance for a government only system and those want only market force insurance coverage leaving the sick and the poor to die kenny said buttigieg hasn t yet spoken as extensively as he would like on climate change or on how we find a balance between a national defense policy that protects us while deterring our foes and reassuring our allies stonington resident john groton said the most important issues to him are health care the environment and gun laws ones the candidates are talking about what nobody is talking about he said is the growing budget deficit that trump has taken to a whole new level also a buttigieg supporter groton thinks his preferred candidate has done very well so far similarly mary kay michaels of niantic commented in an email i think pete is performing remarkably well considering he s a young outsider and is running against the washington old guard his campaign strategies seem to be on target as he has a slight edge in the overall number of acquired delegates at 66 important issues to michaels are health care social security and medicare medicaid there are countless issues since trump was elected candidates need to and are addressing i e unifying the country immigration the arts education nato taxes etc she said in the end she said she ll support any candidate the democratic party nominates as she wants trump out of the white house
iran s islamist rulers who sparked deadly domestic unrest by raising gas prices in november say their controversial move also has failed to ease fuel smuggling into neighboring countries such as pakistan largely because smugglers have shifted to diesel fuel from gasoline iranian authorities tripled the unsubsidized price of gasoline nov 15 from 7 to 21 cents per liter based on iran s latest unofficial rial dollar exchange rate of 139 700 published by bonbast com the gas price hike imposed as iran s finances worsened under u s sanctions triggered days of nationwide street protests that authorities crushed in a violent crackdown killing at least 1 500 people according to u s officials iran has called that figure exaggerated without disclosing its own death toll gas prices in iran a major global oil producer have long been among the lowest in the world a phenomenon that has spurred decades of smuggling of iranian fuel into such neighboring countries as pakistan and afghanistan where legally sold fuel has been relatively expensive iran s government has publicly opposed such smuggling which robs it of revenue from legal fuel exports the iranian state news agency irna said in a dec 17 article that the november gas price hike had raised hopes for a reduction in fuel smuggling across iran s porous borders however the article quoted majid mohebbi an anti smuggling official in southeastern iran s sistan and baluchistan province as saying the amount of iranian fuel being smuggled into neighboring pakistan and afghanistan had remained as high as it had been before the gas price hike the irna article did not cite any estimate for the amount of iranian fuel being smuggled out of the province but another provincial economic official alireza noura previously estimated that 5 million liters of fuel were being smuggled into pakistan and afghanistan daily according to a november 2018 report by iranian news site entekhab iranian officials said the continued high levels of fuel smuggling stem from a switch in what is being smuggled iranian lawmaker ali bakhtiar spokesman for a parliamentary energy committee told the parliament s icana news site this month that there had been a significant shift in the type of fuel being smuggled from gasoline to diesel with the price of the latter fuel type remaining low at 2 cents per liter bakhtiar noted that diesel was now one tenth the price of unsubsidized gas and comprised 80 of all fuel being smuggled out of iran before the november gas price hike more gasoline was being smuggled out of iran than diesel according to mehdi aboui a former deputy head of an intergovernmental task force on smuggling prevention in september the hamshahri newspaper quoted aboui as saying 30 million to 35 million liters of gasoline were being smuggled across iran s borders per day compared to 15 million to 20 million liters of diesel iranian smugglers also appeared to confirm a post november shift to cross border smuggling of diesel in interviews reported by irna and iran s sazandegi news site in december the shift to smuggling of iranian diesel also has been noted in pakistan s impoverished western baluchistan province which borders iran in a phone interview with voa deewa a baluchistan based executive for the state owned pakistan state oil company said diesel has become the most smuggled fuel coming from iran with widespread smuggling networks delivering it to provinces across pakistan the diesel smuggled from iran where it costs 2 cents per liter is much cheaper than the diesel sold by pakistan s pso and other licensed energy companies which charge about 80 cents per liter according to news site urdupoint diesel is used to fuel pakistani buses trucks and other heavy vehicles as well as agricultural equipment and deep well turbines used to pump groundwater to the surface gasoline sold by licensed companies in pakistan also is more expensive than in iran at 76 cents per liter versus 21 cents per liter although the difference is less than it was before iran s november gas price hike a year ago licensed gasoline sold for 85 cents per liter in pakistan versus 7 cents per liter in iran according to a february 2019 report by iran s center for strategic studies in pakistan s baluchistan smuggled iranian fuel is widely sold at so called mini petrol pumps along highways and crowded city streets bayazid khan the owner of one such pump in the town of kuchlak told voa deewa that smuggled iranian diesel typically sells for around 51 cents per liter while smuggled iranian gasoline sells for 65 to 70 cents per liter the prices for both smuggled fuel types are cheaper than the prices for their pakistani licensed equivalents but the discount for smuggled diesel is substantially greater smugglers will adjust based on perceived market preferences and in baluchistan and across pakistan there s strong demand for a variety of fuels not just gasoline said michael kugelman a south asia analyst at washington s wilson center in an email to voa persian the shift in fuels underscores both the versatility of the smugglers and the high demand for energy in pakistan he added kugelman said another reason for the failure of iran to ease fuel smuggling to pakistan is the strength of the smugglers supply channels it s easy to understand why this iranian fuel smuggling is such a flourishing business baluchistan is rich in natural resources but the pakistani state exerts a heavy hand there and prevents locals most of whom are poor from accessing local energy resources kugelman said for many local residents supporting cheaper alternatives from iran is a no brainer there s a desire to purchase them and to help smuggle them fuel smugglers also appear to have benefited from permissive attitudes by officials and security forces on both sides of the iran pakistan border some iranian and pakistani lawmakers have expressed sympathy for the poor economic conditions that drive many people in their respective border regions into fuel smuggling as one of their only means of survival security forces of both nations also have been unwilling or unable to stop the smuggling fueling perceptions that some seek to profit from the activity themselves the fuel smuggling also has come at a cost for pakistan a pakistani senate committee estimated last may that the government was losing at least 350 million a year in tax revenue that was not being levied on the smuggled iranian fuel lives have been lost in recent years as well as a result of dangerous nighttime driving by fuel smugglers seeking to evade pakistani security checkpoints and because of dangerous storage of smuggled fuel at mini pumps and other facilities without regard to safety precautions in one of the worst incidents of recent months a truck carrying smuggled iranian gasoline collided with a passenger bus in baluchistan s killa saifullah district in december burning 13 people to death this article

conservative prime minister boris johnson s cabinet reshuffle thursday ended with the resignation of his chancellor sajid javid javid had only been in the position for seven months and was understood not to be under threat in a reshuffle that had been trailed as a low key affair his position was seen as being particularly secure given that johnson s spring budget the first since his landslide december general election victory is just weeks away johnson sacked five cabinet ministers northern ireland secretary julian smith business secretary andrea leadsom environment secretary theresa villiers and attorney general geoffrey cox then in the afternoon news broke that javid had resigned johnson made it impossible for him to stay in the role javid was instructed that he must sack all five of his advisers and replace them with ones recommended by johnson and his arch strategist dominic cumming this was in order to create a joint unit between johnson s office in 10 downing street and the treasury team at number 11 javid quit declaring that johnson attached conditions to him staying on as chancellor which no self respecting minister would accept the huffington post s paul waugh noted that no one at the treasury foresaw johnson s aim that his chief adviser dominic cummings would be in charge of the new advisory team but anyone slightly off message including smith who had been generally praised in his role as northern ireland as had cox on brexit issues was discarded javid s ignominious exit confirms the essential agenda of the johnson government is one of escalating the class war offensive against workers when johnson took office the nominally liberal guardian s economics editor larry elliott asserted johnson has shifted the tories left on the economy instead after javid declared prior to the december election that the page is turned on a decade of austerity within days of winning office he announced that all government departments had to come up with another 5 percent in savings the financial times commented that javid and johnson signed a joint letter to ministers that budgets remain extremely tight even after a decade of austerity in public services departments were instructed to name 10 projects that could be scrapped in this autumn s comprehensive spending review led by the treasury ministers would be required to go through every line of departmental budgets assessing value for money and present radical options to cut spending johnson s government is taking a hard line on brexit against the european union eu in its trade talks over the next 10 months accompanying this will be a massive stepping up of austerity in furtherance of trade war to impose such attacks johnson s office is accruing enormous powers to itself including tearing up the much vaunted semi independent status of number 11 chancellors who sign the cheques to ram through an agenda that will have explosive consequences both internationally and nationally javid is political collateral damage javid was replaced by rishi sunak described by johnson as his favourite minister during the election campaign when johnson refused to attend candidates debates sunak stood in for him following his education at prestigious private school winchester college the same institution attended by labour leader jeremy corbyn s stalinist adviser seamus milne sunak graduated from oxford university from there he obtained a degree in business administration from stanford university in the united states there he met his future wife akshata daughter of the billionaire co founder of indian outsourcing company infosys and india s sixth richest man narayana murthy sunak was employed at goldman sachs before moving to british hedge fund tci this had a reputation for aggressive activism that helped trigger the sale of dutch bank abn amro to the royal bank of scotland during mr sunak s time there noted the financial times the wsws noted previously of tci s modus operandi the fund buys into companies whose share price has fallen sharply ensures that the yield and therefore the share price rises again by imposing mass layoffs and dismantling the entire concern finally sucking out millions and billions of euros from the leftovers before moving on to look for new victims what remains are tens of thousands of workers and their families who have been pushed into unemployment and poverty before making his way into politics sunak worked at another hedge fund theleme partners and was a director at catamaran ventures the investment office of the murthy family sunak is also the main architect of the free ports policy that johnson s hard brexit wing of the tory party have wanted in place for years in 2016 he issued a report the free ports opportunity calling for an extensive and ambitious network of uk free ports these would not only provide domestic manufacturers with a wealth of tangible benefits but also send a clear message to international markets that britain s new global role will be open innovative and outward looking free ports which can be based at any location in the uk not simply at ports are essential for setting the benchmark for ramping up the exploitation of the working class to ensure the competitiveness of the british capitalist class post brexit johnson is seeking to roll out around 10 free ports initially that offer lower levels of taxation no vat and have few regulations their creation is seen as imperative in attracting global investment at the expense of the eu and britain s main competitors another hard brexiteer simon clarke insisted in summary we should not aim to establish the type of insipid freeport that one finds across the european continent instead we should aspire to construct supercharged freeports like those found in china the us and the middle east the pro brexit daily telegraph was clear as to the meaning of javid s ouster in an editorial friday new chancellor has a chance to be radical it stated that although javid was a bright political talent there were rumours that he was considering some popular measures in his next budget including a mansion tax it appeared that javid had been persuaded by civil servants to consider socialist measures that even the last labour government would never have touched the message to sunak on his first budget was let it be radical the tories have an historic opportunity to rethink the way britain works they could do what the treasury prefers and keep all the old regulations sticking close to europe while the government taxes and spends incautiously alternatively mr johnson and mr sunak could plan for a smaller state judicious investment and lower taxes and thus build the free enterprise economy of a

alleging that pakistan had been harbouring terrorists trump slammed the previous us governments for supporting the country pakistan on friday accused the american government of destabilising the south asian region because itâ approved a military sale to india of integrated air defence weapon system iadws worth an estimated 1 867 billion pakistan foreign ministry spokesperson aisha farooqui called the decision disturbing notwithstanding the regular stream of advanced weaponry flowing into islamabad courtesy us and china advertisement farooqui said the sale of such sophisticated weapons to india will disturb the strategic balance in south asia the us decision would disturb strategic balance in south asia with serious security implications for pakistan and the region these growing defence ties including purchase of arms between india and the united states would contribute towards further destabilisation of peace and security in the region said the foreign office spokesperson during a press briefing in islamabad before nosediving into pakistanâ s concern in the growing defence ties between india and the united states it is salient to recall how pakistan built its military strength depending on the us looking back at 1950s pakistanâ s relationship with the us took a new course in the 1950s culminating in the military alliance and treaties that imposed far reaching and unilateral commitments on pakistan to subserve us purposes advertisement both the countries signed the mutual defence assistance treaty in 1954 which was followed by two us sponsored regional security alliancesâ â â seato and cento the mutual security pact in 1959 became the fourth security deal between the two nations these arrangements facilitated american arms transfer to pakistan and a military personnel training program an american military advisory mission was based in pakistan army headquarters for some years advertisement us pakistan form military alliance since 1948 pakistan has historically been among the top recipients of us aidâ â the country received more than euro 30 billion in direct aid â the guardian â reported a propagandist view of the newly formed us pakistan military alliance was that it was intended to strengthen pakistan vis ã vis india but the rhetoric provided by the us leaders about the pact was contradictory their argument was that the alliance was formed to bolster pakistan as a first line of defence of south asia against soviet expansionist designs in afghanistan the reasoning was calculated to allay indiaâ s fears advertisement the us was building pakistan militaryâ s strength as part of its strategy for developing regional security networks to contain the soviet union and the spread of communism but for pakistan the sole aim of strengthening its armoury was to gather weapons for use against bigger military power india what pakistan wanted is to toughen its security against this perceived indian threat it never had a problem with the soviet union advertisement pakistan bolsters military equipment in 1981 the us announced a six year 3 2 billion package for pakistan which was equally distributed between economic assistance and credit for military sales in the following five years â the us provided 40 f 16 fighters 100 m 48 tanks 64 m 109 155 mm howitzers 40 m 110 203 mm sp howitzers 75 towed howitzers and 1 005 tow anti tank missile system all of which made pakistan supersede its defence capability advertisement the aid rose from around 60 million in economic and development assistance in 1979 to more than 600 million a year in the mid 1980s in total the united states gave 2 19 billion in military assistance from 1980 till 1990 the military aid was in addition to the 3 1 billion economic assistance for pakistan advertisement despite its economic challenges including spiraling debt and rising cost of imports along with low government revenue pakistan has maintained progress on critical modernization programs to strengthen its conventional military forces george bush administration after the united states spent more than 5 billion in proposed combat aircraft sales to pakistan in 2007 the george bush administration faced flak for its failed effort to bolster the pakistani military effort against al qaeda and the taliban advertisement in interviews in islamabad and washington bush administration and military officials said they believed much of the american money was not making its way to frontline pakistani units the new york times reported money has been diverted to help finance weapons systems designed to counter india not al qaeda or the taliban the officials said adding that the united states has paid tens of millions of dollars in inflated pakistani reimbursement claims for fuel ammunition and other costs advertisement obama administration america s relations with pakistan suffered a setback after the us raid killed osama bin laden in abbottabad â in may 2011 the barack obama administration had issued warnings to pakistanâ s security establishment to mend its disruptive behaviour however coming under increasing pressure to justify us aid spending in pakistan the administration in july 2011 had suspended more than one third of all military assistance to pakistan advertisement robert gates the defence secretary from 2006 to 2011 in his memoir conceded when the operation to kill laden was being planned he was worried that pakistanâ s inter services intelligence agency isi was aware of bin ladenâ s whereabouts ahead of the raid no one in the obama administration considered seeking pakistanâ s help in killing bin laden as past experience showed that the target was forewarned and fled or the pakistanis went after the target unilaterally prematurely and unsuccessfully whenever intelligence about them was shared advertisement trump vows to end military aid to pakistan in the early days of the donald trump administration the white house talked tough on pakistan vowing to apply more pressure on islamabad in its efforts to crack down on terror groups on its soil trump thundered in an august 2017 speech laying out his south asia strategy we have been paying pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting but that will have to change and that will change immediately no partnership can survive a countryâ s harboring of militants and terrorists who target us service members and officials he had said coming down heavily on pakistan again on the first day of 2018 the us president accused the country of deceiving the united states and declined the funding in military assistance due to its continued support to the haqqani network and the taliban alleging that pakistan had been harbouring terrorists trump slammed the previous us governments for supporting the country he claimed that the us foolishly gave more than 33 billion dollars to pakistan in aid and said that in return pakistan considered american leaders fools in august 2019 the trump administration notified congress that it was putting 255 million in military assistance to pakistan into the equivalent of an escrow account that islamabad can only access if it does more to crack down on internal terror networks launching attacks on neighboring afghanistan as opposed to pakistan foreign ministry s claim that approval of the indian request to purchase iadws comprising dozens of amraam missiles is â disturbingâ it can be argued that it is in fact pakistan that has always tried to develop a strategy to destabilise south asia specifically india empowered by military equipment from the united states one such example was seen in february 2018 when india provided proof to the us that weapons like the us tow 2a anti tank guided missiles given to pakistan to combat taliban forces were being used against the indian army according to media reports nine indian soldiers lost their lives in 2018 during pakistani ceasefire violations and fire assaults directed against indian army positions along the line of control loc pakistan had purchased tow 2a anti tank missiles for self defence and showcase support to us operations against terrorists in afghanistan the sale of 2000 anti tank guided missiles to pakistan was cleared by the us congress in october 2007 flagging the misuse of the missiles with the us is part of india s policy to isolate pakistan in the global arena in past india has objected to sale of lethal weapons to pakistan meanwhile as pakistan continues to bolster its infantry anti tank capabilities author analyst and former defense attachã to islamabad brian cloughley told defense news that emphasis on heavy armor indicates pakistanâ s preparedness for conventional war he also added it seems that the riposte is alive and being refined in direct answer to indiaâ s overwhelming numerical superiority cloughley said the government may have realized the use of tactical nuclear weapons would spark an uncontrollable escalation and so it is focusing on other capabilities however this by no means indicates that tactical nuclear surface to surface missiles are not a most important asset â simply that pakistan has been considering all options and appears to have concluded it had better maintain and develop conventional forces concentrating on armor he added pakistan s history of misusing foreign aid and loaned defence equipment against india is no secret thus by making such statements against a legit defence deal between india us it s making a mockery of itself
investors are still being fairly complacent about the novel coronavirus after the number of new daily cases suddenly shot up to more than 15 000 on february 12 following more than a week of decline there were some jitters in the markets with chinese authorities saying the increase was due to a decision to broaden the definition for diagnosing people there were falls in the region of 1 in european markets and smaller retrenchments in asia and north america it is a fairly minor shift in sentiment after a few days in which investor concerns had been steadily receding there appears to be a real danger of underestimating the likely economic impact of this crisis china s manufacturing sector in particular faces an unprecedented challenge because supply chains have been so seriously disrupted coronavirus daily new cases well over 80 cities have gone into lockdown including the entire areas of five chinese provinces hubei liaoning jiangxi an hui and inner mongolia and four main cities in zhejiang province affecting well over 275 million people since february 10 beijing and shanghai have further restricted the movement of people having already extended the chinese new year break my parents live in jiangxi province and are among millions semi quarantined at home the local government allows one person from each household to go out every two day to buy necessities even in cities not under compulsory lockdown there are rarely people on the streets the tweet below shows the nanjing road in shanghai the busiest shopping precinct in the country it was taken on january 26 but the situation is not much better now this is taking a serious toll on the chinese economy no statistics on the actual losses are available yet but for example the number of intercity passengers on public transport during the new year break was only 60 of 2019 levels xibei a famous dining brand with 350 restaurants and rmb5 7 billion pound 628 million annual revenues said takings during the holiday period were down 87 year on year the contrast with last year when chinese tourism retail and catering revenues all rose by around 8 during the new year period is likely to be huge the problems in the chinese services sector are primarily a demand shock this will probably rebound once the epidemic is contained just like during the sars outbreak of 2003 the chinese inflation rate based on the consumer price index cpi turned down during peak crisis between february and june 2003 then quickly shifted to positive makers not marching this time around in manufacturing which comprises nearly a third of the chinese economy there is a much bigger shock to the supply side than in 2003 factory lines have ground to a halt because of the lockdown you can see the gap between the demand and supply of chinese goods by comparing the inflation rate with the level of optimism among the country s manufacturers as measured by the purchasing managers index pmi the chinese cpi in january rose 5 4 the highest monthly rate since october 2011 while the manufacturing pmi hit a three month low of 50 the fact that inflation is actually rising this time when it fell in 2003 is because this time both supply and demand are falling but supply is falling faster to keep the economy afloat the government has rolled out a series of financial measures including lower borrowing rates loan extensions tax reductions and waivers and an injection of rmb200 billion pound 22 billion in market liquidity this will ease financial strains but not address the underlying problems in manufacturing supply chains many manufacturers cannot resume work because they can t get supplies of raw materials and their workforce is quarantined they are having problems with orders wage payments cash flow order deliveries debt repayments and logistics and transport many are also facing penalties for breaching contracts many companies are also having to suspend operations by order of the local government for example out of 29 814 firms that have applied to resume operations in hangzhou the capital city of zhejiang province just 162 had been given authorisation by february 10 many smaller companies can t get authorisation because they are less capable of sourcing face masks than bigger companies they are also more wary of letting out of town workers return because they usually have less dormitory space so can t give them a room to themselves another key precaution against the spread of infection a poll of 1 295 firms by the chinese academy of social science cass published on february 1 found that 43 9 expected their business will post a loss in the coming year it won t take long before liquidity problems morph into solvency problems especially for smaller companies only 9 of respondents to the cass survey thought they would survive a month of suspended operations while two thirds said that a two week shutdown was all they could take global supply chains this is already disrupting the world supply chain for manufacturing hitting everyone from big south korean car manufacturers like hyundai and kia to small tech companies in the us like agilian technology some chinese manufacturers such as number one apple supplier foxconn are resuming work in phases but they still need more time to reach full capacity because only local employees can return immediately workers travelling from elsewhere have to isolate themselves at home for seven to 14 days before returning the next apple smartphone due in march could be delayed the new coronavirus is a major shock to all market participants in china even if the outbreak is contained over the next few weeks it will still have a long term impact the demand and supply shocks could combine to drive china into stagflation where there is inflation and weak economic growth at the same time and for which there are no effective monetary or fiscal policies the uncertainty created by the outbreak compounded by china s trade war with the us is going to force companies to re examine their exposure to chinese manufacturing and the whole idea of a global supply chain it wouldn t be surprising to see rival countries developing supply hubs of closely linked manufacturers of the kind that china has created very successfully this too looks like bad news for china the novel coronavirus is prompting a new period of global instability whose ramifications could be felt for many years to come author chusu he lecturer in finance coventry university
facebook x linkedin pinterest email child labor unethical promotion manipulating uneducated mothers pollution price fixing and mislabeling those are not words you want to see associated with your company nestle is the world s largest foodstuff company and it has a history that would make even hardcore industrialists shiver we re gonna look at why nestle has such a bad reputation and whether or not it deserves it introduction people love to hate and they really love to hate on big companies whether or not they have a reason to i especially dislike it when the latter happens companies big companies included are the very backbone of our economy and they often get a bad rep for little or no reason but sometimes there is a reason or as in this case several solid reasons as we ll see below which brings me to the next point why are we writing this article zme science is a science website crazy right and this is not strictly science at least not in the way our regular articles are but we also write about environmental issues especially when they affect many of us and especially when we can make a difference nestle is a swiss multinational food and beverage company according to wikipedia their products include baby food bottled water breakfast cereals coffee and tea confectionery dairy products ice cream frozen food pet foods and snacks twenty nine of their brands have sales of over 1 billion a year and have over 8 000 brands they have 447 factories across 194 countries and employ around 333 000 people they truly are what you would call a giant they re also considered to be one of the best employers in europe with six leed certifications and sponsor numerous activities and sustainable projects looking at only these stats it would seem that nestle is one of the good guys but then why are they so hated let s take it step by step baby formula and boycott we re in the 90s and this is a sad story about poverty breastfeeding and greed nestle aggressively pushed their breastfeeding formula in less economically developed countries ledcs specifically targeting the poor they made it seem that their infant formula was almost as good as a mother s milk which is highly unethical for several reasons the first problem was the need for water sanitation most of the groups they were targeting especially in africa didn t have access to clean water many don t to this day so it was necessary for them to boil the water but due to low literacy rates many mothers were not aware of this so they mixed the formula with polluted water which put the children at great risks nestle seems to have knowingly ignored this and encouraged mothers to use the formula even when they knew the risks breastfeeding one of the most important aspects for an infant especially in unsanitized areas was cast aside baby formula was the nearest thing in the world and this splendid triumph of care and science is so like mother s milk that the tiny stomach won t notice the difference but the tiny stomach did notice the difference breastfeeding is unparalleled in providing the ideal food for infants the optimal way to feed a baby is exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months followed by breastfeeding combined with complementary foods until the child is two years old a 2007 save the children report many mothers were able to read in their native language but were still unable to read the language in which sterilization directions were written even if mothers understood the need to boil the water they might not have had the facilities to do so unicef estimates that a formula fed child living in disease ridden and unhygienic conditions is between 6 and 25 times more likely to die of diarrhea and four times more likely to die of pneumonia than a breastfed child another problem was that mothers tended to use less formula than needed to make the jar last longer resulting in many infants receiving inadequate amounts but even if the water was boiled and even if the formula was administered in the right proportion and in the right quantity it is lacking in many of the nutrients and antibodies that breast milk provides breast milk contains the required amount of the nutrients essential for neuronal brain and nerve development and to some extent protects the baby from many diseases and potential infections according to the international baby food action network ibfan nestle used unethical methods to promote their infant formula to poor mothers in developing countries but it gets even worse ibfan claims that nestle distributes free formula samples to hospitals and maternity wards after leaving the hospital the formula is no longer free but because the supplementation has interfered with lactation the family must continue to buy the formula nestle denies those allegations sort of nestlé takes reports on non compliance with the who code very seriously and we have endeavored to investigate all allegations brought to our attention despite the fact that in many cases we are not provided with accurate details substantiating the accusations this makes it difficult for us to investigate how where and when the alleged infringement could have occurred some of the allegations are several years old before they are brought to public attention which also could complicate the investigation health experts were concerned from the very start it s been known for quite a while that bottle feeding infants in impoverished tropical environments with limited sanitation and refrigeration can be a recipe for disaster but nestlé s asked that critics should focus on doing something to improve unsafe water supplies which contributed to the health problems associated with bottle feeding they also later used this approach to promote their bottled water using their huge marketing budget to influence people s behavior while avoiding denying any direct responsibility today several countries and organizations are still boycotting nestle despite their claims to be in compliance with who regulations there s even a committee the international nestlé boycott committee that monitors their practices several universities and student organizations have also joined the boycott especially in the uk more recently the company has also been under head for a study on breastmilk substitutes in india india s apex medical research authority asked the company to stop paying study participants which included pregnant and breastfeeding mothers it s not clear how many lives that were lost directly and indirectly due to this aggressive marketing campaign and of course nestle does not claim responsibility for these tragedies but it was easy for them as it was easy for everybody to see the risks and the negative effects their formula was having it was easy for them to save many lives but they chose the money instead profits before children check let s move on nestle and water few people know it but nestle is actually the world s largest producer of bottled water in fact they re so keen on their water business which also involves many of their other products that they believe water isn t a universal right chairman peter brabeck letmathe said there are two different opinions on the matter the one opinion which i think is extreme is represented by the ngos who bang on about declaring water a public right that means that as a human being you should have a right to water that s an extreme solution having access to water is not an extreme solution it s what we have called a basic need for centuries even brabeck after the media attack that followed backed down he said that he believes that water is a human right and advocates for universal access to safe drinking water but his actions as well as nestle s actions show that that s just greenwashing if you care about the environment find out the latest news join our community at the second world water forum in 2000 nestle pushed for making access to drinking water from a right to a need a defining change meanwhile nestle drains the aquifers it controls as much as possible without any regards to sustainable usage or environmental concerns a recent case is the california drought an issue without precedent in the past 1 200 years but nestle doesn t care even as starbucks recently announced they would transfer their ethos water bottling facility from california to pennsylvania nestle ceo tim brown said absolutely not in fact if i could increase i would yes if he could he d increase water bottling operations even though nestle has been working without a permit since 1988 inhabitat reports that the company has been sourcing its water from the san bernardino national forest without a permit and they ve been recently been bumped to the front of the queue for permit renewal which will take around 18 months and they can keep working in the meantime as long as they pay a laughable 524 annual fee also california doesn t know how much water nestle uses because they have no legal grounds for making the company divulge this information and nestle hasn t published any reports an independent analysis puts all their water usage at 1 billion gallons a year arguably that s not much when you considering that 500 billion gallons of water that will be saved under gov brown s new water restrictions but there s something absurd and immoral about a private company using as much water as they want while the rest of the state is facing severe restrictions but other areas in the world have it even worse than california in the small pakistani community of bhati dilwan a former village councilor says children are being sickened by filthy water who s to blame he says it s bottled water maker nestle which dug a deep well that is depriving locals of potable water the water is not only very dirty but the water level sank from 100 to 300 to 400 feet dilwan says source indeed unsustainable usage of aquifer water can lead to a significant decrease in water levels and can even exhaust the aquifer that s right underground water isn t the inexhaustible source many people believe it to be in the case of bhati dilwan people are getting sick because if the community had fresh water piped in it would deprive nestle of its money source bottled water under the pure life brand greedily using natural resources for profits check but when nestle isn t trying to privatize water or use it without regards to the environment it s simply bottling tap water a chicago based business has sued the company again claiming that the five gallon jugs of ice mountain water they bought were nothing else than tap water it may come as a shock to you but nearly half of the bottled water in pet plastic bottles is actually from a tap though nestle never advertised this they know what s likely going to happen though as this is almost a dress rehearsal of a previous scandal twelve years ago nestle waters was sued over allegation of false labeling and ultimately settled for 10 million in charitable contributions and discounts more recently nestle expressed their concern to the city of flint michigan which was undergoing a massive water crisis at the time a crisis which still takes a toll to this day meanwhile the company was using nearby water reserves for their own bottled water products nestle was bottling hundreds of thousands of bottles paying only 200 to use this natural reserve child labor abuse and trafficking most people love chocolate but few know the dirty deals behind chocolate production the 2010 documentary the dark side of chocolate brought attention to purchases of cocoa beans from ivorian plantations that use child slave labour the children are usually 12 to 15 years old and some are trafficked from nearby countries and nestle is no stranger to this practice in 2005 the cocoa industry was for the first time under the spotlight the international labor rights fund filed a lawsuit against nestle among others on behalf of three malian children the suit alleged the children were trafficked to côte d ivoire forced into slavery and experienced frequent beatings on a cocoa plantation in 2010 the us district court for the central district of california determined corporations cannot be held liable for violations of international law and dismissed the suit a controversial decision which has since been appealed but even if nestle wasn t legally liable for these abuses they are at least morally but that wasn t the only case of this kind a report by an independent auditor the fair labor association fla says it found multiple serious violations of the company s own supplier code it was reported that nestle hadn t carried out checks against child labor and abuse additionally many injuries caused by machetes which are used to harvest cocoa pods have been reported nestle s excuse can be summed up broadly as everybody does it the use of child labour in our cocoa supply chain goes against everything we stand for says nestle s executive vice president for operations jose lopez no company sourcing cocoa from the ivory coast can guarantee that it doesn t happen but we can say that tackling child labour is a top priority for our company the fla reported that nestle was fully aware of where their cocoa was coming from and under what conditions but did little to improve conditions child slavery and abuse check health threats in july 2009 the food and drug administration fda and the centers for disease control and prevention cdc warned consumers to avoid eating any varieties of prepackaged nestle toll house refrigerated cookie dough due to risk of contamination with e coli o157 h7 a foodborne bacterium that causes illness in the us it caused sickness in more than 50 people in 30 states half of whom required hospitalization in particular one woman had a fatal infection before the batch was reclaimed the fact that our product was implicated in linda rivera s 2009 illness and tragic passing was obviously of grave concern to all of us at nestle the company said in a statement since then we have implemented more stringent testing and inspection of raw materials and finished product to ensure the product meets our high quality standards which sort of makes you wonder why weren t stringent testing and inspections implemented in the first place but this is just a minor incident compared to the 2008 chinese milk scandal six infants were killed and 860 were hospitalized with kidney problems after nestle products were contaminated with melamine a substance sometimes illegally added to food products to increase their apparent protein content in october 2008 taiwan health ministry announced that six types of milk powders produced in china by nestlé contained low level traces of melamine and were removed from the shelves the scandal quickly escalated with china reporting over 300 000 victims raising concerns about the security of major food companies operating in china two people were executed and several life prison sentences were issued with the world health organization who referring to the incident as one of the largest food safety events it has had to deal with in recent years nestle denied implication and claimed that all its products are clean but the taiwan government linked their products to toxic melamine as a response nestle says it has sent 20 specialists from switzerland to five of its chinese plants to strengthen chemical testing pollution as with any respectable large company nestle has been involved in several incidents regarding pollution a 1997 report found that in the uk over a 12 month period water pollution limits were breached 2 152 times in 830 locations by companies that included cabdury and nestle but again the situation in china was much worse while people in the us and europe are slowly becoming more environmentally concerned and some are opting for more sustainable sources of water nestle has moved to another market asia alongside companies such as kraft or shell nestle made several environmental violations nestle sources shanghai ltd s bottled water manufacturing plant also made the list for starting operation before its wastewater treatment facilities had passed an environmental impact assessment these are only some of the water pollution violations committed by multinational companies in china since our website has yet to cover information about air and solid waste pollution said ma jun director of the institute of public environmental affairs the parent companies in their home countries are models for environmental protection but they have slackened their efforts in china another article claims that nestle capitalizes on china s already polluted waters to make a good profit while corporate watch highlights the fact that nestle continues to extract water illegally from brazil for their perrier brand although nestlé lost the legal action pumping continues as it gets through the appeal procedures something which can take ten years or more ethiopian debt in 2002 nestle made what turned out to be a colossal error demanding that ethiopia pay them back a debt of us 6 million there s nothing wrong with that per se if ethiopia wasn t facing extreme famine at the time for a company that has 29 brands that make over 1 billion a year asking a famine stricken country to pay you back 6 million seems questionable to say the least nestle s claim dates back to the 1970s when the military regime in addis ababa seized the assets of foreign companies the public roar came almost overnight with the company receiving 40 000 letters from outraged people in one of the most famous cases of public opinion beat corporate greed in the end nestle took a u turn settling for a partial debt which was also invested in the country s bouncing back from famine for nestle who initially insisted that the compensation issue was a matter of principle and that it was in the best interest of addis ababa to settle the demand to repair its record with foreign investors it was a huge moral defeat for analysts it was an exciting case which showed that even giants can falter in the face of public opinion this is a welcome result because it shows that nestle is not immune to public pressure said phil bloomer a senior policy analyst a deal with mugabe striking dubious partnerships to make a profit seems to be a recurring theme the swiss multinational made a deal with the wife of the infamous dictator from zimbabwe robert mugabe buying 1 million liters of milk a year from a farm seized from its rightful owners by grace mugabe grace has taken over at least six of zimbabwe s most valuable white owned farms since 2002 building a farming empire from illegally confiscated farms which led to an international boycott as well as eu and us sanctions she is known for her ridiculously lavish lifestyle which includes overseeing the construction of two luxuriant castles in 2014 she was given a doctorate diploma only three months after signing up for the program nestle went forward with the deal though even as the country s agriculture based economy was collapsing and inflation was reaching unheard of levels price fixing in canada the competition bureau raided the offices of nestlé canada along with those of hershey canada inc and mars canada inc in an investigation on price fixing nestlé and the other companies were subject to class action lawsuits and ultimately settled for 9 million without actually admitting liability furthermore former president and chief executive officer of nestle canada is facing criminal charges in the us another larger trial was rejected because even though it was plausible that the same thing happened in the us there was no clear evidence of any foul play the suspicion remained however and still lingers with the company promoting unhealthy food and mislabeling that nestle is promoting unhealthy food should come as no surprise but the level at which they operate it is simply staggering a recent report by the uk consumers association claims that 7 out of the 15 breakfast cereals with the highest levels of sugar fat and salt were nestle products nestlé claims to be the world s leading nutrition health and wellness company but when it comes to food marketing to kids nestlé is a laggard not a leader said cspi nutrition policy director margo g wootan nestle dismissed all responsibility in promoting healthy food to pour even more salt in the foods wound mister brabeck came out with a dismissive interview in the telegraph claiming that he is not obese yet every morning i have a tablet of dark chocolate as my breakfast and that it is the perfect balance and contains everything he needs for the day hey after all who would actually think that nestle s cereals are healthy right but while nestle s labels aren t simply misleading they have also been downright false in november 2002 police ordered nestle colombia to decommission 200 tons of imported powdered milk because they were falsely relabeled not only as a different local brand but also with a different production date a month later another 120 tons suffered the same fate causing uproar among the colombian population nestle bringing old powdered milk from a different country and labeling as local and new is not only unethical and illegal but it poses health hazards for consumers drawing the line all major companies have incidents accidents and scandals when you have so many people working for you it s virtually impossible to maintain a clean sheet someone will eventually screw up someone will eventually do something they should as i was preparing to write this article a friend actually asked me if other companies don t have a similar record and advised me to look at mars for example what i found was that mars and other big companies have indeed had their share of scandals sometimes the same ones as nestle but not nearly on the same scale nestle has shown time and time again that they have few ethics and little interest in a real social responsibility from promoting their formula to uneducated african mothers to lying about production dates to using water without a permit to dealing with ruthless dictators they have often gone the extra mile to make an extra profit even when the extra mile meant hurting people directly or indirectly if you care about the environment find out the latest news join our community was this helpful thanks for your

in 2017 and 2018 the census bureau announced positive figures for net internal migration into minnesota of 7 941 and 6 769 respectively this was the cause of some celebration in every year since 2001 minnesota had lost residents on net to other states this uptick has not since been maintained however figures for 2019 show that net domestic migration slumped to just 65 people if minnesota goes back to losing residents to other states it will exacerbate one of our state s most discussed economic issues slowing population and labor force growth leading to slower economic growth minnesota s labor force participation rate stood at 63 2 in november 2019 and the state demographic center projects this will fall to 60 4 in 2050 a smaller share of minnesotans working to produce goods and services gross domestic product or gdp means all else equal less gdp to divide among the state s population in other words lower per capita gdp immigration either domestic or foreign where minnesota had a net gain of 9 113 in 2019 is often offered as a solution this was why the numbers in 2017 and 2018 were celebrated of course immigrants can add to the denominator population as well as the numerator gdp so while they might increase the state s total gdp the question of whether they increase the state s per capita gdp which is what really matters for living standards depends on two factors their propensity to be employed and their productivity advertisement this latter is the key point as the economist paul krugman has written productivity isn t everything but in the long run it is almost everything a state s ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker he is exactly right at a conference in 2017 minnesota s state economist laura kalambokidis was asked about the prospects for economic growth given these demographic challenges when you have slow labor force growth and you want economic growth she replied the key is going to be productivity if minnesota can improve its labor productivity it can maintain economic growth in the face of declining participation rates and employment ratios even in per capita terms sadly another set of recent data this time from the internal revenue service suggests that migration might be causing problems here too the irs recently released data on the movement of taxpayers and income across the country for 2016 17 and 2017 18 minnesota on net lost 900 million of income to other states between 2016 and 2018 specifically in 2016 17 the state lost 223 million in adjusted gross income reported by tax filers who moved in and out of minnesota the least adjusted for inflation since 1995 96 before rebounding to 673 million in 2017 18 this is down from the peak outflow of 2013 14 when former gov mark dayton s tax hike prompted a flow of income from the state as dayton himself said discussing tax breaks to encourage investment incentives do make a difference contrary to popular belief minnesota s out migration is not driven by retirement in both 2016 17 and 2017 18 our state saw a net loss of residents in every age category from 45 54 people their prime working years and up neither is it just the rich who are leaving in 2017 18 minnesota was a net loser of residents in every income category from 50 000 to 75 000 and up none of this should be a surprise the large and growing body of evidence on the effects of taxation on migration was summarized recently by economists henrik kleven camille landais mathilde muñoz and stefanie stantcheva they found that there is growing evidence that taxes can affect the geographic location of people both within and across countries this migration channel creates another efficiency cost of taxation that policymakers need to contend with when setting tax policy and minnesota s taxes are famously high our top rate of personal income tax 9 85 on taxable incomes over 163 890 is higher than anywhere else apart from california hawaii new jersey and oregon we are one of 13 jurisdictions with an estate tax which new research shows loses the state government revenue by pushing people out of the state equally significant perhaps minnesota s lowest income tax rate of 5 35 is higher than the highest tax bracket in 25 states advertisement this brings us back to labor productivity if we take income as a proxy for productivity which is a fairly standard approach in economics the numbers show that minnesota is on net losing its most productive workers this is not what we need in the face of declining labor force growth taxes are not the only reason people move but they are a factor it is imperative state government policy tilts the table in minnesota s favor john phelan is an economist for the center of the american experiment americanexperiment org which is based in golden valley minnesota he wrote this for the news tribune
i want to thank noozhawk publisher bill macfadyen for his forceful words about mary jane and adolfo corral and their killer in his feb 14 column impacts of goleta couple s deaths in hit run collision run deep around here it s true that their tragic deaths have affected a really large part of our community which just goes to show how big of a difference they made i hope that the way the community is coming together now for their children and each other can lead to something bigger and better their relentless positivity should be an inspiration to all of us jessica murphy santa barbara idiot please reserve your idiotic remarks about the astros for your dodger whining blog your team got beat because they re not good enough to win get over it and move on homer michael brown goleta at the santa barbara county planning commission and board of supervisors i have recounted the story that upon arriving at our vineyard one of the grandkids while getting out of the car asked granddad why does the vineyard smell like pepperoni the smell was of course cannabis whether it was from a legal grow bad actor or homeowner s backyard stash was unknown it seems ironic that the proposed winery ordinance for an industry that sells smell had an odor abatement requirement surprisingly the cannabis ordinance had no odor abatement requirement for an industry that everyone agrees can stink the planning commission is holding marathon workshops to craft recommendations for amendments to the cannabis ordinance at its feb 5 session there was a suggestion for a requirement that cannabis odor stop at the property line while this may sound good it is a dangerous precedent for farmers our vineyard is on the north side of highway 246 across the road from us are several hundred acres of farmland that for many years were planted with broccoli and brussel sprouts two or three times each year for five days or so when the broccoli or brussel bprouts were harvested our vineyard smelled like broccoli or brussel sprouts an aroma that some may like but i find unpleasant that is the problem with odors they are very individual when our young granddaughter spent every spare moment at the horse stable she invited my wife cathy into the stable and exclaimed grandma don t you just love the smell cathy said of course dear but later confided to me that all she could smell was horse sweat and merde it is not a very big step from requiring cannabis odors to stop at the property line to requiring all farm odors to stop at the property line i suggest farmers would be better served if we treated farm odors like we treat farm noise some of us in the vineyard business use noisy wind machines for frost protection and air cannons during harvest to scare the birds these noises don t stop

threshold that is realistic for responsible growers stephen pepe close pepe vineyards lompoc i thoroughly enjoyed noozhawk columnist dan mccaslin s edifying feb 9 column post stroke hiking and the skylike mind following his stroke inspiring and revelatory karin collison los angeles important issues affecting residents have been obscured in the campaign for santa barbara county s first district supervisor because of the vitriolic attacks by the relatively inexperienced challenger laura capps on the effective incumbent das williams the important issues include community resilience in the face of natural disasters fire and flood debris basins environmental concerns oil gas water and pollution affordable housing including public employees homelessness health availability and costs transportation auto bus and train walkways utilities micro grids schools insurance cancellations and claim denials public budgets fostering business and labor williams addresses these issues knowledgeably while capps has only recently taken a stab at them rather than at williams williams has worked forcefully and effectively in all of these areas and has received endorsements from more than a dozen organizations including santa barbara county firefighters association the santa barbara county deputy sheriff s association the santa barbara democratic party the women s political committee a half dozen unions and the sierra club as well as dozens of elected officials capps has isolated advocates in these areas but because she has little if any experience except with schools there has been little organizational support and almost no endorsements from elected officials this lack of support has led her to focus almost entirely on negative attacks on the incumbent such unprincipled vilification is expected from president donald trump but could well capps ize her campaign dick mazess montecito i wholeheartedly support bruce porter in the upcoming election for santa barbara county s third district supervisor i was born and raised in santa barbara and after many years of living and working outside of the area my husband and i chose to return to the county and make our home in the beautiful santa ynez valley we have become active members of our wonderful community by volunteering for various nonprofit organizations i have worked in both the private and public sector and was also a small business owner and employer giving me a broad perspective on how our county supervisors can best serve our third district citizens a group of rancho santa ynez estates residents here in solvang including myself recently hosted porter to meet and speak with us as well as those in the adjoining alisal glen neighborhood along fjord drive we are a community that the county has been steamrolling over in their personal vision of what s best for their agendas and they have ignored our many voices about our concerns with how their proposals will negatively affect and forever change the nature of the quiet and safe neighborhood that has existed here for 50 years porter however reached out to us took the time to hear our concerns answer questions have a genuine discussion and share his vision for the third district we desperately need a change of county leadership and porter has proven himself to be a deeply committed candidate who understands the challenges we face as well as opportunities for the future and has the determination and the experience to produce results our santa ynez valley community is home to people from all walks of life we have chosen this place as home and most people i know want to work to make and keep our community the best that it can be i know that porter wants the same and he will fight for us all denise rose solvang i am writing in support of re electing joan hartmann as santa barbara county s third district supervisor when i was a newly elected board member of the goleta water district hartmann immediately reached out to me and invited me to meet with her to discuss water issues important to the county and the goleta valley i was impressed with her knowledge of local water issues and her interest and willingness to listen and learn from elected officials who represent other segments of the community on a personal note hartmann understood the importance of and voted on a traffic issue in my neighborhood that has increased the safety of drivers bicyclists and pedestrians she has displayed the intelligence curiosity thoughtfulness and willingness to listen all important qualities to have in order to truly represent the people not only in the third district but also throughout santa barbara county re elect hartmann as third district supervisor so she can continue to work for the people in santa barbara county kathleen werner goleta as an appointed member of the los alamos planning advisory committee i want to express my gratitude for santa barbara county third district supervisor joan hartmann s eminent approachability pragmatism and humble respect for her constituents hartmann s campaign runs on the same clean energy and enthusiasm as does her platform on the environment she works with dedication toward the goal of creating a vibrant sustainable community whether on the shores of uc santa barbara or in the farm to table los alamos valley such an ability to multitask between the many communities in the third district doesn t distance her from her innate focus on each individual task until it has been completed to the highest standards hartmann s passionate governance has created the needed base for fiscal responsibility individual inclusivity and community transparency that has played out in city and unincorporated town alike it s important to see our local government representatives want to be involved in the well being of our communities hartmann has gone the extra distance to engage in town halls and to help get awareness for local organizations like the los alamos business association i have even found myself picking up trash with her in the riverbed behind my house i a 23 year old autistic man wouldn t be in public service pursuing a political science degree if she hadn t inspired me to challenge myself and try new opportunities in my own community forest starr los alamos seeing all the political ads lately i feel compelled to write in a letter of support of santa barbara county first district supervisor das williams i ve lived in the first district for many years it s much more diverse than people realize with residents of all income levels as well as different ethnic backgrounds i appreciate the fact that williams recognizes and cares about the full range of first district residents williams himself has both asian and european ancestry he understands both perspectives and experiences as someone who put himself through college and grad school he knows about economic insecurity he and his family live in a multiethnic lower middle class neighborhood in carpinteria he s had personal experience of economic hardship and racial difference which gives depth to his concerns about working families as the father of two young daughters williams understands the struggles of raising a family in a place where the cost of living is so high his passionate commitment to environmental protection leading santa barbara county to renewable energy sources is about ensuring that his girls like our children and grandchildren will have a future it s important that our elected officials reflect the diversity of our community so that everyone who lives here feels like they have a voice re electing williams means not just keeping his experience and commitment to our community but reassuring all of our county residents that there is a place on the dais for them too linda gardy summerland when you work for someone you get a good sense of who they are and what they care about i worked for das williams for four years as his district director when he represented our region in the assembly what i saw then and remains clear now is williams deep commitment to supporting all members of our community including women and people of color williams has consistently received a 100 percent rating from planned parenthood for his support of abortion rights and women s reproductive health in the assembly he authored ab 2441 which taxed strip clubs distributing funds toward services at rape crisis centers his bill reforming the 9 1 1 cell phone system was critical to helping anyone at risk of attack a need faced often by women threatened with rape or domestic violence in 2015 he was a sponsor of california s equality act these are just some reasons that the santa barbara women s political committee wpc endorsed his re election it s no accident that when the wpc members spoke in support of candidates for santa barbara county s first district supervisorial seat many who spoke for williams were women of color in my years working for him he also had an all female staff from diverse backgrounds an ardent environmentalist he balances social justice with environmental protection in 2016 he received a 100 percent rating from the california environmental justice alliance which promotes policies that alleviate both poverty and pollution williams is well positioned to continue representing the diverse residents of the first district jeannette sanchez palacios ventura the elephant in the room in santa barbara county s first district supervisorial race is cannabis incumbent das williams did not endorse and did not even vote for proposition 64 and would have preferred a state run system when california legalized recreational marijuana in 2016 it fell to the santa barbara county board of supervisors to tax and regulate the new industry in the county williams rolled up his sleeves and got to work bringing his collaborative skills and legislative experience to benefit the south coast the supervisors in bipartisan fashion hammered out ordinances to handle the industry from the ground up agriculture processing and sales and passed them on a 4 1 vote williams was a leader from the outset crafting strict but fair regulations the carpinteria valley s languishing flower farms were literally fertile ground for the new businesses indeed cannabis tax has generated more county revenue than expected 2 86 million in the last quarter alone the county coffers went from deficit to surplus which enabled the county to pick up the shortfall on three libraries the revenue also funds the inspection of the cannabis industry as well as policing illegal growers williams has worked hard on the board to regulate this new form of agri business anyone who knows him as i have for more than a decade knows that principles not self interest determine his choices and his votes anyone who has paid attention to his career in public service knows that the environment education and public welfare are paramount to williams it s no different now with the cannabis business jan clouse santa barbara i write this letter in strong support of das williams re election as santa barbara county s first district supervisor i have known williams since 2002 2003 when we were both marching up state street to protest the looming war in iraq even then williams showed strong leadership qualities since that time williams has taken his natural talents for policy work and problem solving to various municipal and state elected positions and honed his government skills gathering the knowledge and experience to serve our district i have met with laura capps she is friendly and intelligent but she does not have the breadth of experience that williams brings to the job and which serves us so well i appreciated williams position on dealing with cannabis he felt that permitting and fees would allow regulation to control a new industry and provide economic support to our dying flower industry i am disappointed that in the county s rush on this some neighbors including the city of carpinteria felt that they had been left out of the process subsequently some of these concerns have been addressed others have not i look forward to working with williams and further protect our citizens my endorsement of williams is based on the totality of his service and qualifications in addition to his vast experience he is a proven and stalwart defender of the environment a consistent supporter of our district s multicultural diversity and a strong progressive voice in government he is perhaps the most progressive member on the board of supervisors as such i hold him as a treasure to protect al clark carpinteria vice mayor i am extremely saddened and disappointed by how negative and attacking santa barbara county first district supervisorial candidate laura capps has been toward incumbent das williams a fellow democrat who has a 17 year record of extraordinary accomplishments on a range of issues from a living wage ordinance for the city of santa barbara to climate change and sustainability legislation locally and at the state level to authoring the nation s first red flag law and so much more using trump like tactics and low blows like questioning williams integrity is just not how i expect our local democrats to conduct themselves i know capps has contributed to our community and appreciate her work on the santa barbara unified school district board she has a lot to offer and has some interesting and valuable ideas but this is just not acceptable behavior i also question why she made the strategic decision to run for first district supervisor against a strong dedicated incumbent when she knew we have a critical election in the third district represented by supervisor joan hartman that could cause us to lose the progressive majority on the board of supervisors which could have a terrible impact on our community especially where environmental protection is concerned winning at any cost is not something i respect and i am offended when capps publicly attacks williams as far as i am concerned williams walks the walk and is as committed and ethical a public servant as i have ever seen i am proud to support him for re election and proud of him for not going low sherry k holland santa barbara it s time to vote for new wiser supervisors in santa barbara county especially in the first district race laura capps knows we should have conducted due diligence research before allowing cannibis cultivation into our district now many of us are left struggling with health issues due to the cannibis cultivation that is permeating the carpintetia valley once know for it s safe clean beaches carpintetia is surrounded with a disgusting skunk odor that is causing our children adults and seniors to suffer from multitudes of health issues caused by cannibis cultivation the disgusting skunk smell has replaced our once pleasant ocean breezes be aware voters we need to stop this creeping takeover by cannibis cultivation it needs to be seriously controlled and independent studies should have taken place before permits were granted ask yourself who were those responsible for drafting permits for cannibis cultivation they should have done the necessary due diligence that would have protected the citizens in the carpintetia valley the first district supervisor should have protected us instead of selling us out to the owners of cannibis cultivation unless we wake up to this serious problem of cannabis cultivation it will and already has started expansion in communities throughout california land is being purchased throughout the first district for potential cannibis cultivation unless our leaders develop stricter regulations our schools homes and businesses will be surrounded by cannibis cultivation and we will be living with the smell of skunks 24 7 it s time to get rid of the skunks and vote for supervisors who will protect our health lynn cederquist carpinteria the march 3 election is nearing and i find it urgent and critical for the future of our beloved community of isla vista to express my support for bruce porter an independent candidate for santa barbara county s third district supervisorial seat i am a fourth year uc santa barbara student and i have dedicated my time at ucsb to making isla vista a safer more sustainable and better place i am a board member of the isla vista recreation park district and earned support from community leaders the daily nexus editorial board and president of the isla vista community services district during my election to be the isla vista representative for ucsb s student government now i m asking you to consider supporting porter in his bid to bring tangible change to isla vista current supervisor joan hartmann took office my freshman year by promising ucsb students a better isla vista while four years was long enough for me and many of my classmates to earn a college degree it wasn t enough for her to help isla vista in many ways our community is worse off than it was during my freshman year students and families often do not feel safe in their own community housing costs have risen and availability hasn t improved multiple bluffs have collapsed dozens of people have overdosed and thousands of us remain food insecure college students are already burdened enough by classes work and planning for a career we should elect candidates who pledge to prioritize policies and legislation that make our community safer and more sustainable that person is porter with experience as an environmental engineer school board president and chairman of the santa barbara county chapter of the american red cross porter has dedicated his life to improving communities advancing educational equity and opportunity and saving our beloved planet we deserve a representative who keeps their promises not someone who turns their back after an election porter and his campaign have become a part of this community through tabling and canvassing at ucsb and in isla vista he recognizes that our community has been neglected over the past four years and wants to stop that hartmann claims she is the only environmental candidate in the race but when she had a chance to limit the growth of the county s oil infrastructure two years ago she voted to expand oil transport in cat canyon porter on the other hand wants to pursue a countywide ban on fracking ban new oil fields and pre zone land to speed up the transition to renewable energy commercial shipping through the santa barbara channel is the leading emitter of greenhouse gas forming nitrogen oxides nox in the county an activity porter wants to ban on top of that he wants to address food insecurity in isla vista find ways to limit erosion on the del playa bluffs and improve lighting throughout the community porter is the representative we deserve and have earned i support him and encourage you too as well on march 3 because without him isla vista will continue to be neglected matt griffin isla vista santa barbara county third district supervisorial candidate bruce porter is attacking supervisor joan hartmann for a list of broken promises his mailer comes from the porter for supervisor campaign but there is nothing in it about why anyone should vote for bruce porter what does he stand for what has he accomplished instead third district voters are offered a list of false statements about hartmann claim the negotiated camp 4 agreement has led to lost revenue for local schools fact the chumash tribe has contributed 8 8 million to educational and childhood programs in the third district school revenue losses are the result of lost oil revenue from the 2015 refugio oil pipeline rupture and changes to state funding formulas claim hartmann has neglected infrastructure leading to dangerous bridges and roads fact the board of supervisors has kept the 2015 commitment of allocating 18 percent of general revenue growth to maintaining county facilities parks and roads on top of a baseline commitment sb 1 means the state will provide much more money for deferred maintenance road maintenance will reach the board s 2020 goal of 40 milllion claim hartmann took cannabis money and then allowed unfettered cannabis development fact she led the effort to institute a cap on total acres cultivated countywide and to ban cultivation on small parcels she directed the county planning commission to develop additional measures that would resolve conflicts between traditional agriculture and cannabis to further protect urban rural boundaries and to prevent over concentration of cannabis cultivation enough lies porter or is this all you have to offer john burnaby buellton when we got our mail in ballots for the march 3 election a neighbor asked me if we should vote in santa barbara county s third district supervisorial race even though we live in the city of goleta the answer is yes and here s why the county board of supervisors will be voting on the issues that seriously affect us our beautiful coast and beaches and oil goleta beach and the gaviota coast are outside the city limits so decisions about these areas are made by the county not goleta it s up to the supervisors to protect these special areas as for oil county supervisors weigh in on oil drilling processing and transportation along our coast they recently opposed trucking oil through our community and they have actively supported a stop to drilling in our ocean and oil processing at haskell s beach in ellwood other reasons that goleta residents in the third district should vote is that the county provides virtually all our emergency and public health services either directly or by contract with goleta if you re unsure whom to vote for see the websites of the two leading candidates incumbent supervisor joan hartmann and main challenger bruce porter don t be lulled into thinking this march 3 election doesn t matter to goleta residents just because we have a city as a city we have more local control now but our quality of life in goleta also depends a lot on the county marian shapiro goleta follow the money we can all access official campaign contribution information by going online at sbcvote com when i did it became clear that santa barbara county third district supervisor joan hartmann has received contributions from lots of average folks her opponent bruce porter however is getting his contributions from a very small group a handful of wealthy donors who have been aligned with big oil what does this suggest hartmann would continue to support the clean renewable energy economy and jobs that we benefit from now she s done this for years this is our best future and she understands it well further her re election would not affect existing employment in the oil fields a porter victory however would result in hundreds of new and dangerous oil wells the effect of this would be few new jobs and greater threats to the county budget as we citizens would be paying to clean up oil spills and to repave roads after tens of thousands of additional annual trips by heavy oil trucks we have plenty of oil already more than enough in fact so much that we even export it we don t need more forest fires and contaminated drinking water what we need is an advocate for the good jobs in the safe energy fields i m voting for joan hartmann and ask you to consider doing the same seth steiner los alamos santa barbara and ventura county voters remember jason dominguez for assembly in the march 3 election as a santa barbara city councilman dominguez proved to be an independent thinker who asked the tough questions he also fought against overdevelopment the son of a teacher dominguez earned degrees from stanford uc berkeley and heidelberg university always committed to our youth and schools he has taught at both the high school and college levels he is currently a law professor dominguez has worked as a criminal prosecutor taking on tough cases and serious crimes he has a strong record of fighting for the environment in fact he has a master s degree in environmental law as a republican who has known dominguez since 2015 he is a democrat that i support he puts people over politics independents and his fellow democrats should support him too let s bring common sense solutions to sacramento vote jason dominguez for assembly pete dal bello santa barbara men have always used women whether it s for their looks to give them children or just to use them for their own needs when the time is right for them women s rights are getting better but they still aren t good one in five women are sexually assaulted by fraternities here at ucsb this is a huge problem from 2015 2017 there were 25 sexual assaults reported that might not seem that bad but those were only the people who were brave enough or felt comfortable enough to say something about it some people don t even remember what happened because they were drugged people weren t really paying attention to it until the end of 2019 when many more girls came forward and told people what was happening people started using social media to spread awareness because nowadays social media is the fastest way to spread news people are now more aware of what the frats are doing but no one has taken responsibility for their actions the fraternities got suspended and they are doing further investigations but those men are still walking around just waiting for another opportunity for a girl to be too drunk the part that makes me the most upset is when i hear people say well she should have been more careful or she shouldn t have had that much to drink it makes me so upset when i hear this it is said that guys can drink as much as they want but girls can t and when they are assaulted it is their fault because they had too much to drink while the guy gets away with no problems what are women supposed to do if people won t listen we are supposed to have equal rights but we don t men need to start taking responsibility for their actions women do need to be more careful but they shouldn t have to be i don t want to live in a world in which i will constantly have to be walking on eggshells when i am older i want to be able to have fun without having to worry about being assaulted i don t want to be a part of a world in which i m not heard or in which i can t be equal to the opposite gender i want to be comfortable and feel safe at all times i will always stand by a woman who says something has happened to them because men won t listen even though they know it s true dela bucy santa barbara mail calls noozhawk welcomes and encourages expressions of all views on santa barbara county issues letters should be

officer good morning and thank you for joining us and for your interest in terex for terex operating within a zero harm environmental health and safety culture is an absolute way of life i am proud of our team s dedication commitment and focus on a zero harm safety culture the global team made great progress during the year reducing our recordable injuries by 39 a significant accomplishment but we realize we can and will continue to make further progress in our zero harm culture the fourth quarter completed a year where we faced considerable market driven and operational headwinds principally within our awp segment our q4 results reflect the headwinds of the challenging global industrial equipment market and our operating results were generally in line with our expectations on lower revenue awp s fourth quarter revenue was down 21 from q4 2018 this demonstrates the cautious customer sentiment and our largest markets in north america and europe awp s revenue decline coupled with the need to produce below retail demand to reduce inventories adversely impacted operating margins our mp team continued to execute well maintaining 12 operating margins despite q4 revenues being down 10 in the quarter driving parts and service growth is one key element of our execute to win initiative despite the challenging global equipment markets our parts and services teams drove 7 sales growth on a currency neutral basis over time continued growth from this initiative will help reduce our cyclicality given the environment in which we are operating we have maintained our absolute focus on our disciplined capital allocation strategy we generated positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter and generated 86 million of positive free cash flow during 2019 combined with the 106 million of cash proceeds from dispositions terex ended 2019 with a strong balance sheet including over 1 1 billion of liquidity our global team continues to be committed to generating cash and improving our working capital efficiency turning to slide 4 terex remains committed to its goal of establishing a corporate culture based on process discipline and accountability that will consistently deliver high performance in all phases of the business cycle turning to slide 5 now let me share some 2019 highlights that continue to move terex forward we essentially completed the focus element of our strategy by finalizing two significant portfolio actions in our former cranes segment the remaining businesses in our portfolio have industry leading competitive positions they have also demonstrated their ability to consistently outearn their cost of capital over the course of multiple cycles at the start of this year we moved the tower and rough terrain crane businesses to the material processing segment these moves complete the transformation of terex into a two segment organization we have brought online new manufacturing capabilities including our campsie facility in northern ireland and expanded our hosur india mp facility allowing terex to be even more responsive to global demand our new utilities facility will consolidate multiple production buildings into one state of the art world class manufacturing engineering facility commercial excellence begins and ends with the customer we completed our global rollout of sales force increasing process discipline throughout the entire sales process technology is a critical part of our global parts and services business to deliver industry leading customer service we are providing our distribution partners easy to use digital tools that help them to service their customers more efficiently maximizing their opportunity to win business this is allowing terex to build a competitive advantage and accelerate parts growth strategic sourcing finished 2019 with strong momentum as the team continues to implement waves 1 and 2 and launching a new round of strategic projects with our high quality portfolio of specialized equipment businesses our strong financial position and the investments in our facilities and systems we are well positioned to perform throughout the cycles looking ahead to 2020 we recognize that we must drive improvement in our operational excellence so that we can consistently deliver on our commitments to our team members customers and shareholders at terex we are driving toward a zero harm safety culture we are doing this with open communication reporting and putting our team members first terex is also committed to a responsible environmental stewardship through energy and water conservation efforts in our facilities and by developing innovative products that reduce emissions turning to innovation we are continuing to invest in innovative products to serve our specialized markets a few examples are the terex ecotec shredder expands our offering in recycling markets also the terex advance mixer truck reflects improved performance value and entry into new markets in addition to expanding our product offerings we are investing in our manufacturing capabilities which leads to future growth the new utilities manufacturing facility in south dakota remains on schedule and within budget another important facility for terex s future global growth is our changzhou china facility which will undergo an expansion in 2020 to accommodate the market growth in china for aerial products in addition mp and utility product lines will be added we are localizing manufacturing to take advantage of increasing adoption of these products our parts and services team is focused on growth by delivering a best in class experience for our customers these investments enable improved manufacturing productivity industry leading customer offerings and growth as we communicated during our q3 earnings call we expect the global industrial markets to remain challenging in 2020 we expect sales to be down 8 to 11 from 2019 to a midpoint of 3 9 billion the lower anticipated sales will result in lower production levels which will have an adverse effect on operating margins based upon this current outlook for 2020 and we are anticipating full year earnings of 1 85 to 2 35 per share we will continue to enhance shareholder value by executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy which includes dividend increases in each of the last four years with that let me turn it over to duffy duffy sheehan senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks john turning to page 8 let me begin by reviewing our q4 segment highlights awp sales of 500 million contracted by 21 compared to last year driven by continued challenging markets in north america and europe during the fourth quarter we saw a 55 increase in china sales where the aerial market continues to grow through increased product adoption overall lower sales and significantly reduced production levels challenged awp s operating margins in the quarter as we discussed last quarter to align customer demand and to manage inventory we have been significantly reducing production during q4 we reduced production levels 45 compared to q4 2018 this resulted in lower manufacturing absorption and lower material cost savings awp fourth quarter bookings of 755 million were 22 lower than q4 2018 but the book to bill ratio did improve sequentially backlog at year end was 753 million down 31 from the prior year however awp s year end 2019 backlog is not fully comparable to the prior year as not all 2020 advanced purchase orders from our national account customers were completed by december 31 2019 additionally national account customers placed a smaller percentage of their planned 2020 capex on advanced purchase orders when adjusted for these year over year customer ordering patterns our backlog supports our awp revenue guidance materials processing closed out the year with another solid quarter achieving 12 operating margin despite challenging markets sales were 321 million down 10 from the fourth quarter 2018 driven by cautious customer sentiment delaying capital purchases of crushing and screening products material handlers and environmental equipment operating margins decreased off the levels we experienced during the first three quarters of the year but were still double digits as the mp team has been aggressively managing all elements of cost in a challenging market environment backlog of 295 million was 42 lower than last year however mp s year end 2018 backlog was an anomaly in the fourth quarter of 2018 dealers ordered a much higher percentage of their 2019 full year equipment requirements due to extended lead time as we enter 2020 dealer ordering patterns have returned to historically normalized levels as lead times are shorter within corporate and other we saw lower rough terrain and tower crane sales operating margins for tower cranes were modestly impacted by the lower sales but rough terrain s operating margins performed in line with expectation turning to slide 9 to review our q4 consolidated results total sales decreased by approximately 16 mp s operating margin and lower corporate expenses partially offset the volume and lower production headwinds that impacted awp margin leading to an overall contraction of operating margin restructuring related charges and to a lesser extent investment in our execute to win priority areas where the primary differences between our as reported and as adjusted operating profit our full year 2019 tax rate came in lower than we had previously anticipated as a result of a more favorable jurisdictional mix of sales and pre tax income combined with favorable adjustments between our tax provisions and tax returns these adjustments resulted in our recording a tax benefit in q4 of 8 8 million to adjust our full year 2019 tax rate to approximately 16 on an adjusted basis we generated quarterly earnings per share of 0 36 turning to slide 10 to review our full year consolidated results overall of 2019 was a challenging year for terex net sales for the year contracted 3 6 to approximately 4 4 billion this revenue decline was attributable to awp whose sales declined almost 8 for the year awp s revenue declines were greatest in north america and western europe as concerns over the global market for industrial equipment caused rental customers to reduce their capital equipment purchases partially offsetting awp s revenue decline mp s revenue increased almost 4 in line with our expectations from the beginning of the year to nearly 1 4 billion awp s lower sales and significantly reduced production levels challenged total company operating margins for the year mp had a strong 2019 with a full year adjusted operating margin over 14 up 130 basis points from 2018 turning to slide 11 our 2020 guidance is based on our two segment operating model awp and mp the rough terrain and tower crane businesses are reflected in mp to assist your modeling of our business we have recast our segment results for the full years 2018 and 2019 including 2019 by quarter these analyses are included in the appendices to our q4 earnings presentation and posted to our investor relations website today s guidance includes all currently anticipated expenses as we simplify our financial reporting to the investment community and have completed investments in our transformation program in 2020 we currently expect our operating margins to decrease by approximately 150 basis points to between 6 3 and 7 3 on approximately 8 to 11 lower sales reduced operating leverage on the lower sales volumes both in our awp and mp segments are partially offset by ongoing operational improvement with respect to the coronavirus while we are not currently anticipating any material impact on our full year results we do expect to have lower sales and earnings from our awp china facility in the first half of the year which will be made up in the second half we expect 2020 earnings between 1 85 and 2 35 per share this eps guidance assumes a full year 2020 expected tax rate of 19 but excludes any benefit associated with our existing share repurchase authorization this guidance also assumes extension of our existing 301 tariff exclusion for machines and components that are reported into the u s from china from a quarterly perspective we expect a normal historical sales pattern however on a year over year basis revenue in the first half of the year will be down approximately 15 and flat in the second half of the year we expect our eps to be generated roughly 5 in q1 45 in q2 and 25 each in q3 and q4 the abnormally low level of profitability in q1 is driven by awp revenues being down 25 year over year combined with unabsorbed overhead on production below retail demand and finally the impact of the coronavirus on our china operation for the full year we are estimating free cash flow of approximately 140 million reflecting a strong year of positive cash generation we expect to improve first quarter year over year cash flow performance however we do expect q1 cash flow to be negative consistent with historical pattern we also estimate capital expenditures will be approximately 100 million this level of capex reflects continued investment in initiatives designed to drive long term earnings growth and shareholder return turning to our segment guidance we expect precaution being exhibited by our genie rental customers during 2019 to continue into 2020 resulting in awp sales being down 7 to 10 and operating margin of 6 to 7 we expect materials processing revenues including our towers and rough terrain cranes businesses to be down 8 to 11 which will result in mp s operating margins being approximately 12 to 13 while we continue to monitor developments associated with the u k s exit from the european union we do not anticipate any material impact to terex in 2020 associated with the brexit process we are guiding for our corporate expenses to be approximately 80 million during 2020 up 10 million from 2019 the increase is due to planning for 2020 incentive compensation at target payout and lower gains on sales of financing receivables overall we have been managing our corporate cost structure aggressively and we ll continue to do so in 2020 turning to slide 12 to review our disciplined capital allocation strategy since we introduced our disciplined capital allocation strategy at our analyst day in 2016 we have made tremendous progress in strengthening our balance sheet reducing our cost of capital and reducing our debt by over 500 million as a result our 2019 year end net leverage which is net debt divided by adjusted ebitda was less than 1 6 times nearly a full turn better than our targeted 2 5 times through the cycle additionally we reduced our pension obligation by more than 300 million over this period during the last three years we have made substantial investments in terex in fact we have invested almost 0 25 billion into our businesses over the last three years which is significantly higher than our annual maintenance capex of 45 million these investments demonstrate our commitment to long term growth we are excited by the portfolio of businesses we have each of which outearns their cost of capital we have deployed the proceeds from the sales of businesses to return capital to shareholders first we have approximately 34 fewer shares now than were outstanding at our 2016 analyst day second we have increased our quarterly dividend by 71 to 0 12 per share as i have said consistently the terex team has and will continue to generate shareholder value through the execution of our disciplined capital allocation strategy with that i ll turn it back to you john john garrison chairman and chief executive officer thank you duffy i ll review our segments starting with awp the north american and european markets for aerial work platforms are challenging however the north american utilities market remains strong our north american rental customers continue to be cautious in their capital expenditure decisions they are prudently managing their fleet utilization as we move into the latter half of the year and into 2021 we expect the replacement cycle in north america and europe to increase finally the ongoing adoption of aerial work platforms in china is fueling growth to improve margins the awp team is fully committed to executing their strategic sourcing plan including transitioning significant volume to new suppliers we are seeing savings rates consistent with our expectations however the lower production levels have impacted the total value of savings realized to date in the aerials market the genie brand is synonymous with technological leadership and innovation in 2020 we will continue to add more fuel efficient hybrid products and fill out the extra capacity line which will be on display at conexpo the xc line is important for genie as the new ansi standards governing load levels are currently due to take effect in march the utilities team will transition to their new manufacturing and engineering facility during the summer this new facility will improve efficiency and increase capacity which together with new products and services will enable terex utilities to continue to grow for example the terex utilities tl 80 pictured on the slide is a new product serving the transmission line distribution market the electric grid requires significant continued investment to support the electrification and innovation that is occurring around the world we invite you to visit us at our conexpo at our terex booths to see our exciting new product and service offerings turning to mp on slide 14 materials processing is a high performing segment that consistently delivers strong results and meets its commitment mp is well positioned heading into 2020 with their new product offerings the mp team continues to innovate the evoquip colt screen pictured here will launch in q1 2020 it delivers higher capacity telematics and value to our customers the mp team continues to expand its penetration into emerging markets for environmental and mobile crushing and screening equipment mp s innovation was recognized in q4 2019 with three separate industry awards omni by terex is a new first of its kind innovation that improves efficiency and reduces the risk of injury on crushing and screening sites omni and all of mp s industry leading innovation will be on display at conexpo i expect our mp team to continue to execute at a high level and deliver on its plans again this year to wrap up our prepared remarks in a challenging global environment our global terex team continues to focus on meeting commitments to our customers and shareholders despite the near term market conditions we will continue to invest in innovative products and services to win and grow in the marketplace we will continue to invest in the initiatives that improve our operating and commercial capabilities we will also continue to follow our disciplined capital allocation strategy and create additional value for our shareholders and finally we are confident in achieving our 2020 objectives with that let me turn it back to randy randy wilson director of investor relations thanks john as a reminder during the question and answer session we ask you to limit your questions to one in a follow up to ensure we have time to get to everyone with that i d like to open up for questions operator questions answers operator your first question comes from jerry revich with goldman sachs jerry revich goldman sachs analyst yes hi good morning everyone john garrison chairman and chief executive officer good morning jerry jerry revich goldman sachs analyst can you expand more on your outlook for the second quarter for earnings to hit the level let s call it 0 95 at the midpoint of guidance i think essentially you d be within 100 basis points of your aerials margins in second quarter of 19 can you just fact check that for me and just step through the moving pieces in terms of why the second quarter this year is expected to be disproportionately significant compared to prior years duffy sheehan senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah thanks jerry i ll take that question and when you look at the dispersion of our eps guidance for the year it reflects that the challenging q1 we ll have with our expectation that awp revenue would be down year over year by 25 in q1 and that we would have almost 25 lower production on a global basis for awp also in the first quarter and then the impact of the coronavirus in the second quarter it is as you certainly know our seasonally adjusted best quarter of the year and both the for both the aerials business as well as our utilities business and so we are expecting a strong q2 production will be coming more in line with retail demand in the second quarter after a down q1 and so we are expecting both our aerials and utilities businesses to perform which would drive strong operating performance for terex as a whole jerry revich goldman sachs analyst and john maybe expand on that point so how sure you expecting production to be up sequentially in the second quarter versus the first quarter compared to normal seasonality to get that big margin ramp that you re looking for just correct me if i m wrong but you re embedding about i don t know 800 900 basis points sequential improvement in awp 2q versus 1q so if you wouldn t mind just building our comfort level around that that would be helpful john garrison chairman and chief executive officer yeah no problem at all i don t disagree with the range in which you re estimating the margin improvement in awp from q1 to q2 and that would be on the production would increase as i said a few moments ago production down year over year in q1 by 24 25 and production from q2 of 19 to q2 of 20 would be down in the 10 ish percent range which would be in line with where revenue was so that would be you d see a sequential improvement by 10 10 to 15 actually jerry revich goldman sachs analyst so we re done with destock as of q1 essentially john garrison chairman and chief executive officer the biggest portion of it that is absolutely correct jerry revich goldman sachs analyst ok thank you randy wilson director of investor relations thank you jerry operator next question comes from ann duignan with jp morgan ann duignan j p morgan analyst hi good morning john garrison chairman and chief executive officer good morning ann ann duignan j p morgan analyst good morning i m a little concerned about the backlog and the outlook for materials processing i mean as we look in the united states and in europe i mean the fundamentals are not that bad particularly in the u s for infrastructure investment is booming can you just talk about your outlook for materials processing leaving out the cranes businesses and what s going on regionally with that business what are you seeing out there is there any should we be worried that you re losing market share somewhere john garrison chairman and chief executive officer thanks ann thanks for the question about mp we re excited about our mp business it s been a very strong consistent performer and has done well over the course of the last couple of years and we think it will continue to do well but the global macroeconomic environment is impacting demand but different dynamics ann driving for each business as we look at backlog we had a historically high backlog going into 2019 and historically the business did not operate at that level of backlog normally it s a much shorter cycle of book to business type of business so if you look going into 19 our backlog was almost 50 higher than it had been in the previous three years so i would say the backlog obviously we d like to have higher backlog but i would say the backlog now is along a more normal pattern historical pattern when we went into 19 when it was tight we did strongly encourage our dealer network around the world to get their orders in for the full year demand and with our lead times being shorter this year there s not that need for the dealers to place that level of demand this early in the year so that is a key dynamic that is impacting the overall backlog and if we look at the businesses as you asked ann so if you look at crushing and screening in north america the retail utilization rate of the dealers rental equipment is stable they re seeing good utilization but there s a hesitancy a caution on the customers to convert the rental to ownership which is delaying the restocking of the network so overall the market is still good utilization is still good there s just customers are being generally cautious on the crushing and screening side now material handlers ann our fuchs business team s executed well but with scrap steel prices coming down pretty significantly specifically in north america but really around the world that has impacted the fuchs business now they ve done a good job expanding their distribution channels expanding the offering they re coming into but scrap steel prices still drive the fuchs so if i look at the businesses within mp the fuchs business from a backlog standpoint is actually off the most offsetting that is our environmental businesses kieran and the team have done a good job bringing some new products to the marketplace so we re continuing to see growth really globally across our environmental portfolio like our ecotec brands when we look at the concrete mixer business again for us that s principally a regional north american business u s north american business that was relatively stable and we re looking at it to be relatively stable year over year and then the pick and carrybusiness that was in the mp throughout all of last year operates well down in australia again relatively stable up a little bit down a little bit so that s how i d characterize it is customers are being they re being cautious but the markets are still strong but dealers customers are cautious in seeing how the year is going to play out and i m confident that the team will capitalize on the opportunities in the markets as we head into 2020 and i m not concerned at all about any share erosion associated with the backlog or the revenue outlook ann duignan j p morgan analyst ok that s helpful color did you quantify the impact of coronavirus on your q1 eps or can you john garrison chairman and chief executive officer so let me if you don t mind duffy before you quantify just a broader comment on the coronavirus i want to say first our priority is to our team members and we have been fortunate that none of our team members have been reported with the virus we do have a world class manufacturing facility for our awp segment in changzhou due to the virus we did delay opening of the plant like most companies in china our plant did open this week on february 11 but the ramp has been slowed because the only key members that are allowed to come back to the plant are the team members that did not travel out of the city during the lunar new year holiday so it s going to be a slow ramp because they have to self quarantine for 14 days so we re working that with our awp team we re working that with our suppliers and as duffy said in the guidance we have incorporated the impact of the coronavirus we believe in our q1 and q2 performance and our guidance does assume that we will make up the q1 and q2 shortcoming as we move through q3 and q4 duff do you want to add anything there duffy sheehan senior vice president and chief financial officer no i would say that from a revenue perspective since the situation is still evolving we for purposes of guidance anyway at the moment there is a say 25 million to 30 million revenue impact built into the guidance for q1 a negative 25 million to 30 million revenue impact and a 5 million to 10 million op impact that s been built into that ann duignan j p morgan analyst ok that s very helpful thank you i appreciate that i ll get back in line john garrison chairman and chief executive officer thank you ann operator next question comes from jamie cook with credit suisse jamie cook credit suisse analyst hi good morning john garrison chairman and chief executive officer good morning jamie jamie cook credit suisse analyst just another question on aerials i understand the can you hear me john garrison chairman and chief executive officer yes we can jamie jamie cook credit suisse analyst sorry just another question on the aerial business for the first quarter understanding we re down 25 i m assuming we re losing money again in the first quarter if there s any way you could sort of handicap how much we lose in the first quarter and then we re underproducing again in the first quarter is that just the coronavirus because the sales assumption doesn t seem too materially different from what we said before and then just my last question did i miss what you guys said on supply chain benefits in the in what s implied in the guidance and the cadence of that for the year thank you duffy sheehan senior vice president and chief financial officer so let me start john garrison chairman and chief executive officer yeeah if you would duffy sheehan senior vice president and chief financial officer is that when you look at our aerial work platforms segment the aerial work platforms business did have positive operating margin in q4 2019 and we ll have positive operating margin in q1 2020 so the segment isn t losing money the revenue is certainly ahead the market environment resulting in 25 lower revenue is certainly a headwind and our bringing inventory levels down and therefore producing significantly below retail demand has been challenging the profitability of the business and once we get ourselves past both of those impacts we do expect the margins to improve do you want to go to supply chain john garrison chairman and chief executive officer yeah so jamie and i think your last question was around supply chain and specific to strategic sourcing is that your question jamie jamie cook credit suisse analyst yeah that was my question the supply chain assumption in the 2020 guidance john garrison chairman and chief executive officer yes so thank you so in our 2020 guidance we re anticipating a full year impact of about 50 million as i said in my opening comments we re experiencing good savings rates on what we re doing but the lower production volumes is taking longer to consume the raw and whip inventory in the pipeline so we ve built that in i will say the teams are really doing a good job we literally changed thousands of parts over the course of 19 and we were able to do that with limited to no disruption to our manufacturing facility so the teams who ve internalized these processes developing the ssi capability is critical to us and we re going to continue to drive improvements in strategic sourcing and i think you see that clearly show up as we go through the year and the incremental or decremental margins we ll enjoy and i will say that the largest percentage of savings that we re seeing in strategic sourcing is associated with our awp segment jamie cook credit suisse analyst ok thanks i appreciate the color john garrison chairman and chief executive officer thank you jamie operator next question comes from david raso with evercore isi david raso evercore isi analyst hi good morning john garrison chairman and chief executive officer good morning david david raso evercore isi analyst my question is on the cash flow guidance when you adjust for the lower capex year over year but also absorb the extra 25 million for the retirement obligation it implies the free cash flow you think is going to grow 60 million 70 million and that s despite ebit being down 95 million g a is going to be down about 6 million 7 million just trying to get comfortable with why do we expect such a strong working capital performance throughout the year especially if it s very concentrated in the first part of the year and then production ramps back up just trying to gain comfort with that duffy sheehan senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so david i ll take that and in the down revenue environment the headwind market environment that we anticipate for 2020 and that will result in a shrinking of the balance sheet so that we do expect that accounts receivable will be a source of cash as we bring our inventory levels down and don t restock them that the level of accounts payable will also result in a source of cash so it s really about the dynamics associated with the reductions in the inventories the collection of the receivables that result in working capital being a source of cash so i can assure you that our team is absolutely focused on the working capital generation and free cash flow generation and that i acknowledge that our free cash flow generation has got to improve and john and i have been all over our teams on that subject and you will see us achieve the 140 million free cash flow performance in 2020 david raso evercore isi analyst i appreciate that i mean i m just last year we spoke to being very committed to the free cash flow and it s still proved elusive and i m just trying to understand has anything changed with how people are being compensated anything john how you re thinking about being willing to give up sales to make sure that the cash flow is there i m just trying to understand why should we believe the guidance this year when last year in a big under production year where you would have thought it would generate some decent working capital inflows it didn t materialized john garrison chairman and chief executive officer right thanks david so yes for the management team net working capital is part of our incentive compensation plan it was significantly below target in 2019 obviously we want to drive to that target in 2020 so from a compensation standpoint i can assure you that the management team is focused on driving the net working capital and one of the things david is we re being very disciplined on production and even in the fourth quarter the revenue was down a little bit more than we had forecasted and so we re still trying to ensure that we re producing below retail demand to bring our inventories in line and we re going to be very disciplined i think it s important in these types of businesses in these markets to be very disciplined on your production because it doesn t help anybody to overproduce and build inventory and put yourself in a position where you may have to do some things on pricing that you don t want to do so we re going to attack inventory we re going to attack our production schedules and we re going to adjust our production schedules based on the revenue level to drive that net working capital as duffy said into free cash flow for the year and as you mentioned we re continuing to spend we have sizable investments great organic growth our capex remains elevated we think that s in the best long term interest of our shareholders so it has intense focus it is part of our incentive compensation plan highly disappointed in our performance this year and it was reflective in the mib payments of our leadership team and we ve got to turn that around in 2020 david raso evercore isi analyst well lastly related to that let s say if you did do the free cash flow of 140 million the dividend is probably only call it 35 million the excess 105 million roughly how should we expect the use of that if you do hit those free cash flow targets duffy sheehan senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so we ll follow our disciplined capital allocation strategy david and that will include returning capital to shareholders during this market headwind portion of the economic cycle we have been preserving liquidity through the downturn we ended 2019 with 1 1 billion of liquidity on the balance sheet between our cash on the balance sheet and available revolving credit facility borrowings we think that s a good place to be net debt to ebitda 1 6 times so we will continue to consider what the right level of liquidity is and to make sure that we are following the disciplined capital allocation strategy including the efficient return of capital to shareholders david raso evercore isi analyst so just making it clear here i mean it s the start of the year so probably the easier time to ask but any commitment from management on where that would be utilized again if everything played out as you thought that excess 105 million are you comfortable with the leverage i mean obviously ebitda will be down a bit this year so the leverage naturally goes up if you maintain at the debt level but would you look at this as a share repo opportunity or are you more sensitive to keeping the leverage down as the ebitda drops john garrison chairman and chief executive officer david we had a through cycle ebitda target net debt to ebitda target of two and a half we like the position we re going into the year we have an outstanding share repurchase authorization outstanding that the board has approved and we will be opportunistic in the market against that outstanding share repurchase authorization but we will manage our liquidity to ensure that we don t create any liquidity issues for ourselves but we like the position we re in now david going into a softer year david raso evercore isi analyst i appreciate the time thank you john garrison chairman and chief executive officer thanks david operator next question comes from mig dobre with baird mig dobre baird analyst good morning everyone john garrison chairman and chief executive officer good morning mig dobre baird analyst good morning i want to dig in a little more on awp just to understand the moving pieces there so can you talk a little bit about the utility business in 2019 so on that 2 7 billion of revenue how much of that was associated with the utility business and can you maybe give us a little clarity as to how you re thinking about that portion of the business as far as the 2020 guidance for the segment is concerned john garrison chairman and chief executive officer yeah thanks mig yes utilities is part of our awp segment it s a really solid business and what s different about the utilities business is it doesn t experience the same seasonality and cyclicality of our aerials business so it s a little bit more constant as we go through the course of the year as we ve said it was about 400 million so you can plan between 400 million and 450 million of revenue reasonably split equally across the quarter q1 is a little lower q2 picks up but relatively consistent across the year and as we ve said generating 9 to 10 level operating margins q3 is going to be a bit challenging for the team this year we re we ve anticipated that in our guide as we move from our manufacturing facilities into our state of the art facility that will occur in q3 so as we move as we get into the new facility we expect two things to occur one increase capacity to take advantage of a growing market the electrical grid market is a good space to be there s a lot of infrastructure investment required for that and we think that s going to give us increased capacity because right now we are capacity constrained and have lead times that are extended in our utilities business and then we also believe it s going to improve and drive efficiency for us as we go forward but if you think about 400 million to 450 million reasonably spread across the year 9 to 10 operating margin that s a good way to think about that business in 2020 mig dobre baird analyst so it s fair to say that this business is you expect it to be up some in 2020 duffy sheehan senior vice president and chief financial officer slightly yes mig dobre baird analyst slight ok so then if i look at the low end of your guidance i mean that implies your awp business to be below 2 billion in revenue can you frame this number for us historically because there s been so much noise in the segment with stuff kind of going in and coming out where would that revenue be versus say 2016 coming out of the industrial recession and how should we think about that level of revenue versus all the modeling that you ve done historically as far as replacement demand is concerned are we back to replacement demand levels really help us out with a framework here john garrison chairman and chief executive officer right so let me i don t have 16 in front of me so we ll have to get back to you on that mig sorry about that we ll have that for the next time but let me frame the replacement cycle commentary as we go into 2020 is again i think customers are being highly disciplined in their capex plans i was at ara this week and talked to multiple customers across the customer spectrum they re being disciplined they do say as we move in the back half of 2020 and into 2021 the replacement cycle in the aerials business should begin to kick in they re already talking about it as they look at their longer range of capital plans and that s a result of the products that were purchased seven to eight years ago because in general the equipment maintains its first life in the rental channel for seven to eight years so the replacement cycle was a topic of conversation with customers just even this week and we do think as we move into the 2021 time period that the replacement cycle in the aerial business will kick in going forward and help to build demand as we move from 2020 into 2021 obviously it s only february of 2020 but long looking longer term or intermediate term we clearly would expect the replacement cycle to kick in in north america and also in europe europe is on a very similar cycle to north america duffy sheehan senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah mig as john said a moment ago we don t have 2016 with us here in the room so apologies for that i would say that the aerials or genie portion of our business in the guidance we ve provided today with the information john gave you is still above revenue of 2 billion and is in the same area that it was in 2017 so i would say it s up versus 2016 because obviously 16 was lower john garrison chairman and chief executive officer right mig dobre baird analyst all right that s helpful thank you john garrison chairman and chief executive officer absolutely operator next question comes from stephen volkmann with jefferies john garrison chairman and chief executive officer hey stephen stephen volkmann jefferies analyst good morning guys i just had a quick follow up on this utilities thing as well so once we consolidate these plants into the new one do we still think about this as a 9 to 10 ebit business john john garrison chairman and chief executive officer we re challenging the team to do better than that stephen and if i look at production efficiency the number that we ve kind of put out there is around 20 improvement in production efficiency associated with the move to the new facility now we ll take time to ramp it s not going to occur on day 1 but i would be disappointed if we didn t see an improvement of around 20 in our production efficiency within the plant duffy sheehan senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean i think it would be fair to say the business case certainly did anticipate growth in the top line for the business as the utilities business continues to take market share and then secondly that the manufacturing efficiency drives stronger gross margin john garrison chairman and chief executive officer that s correct stephen volkmann jefferies analyst ok and then i think in the past you ve said that there might be some other things you could do in that facility as well so is there any sort of positive benefit anywhere else in the company john garrison chairman and chief executive officer no this facility is a special purpose facility for our utilities product lines for both our installs and what we manufacture on the boom side so we re not currently anticipating using that facility for any other product lines what we are doing is we have 19 service centers in our utilities business and those 19 service centers are working very closely with our aerial customers and we ve seen a very nice growth in parts and service revenue associated with the service centers focusing more on the aerial customers and so having the utilities business underneath awp as a segment has helped to drive some of that synergy and we did see growth in that in 19 and would anticipate that to continue in 20 and beyond that was more of the synergy not necessarily manufacturing synergy in the watertown plant stephen volkmann jefferies analyst got it got it ok thanks and then finally does capex go back to kind of maintenance after this is done or is there more to do john garrison chairman and chief executive officer stephen we re not going to i don t think it goes all the way back to 40 million of maintenance capex as we continue to look at the opportunities for organic growth in our business the opportunities to invest in some of our systems and processes so we think it s going to come down from 100 million but i don t want to put out there that it s going to go all the way down to maintenance capital levels in 2021 stephen volkmann jefferies analyst ok thank you guys appreciate it john garrison chairman and chief executive officer thank you stephen operator next question comes from steven fisher with ubs steven fisher ubs analyst thanks good morning just wondering within the mp segment what degree of revenue decline do you assume for the rough terrains and towers for 2020 i m not sure if that was included in the answer to ann s question and then how are the decrementals you assumed in the crane component of materials processing versus the legacy materials processing component john garrison chairman and chief executive officer yes so i would say really no difference with the rts and the towers in terms of the top level revenue guide so somewhere in that 10 down range is what we re assuming for that business and from a margin standpoint pretty consistent with actually a little lower actually call that 9 to 10 we did have a good guide in 2019 but 9 to 10 operating margins associated with the crane business and down at the same revenue proportion as the overall segment i think that s a reasonable assessment duffy sheehan senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah that s correct steven fisher ubs analyst ok that s helpful then just over on the awp side thinking about the order patterns for the year i think you mentioned that some of the annual purchase orders didn t get finalized in q1 really just kind of thinking about how the order pattern is now set up for both the rest of the first half and into the second half i m curious how does conexpo fit into the ordering plans for the year is it too early for the customers to kind of be definitive about the second half at this point so maybe if you can just kind of walk us through the order pattern you expect here for the rest of the year john garrison chairman and chief executive officer yeah so thank you and specific to awp and the backlog dynamics really what impacted this year was timing of negotiations with the national accounts and the other dynamic was the percentage of their full year capex that they were willing to put on advanced purchase orders so as i ve said the national accounts being very disciplined with their plans our lead times industry lead times were much shorter so our national account negotiations flowed into january and into early february those negotiations now are principally complete and you can argue that it s a bit more of a more normal pattern and if you go back to 16 17 then it was as we ended 18 going into 19 so that s where we stand now in terms of conexpo from an aerials perspective conexpo was not as big a selling show as perhaps cranes and some other mp businesses as i said i was just at ara this week you do sell a little bit at ara i think it will be too early in the year given that it s the second week of march that conexpo would have a significant impact on awp customers we would expect mp to see some pickup with some of the dealers and customers so that s how i d look at conexpo i would put it in a shameless plug for everyone to come visit us at conexpo we ve got some incredibly new exciting innovative products across our portfolio of product lines that demonstrate the technology that we re investing the telematics that we re investing in and positioning the business for longer term growth so i hope that answers your question in terms of the flow but conexpo is not going to be a big big selling show for our awp segment steven fisher ubs analyst i guess just wondering if we should be anticipating any particularly big q1 swing in orders year over year or is it more starting to neutralize john garrison chairman and chief executive officer i d say it s given the demand is i d use the word more neutralized obviously where we re going to record some that flowed into the first quarter but it s still going to be difficult comps year over year until we get to the back half of the year duffy sheehan senior vice president and chief financial officer that s right steven fisher ubs analyst got it thanks a lot operator at this time i will turn the call back over to mr wilson randy wilson director of investor relations thank you operator this concludes our q a session i will now turn it over to john garrison for concluding remarks john john garrison chairman and chief executive officer first of all i want to thank you for your interest in terex and i would encourage you i know many of you do attend conexpo we will be there we would love to host you at conexpo and show you the exciting things that we have across the portfolio of terex that we re going to be demonstrating and showing to our customers so again thank you for your interest i d love to see at conexpo and if you have any questions please follow up with randy and john operator duration 63 minutes call participants randy wilson director of investor relations john garrison

from dealing with unexpected medical costs to supporting adult children americans often find themselves facing expenses they weren t anticipating in their golden years plus it s harder to save for retirement today than it was 50 years ago over 30 of americans plan to continue working after they retire according to a 2019 survey by td ameritrade if you re not sure how long you ll need to work or what to expect when you retire find out the hard truths so you can figure out when you should retire last updated oct 16 2020 1 some of your investment success will be left to chance what happens in the market during the 10 years before and after your retirement date can play a significant role in how well funded your portfolio is it s difficult to replace lost money during this period of time either because of time constraints or the loss of earned income said patrick daniels a financial planner at precedent asset management in indianapolis to protect your retirement savings during what daniels refers to as the high risk window he suggested that individuals take a conservative approach with their investments 2 but you can still invest too conservatively steer clear of high potential investments like stocks and you could end up making a mistake in retirement and outspending your lifestyle said joseph carbone a certified financial planner and founder of focus planning group in bayport new york retirees should be looking to invest in total return type strategies that focus on stock appreciation more specifically dividend producing stocks and good quality bonds that don t have long maturities carbone said many of my clients who are in or approaching retirement have a 60 stock and 40 bond allocation with an emphasis on dividend producing stocks and bonds that have a duration of less than six years 3 you might not be saving enough about 64 of americans have less than 10 000 saved for retirement according to a recent gobankingrates survey even if you plan to spend your golden years living modestly that dollar amount won t come close to cutting it matt ritt a certified financial planner and investment advisor with questis suggested that investors start saving as early as you can story continues he advised investors to take advantage of 401 k 403b and ira accounts and maximize contributions whenever possible to find the funds limit your expenses and stick to a reasonable spending plan ritt said 4 whether you re young more than half of millennials have 0 saved in the bank for retirement according to the gobankingrates survey that s a shame too because the younger you are the greater your potential to grow your nest egg through the power of compound interest start saving just 200 per month at age 25 and you could have 621 735 accrued by age 65 assuming an 8 rate of return 5 or whether you re older sadly baby boomers the group closest to retirement age aren t doing much better according to the gobankingrates retirement survey 30 7 of people over age 55 have retirement savings below 50 000 which is considered insufficient for those approaching their golden years late savers might have to play catch up with their retirement contributions or even delay retirement for a few years 6 you ll probably live longer than your folks which costs more the average life expectancy in the u s today is 78 6 years according to the centers for disease control and prevention and the ugly truth about retirement is that the longer we live the more we have to shell out to fund our extended golden years with americans living longer than ever it s no surprise that their biggest concern is outliving their income said jim poolman executive director of the indexed annuity leadership council but the good news is there are solutions for outliving income such as looking into products that offer guaranteed lifetime income such as fixed indexed annuities 7 you could lose out by mistiming your social security benefits start taking social security payments before your full retirement age and you ll permanently decrease your monthly payment wait until age 70 and you ll get more money with each check still that doesn t mean one strategy is always best particularly when you factor in spousal and survivor benefits fortunately there are several social security optimizers that can help you figure out the best time to start taking social security benefits such as the quicken social security optimizer read want to retire early in your state aim to save this much 8 you might regret skipping your roth contribution the younger you are the more you can benefit from roth accounts because they re funded with after tax dollars which accumulate investment earnings tax free for the life of the investment ritt said that makes them a great option if you expect to have a higher tax rate in retirement than you do now by tapping your roth account before your taxable account you decrease the amount of distributed funds you ll pay tax on for that year 9 you ll have numerous financial issues to consider those nearing retirement and those that have just begun retirement face the challenge of planning cash flows for their new lifestyle said scott smith a certified financial planner with olympia ridge personal financial advisers in rochester hills michigan before you tap your ira or brokerage account smith suggested creating a five year cash flow plan which should consider the tax repercussions of distributing from your pension annuity social security retirement savings and even available part time income often these choices are made without tax efficiency in mind and the retiree ends up paying more in taxes than they really need to smith said 10 you ll probably need to supplement your medicare many procedures aren t covered by medicare including dental hearing vision and long term care in an assisted living or nursing facility many retirees also face unexpectedly high deductibles and co pays the best solution is to include unexpected medical costs in your budget as you build your retirement savings said joshua zimmelman founder of westwood tax consulting you can also enroll in a medicare supplemental insurance plan which will help pay for co payments deductibles co insurance prescription drugs and medical care while traveling overseas he said 11 your healthcare will cost more than you expect the average couple retiring in 2019 at 65 will spend 285 000 on medical costs in retirement according to a report by fidelity and not all those expenses will be covered by medicare a health savings account or hsa can be a huge help when it comes to preparing for those healthcare costs in retirement said jody dietel senior vice president advocacy and government affairs at healthequity when paired with a high deductible healthcare plan hsa contributions are made tax free the balance accrues tax free and withdrawals are made tax free dietel said the account can build a healthy nest egg that can save you from having to pull from your 401 k for those unforeseen healthcare costs dietel said 12 most people will need long term care around 70 of people over age 65 will need long term care at some point in their lives according to the u s department of health and human services the cost will vary by state but three years can easily set you back 300 000 said mark struthers a certified financial planner at sona financial in chanhassen minnesota to protect against this likely expense struthers suggested that retirees purchase long term care insurance which was created to cover long term costs like skilled nursing assisted living and hospice care 13 your overall health will affect your retirement costs regular physical exercise and activity can help you manage and prevent chronic disease which is expensive to treat according to the cdc sample exercises and diet information for retirees and people getting closer to retirement can be found at the national institute on aging 14 inflation can eat away at your nest egg thanks in large part to strategic moves by the federal reserve the u s has seen very little inflation for the past 25 years still as anyone who s lived through a sky high inflationary environment can attest 10 per year inflation can happen inflation can be devastating for retirees struthers said if we are in retirement for 30 to 40 years and we have a fixed income stream its purchasing power can easily be cut by 60 to 70 to combat inflation s effects struthers suggested investing in inflation sensitive assets like treasury inflation protected securities tips i bonds and real estate 15 you don t really know how much you re spending you should have a solid understanding of how much money you re spending but if you don t you re not alone over half of the people i talk to who are gearing up for retirement don t have a good understanding of how much they spend and where it goes said daniel p johnson a certified financial planner and founder at forward thinking wealth management in akron ohio retirees need to know this information because they ll use their investments to fill the gap between what s going out and what s coming in through their pensions and social security plans there is a huge difference if you are anticipating to need an additional 20 000 annually from your investments to fill the gap versus actually needing 50 000 johnson said consider 50 cheapest places to retire across america 16 your child can borrow for college but you can t borrow for retirement many parents find themselves stuck between wanting to help their children pay for college and wanting to save for retirement said sally brandon senior vice president client service and advice at rebalance ira however putting a lot of money into a college fund isn t going to help if your retirement savings suffer as a result she said instead brandon suggested setting a budget for what you can afford to pay toward college tell your child what portion you can afford to pay she said if you have extra money after putting away what you need for retirement so much the better 17 your employer might not help you prepare not all employers offer a 401 k or similar plan while a 401 k is a great retirement tool when available there are other options available to you brandon said for people without an employer sponsored plan she recommended setting up an automated payment plan to fund a roth ira a roth ira helps you save both for emergencies and retirement money you put in as a contribution can be taken out tax free later brandon said the account can also act as an estate planning tool and is generally more tax efficient than a traditional ira 18 you could overspend on housing a survey by american financing found that 44 of americans ages 60 to 70 have a mortgage when they retire according to the chicago tribune some retirees even upsize their homes said cary carbonaro a certified financial planner with goldman sachs and author of the money queen s guide for women who want to build wealth and banish fear a hefty mortgage payment can seriously crimp cash flow particularly for people on a fixed income cutting your costs by downsizing is always a good idea carbonaro said taxes utilities and maintenance costs almost always go up 19 or you could be house poor then again paying down your mortgage might not be the best solution if it leaves you without enough of a retirement savings cushion if most of your wealth is tied up in your primary residence going into retirement it can be tricky to find a good solution that allows you to maintain your desired lifestyle especially if you want to stay in the home said taylor schulte founder and ceo of san diego based commission free financial planning firm define financial schulte suggested downsizing and using some of the equity to help fund your retirement many people in this situation have a home that is far too large for their needs anyway he said 20 you might have to move depending on where you live you might consider moving to a place where your retirement money goes further for many people especially if they re worried about retirement it s a move that can cut costs substantially it s also an opportunity to relocate to a more attractive climate or move closer to grandkids and like minded transplants read 50 best and worst places to retire if you have no savings 21 you might have to work part time some older americans recognize the physical and mental health benefits that come with keeping an active mind others simply can t afford to retire whether you work past age 67 by necessity or choice one thing is for sure the added income can help boost your retirement nest egg 22 your adult children could derail your retirement plans cutting off the kids might be a necessary step if you re looking to retire in fact 79 of parents are continuing to support their adult children financially according to a report from merrill lynch and age wave for many americans middle age is also the prime income earning age and ideally when savers should have the most disposable income available to bolster retirement accounts financially funding a loved one during those years can have a serious impact on your retirement savings benjamin brandt a certified financial planner and president at capital city wealth management in bismarck north dakota suggested folding a plan b option into a retirement plan if you suspect your child might boomerang home for example being proactive rather than reactive will always lead to better retirement outcomes he said 23 as could your aging parents most adult children are unwilling to withhold support from a parent so brandt suggested that workers plan ahead if they anticipate this expense if a client thinks it is likely they will care for a parent they could build a contingency plan he said they could switch to part time work earlier than expected brandt said or perhaps even work longer if excess funds are needed more than excess time as a caretaker 24 or you could be sandwiched between both generations a 2019 nationwide retirement institute survey found that 38 of older adults have or have had their adult children live with them and 16 have or had their parents live with them some older adults may end up having to provide financial assistance and care to both generations at the same time this phenomenon is so common that it has a name the sandwich generation brandt said by supporting loved ones many people are sacrificing their own ability to save for retirement the nationwide retirement institute survey found that 21 of older adults are somewhat or very concerned about financially supporting their adult children and or parents 25 you ll have to talk to your kids about your end of life care decisions no one wants to think about their own mortality but according to information available from the national institute on aging it s best to discuss end of life care preferences long before illness strikes individuals should consider when they want to use life prolonging measures where they want to receive care and what they want to happen if they re physically unable to care for themselves an ugly truth about retirement is that these are the years when those decisions need to be made and it s best to talk to your loved ones and your doctors about your wishes 26 you ll need to discuss your wealth transfer plans even for people with a modest inheritance to pass down it s often difficult to initiate the money conversation especially when you re not sure how your future heirs will react to the news of an impending windfall some children feel guilt at the thought of an unearned financial boon and squander the funds others can misinterpret your intentions did dad love my sister more than me can be an oft uttered phrase among children of the deceased to avoid misinterpretation have a sit down conversation with your future heirs so they understand the rationale behind your decisions and can start preparing emotionally 27 you ll need to address your burial plan many people are not comfortable discussing death said funeral director veronica reyes still avoiding the topic can lead to bigger problems particularly if you wait until your health is ailing solidifying your burial or cremation arrangement plans now with a cool and clear head allows you to lock in a fixed price reyes said your loved ones will not have to worry about being burdened with confusing decisions and unexpected funeral costs more from gobankingrates taylor bell and gabrielle olya
