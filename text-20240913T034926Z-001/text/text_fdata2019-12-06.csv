nearly six months 5 8 are consolidated as the market tries to make sense of the 500k barrel a day cut that opec is discussing asia pacific many observers understanding of the main obstacle to the so called phase one of a trade agreement between the us and china is split between beijing s demand for tariff roll back and washington s demand for a fixed dollar amount of the chinese agriculture market that will be reserved for us farmers this is the basis of a potential quid pro quo trump had previously claimed that phase one was about 60 of the overall agreement he envisaged therefore the logic would seem to be that 60 of the tariffs should be unwound and that does not count the december 15 threatened tariff the us is reluctant because the tariff is understood as the way to ensure compliance and trump insists it cannot be a fair deal because china has the advantage now the us bilateral deficit with china has fallen by about 50 bln this year but this has done very little for the overall us trade balance the average deficit so far this year is a little more than 52 bln a month in the first ten months of 2018 the monthly average shortfall was 51 3 bln japan s household consumption tanked in october as the sales tax increase had brought purchases forward and the typhoon aggravated an already weak situation the 5 1 year over year drop was half again as large as

disappoints the unexpected decline in october factory orders reported yesterday was followed a stunningly poor industrial production data today there was a broad range of forecasts in the bloomberg survey from a 0 6 gain to a 0 7 loss it actually dropped 1 7 on the month and drove the year over year decline to 5 3 the most since the great financial crisis the output of autos and machinery remains depressed leading to a 4 4 decline in capital goods production however there were more positive impulses from consumer goods 0 3 and basic goods 1 0 the magnitude of the drop warns that next week s aggregate report for the emu will be weaker than the 0 2 decline that economists had forecast the weakness of factory orders and industrial output is not likely to substantially change the debate in germany it seems that nearly every observer outside of germany wants berlin to boost fiscal spending but the government remains reluctant the german political and economic elites for the most part do not embrace keynesian demand management through fiscal policy that dominates the thinking in so many other countries it appears to require a political change in germany to alter this the social democrats the junior party in the grand coalition with merkel concludes its conference this week despite the selection of new leaders that are critical of the coalition agreement there is a reluctance to leave the coalition immediately and force elections it would do miserably however the likely strategy that will be embraced may call for new demands from merkel s cdu csu that may still

unlikely to change minds about the state of the economy growth in q4 is slowing and the question is the magnitude and significance our back of the envelop estimate of 1 is not looking out of place the

argentina owes the imf over 50 billion with a large tranche due around 2022 they can t pay it on schedule and everybody knows it marcos brindicci getty images the international monetary fund s biggest junk bond is on the cusp of getting even junkier leaving investors who bought argentina bonds a year ago under then president mauricio macri holding a bag of dust macri was voted out of office in october his biggest claim to fame was bringing the imf back to argentina bigger than ever with a hefty 56 billion unpayable loan he is officially argentina s ex president in five days alberto fernandez and his vice president cristina kirchner take over on december 10 bondholders are nervous distressed asset investors are loving the deep discounts on argentina debt hoping the imf won t let argentina default and will extend maturities beyond 2023 when they are due there is no way argentina can pay back the imf in full within the current timeline a large tranche of over 20 billion is due in a little over two years argentina s central bank has roughly 10 billion in reserves the economy has been contracting all year the government continues to spend money it does not have it has to the public is now demanding it spend even more indeed that is why fernandez kirchner won the election what does this mean for wall street s bondlords president elect alberto fernandez says he does not want to default ricardo ceppi getty images with fernandez as president the burden clearly is on investors and the imf to provide solvency relief to what has become the mercosul trading bloc s biggest basket case the proposal for a two year moratorium on all debt service something argentina has proposed many times before is also not feasible asking argentina s funders to extend and pretend forfeiting any near term payments is okay without any reassurance on future debt payments has got to be a nonstarter says siobhan morden head of fixed income latin america at amherst pierpont securities in new york the assumptions of the fernandez team may quickly shift from re profiling the debt to restructuring once there is careful assessment of the economic situation morden says we don t underestimate the difficulty of designing a realistic economic program under the ideological constraints of a kirchnerista public consumption growth model that will face pushback from bondholders and the imf the delays on the appointment of the economic team reflect potential ideological tensions within the fernandez kirchner team for weeks investors were willing to believe that a more pragmatic fernandez would be fully in charge but now it seems that kirchner diehards are surrounding him meaning he may not be a totally independent voice on economic matters this looks like a worst case scenario says morden about the unfolding fernandez team an activist and dominant kirchner loyalist group inside the administration will be a negative influence on economic policy it appears argentina will return to a public consumption growth model with huge spending initiatives and price controls as a means to control inflation on the plus side price controls would anchor inflation enough for the central bank to cut the country s onerous lending rates of more than 50 per annum still the investment growth model in strategic sectors is not realistic under the constraints of market interventionism deficit financing near zero foreign currency reserves at the central bank capital controls a dual exchange rate regime and uncertain relations with creditors says morden meanwhile medium term growth which is nonexistent provides no tax revenue for the government currency controls have kept the peso from weakening further unlike every free market economy on the planet argentina has two currency systems the official exchange rate and the black market rate spencer platt getty images distressed asset investors believe that buying argentina bonds priced in the 30s is a steal providing the imf gives the country some relief by extending its debt payment schedule a default is unlikely to wreak havoc on argentina s neighbors i don t see any contagion there says teresa barger cofounder and ceo of cartica management it is ring fenced by its own history of dreadful governments argentina was once economically on a par with europe buenos aires was proudly referred to as the paris of the south it remains the most european city in latin america but since the early 2000s with consecutive failing governments unable to pay its bills argentina has consistently been a story of one step forward two steps backward and little more the wealthy live on dollars real estate and tourism its wine country and its farmers live on dollars to the rest the peso is unreliable so is their government left wing populism kicked into high gear under the governments of nestor kirchner and his wife cristina may now have irretrievably ruined it macri was elected to reverse kirchner s damages he managed to make it worse in 2017 foreign investors spent 2 75 billion on argentina s century bond a 100 year maturity paying a little under 8 interest it has already lost a chunk of its value so anyone buying it has seen their coupon payments vanish as the bond they spent 100 on is now worth around 40 writing in moneyweek in london on thursday retired finsbury asset management portfolio manager max king noted that over the years argentina governments ensured that there are no domestic savings and negligible investment everyone in argentina recognizes this the rule of law and property rights have been undermined to the point of collapse while punitive taxation and exchange controls prop up the black market and informal economy there all activity is directed towards earning dollars to take out of the country and finance emigration which keeps alive the entrepreneurial spirit countries that argentina once looked down on such as chile mexico and uruguay have overtaken it in terms of gdp per capita king warns adding that the example of venezuela also once one of the world s richest countries shows that things can get much much worse

his economics degree at queen s university in kingston he received a master s degree in economics in 1979 and a phd in economics in 1982 both from the university of western ontario he first joined the bank of canada in 1981 where he rose up through the ranks over a 14 year period christopher ragan former special advisor to bank of canada governor david dodge said it was immediately evident to him that poloz was on the fast track for the governor position when he first met him in the early 90s poloz was heading the bank s then research arm at the time the other potential successor ragan had identified was tiff macklem who would later become senior deputy governor at the bank they just had the complete package of things that you want ragan said they had the analytical power they had the administrative savvy they had the communication chops it was clear as day to me advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content for many carney s natural successor was macklem a long time bank of canada employee who seemed groomed for the job the decision by then finance minister jim flaherty to appoint poloz was met with confusion by some in a 2013 interview with the globe and mail former european central bank economist thorsten koeppl said there was a lot of head scratching going on after the appointment macklem stepped down from the bank shortly after the appointment four years before the end of his term but poloz gradually won the confidence of bay steet in part through a communication style that unlike his predecessor would readily convey the unknowns and uncertainties in the bank s economic models it s part of his aw shucks we don t know everything that the previous guy knew communication style ragan said he probably trades on that a little bit and that s okay he would say there are things the bank doesn t know things that i as a governor don t know things that the economics profession doesn t know and i think that s extremely healthy another of his trademarks was a stand against debt poloz was uncommonly outspoken about rising consumer debt levels across canada and often expressed his worries over a heated housing market advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s something that s reasonably different than what other governors have done in the past said jean françois perrault chief economist at scotiabank unfortunately that also muddles a little bit the approach to monetary policy he added some analysts have disagreed with poloz s decision to continue holding rates especially in recent months when trade rifts between the u s and china kicked off a wave of cuts at central banks around the globe over the last few weeks one could make a very good case that there was a need for lower interest rates in canada to guard against risks perrault said scotiabank had predicted the bank would cut rates in october or december the wisdom of poloz s move remains to be seen particularly with canada s current interest rate of 1 75 per cent being the highest among advanced economies meanwhile consumer debts have continued to rise canada s household debt in 2018 averaged 181 per cent of total income well higher than the united states 109 per cent germany 95 per cent and others according to the organisation for economic co operation and development that could be among his more unfortunate legacies at the bank rbc s chandler said concerns about household debts had already begun to surface when poloz took over from his predecessor when the canadian economy was taking its long slow climb back to health seven and a half years later debt levels are even higher chandler said so if that legacy was a question mark for carney it s even more so under poloz email jsnyder nationalpost com twitter jesse_snyder article content share this article in your social network read

revenue is up 30 0 primarily due to the increase in revenue in our russia segment the russia segment revenue is up 29 1 mainly driven by an increase of 39 7 in the number of paying customers in small

increase in revenue adjusted ebitda is up 34 8 primarily due to an increase in revenue and adjusted ebitda margin is up to 53 5 from 51 5 as our personnel expenses excluding equity settled share based compensations marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses excluding insurance costs related to our initial public offering ipo declined as a percentage of revenue adjusted net income is

the last twelve months basis net working capital as of september 30 2019 remained flat as compared to december 31 2018 as the increase in trade and other payables over the nine months ended september 30 2019 primarily due to increase in payables to employees was offset by the increase in advances paid primarily due to prepayment of ipo insurance costs and a decrease in contract liabilities primarily due to the utilization of prepayments for annual subscriptions received from our customers in the fourth quarter of 2018 net debt increased by 59 8 million or 7 8 primarily due to dividends paid to shareholders and minority holders the acquisition of a 25 01 ownership interest in llc skilaz a russian hr technology company which automates routine recruiting processes for 235 million capital expenditures and the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash partly offset by the increase of cash from operating activities net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio declined from 1 3x to 0 9x mainly due to an increase in adjusted ebitda today i am delighted to present another set of excellent results said mikhail zhukov chief executive officer of headhunter group plc against the backdrop of a challenging macro environment we continued to deliver strong revenue growth in key market segments as a result of balanced monetization and customer acquisition strategies also this quarter we continued demonstrating our ability to increase revenue whilst improving profitability we continued to deliver on our mobile first strategy and in the third quarter of 2019 over 80 of total traffic came from mobile devices we deem this especially important in the light of our increasingly high focus on blue collar professionals recently as a testimony of our relentless product focus we were granted a patent for a comprehensive machine learning powered candidate recommendation system that is embedded into various headhunter user interfaces this technology provides our clients with an opportunity to increase the efficiency of their recruitment process by automatically matching candidates with relevant vacancies we believe such recommendation and curation systems will continue to play an integral part in our product proposition going forward we continue to explore opportunities in both market penetration and monetization enhancement as we implement our long term growth strategy operating segments for management purposes we are organized into operating segments based on the geography of our operations our operating segments include russia belarus kazakhstan and other countries as each segment other than russia individually comprises less than 10 of our revenue for reporting purposes we combine all segments other than russia into the other segments category customers we sell our services predominantly to businesses that are looking for job seekers to fill vacancies inside their organizations we refer to such businesses as customers in russia we divide our customers into i key accounts and ii small and medium accounts based on their annual revenue and employee headcount we define key accounts as customers who according to the spark interfax database have an annual revenue of 2 billion or more or a headcount of 250 or more employees and have not marked themselves as recruiting agencies on their page on our website and we define small and medium accounts as customers who according to the spark interfax database have both an annual revenue of less than 2 billion and a headcount of less than 250 employees and have not marked themselves as recruiting agencies on their page on our website our website allows several legal entities and or natural persons to be registered each with a unique identification number under a single account page e g a group of companies each legal entity registered under a single account is defined as a separate customer and is included in the number of paying customers metric natural persons registered under a single account are assumed to be employees of the legal entities of that account and thus are not considered separate customers and are not included in the number of paying customers metric however in a specific reporting period if only natural persons used our services under such account they are collectively included in the number of paying customers as one customer seasonality revenue we generally do not experience substantial seasonal fluctuations in demand for our services and our revenue remains relatively stable throughout each quarter however our customers are predominately businesses and therefore use our services mostly on business days as a result our quarterly revenue is affected by the number of business days in a quarter with the exception of our services that represent stand ready performance obligations such as subscriptions to access our curriculum vitae cv database which are satisfied over the period of subscription including weekends and holidays public holidays in russia predominantly fall during the first quarter of each year which results in lower business activity in that quarter accordingly our first quarter revenue is typically slightly lower than in the other quarters for example our first quarter revenue in our russia segment in 2017 and 2018 was 21 1 and 20 9 respectively the number of business days in a quarter may also be affected by calendar layout in a specific year in addition the government of russia decides on an annual basis how public holidays that occur on weekends will be reallocated to business days throughout the year as a requirement of the labor code of russia as a result the number of business days in a quarter may be different in each year while the total number of business days in a year usually remains the same therefore the comparability of our quarterly results including with respect to our revenue growth rate may be affected by this variance in addition when a calendar layout in a specific year provides for several consecutive holidays or a small number of business days between holidays or holidays adjacent to weekends hr managers of our customers may take short vacations further contributing to the decrease in business activities in these periods the following table illustrates the number of business days by quarter for the years 2017 to 2019 in 2019 the total number of working days is the same as in 2018 but there is 1 business day more 2 business days less and 1 business day more in the first quarter second quarter and third quarter respectively and the same number of business days in the fourth quarter number of business days as of total business days per year 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 first quarter 57 56 57 23 1 22 7 23 1 second quarter 59 61 61 23 9 24 7 24 7 third quarter 66 65 65 26 7 26 3 26 3 fourth quarter 65 65 64 26 3 26 3 25 9 year 247 247 247 100 0 100 0 100 0 therefore in the third quarter of 2019 we saw a positive impact on our revenue and revenue growth rate from additional business days as compared to the third quarter of 2018 operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization personnel and marketing expenses in total accounted for 77 4 and 78 9 of our total operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization for the years ended december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 respectively most of our marketing and personnel expenses are fixed and not directly tied to our revenue marketing expenses are more volatile in terms of allocation to quarters and are affected by our decisions on how we realize our strategy in a particular year which can differ from year to year therefore total marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue for a particular quarter may not be fully representative of the whole year personnel expenses are relatively stable over the year however they are also affected by other dynamics such as our hiring decisions some costs and expenses such as share based compensation or foreign exchange gains or losses can be significantly concentrated in a particular quarter third quarter segment external expenses in our russia segment in 2017 and 2018 were 26 0 and 24 7 respectively of total russia segment external expenses for the year net income and adjusted ebitda even though our revenue remains relatively stable throughout each quarter seasonal revenue fluctuations as described above affect our net income as a result of revenue seasonality our profitability in first quarter is usually lower than in other quarters and for the full year because our expenses as a percentage of revenue are usually higher in first quarter due to lower revenue for example our adjusted ebitda margin was 34 6 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 46 7 for the full year 2018 our profitability is also affected by our decisions on timing of expenses again as described above contract liabilities our contract liabilities are affected by the annual subscriptions renewal cycle in our key accounts customer segment a substantial number of our key accounts renew their subscriptions in the first quarter and prepay us in the fourth quarter of a previous year as per our normal payment terms as a result we receive substantial prepayments from our customers in the fourth quarter which causes consequential increase in our contract liabilities at the end of that quarter for example our contract liabilities as of march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 2018 were 1 607 million 1 548 million 1 553 million and 2 073 million respectively net cash generated from operating activities our net cash generated from operating activities is affected by seasonal fluctuations of business activity as explained in revenue and by substantial prepayments from our customers see contract liabilities as well as by our decisions in regard to timing of expenses see operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization and to a lesser extent by payment terms provided to us by our largest suppliers such as tv advertising agencies and others net working capital our net working capital is primarily affected by changes in our contract liabilities as discussed above as our contract liabilities are usually highest in the fourth quarter our net working capital is usually lowest in the fourth quarter for example our net working capital of march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 2018 was 2 044 million 2 048 million 2 036 million and 2 623 million respectively third quarter 2019 results our revenue was 2 142 million for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to 1 648 million for the three months ended september 30 2018 revenue for the three months ended september 30 2019 increased by 494 million or 30 0 compared to the three months ended september 30 2018 primarily due to the increase in revenue in our russia segment revenue in our russia segment was 1 984 million for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to 1 538 million for the three months ended september 30 2018 revenue in our russia segment increased by 447 million or 29 1 this was primarily due to a 66 9 growth in the number of paying small and medium accounts in the other regions of russia and by 16 1 in moscow and st petersburg coupled with an increase of 19 9 in the arpc in key accounts in moscow and st petersburg driven by price increases and an increase in the usage of our services by this type of customer the following table breaks down revenue by product for the three months ended september 30 for the nine months

medium accounts continues to grow in our key accounts arpc has increased by 19 9 in moscow and st petersburg and by 4 4 in other regions of russia increase in the arpc in moscow and st petersburg was driven by 1 the increase in prices effective january 1 2019 e g 10 on average for subscriptions and 18 for a single standard type job posting a reduction in discounts and 2 the increase in the usage of service which was driven by the increase in the average number of job postings per customer while the average number of subscription days per customer total for bundled subscriptions and cv database access remained flat in our small and medium accounts arpc has increased by 4 3 in moscow and st petersburg and decreased by 2 8 in other regions of russia arpc dynamic in these customer

september 30 2019 compared to the three months ended september 30 2018 the main factors that contributed to the increase in personnel expenses are i an increase in share based compensation primarily due to the grant of new options under the 2016 unit option plan and 2018 unit option plan in the second quarter of 2019 ii 76 new employee hires from september 30 2018 to september 30 2019 primarily in the development and production teams in our russia segment thus increasing headcount in the russia segment to 681 people as of september 30 2019 and iii the indexation of wages effective from the first quarter of 2019 excluding share based compensation our personnel expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue marketing expenses marketing expenses increased by 43 6 million or 17 5 for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to the three months ended september 30 2018 primarily due to i an increase in tv marketing expense ii timing of expenses incurred on a brand recognition study which was carried out in the third quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018 and iii an increase in online marketing expenses other general and administrative expenses our professional services have decreased by 29 5 million or 36 7 for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to the three months ended september 30 2018 primarily due to the decrease in the professional services related to the ipo our insurance services have increased by 43 6 million for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to the three months ended september 30 2018 due to the purchase of insurance cover related to the ipo our office rent and maintenance expenses decreased by 7 million or 12 7 for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to the three months ended september 30 2018 at january 1 2019 we initially adopted ifrs 16 the new accounting standard that introduced a single on balance sheet accounting model for lessees as a result we as a lessee have recognized right of use assets representing our rights to use the underlying assets and lease liabilities representing our obligation to make lease payments we have applied ifrs 16 using the modified retrospective approach accordingly the comparative information presented for 2018 has not been restated and is presented as previously reported under ias 17 and related interpretations we have recognized 18 618 thousand of depreciation charges and 8 070 thousand of interest costs from the leases in the third quarter of 2019 our other operating expenses increased by 34 8 million mainly due to i certain additional valuation allowances for value added tax receivables provided in the third quarter of 2019 and ii an increase in travel expenses net foreign exchange income net foreign exchange income was 11 4 million for the three months ended september 30 2019 an increase of 10 3 million compared to a 1 1 million income for the three months ended september 30 2018 the net foreign

primarily due to a depreciation charge of 18 6 million related to right of use assets recognized as of january 1 2019 under the new standard ifrs 16 leases see other general and administrative expenses finance income and costs finance income was 12 0 million for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to 25 1 million for the three months ended september 30 2018 primarily due to a decrease in short term deposits as we used cash to pay dividends to shareholders for the year 2018 in july 2019 finance costs were 145 5 million for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to 159 1 million for the three months ended september 30 2018 finance costs decreased by 13 7 million primarily due to a decrease of loans and borrowings balance by 1 043 million from december 31 2018 to september 30 2019 partly offset by interest expense of 8 1 million related to lease liabilities recognized as of january 1 2019 under the new standard ifrs 16 leases income tax expense income tax expense was 191 4 million for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to 173 4 million for the three months ended september 30 2018 driven by the increase of tax base primarily due to the increase in revenue the effective tax rate was 25 1 for the three months ended september 30 2019 and 34 0 for the three months ended september 30 2018 the effective tax rate for the three months ended september 30 2019 was affected by the reversal of provision for uncertain tax positions in the third quarter of 2019 that did not occur in the third quarter of 2018 without the effect from the reversal the effective tax rate for the three months ended september 30 2019 would have been 28 4 the remaining decrease in the effective tax rate from 34 0 to 28 4 is primarily due to a decrease in the proportion of non deductible expenses and unrecognized deferred tax assets relative to profit before income tax net income net income was 571 million for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to 336 million for the three months ended september 30 2018 net income increased by 235 million compared with the three months ended september 30 2018 primarily due to the reasons described above adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda was 1 145 million for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to 850 million for the three months ended september 30 2018 and it increased by 295

30 2019 net cash generated from operating activities was 1 569 million compared to 1 083 million for the nine months ended september 30 2018 the change between the periods of 486 million was primarily

revenue is up 30 0 primarily due to the increase in revenue in our russia segment the russia segment revenue is up 29 1 mainly driven by an increase of 39 7 in the number of paying customers in small

increase in revenue adjusted ebitda is up 34 8 primarily due to an increase in revenue and adjusted ebitda margin is up to 53 5 from 51 5 as our personnel expenses excluding equity settled share based compensations marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses excluding insurance costs related to our initial public offering ipo declined as a percentage of revenue adjusted net income is

the last twelve months basis net working capital as of september 30 2019 remained flat as compared to december 31 2018 as the increase in trade and other payables over the nine months ended september 30 2019 primarily due to increase in payables to employees was offset by the increase in advances paid primarily due to prepayment of ipo insurance costs and a decrease in contract liabilities primarily due to the utilization of prepayments for annual subscriptions received from our customers in the fourth quarter of 2018 net debt increased by 59 8 million or 7 8 primarily due to dividends paid to shareholders and minority holders the acquisition of a 25 01 ownership interest in llc skilaz a russian hr technology company which automates routine recruiting processes for 235 million capital expenditures and the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash partly offset by the increase of cash from operating activities net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio declined from 1 3x to 0 9x mainly due to an increase in adjusted ebitda today i am delighted to present another set of excellent results said mikhail zhukov chief executive officer of headhunter group plc against the backdrop of a challenging macro environment we continued to deliver strong revenue growth in key market segments as a result of balanced monetization and customer acquisition strategies also this quarter we continued demonstrating our ability to increase revenue whilst improving profitability we continued to deliver on our mobile first strategy and in the third quarter of 2019 over 80 of total traffic came from mobile devices we deem this especially important in the light of our increasingly high focus on blue collar professionals recently as a testimony of our relentless product focus we were granted a patent for a comprehensive machine learning powered candidate recommendation system that is embedded into various headhunter user interfaces this technology provides our clients with an opportunity to increase the efficiency of their recruitment process by automatically matching candidates with relevant vacancies we believe such recommendation and curation systems will continue to play an integral part in our product proposition going forward we continue to explore opportunities in both market penetration and monetization enhancement as we implement our long term growth strategy operating segments for management purposes we are organized into operating segments based on the geography of our operations our operating segments include russia belarus kazakhstan and other countries as each segment other than russia individually comprises less than 10 of our revenue for reporting purposes we combine all segments other than russia into the other segments category customers we sell our services predominantly to businesses that are looking for job seekers to fill vacancies inside their organizations we refer to such businesses as customers in russia we divide our customers into i key accounts and ii small and medium accounts based on their annual revenue and employee headcount we define key accounts as customers who according to the spark interfax database have an annual revenue of 2 billion or more or a headcount of 250 or more employees and have not marked themselves as recruiting agencies on their page on our website and we define small and medium accounts as customers who according to the spark interfax database have both an annual revenue of less than 2 billion and a headcount of less than 250 employees and have not marked themselves as recruiting agencies on their page on our website our website allows several legal entities and or natural persons to be registered each with a unique identification number under a single account page e g a group of companies each legal entity registered under a single account is defined as a separate customer and is included in the number of paying customers metric natural persons registered under a single account are assumed to be employees of the legal entities of that account and thus are not considered separate customers and are not included in the number of paying customers metric however in a specific reporting period if only natural persons used our services under such account they are collectively included in the number of paying customers as one customer seasonality revenue we generally do not experience substantial seasonal fluctuations in demand for our services and our revenue remains relatively stable throughout each quarter however our customers are predominately businesses and therefore use our services mostly on business days as a result our quarterly revenue is affected by the number of business days in a quarter with the exception of our services that represent stand ready performance obligations such as subscriptions to access our curriculum vitae cv database which are satisfied over the period of subscription including weekends and holidays public holidays in russia predominantly fall during the first quarter of each year which results in lower business activity in that quarter accordingly our first quarter revenue is typically slightly lower than in the other quarters for example our first quarter revenue in our russia segment in 2017 and 2018 was 21 1 and 20 9 respectively the number of business days in a quarter may also be affected by calendar layout in a specific year in addition the government of russia decides on an annual basis how public holidays that occur on weekends will be reallocated to business days throughout the year as a requirement of the labor code of russia as a result the number of business days in a quarter may be different in each year while the total number of business days in a year usually remains the same therefore the comparability of our quarterly results including with respect to our revenue growth rate may be affected by this variance in addition when a calendar layout in a specific year provides for several consecutive holidays or a small number of business days between holidays or holidays adjacent to weekends hr managers of our customers may take short vacations further contributing to the decrease in business activities in these periods the following table illustrates the number of business days by quarter for the years 2017 to 2019 in 2019 the total number of working days is the same as in 2018 but there is 1 business day more 2 business days less and 1 business day more in the first quarter second quarter and third quarter respectively and the same number of business days in the fourth quarter number of business days as of total business days per year 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 first quarter 57 56 57 23 1 22 7 23 1 second quarter 59 61 61 23 9 24 7 24 7 third quarter 66 65 65 26 7 26 3 26 3 fourth quarter 65 65 64 26 3 26 3 25 9 year 247 247 247 100 0 100 0 100 0 therefore in the third quarter of 2019 we saw a positive impact on our revenue and revenue growth rate from additional business days as compared to the third quarter of 2018 operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization personnel and marketing expenses in total accounted for 77 4 and 78 9 of our total operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization for the years ended december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 respectively most of our marketing and personnel expenses are fixed and not directly tied to our revenue marketing expenses are more volatile in terms of allocation to quarters and are affected by our decisions on how we realize our strategy in a particular year which can differ from year to year therefore total marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue for a particular quarter may not be fully representative of the whole year personnel expenses are relatively stable over the year however they are also affected by other dynamics such as our hiring decisions some costs and expenses such as share based compensation or foreign exchange gains or losses can be significantly concentrated in a particular quarter third quarter segment external expenses in our russia segment in 2017 and 2018 were 26 0 and 24 7 respectively of total russia segment external expenses for the year net income and adjusted ebitda even though our revenue remains relatively stable throughout each quarter seasonal revenue fluctuations as described above affect our net income as a result of revenue seasonality our profitability in first quarter is usually lower than in other quarters and for the full year because our expenses as a percentage of revenue are usually higher in first quarter due to lower revenue for example our adjusted ebitda margin was 34 6 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 46 7 for the full year 2018 our profitability is also affected by our decisions on timing of expenses again as described above contract liabilities our contract liabilities are affected by the annual subscriptions renewal cycle in our key accounts customer segment a substantial number of our key accounts renew their subscriptions in the first quarter and prepay us in the fourth quarter of a previous year as per our normal payment terms as a result we receive substantial prepayments from our customers in the fourth quarter which causes consequential increase in our contract liabilities at the end of that quarter for example our contract liabilities as of march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 2018 were 1 607 million 1 548 million 1 553 million and 2 073 million respectively net cash generated from operating activities our net cash generated from operating activities is affected by seasonal fluctuations of business activity as explained in revenue and by substantial prepayments from our customers see contract liabilities as well as by our decisions in regard to timing of expenses see operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization and to a lesser extent by payment terms provided to us by our largest suppliers such as tv advertising agencies and others net working capital our net working capital is primarily affected by changes in our contract liabilities as discussed above as our contract liabilities are usually highest in the fourth quarter our net working capital is usually lowest in the fourth quarter for example our net working capital of march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 2018 was 2 044 million 2 048 million 2 036 million and 2 623 million respectively third quarter 2019 results our revenue was 2 142 million for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to 1 648 million for the three months ended september 30 2018 revenue for the three months ended september 30 2019 increased by 494 million or 30 0 compared to the three months ended september 30 2018 primarily due to the increase in revenue in our russia segment revenue in our russia segment was 1 984 million for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to 1 538 million for the three months ended september 30 2018 revenue in our russia segment increased by 447 million or 29 1 this was primarily due to a 66 9 growth in the number of paying small and medium accounts in the other regions of russia and by 16 1 in moscow and st petersburg coupled with an increase of 19 9 in the arpc in key accounts in moscow and st petersburg driven by price increases and an increase in the usage of our services by this type of customer the following table breaks down revenue by product for the three months ended september 30 for the nine months

medium accounts continues to grow in our key accounts arpc has increased by 19 9 in moscow and st petersburg and by 4 4 in other regions of russia increase in the arpc in moscow and st petersburg was driven by 1 the increase in prices effective january 1 2019 e g 10 on average for subscriptions and 18 for a single standard type job posting a reduction in discounts and 2 the increase in the usage of service which was driven by the increase in the average number of job postings per customer while the average number of subscription days per customer total for bundled subscriptions and cv database access remained flat in our small and medium accounts arpc has increased by 4 3 in moscow and st petersburg and decreased by 2 8 in other regions of russia arpc dynamic in these customer

september 30 2019 compared to the three months ended september 30 2018 the main factors that contributed to the increase in personnel expenses are i an increase in share based compensation primarily due to the grant of new options under the 2016 unit option plan and 2018 unit option plan in the second quarter of 2019 ii 76 new employee hires from september 30 2018 to september 30 2019 primarily in the development and production teams in our russia segment thus increasing headcount in the russia segment to 681 people as of september 30 2019 and iii the indexation of wages effective from the first quarter of 2019 excluding share based compensation our personnel expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue marketing expenses marketing expenses increased by 43 6 million or 17 5 for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to the three months ended september 30 2018 primarily due to i an increase in tv marketing expense ii timing of expenses incurred on a brand recognition study which was carried out in the third quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018 and iii an increase in online marketing expenses other general and administrative expenses our professional services have decreased by 29 5 million or 36 7 for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to the three months ended september 30 2018 primarily due to the decrease in the professional services related to the ipo our insurance services have increased by 43 6 million for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to the three months ended september 30 2018 due to the purchase of insurance cover related to the ipo our office rent and maintenance expenses decreased by 7 million or 12 7 for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to the three months ended september 30 2018 at january 1 2019 we initially adopted ifrs 16 the new accounting standard that introduced a single on balance sheet accounting model for lessees as a result we as a lessee have recognized right of use assets representing our rights to use the underlying assets and lease liabilities representing our obligation to make lease payments we have applied ifrs 16 using the modified retrospective approach accordingly the comparative information presented for 2018 has not been restated and is presented as previously reported under ias 17 and related interpretations we have recognized 18 618 thousand of depreciation charges and 8 070 thousand of interest costs from the leases in the third quarter of 2019 our other operating expenses increased by 34 8 million mainly due to i certain additional valuation allowances for value added tax receivables provided in the third quarter of 2019 and ii an increase in travel expenses net foreign exchange income net foreign exchange income was 11 4 million for the three months ended september 30 2019 an increase of 10 3 million compared to a 1 1 million income for the three months ended september 30 2018 the net foreign exchange income for the three months ended september 30 2019 reflects mostly the foreign exchange income on usd denominated cash balances depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization were 171 1 million for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to 148 2 million for the three months ended september 30 2018 depreciation and amortization increased by 23 5 million or 15 9 primarily due to a depreciation charge of 18 6 million related to right of use assets recognized as of january 1 2019 under the new standard ifrs 16 leases see other general and administrative expenses finance income and costs finance income was 12 0 million for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to 25 1 million for the three months ended september 30 2018 primarily due to a decrease in short term deposits as we used cash to pay dividends to shareholders for the year 2018 in july 2019 finance costs were 145 5 million for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to 159 1 million for the three months ended september 30 2018 finance costs decreased by 13 7 million primarily due to a decrease of loans and borrowings balance by 1 043 million from december 31 2018 to september 30 2019 partly offset by interest expense of 8 1 million related to lease liabilities recognized as of january 1 2019 under the new standard ifrs 16 leases income tax expense income tax expense was 191 4 million for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to 173 4 million for the three months ended september 30 2018 driven by the increase of tax base primarily due to the increase in revenue the effective tax rate was 25 1 for the three months ended september 30 2019 and 34 0 for the three months ended september 30 2018 the effective tax rate for the three months ended september 30 2019 was affected by the reversal of provision for uncertain tax positions in the third quarter of 2019 that did not occur in the third quarter of 2018 without the effect from the reversal the effective tax rate for the three months ended september 30 2019 would have been 28 4 the remaining decrease in the effective tax rate from 34 0 to 28 4 is primarily due to a decrease in the proportion of non deductible expenses and unrecognized deferred tax assets relative to profit before income tax net income net income was 571 million for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to 336 million for the three months ended september 30 2018 net income increased by 235 million compared with the three months ended september 30 2018 primarily due to the reasons described above adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda was 1 145 million for the three months ended september 30 2019 compared to 850 million for the three months ended september 30 2018 and it increased by 295

with brent d griffiths the ticker president trump s pro wall street record will leave him little room on the campaign trail next year to reprise the anti industry pose he struck in 2016 that was in fresh evidence as treasury secretary steven mnuchin the onetime goldman sachs executive appeared on capitol hill to defend the trump administration s deregulation of the financial services industry and criticize democratic proposals to tax and scrutinize it mnuchin spent most of his time before the house financial services committee in the weeds of financial oversight but the hearing also offered a preview of what democratic strategists believe will be a potent line of attack to press against trump on the campaign trail and at least one former trump official agrees the president is vulnerable on this front there s some truth to the idea that it would be smart for a democrat nominee to focus on the closeness between the trump white house and goldman sachs the former white house official tells me speaking on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment that would be some inherently good messaging for democrats to use advertisement mnuchin in his appearance offered a full throated critique of a tax on financial transactions embraced by some democratic presidential candidates including sens bernie sanders i vt and elizabeth warren d mass and entrepreneur andrew yang and the treasury secretary faced sharp questions from democrats about the administration s moves to shrink the financial stability oversight council the post crisis board charged with coordinating the federal government s regulation of the financial system mnuchin said the treasury department is working to study the impact of the potential financial transactions tax i am very concerned that that would destroy our capital markets and the cost to american holders of mutual funds would bear the majority of the cost mnuchin said but it likely will remain a popular concept on the campaign trail a version introduced by congressional democrats would raise an estimated 777 billion over a decade a considerable sum for the party s white house hopefuls looking to fund pricey social welfare expansions while reining in the industry advertisement to be sure not all democratic presidential candidates are embracing a financial transactions tax but even former vice president joe biden arguably the field s moderate pacesetter is pushing a tax plan that would mean a significantly higher burden for big banks his plan released this week would bump the corporate rate up from 21 percent to 28 percent effectively halving the windfall the industry reaped from trump s tax cuts democratic pollster celinda lake says the trump cuts whose second anniversary arrives this month present a ripe target for democrats to make the case the president has betrayed the populist pitch he made in 2016 she tells me focus groups she s conducted with disaffected trump voters reveal they are really really mad about the corporate windfall the cuts yielded and a remarkable number of people know about companies like amazon that aren t paying any taxes to that end biden is proposing a 15 percent minimum corporate tax lake says going after the failed promise of the tax cuts could become a very powerful component of a broader case against the president s coziness with corporate interests another focus group of trump voters conducted in michigan s swing macomb county by democracy corps a project by democratic strategists james carville and stanley greenberg struck on the framing back in march 2017 from that report advertisement when his cabinet is described as full of campaign donors goldman sachs bankers bailed out by the taxpayers and people who use undocumented workers in their homes they question whether this is the donald trump they voted for that right there seems to be two faced and trump is now just the puppet doing what goldman sachs want most important this means they won t get the changes they wanted and it s possible we re in for another four or possibly eight years of the same old same old but the former white house official argued not all democratic candidates are on the same footing when it comes to challenging trump s wall street advocacy trump he said can lean into his trade wars anathema to c suites and wall street to argue his populist credentials are intact if he s running against a more moderate trade friendly democrat both sides are going to attempt versions of the same argument against the other he said but sanders will

by graham peebles for many people around the world where and to whom one is born is the single most important factor in deciding the trajectory of one s life if you are born to middle class parents in one of the developed wealthy nations of the world you will be blessed with comfort opportunity good healthcare and education and a life of profitable possibilities on the other hand find yourself in a slum in nairobi in kenya or if you are the daughter of tea pickers in assam in india then all a life of poverty uncertainty suffering and the threat of extreme exploitation awaits you shocking statistics we live in a world rife with inequality of wealth income power and influence it is the underlying cause of deep seated social tensions community divisions and a range of poisons that cause terrible suffering to millions of people the disparity between the wealthy minority and the billions living in suffocating poverty is greater than it has ever been worldwide it is estimated that the wealthiest 10 per cent owns 85 per cent of global household wealth according to wikipedia as of may 2005 the three richest people in the world have assets that exceed the combined gross domestic product of the 47 countries with the last gdp and the richest 2 per cent of the world population own more than 51 per cent of the global assets at the other more densely populated less perfumed end of the scale global issues reports that almost half the world s people over 3 5 billion live on less than 2 50 us dollars a day and 80 per cent live on less than 10 dollars a day the largest proportion of those living in poverty are in india rural china and sub saharan africa where despite the fact that some countries within the last decade or two have seen economic growth poverty rates have remained unchanged and some countries angola the democratic republic of the congo and gabon have actually seen an increase in the percentage of their population living in extreme poverty and there would seem to be no light at the end of the tunnel according to unicef it would take more than 800 years for the bottom billion to achieve 10 per cent of global income under the current rate of change the world of income and wealth inequality is awash with shocking statistics figures disclosed by world bank economist branko milanovic and reported by nobel prize winning economist joseph stieglitz are shocking and revealing eight per cent of humanity takes home 50 per cent of global income the top 1 per cent alone takes home 15 percent america he states provides a particularly grim example for the world it is where income and wealth inequality reach their zenith and where one in four children live in poverty the countrys wealthiest 1 per cent incomes above 394 000 dollars take home 22 per cent of the nation s income the top 0 1 per cent make do with a colossal 11 per cent stieglitz goes on to make the staggering point that an average american worker earns less today than he did 45 years ago inflation adjusted and that men without a university degree earn almost 40 per cent less than they did four decades ago the figures depicting poverty and hardship are many and varied over 20 per cent of the world s population that is 1 4 billion people live on less than 1 25 dollars a day 75 cents below the official world bank poverty threshold unicef states that 22 000 children under the age of five if it was six or seven the numbers would be even higher die every day due to poverty related issues of the two billion children in the world half are currently living their lives in extreme poverty with limited or no access to clean water or sanitation healthcare and education worth the name the greatest concentrations of people living below the 2 dollars per day poverty line are to be found in rural areas where three in every four of those below the poverty line are to be found life is little better in the cities where over half the world s 7 2 billion population now live one in three of whom are living in a slum the unequal are always with us income and wealth inequality have always existed however the worldwide gap between the rich and the rest as stieglitz puts it widened even more right up through about world war ii but it took the combined doctrinal political idealism of british prime minister margaret thatcher in power during 1979 90 and us president ronald reagan 1981 89 to hyper accelerate levels of inequality and set the divisive competitive tone for the years that followed the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd states that income inequality first started to rise in the late 70s and early 80s in america and britain and also in israel the ratio between the average incomes of the top 5 per cent to the bottom 5 per cent in the world increased from 78 1 in 1988 to 114 1 in 1993 during the thatcher reagan reign income tax was lowered for higher earners trade unions were broken and the financial sector was deregulated with we now know devastating consequences the inequality trend became more widespread starting in the late 1980s and continues to poison the social fabric of countries throughout the world including more egalitarian nations like sweden finland germany and denmark stieglitz relays that from 1988 to 2008 people in the world s top 1 per cent saw their incomes increase by 60 per cent while those in the bottom 5 per cent had no change in their income in america home to the 2008 recession from 2009 to 2012 incomes of the top 1 per cent in america many of which no doubt had a greedy hand in the causes of the meltdown increased more than 31 per cent while the incomes of the 99 per cent grew 0 4 per cent less than half a percentage point flowing from wealth and income inequality combining to create the powerful elite is the inequitable use and distribution of water and food minerals information technology and skills the united states for example with a mere 5 per cent of the world s population uses 30 per cent of natural resources the 25 per cent of people living in developed countries use 80 per cent of the world s non fuel minerals many of these are found in poor developing countries which have little or no control over their resources and on the whole benefit little from their extraction and sale not only do the wealthy countries usurp and waste 80 per cent of the world s resources but according to a united nations report their voracious consumption of resources cannot be sustained inequality vulnerability exploitation the extreme dualities of poverty and wealth inevitably create the vulnerable and the powerful the abuser and the abused there are wide ranging consequences of such social division foremost being the erosion or denial of democracy with money comes power and with power comes political influence making it inevitable that inequality reinforces itself by corroding our political system and our democratic governance as stieglitz says man made climate change though affecting everyone impacts most acutely on the poorest people living in the poorest countries as a recent world bank report makes clear global warming will lead to a major food crisis in the future sub saharan africa and southeast asia are expected to be the worst hit that is the regions with the largest concentrations of people living in utter poverty one of the gravest consequences of this social economic imbalance is the worldwide movement of people from impoverished communities with few employment opportunities to a rich or richer region or nation the international organization for migration iom estimates there to be over 105 million persons working in a country other than their country of birth women make up the lion s share of this army of workers many of whom are vulnerable to trafficking the us state department states that up to 800 000 persons are trafficked every year although the figure is probably considerably higher 80 per cent of victims are women of which 80 per cent are sold into the commercial sex industry trafficking which is the second most widespread and profitable worldwide criminal activity often arises from debt bondage resulting in forced labour trafficking is nothing less than modern day slavery there are thought to be more people living as slaves that is people held against their will forced to work and paid nothing now than at any time in history for those with the means they are cheap on average 90 dollars will buy you a human being according to free the slaves working within an economic system that disempowers the disadvantaged migrant workers form an economic lifeline for millions of families in 2012 they sent 406 billion dollars in savings to their families in developing countries the world bank reports such money is often earned through domestic servitude with its inherent dangers of mistreatment or construction work in appalling and often dangerous conditions it is poverty in its many manifestations poor education and healthcare poor sanitation and water supplies poor living conditions poor or low self esteem and an absence of hope which drives migration and creates the environment in which trafficking and extreme exploitation can flourish in a world of plenty why are hundreds of millions perhaps billions of people vulnerable at all the vulnerable and exploited exist because of an inherently unjust social economic system which has caused extreme global inequality and built a divided and fractured world society inequality sharing justice the complacent party line of the wealthy is that there is no alternative to the present unhealthy divisive economic model the advocates of market fundamentalism have sought to close down totally the intellectual space for enquiry and discourse as stieglitz says if indeed there is no alternative inequality and poverty will continue to increase building intensely divided societies the rich will hunker in gated communities almost completely separated from the poor whose lives will be almost unfathomable to them and vice versa i ve visited societies that seem to have chosen this path they are not places in which most of us would want to live whether in their cloistered enclaves or their desperate shantytowns the cherished economic model of choice market fundamentalism has as unicef makes clear failed and continues to fail both the people and the planet it concentrates wealth in the hands of the wealth and leads us to question as unicef does the current development model development for whom which has accrued mostly to the wealthiest billion people not only does inequality slow economic growth but it results in health and social problems and generates political instability inequality is dysfunctional and there is a grave need to place equity at the centre of the development agenda a more just and humane model of development based on equitable distribution of the world s resources is a viable alternative whose time has come the idea of equitable distribution of sharing the food and water the resources knowledge skills ideas and technology of the world as the guiding principle for development and economic life is supported by frances stewart professor emeritus at oxford department of international development she believes that poverty can be eliminated essentially what is needed is a significant reduction in the quite obscene levels of inequality that prevail today the distribution of resources from the privileged to the deprived would be enough to eliminate poverty in high and middle income countries she asserts not simply the redistribution of wealth but resources more broadly to as she puts it improve the health the education the assets and the productivity of the poor so that the improving of their lives can become self sustaining expanded and imaginatively applied to address the needs of the poorest people in the poorest nations such a simple common sense model based on social justice and equality would meet basic rights and needs reduce vulnerability and exploitation ease social tensions and slowly establish trust and unity

strategy at rbc capital markets poloz took over from carney at a time when the country was climbing out of the deepest recession in decades a prolonged period of low interest rates had pushed

tailspin poloz shocked the market with a sudden rate cut in early 2015 followed by a second cut months later reducing the overnight rate to 0 5 per cent the move both solidified what proved to be a

the upcoming week is going to be a wild ride for those of us in the uk who are facing the most unpredictable election in modern times one that will dictate not just the domestic agenda over the next five years but also the brexit outcome it s no small issue biggest uk election in decades next week us and china seek deal before 15 december tariffs opec reaches deal on deeper output cuts while it may seem we re already into the holiday season and attention is shifting to office parties and shopping there is no shortage of talking points next week even outside of the uk trade talks between the us and china will continue to be a hot topic as both sides aim to secure a deal before 15 december tariff deadline hong kong protests have created further divisions between the worlds two largest economies and more are expected over the weekend uk election we ve entered the final week of the election campaign and traders are starting to feel a little overconfident whether that s the 10 point margin that the conservatives hold in the polls that would deliver a majority government or donald trump s visit ending without catastrophe confidence is creeping in if we hadn t been in this position before it may be understandable but this premature confidence has been punished before maybe this time they ve got it right there s obviously a risk that they ll be burned again the weekend is always a risky time for uk politics when we re this close to such an incredibly decisive day the prime ministerial debate on friday night is the first chance of the weekend for both to take aim at each other it could be fierce as the clock ticks down to election day with johnson s only aim to come out unscathed having already avoided numerous events including being questions by bbc s andrew neil he may face a number of uncomfortable questions us the biggest risk to the us stock market remains a progressive president currently polls are suggesting that seems to be very unlikely the current focus with us politics remains the impeachment process speaker nancy pelosi seems likely to get the ball going in the house but the senate firmly remains supportive of the president the risks of impeachment getting passed the senate are slim to none hong kong protests have subsided in hong kong this week with the government announcing more spending as the economy is now in a deep recession a march is planned for saturday though and although planned to be peaceful tensions could escalate major risks are limited with the us china interim trade agreement seemingly in the final strait protests turning violent could weigh on the hang seng to start the week china protests have subsided in hong kong this week with the government announcing more spending as the economy is now in a deep recession a march is planned for saturday though and although planned to be peaceful tensions could escalate india rbi did not cut rates as expected today its hand is stayed by an ugly stagflation mix growth revised lower from 6 to 5 and inflation revised higher for q4 2019 and q1 2020 the non performing loans issue across the non bank and official financial sectors appears to be deepening the inr is lower and indian bond yields are higher today the sensex has fallen the sell off could deepen next week especially if the us and china fail to agree a trade deal australia the rba held rates with a dovish outlook australia trade surplus fell more than expected led by mineral resource no visibility on fiscal stimulus by the federal government it appears that most sectors of the australian economy are now in a recession or slowing any change in the status of trade negotiations would be detrimental to local equities and the aussie dollar any discussion on qe at the rba meeting could hurt the local dollar latam politics protests in latin america have put pressure on most economies either for the presence of social movements within its borders or for the threat that one could break out soon risk appetite has been positive this week and for the most part has ignored protest movements in the second part of the week trade optimism could soon turn into pessimism and with it the investors could once again look at political instability as a big factor driving risk aversion in the region market usd the dollar will remain sensitive to trade updates this week but also see a strong focus on with key rate decisions the greenback has fallen against most of its trading partners and we could see further weakness if we see material weakness to the us economy the fed has done a very good job in signaling they are on hold until any material changes to the outlook the fed is still evaluating what to do regarding the repo market upheaval and we could get an incremental update on the standing repo facility while the fed meeting could be a non event on wednesday we could see the ecb decision see further momentum grow for calls to move away from negative interest rates we are one tweet away from a complete collapse in the us china trade war the latest uncertainty on how hong kong will impact trade negotiations and whether we will see a meaningful rollback with tariffs will determine how much risk appetite we have for global indexes the dollar will remain a key safe haven trade that could see it outperform to the euro and commodity currencies mexican peso the mexican peso has been on an upwards trajectory since trade hopes lifted risk appetite the peso has appreciated more than one percent against the dollar even as the nfp returned some of its strength to the greenback but it was too late to make a difference even if the fed does not cut for a fourth time in december and the mexican central bank does so in the middle of the month the rate differential still favours the peso contagion risk in mexico is low given political stability and a government that after a year in power is coming around to the idea of more private investment the usmca ratification is advancing at a slow rate but it keeps moving forward with the biggest risk not getting it done this year a usmca ratification on an election year would not be impossible but it would get tougher as it would be heavily politicized to further divide voters the currency pair is trading at 19 33 and could break under 19 30 although as the trading session approaches the end investors could try to hedge their dollar positions as much as possible before going into the weekend the liquidity of the peso makes it a vehicle for speculators that want to short the region as colombians took to the streets today to protest labor reforms the precedent set by ecuador bolivia and chile will not be lost in the market as political instability will keep downward pressure on latam markets oil oil prices are up more than 15 since early october buoyed in recent days by efforts by opec and its allies or opec as they ve become known to further rebalance the market after years of oversupply production cuts were increased to 1 7 million barrels per day from 1 5 million previously but concerns about its effectiveness and compliance with the cuts are stopping traders getting carried away still price is continuing to grind higher with brent and wti trading at near three month highs the trade war is the big risk for oil prices in the near term both the us and china want us to believe a phase one deal is close but this was meant to be signed in chile a month ago with 15 december tariff deadline approaching though a sense of urgency may materialize and a deal could well give oil another kick higher gold the us jobs report on friday took the wind out of the sails of gold bulls just as they were growing in confidence the yellow metal has struggled at 1 480 both when trading above this level and below and this time it was no different a few days of pressure was obliterated by a stellar us jobs report after which markets went into risk on mode and gold headed south gold remains in consolidation a little longer with 1 440 1 450 below now key two central bank meetings next week including the fed should be the key events for gold but recent easing by both mean policy makers are already in holiday mode the trade war remains the final thing that could really shake things up for gold bitcoin bitcoin has entered consolidation mode again between 7 000 and 8 000 this comes after a tough period for the cryptocurrency after chinese authorities appeared to once again turn their back on them while they re fond of the technology it s likely they re not too thrilled with the idea of ceding control that s hardly surprising cryptocurrencies and volatility go hand in hand we may be in a period of consolidation but that s unlikely to last the worst of the decline may be over for now

china s economic growth rate slowed to a near 30 year low in the third quarter hurting the income of its poorest hong kong china several years ago gan xiaoge travelled the nearly 200 kilometres 124 miles from anhui province in china s east to the capital beijing in search of work as an office cleaner she rode the wave of the country s rapid economic growth and the opportunities it created but as that growth cools off and the prices of key items such as pork rise rapidly following a swine flu epidemic gan finds herself among the hundreds of millions of chinese who are starting to feel the pinch pork prices have risen so much in recent months and soon i won t be able to afford meat any more the landlord has also raised my rent from 500 yuan 71 to 800 yuan 114 then 1 000 yuan 142 in three months gan told al jazeera china s gross domestic product gdp which measures the total value of all finished goods and services produced in an economy grew by six percent in the three months leading up to september that was a relatively rapid growth rate for a country the size of china an expansion rate that was more than three times that of the united states over the same period but it was the slowest growth china has experienced since 1992 the slowdown is disproportionately hurting people like gan migrant workers and those in lower income groups there s no protection for us and can always just find another tenant easily the salary in beijing is barely enough to earn a living gan said people in gan s position are feeling the effects of the slowdown in various ways one of them is through the job market china s official urban unemployment rate stood at 3 61 percent in the third quarter according to a ministry of human resources and social security official quoted by the state xinhua news agency it has hovered near or below the four percent mark for years and that figure puts it roughly in line with the us unemployment rate but anecdotal evidence points to a growing number of manufacturing companies laying off staff as they suffer from the drop in overseas orders caused by the trade war with the us for instance china s employed persons index a component of the monthly official manufacturing purchasing managers index that measures whether factory activity is expanding or contracting slipped below 47 in august the first time it had done so since the global financial crisis of 2007 2008 it recovered slightly to 47 3 in october but any figure below 50 indicates that factories are cutting their headcounts balancing act but the chinese economy had been slowing down even before the trade war began last year one reason for the deceleration was beijing s attempt to reduce debts and social inequality that had worsened as the government pursued an export oriented strategy to create world beating low cost industries now chinese president xi jinping is trying to reverse some of those adverse side effects by reducing china s reliance on exports and making domestic consumers the main engine for growth some analysts say that strategy has yet to bear fruit beijing is struggling to rebalance growth towards consumer spending which suggests that any stimulus efforts will remain focused on investment diana choyleva chief economist at enodo economics wrote in a research note but ultimately xi jinping seems prepared to accept much weaker growth he cares more about reducing inequality and disarming its threat to power than about growth and financial markets choyleva added but slowing growth is just one reason for the squeeze on people s incomes the african swine fever outbreak which has forced authorities to cull millions of hogs and which has decimated the supply of pork meat has led to rapid increases in the price of the commodity overall consumer prices rose three percent from a year earlier in september the fastest increase in nearly six years according to the national bureau of statistics this spike was largely driven by the increase in pork prices the lives of chinese people had started to become more pinched even before the trade war and the latest bout of inflation chinese people have traditionally been among the most frugal with savings rates far higher than those of citizens of most other countries but from a peak in 2010 household savings as a percentage of disposable income has been on a slow but steady decline according to the organisation for economic co operation and development savings has declined as the government has encouraged more domestic consumption to reduce china s reliance on exports debt ballooning meanwhile household debt has increased considerably over the same period the international monetary fund imf estimates that the total debt of chinese households stood at 50 3 percent of gdp as of june 2018 above the emerging market average and 32 percentage points higher than it stood a decade earlier the imf says the increase raises concerns whether further debt increases could lead to significant adverse effects on growth and financial stability and it s not just households that have been accumulating debt the central and provincial governments have been too nick marro global trade lead at the economist intelligence unit says he s not surprised by the slowdown in china s economy but he estimates that the actual growth figure may be even lower if the effects of tax cuts are stripped out the government has reduced taxes to allow people to spend more to stimulate growth but a side effect has been to put a strain on the finances of local government revenues forcing them to increase borrowings relying on higher levels of unsustainable debt to reach a certain number for instance is more of a threat to the global economy than china s headline gdp trending below six percent marro told al jazeera more aggressive policies however would exacerbate the existing debt burden which would have ramifications for the health of the chinese economy in the medium to long term moreover the slowdown in growth is far from uniform across the country causing another headache for policymakers according to official figures during the first half of the year the economies of 14 out of 25 provincial level jurisdictions in china grew faster than the national average and the variation in growth rates was wide with yunnan in the southwest posting the fastest growth rate of 9 2 percent while tianjin near beijing in china s east came in at the bottom with a 4 6 percent expansion the wide range of growth rates means that the chinese government cannot implement one size fits all solutions and the overall slowdown translates into greater pain for those areas with the fewest resources normally the coastal provinces are better prepared to weather the storm because they are more diversified and have more economic resources from corporates governments human capital and labour tommy wu a senior economist at oxford economics told al jazeera the northeast provinces and other inner provinces tend to have lower productivity with excess capacity and less opportunities and possibly also suffering from high debt level while the range of options for the government to mitigate the effects of the slowdown may be narrowing the choices for ordinary people like gan caught in the downdraft are stark i will take more part time jobs and cut the unnecessary expenses she said
our n h 2020 primary forum series continues with democratic presidential candidate pete buttigieg we sit down with the south bend indiana mayor and afghanistan war veteran before a live audience to discuss a range of domestic and foreign policy issues and address listener questions submitted before the event buttigieg has proposed medicare for all who want it expanding mental health services and a more targeted approach to free public college than some of his democratic opponents this nhpr series is in collaboration with nhpbs which broadcasts the program after the live exchange interview original air date friday dec 6 2019 listen to the forum scroll to the bottom for a transcript watch the forum read the transcript this is a computer generated transcript and may contain errors laura knoy i m laura knoy and this is the exchange laura knoy today we continue our series of presidential primary 2020 candidate forums and for this show on friday december 6th we re talking with democratic presidential candidate pete buttigieg he s with us before a live audience in nhpr s studio laura knoy we received many questions from our listeners before today and we ll be incorporating those throughout the hour i want to thank everybody who took the time to write in and nhpr s politics and policy reporter lauren chooljian is also with me we ll be both asking questions of mayor buttigieg and mary buttigieg thank you very much for being here well thanks for having me so let s start off with your political philosophy how you sort of see yourself in this overall race it s a very big democratic field you don t need me to tell you that and that has sparked mayor buttigieg a big debate about the ideological future of your party i want to talk about some issues where that debate has been playing up first one is health care you re in favor what you call medicare for all who want it give us two reasons why you think this is better than medicare for sure pete buttigieg reason number one is that it respects people s ability to make their own decisions so a medicare for all who want it means is we take a version of medicare something like a public alternative we make it available to everybody we auto enroll anybody who is uninsured so there s no such thing as an uninsured american but i m going to allow americans to decide whether they want it one at a time because i don t think it is the right thing to do to kick people off of their private plans that s reason number one reason number two is it s much easier to pay for we estimate that the total cost of my plan over the course of the decade would be 1 5 trillion dollars not exactly a small amount of money but some of the others that have been proposed are 20 30 plus there are disagreements to the tune of 10 trillion dollars just over how much the cost is so it s more affordable and it s more respectful of people s ability to make their own decisions there s also a little bit of humility baked into the policy because what we re saying is if this is really the best plan for everybody everybody will choose it until it is the single payer in america if on the other hand it is not the best plan for some americans then we re gonna be really glad that we didn t kick them off of whatever it is they had laura knoy well toward that end a listener charlene wrote us asking do you think employers will drop health care coverage for employees knowing that they could get medicare for all who want it and charlene thank you for writing in and mayor buttigieg how concerned are you that people who like their employer sponsored insurance might lose it because the employer will say well you know to heck with paying it for ourselves we ll just put them on the medicare for all who want to plan the public option pete buttigieg well first of all we re talking about a quality plan secondly if you look at how we first got into this system we re in today and i think everybody agrees nobody would design with a blank slate would design health care today as we know it in america it was because employers tried to differentiate themselves it was a kind of and whistle that they added during the era when wages were controlled and you couldn t always compete on the salary side and so where we are now is we still have this system that s built around the assumption that you re going to have a long term or perhaps lifelong relationship with a single employer where more and more americans are shifting jobs shifting careers or building their income out of multiple employers it just doesn t make sense for us to assume that everybody s going to have that kind of employer based benefit some will continue to have it i think that s fine but we shouldn t have that be the bedrock of our health care system laura knoy couple more quick questions we spoke to elizabeth warren about this when she was on our program and she said we need to recognize how much of our health care dollars have not gone into health care the system made 23 billion in profits last year she said and that s after all the executive salaries the administrative people the fancy glass office buildings again those are her words what s your take mayor buddy judge on the role of the private sector and the profit motive in health care pete buttigieg well i think it s true that if you look at the united states spending on health care more of our health care dollar goes in to administratively compared to patient care than in almost any other developed country and it shows you a lot of the problems with the system we do have the elegance i think of setting up something like medicare for all who want it is it creates a system where you don t have that kind of profit motive you don t have those ways that the dollars leak out of the system which means that the private plans will have to do one of two things they ll either have to get better or they ll go away and i think that s one of the reasons why the private health insurance lobby has been fighting against my plan pete buttigieg but i think they don t want the competition laura knoy what is wrong with the affordable care act in your opinion some candidates among them joe biden have said let s just strengthen the affordable care act pete buttigieg well the affordable care act was a leap forward in health care in this country and this is personal for me there are members of my family who are a matter of fact and i are figuring out this month since i m about to end my time as mayor how to get our insurance on the exchange it has extended health insurance to millions of americans but we would not be having this debate if the health care issue in this country we ve solved there are still uninsured americans there are under insured americans and moving beyond the the insurance part there are also a lot of things we ve got to do on the cost side and other deficiencies in our health care system i don t think most americans believe that the journey to of health care reform ended with the aca the aca was a good move we should defend it the republican efforts to attack it should be resisted but it s clearly not been enough we need to go further laura knoy speaking of costs remind me again the number that you said your plan would cost pete buttigieg we scored at 1 5 over the course of the decade laura knoy ok so where does that money come from pete buttigieg so there are two parts of my tax plan that between them would cover that cost and then some one of them is that we ve got to reverse the corporate rate cut in the trump tax cuts that move alone would raise 1 4 trillion dollars over the next decade a second thing is that we will gain hundreds of billions of dollars part of which i would use to fill that gap between 1 4 and 1 5 simply by allowing medicare to negotiate drug prices with companies selling prescription drugs there are several moves we can make that will lead to savings to the treasury just by having these common sense reforms in the way we handle health care in the country one of the things i m making sure to do is whenever i propose an investment and from health care to other things i m saying we ought to do there is a price tag that we re also going to be candid about revenue we don t have to go back to eisenhower era levels of taxation to pay for these initiatives but we are going to have to raise more revenue from corporations and the wealthy which we should because the share of tax revenue and the tax burden that has fallen on corporations and wealthy has gone down over the years and i think that s directly related to the increase in income inequality in our country laura knoy how concerned are you that if you increase the corporate tax rate again and i know this has gone back and forth in recent years that american companies will say you know what we think we ll just settle in ireland instead or some other country pete buttigieg so here s the thing we ve had lower we have had robust economic growth under periods where we did have fairer taxation higher taxation of the wealthy and corporations pete buttigieg yes we also need to undertake improvements to our tax system and by the way our tax enforcement system so that there is not the incentive to offshore profits there are ways we could do that and making sure that we just plain enforced better and close loopholes the idea that that a company like amazon that profits billions of dollars a year pays less in federal income tax than anybody in this room specifically zero shows you that the system is broken and we have got to take actions to address that in order to fund the things that we need from health care to investments in roads and bridges education and so on laura knoy i want to ask you about one more issue where you ve had some differences with fellow democrats mayor buttigieg and that s paying for college has been a lot about this in the news this week as you know some candidates are proposing free tuition for public universities for everyone your plan from what i understand would make public tuition free for all families earning up to a hundred thousand and provide substantial subsidies for students from families earning up to one hundred and fifty thousand pete buttigieg that s right laura knoy kind of the same question all told again how much might all this cost and where does the money come from pete buttigieg so again we can fund all of that it is hundreds of billions of dollars laura knoy it s a lot of students and a lot of college it is a lot of professors you got to pay pete buttigieg and and it s worth it because we need to make sure that cost is never a barrier to somebody who wants to go to college where i differ with senator sanders and senator warren is when you do get north of that 150 when you re in that top 10 percent that s where i think it s ok to ask people to pay their own tuition and i would rather use those dollars in other areas like some of the plans i put forward around supporting the trades and apprenticeships and workforce development and education for folks who won t get a four year college degree but again we can pay for these things with some commonsense changes look we ve got to reform capital gains taxation in this country with mark to market and taxing those profits in a way that s consistent with how we tax income otherwise we re going to continue to be in this world where as warren buffett has famously commented the united states taxes him at a lower rate than his secretary and it doesn t make any sense most americans get that it doesn t make any since we re gonna fix it laura knoy what incentive would colleges have to keep their own costs down if most students and i think you ve said about 80 percent would be covered if most students were getting their educations paid for what incentive would colleges have to not just you know charge exorbitantly high prices pete buttigieg well this is an important part of the policy design which has to center around a state and federal partnership where the federal funding is available to states at a level high enough that you would not see them passing it up but with enough strings attached to make sure that this doesn t just turn into more costs being pushed through the system we ve got to control the underlying costs too with guardrails and measures to do that but a well designed federal grant program as we ve seen time and time again can do that with the states laura knoy we heard from a voter at one of your events yesterday mayor buttigieg who said she worries her family s income wouldn t quite qualify for aid under your plan but she said her family still struggled to afford college and as you know a hundred thousand dollars in some states is a very comfortable income and other high cost states like new york or california one hundred thousand dollars isn t so comfortable so how much should this be taken into account do you think pete buttigieg so i do think that as part of the policy design we should look at regional differences it s also worth mentioning that there are a lot of things we can do to make college more affordable on the front and the back end so for those who are taking on loans we could have a more generous program for forgiving loans for those who go into public service for example and we re going to continue with income based debt repayment so that if your income is not enough you can have payments according to that and eventually have them waived after a certain number of years all of that stays in place this is about making college dramatically more affordable than it is today laura knoy one quick point that s been made mayor buttigieg and i know you ve heard this is that hey we offer public schools k through 12 to everyone regardless of income so some are asking why not expand that concept to public universities make it free for everyone rich kids can attend public schools they should be able to attend tuition free public college what do you think pete buttigieg i just think it s more progressive to reserve those benefits for those who would benefit the most from it look we have a lot of federal programs and spending the earned income tax credit for example that are targeted and certainly k through 12 education should be free especially because we expect every single american we hope to at least finish 12th grade what s not true is that every single american wants to go to college if you do we should make sure cost isn t a barrier but if you don t we should make sure that you prosper look we ve had a lot of conversation rightly about making it more affordable to go to college in our country where i come from three out of four people don t have a college degree and we should be just as intentional about making it affordable to not go to college in this country and that s why we ve got a lot of work to do not just around apprenticeships trade education career and technical education but also just the cost of living a higher minimum wage and empowering workers in unions so that you can prosper in this country you can afford to to be generous and live well whether you have a college degree or not lauren chooljian we received a lot of questions about your resumé and one thing that came up was your time at mckinsey and company obviously that s a very newsy topic well you never talk about it really you hardly talk about on the campaign trail i saw you yesterday it didn t come up can you explain why that is pete buttigieg well i talked about it i wrote about it in my book and it s very true of my experience pete buttigieg but look the bulk of my experience has been in public service so i worked at a consulting company mckinsey for about two and a half years after i finished school learned a lot there but walked away from that knowing that my call what really fired me up was public service and that s what i chose to do for our city as mayor and and in military service as well so what i would say is that it s it s certainly a part of my background that is useful in understanding the business world but the bulk of my adult life has been in serving my city and serving my country lauren chooljian well what did you learn while you were there that you think that could be helpful in government i mean there s been stories lately about some contracts or some work that mckinsey has done with the government that some have found to be very controversial this story but ice that came out this week so i m wondering you know what did you learn in that experience that would be helpful pete buttigieg well i did math for a living so i learned a lot about math pete buttigieg we were talking about some of the issues on taxation for example and what we have to do in order to make sure that when we go out and make a promise and try to set a policy that is going to be to the benefit of working americans and middle class americans as well as making sure that we alleviate poverty that we do the math right so that we ensure that the taxation is falling appropriately on the wealthiest americans and corporations i learned a lot about how to organize teams to to get work based on the teams that i was on and i also frankly learned a lot about the amoral turn of mind that increasingly dominates corporate america and we see it there at least four times i can think of in the decades since i left that company that i ve opened up the newspaper and seen an infuriating story about something that they did with one of their clients where it s clear that they didn t seem to feel any moral weight to the decisions they were making this is true in the case of ice i mean the reports are disgusting about basically viewing cost cutting as something that should extend to cutting basic needs for for people who are being detained and i think it s a reminder that no matter how nice the people are in in business or in corporate america it s up to us as a democracy to set the rules pete buttigieg the left and right boundaries the guardrails for them to operate in because the profit motive is not going to lead to ethical actions that don t lead to profit unless we establish as a matter of policy what companies can and can t do and the drift away from regulating business from regulating corporations which has been going on really my entire lifetime i mean this began with the reagan era is directly related in my view to the mounting economic and political inequality that we re seeing in the country that is driving us close to a breaking point lauren chooljian the last thing i want to ask about this is there have been calls from other candidates that you re not being transparent because you re not talking about the clients that you work with i mean do you understand why that would be the case especially when we re in a situation where the president gets criticized all the time for not releasing information about himself do you feel like that s a fair criticism pete buttigieg well i strongly believe in transparency pete buttigieg it s one of the reasons why i have released tax returns from when i got back from school and not all of my competitors have been willing to do that and i also believe that mckinsey should release the client list of the clients that i said something they can do it s something they can do yeah i mean they know i made a promise i keep my word you know when you come you you promise to keep your client information confidential but right now i am calling on mckinsey to release that information maybe they re not used to doing that but they re not used to having somebody who used to work there being seriously considered for the american presidency this information should come out and i m happy to speak to it when it does lauren chooljian so i want to talk also about your time in south bend obviously this is a big part of your life as you said and we have quite a lot of questions from people one from mary that said mayor the president is a big jump another person asked why would being mayor make you such a good candidate for president what s your response to that concern you heard this yesterday pete buttigieg look going from any job to president is a big jump right turns out we re talking about the presidency pete buttigieg and yet i think i might not be getting that question if i were a senator because we re just more used to people with washington experience running for president and yet if you think about it in our country you could be a very senior u s senator and have never in your life managed more than 100 people depending what you re doing before leading a city of any size is one of being responsible not only for policy like legislators are but management running an administration and not only management like many people in various offices but guiding a population and the moral weight of an office where you were responsible for calling a community to its highest values that might actually be the part of president the presidency whose absence is costing us the most as a country today laura knoy and we ll follow up on that after a short break coming up more with democratic presidential candidate mayor pete buttigieg stay with us laura knoy this is the exchange i m laura knoy today it s the latest in our presidential primary 2020 candidate forum series and this hour we re talking with democrat pete buttigieg and nhpr s lauren chooljian is also with me and lauren i ll bring it back to you lauren chooljian so maybe just before the break we re talking about your time in south bend of course and so you ve received a lot of credit for the turnaround in south bend a lot of growth has happened there but the benefits as you well know have not been felt equally by white and black residents and that in your city right the details that came out of a report that you had commissioned say that economic inequality between african american and white households is worse than it is nationwide so what should you have done differently pete buttigieg well that s not a problem that began when i became mayor but it is a problem that we attacked from the moment i became mayor as you mentioned those numbers from an audit that i ordered up this problem began in the 1960s well of course racial inequality began long before that but many of the economic struggles of our city were set off by the collapse of studebaker in 1963 that was our biggest we were a company town for an auto company and believe it or not some 50 years later that was still the defining experience of our city we lost population we lost jobs and as across the country there has been particular economic pain and exclusion for african american residents in our city so we were very intentional about acting on that making sure that we directed resources and dollars to neighborhoods including neighborhoods that people had been redlined into and making sure that they saw the benefit of spending on improvement we acted to make sure that we were creating jobs and investment in the city and that s one of the reasons why you saw unemployment rates and poverty rates in particular for the african american community but across the city falling on my watch at a pace that i don t think we ve seen before there s no question that there is work to do in our city and in every community in america to further act to close those wealth gaps and those wealth and income gaps we ve got to recognize aren t going to go away on their own even when you replace a racist policy with a neutral one in the same way that accumulated wealth compounds these inequalities will compound if we are not intentional on doing something about it we ve done it in our way with the resources we ve had as a city but i m also determined and this is a feature of the frederick douglass plan we ve put forward in the campaign to use the powers of the presidency to ensure that this whole country is mending what was broken laura knoy so speaking of experience i want to ask about your military experience you ve been very careful to call yourself a veteran not a combat veteran you spent about seven months in afghanistan what did you do there pete buttigieg so i worked for was called the afghanistan threat finance cell basically my job had to do with blocking the flow of funding into the insurgency largely coming from narcotics activities now in practice probably the most important responsibility i had was driving a vehicle i was one of a couple of people in kabul with my unit who is qualified with with a long gun with them for and in order for the my commander to go anywhere there had to be at least two in a vehicle and so we joked that i was military uber so by night i d be doing a lot of work with message traffic or analysis because that was my training as an intelligence person but by day a lot of the time over 100 times my job was to just get somebody outside of the wire and back in from point to point either around the city of kabul or occasionally traveling between kabul and bagram on the open road laura knoy some presidential candidates have said if elected they d pull u s troops out of afghanistan within the first year they ve set up timetables others have said no timetables depends on what s happening on the ground i m really interested in your answer on this question because you did spend some time in afghanistan which camp do you kind of put yourself in pete buttigieg we re leaving we ve got to leave and the one thing i think that republicans democrats the afghans and international community can all agree on is that it s the u s needs to move on the question is do we do it well or do we do it poorly look we need to leave sooner rather than later because i thought i was one of the last guys turning out the lights when i left and that was years ago now we also have to do it in a responsible fashion what does that mean well i don t think that we can accept responsibility for afghanistan becoming a thriving western style democracy anytime soon but we do have a responsibility to make sure first of all that it can never again be used as a place for an attack on the american homeland and secondly that there is not an immediate collapse of the gains that have been made laura knoy so what does that mean pete buttigieg well what it means is a negotiated settlement that involves the taliban but also crucially that involves the elected afghan government which is sometimes being left on the sidelines of this conversation it means drawing down our large scale presence but honestly it is likely going to mean for some time a minimal highly capable presence of special operations and intelligence personnel to ensure that there is not an attack on the homeland and by the way what we had in syria what the president removed but what we had in northern syria demonstrates the ability of a tiny number of highly specialized personnel to prevent bad outcomes that is probably the medium term destination in order to end our large scale ground troop presence on the ground in afghanistan which we must do quickly laura knoy so since we re going into foreign policy let s talk a little bit more about that lots of threats and challenges out there as i m sure you know what would you say may be to judge america s greatest foreign policy challenge is right now recognizing that there are many pete buttigieg yes i mean we can go down the list to the china challenge stateless terrorism cyber security global climate change which i consider to be a global security threat let me say this the top job of the next president will be to restore u s credibility when it comes to foreign policy the top job will be to restore u s credibility around the world and that is not going to be an easy thing to do given what s happened the spectacle of seeing not just at a cocktail party but in the general assembly the american president being laughed at not only hurts my gut as an american but it hurts american national security laura knoy so how do you do it pete buttigieg well first of all you ve got to make sure that the u s is actually leading with our values the strategic advantage of the united states has always been not only the capabilities of our military and the strength of our economy but the fact that when we are at our best we are living out and promoting values that are felt around the world the desire for human rights and support for democracy that s why it matters for example that when people in hong kong are speaking up standing up for their democratic rights that they hear some at least some kind of moral support from the president of the united states pete buttigieg and when you don t have that kind of moral leadership when we re not leading with our values what we see is not only a lot of misbehavior and throwing weight around by our strategic competitors like russia or china but also among our allies like saudi arabia and turkey behavior that would not be happening if we were leading in a way that recognized the inseparable ability of american interests and american values another thing a lot of this is what you don t do right so we also just need a president who will not undermine our most closely held allies and who will be seen to be leading on the biggest challenges that the world faces climate is a good example climate is an issue that the u s cannot solve alone because only a fifth of the emissions it s also an issue that the world cannot solve without u s leadership because we re the biggest economy laura knoy and i ve got a whole bunch of questions on climate pete buttigieg okay good but for now all i ll say is that if we are seen to be authentically and effectively leading on that issue it s one of the best chances we have in the 21st century to also reclaim our moral and global leadership authority as a country lauren chooljian yeah sticking with that i mean i want to talk about military spending how as president would you determine the adequate level of military spending and do you think we need to increase or decrease the current department of defense budget pete buttigieg well i think it has to be suited to our security needs so it s not just how much in a blanket way it s where s the spending going right now there s a lot of evidence that china s being a lot more intentional and putting more resources for example into artificial intelligence than we are if they get ahead of us on artificial intelligence then some of the most expensive bases and ships that we re building are going to just be bigger targets so a lot of this is making sure that our spending decisions are driven by our security priorities in the 21st century now the president s idea of security priorities is mostly 17th century right he s talking about a moat full of alligators he s talking about building a big wall these are the security technologies of the middle ages and it shows we also need to make sure that it s rational based on what we need to do across the board as a country to be competitive and to be successful and to be secure education public education funding public education is a national security imperative you don t get to meet manhattan project without having a superior level of education in the united states even with the folks that we recruited to help from other countries and it s a reminder of what could happen if we fall behind in that regard so it requires being prioritized there s no easy or across the board answer but i will say that there s a lot of evidence and you see this when you re in uniform that spending is not aligned around top priorities and when it comes to contracting and the interface with the military what the president eisenhower called the military industrial complex it s also clear that there need to be stronger mechanisms to make sure there s actual value for taxpayer dollars lauren chooljian i understand prioritizing but you re looking at the budgets that both parties are presenting right now and the spending that could be on defense is could be reportedly more than any point since world war two what s the ceiling i guess pete buttigieg so again i don t think you can set arbitrary numerical targets on this i do think we need to review every area of u s military posture and ask whether it s really serving american interests and we should be able to find real savings when we realign it around what to do although in order for that to happen we also need to go through some political reforms as a country that has allowed washington to be captured by a number of corporate interests and you certainly see that in the defense industry lauren chooljian last military related thing i wanted to ask you yesterday you got a question when we were in henniker you got a question from a veteran who is drafted and he had asked you about service and you brought up this plan that you have to have more paid service jobs and one question i have for you that we didn t really hear was is there ever a point in which you think that we do need mandatory service in this country and could you say specifically the kinds of jobs that you would pay for under this service plan pete buttigieg yeah i think it s better if it s voluntary but if we get it right then it could become such a norm that everybody does it and that s the idea of creating a million paid voluntary service opportunities a year now the reason it matters that they be paid is that we also can have service be a luxury that if you can afford to you can go off and for a year have an unpaid internship or volunteer experience i want every american to have a shot at that and what we know from the acceptance rates in americorps in the military in the peace corps which are often less than a quarter is there are way more americans ready to serve than those who get the chance if we create and fund service opportunities that every person for example when they come of age could do a year in service then what would happen is when you re applying for your first job or college whatever is next for you the first question you get is where did you serve what did you learn and the virtue of that is in creating a shared experience among americans what does the actual work look like well i m proposing that we create a climate corps because there are a lot of projects i just swore in some americorps and vista volunteers in south bend we are working on things like weatherizing the homes of low income seniors that helps with climate and in a lot of other areas there should be an intergenerational corps that is about preparing for the aging of our population and unlocking what older americans have to contribute there should be a community health corps which can help with issues of mental health addiction and help cultivate young people s interests in that field because we re headed for even more of a care worker and provider shortage than we have right now but some of the specific projects should be developed by the communities not only answers have to come out of washington i just think more the funding should come from washington lauren chooljian so these are not you know i m going to help americorps i m going to see a church that already has a fellowship program for service these are creating brand new positions pete buttigieg no this can absolutely and should interface with expansions in programs that we have like americorps like peace corps the point is to make sure that we have as many different avenues as possible but that we fund people s ability to be in them lauren chooljian gotcha let s make a big switch over to gun violence i want to talk about this because this is something that your city has been grappling with in a very serious way 2019 could be potentially the most violent year in south bend s recent history public safety is a huge part of being mayor how do you explain that do you feel this is a failing of your leadership pete buttigieg so rates of homicide are lower than they were when i was growing up in south bend but we have seen ups and downs and to me they re not numbers these are stories that impact families that i know often i know the names of the family members who were affected pete buttigieg the worst part of being mayor is when you are dealing with violent death and i can walk you through the steps that we ve taken that i think help explain why it has remained lower than it was a generation ago through these ups and downs but the reality is yes we re doing a number of initiatives that i am proud of in terms of especially dealing with gang and group related gun violence and working with some of the people who were most at risk for being involved in violent crime and when you see someone who used to be involved in a violent gang standing up taller because we have connected them with an opportunity to get training and get a job and walk out of that life it is one of the most hopeful things i ve seen but that s no consolation to somebody who loses a young person to gun violence what i ve found is that mayors like me and around the country are fighting this issue with a hand tied behind our back because what we re not able to do is anything about the guns themselves and the state laws and national laws are preventing us from facing up to the very simple fact that we re the only country the only country in the developed world that has not only such routine mass shootings but also the level of day to day gun violence that doesn t grab the headlines but that causes such heartbreak in communities like mine and it s why we need common sense gun reform pete buttigieg and by the way most americans support this most republicans most gun owners believe we ought to at least be doing universal background checks believe in red flag laws ways to disarm domestic abusers and identify when somebody is a danger and help deal with the crisis of gun suicide which gets less attention than than other forms of gun violence but is a big part of the problem and can be addressed lauren chooljian but those gun policy positions that you just brought up i mean these things have been kicked around for years and years your city struggles with gun violence ownership of that problem is part of this and also you know how are you going to solve this problem in a way that nobody else has been able solve it before pete buttigieg well what we know is that even compared to a decade ago we have a strong american majority even among republicans and among gun owners to take steps that would save thousands of lives the question is how do we engage and galvanize not blow up that majority and the things that i think are turning the tide right now are first of all the moral authority of young people i mean when i go to an event and someone not old enough to vote asks a question at least half the time i know it s going to be about gun violence and when a child is asking you what are you doing to keep me safe it arouses a voice in the back of your head i think for any adult that says don t let this kid down and i see now a generational alliance of moms demand action and folks my parents age and kids not yet old enough to vote taking to the streets that is changing the power dynamic on this issue in america and i am convinced that a good use of a president s time is to go into the home state of a senator say like mitch mcconnell who is blocking common sense gun safety measures that are popular even in conservative areas and demand they explain to their voters why they re standing in the way i am convinced we can have a breakthrough on this issue in this decade laura knoy what feels too far many democrats are proposing some of the ideas that you just put out there are there ideas that you ve heard on the campaign trail that feel too far in terms of gun restrictions pete buttigieg i think we know that that we need universal background checks we know that red flag laws can make a huge difference we know that we need to do something about the sale of assault weapons and the kinds of weaponry that i trained on in the military that nobody can explain why they would belong anywhere near a school in peacetime getting at that is challenging because you ve got to draw a line somewhere laura knoy so where is the line are there proposals that feel that could be an infringement on second amendment to you pete buttigieg right now i m focused on the things we can do because we are so far from there s a line somewhere we are nowhere near that line right now in the debate or in the laws of this country if we re getting close we can we can debate it but you know there are some people who say there s no line at all they say that any restriction on guns violates the wording of shall not be infringed in the second amendment pete buttigieg but we know that that argument doesn t hold water for the simple reason that we ve already decided as a country everybody can have a slingshot nobody can have a nuclear weapon right we know there s a line somewhere we can quibble over some of the details on that line but it must be drawn tighter than it is today laura knoy coming up more of our conversation with mayor pete buttigieg we ll talk about climate and a whole bunch of other issues so stay with us this is the exchange on new hampshire public radio laura knoy this is the exchange i m laura knoy today our series of primary 2020 candidate forums continues with democratic presidential candidate pete buttigieg nhpr s lauren chooljian is with me as well we re both asking questions of mayor buttigieg and mayor buttigieg you mentioned earlier climate change and i d like to ask you a couple of questions about the environment and climate the environment first water contamination this is a big concern as i m sure you know four new hampshire communities whose water was polluted with toxic chemicals known as pee fast i m guessing this is a problem in your area of the country too we all remember the headlines from flint michigan lead in the water how would you approach this problem mayor buttigieg of the need for clean safe drinking water it seems to me this is a rising concern pete buttigieg well when you re a mayor you are in the clean safe drinking water business and it s something that you re not supposed to even have to think about it s something that people should be able to take for granted the moment you can t take it for granted it s a crisis as we ve seen in the disaster in flint which is a moral disaster it s a disaster of economic and racial justice and it s an example of why we ve got to take care of the basics in this country when we talk about infrastructure people we usually talk about the sexy stuff the roads bridges bullet trains that kind of thing a lot of our most important infrastructure in this country is underground and so first we have to make sure that we have excellent infrastructure for dealing with things we need to live like water secondly is dealing with pollution and it begins with the awareness that personnel is policy that we need somebody in charge of the environmental protection agency who believes in protecting the environment rather than a coal company lobbyist and some of this stuff is abundantly simple we need the epa to be empowered to enforce we need to make sure that i mean right now you see the trump administration rolling back protections on clean air on clean water when we know that these pollutants are harmful in so many ways so we need to tighten the standards but just as importantly we need enforcement mechanisms that focus on outcomes in terms of water quality laura knoy well and i know asking a mayor about water pipes and all that that s golden for you i came across something in the south bend tribune mayor buttigieg that said your city has been trying to reduce pollution in the st joseph river that there was a court settlement over this resulted in a 700 million plan to improve the infrastructure that you talked about now though according to the paper that plan s been scaled back to about 200 million can you get the same result mayor buttigieg spending 500 million dollars less pete buttigieg this is one of the things i m proud of i promise i won t take up the whole show with this i m very proud of this and it s an example of what i m talking about by do we measure success by the outcome or do we measure it by how much how much money goes into it pete buttigieg so under my plan laura knoy that s the mckinsey consultant talking again pete buttigieg okay fine but what are we actually getting done so my predecessor signed off on a an agreement with the epa this is happening in tons of cities around especially the midwest about how to separate our sewers i won t take you into the finer points of wastewater management but the point is you have to make changes to like 100 year old sewer systems or else untreated water goes into the river sometimes which is unacceptable question is how do you do it and the original plan was going to cost we realized a billion dollars pete buttigieg now our city the per capita personal income is roughly 20 000 per person and a billion dollars means ten thousand dollars for every man woman and child in the city and the only way to get that funding since there there s no federal funding to do this work is from rates that are assessed on low income people so we knew that we had to find a way to get the same result with less pain for ratepayers pete buttigieg and we took two steps one was to make sure that we had relief for low income ratepayers but the other was to actually find better ways to solve the problem through technology and what we learned is that we can use and again i should give credit to my predecessor who did the first round of technology deployment on this and then we ve developed it on my watch but we partnered with the university in our backyard to develop technology that gave us the most intelligent wastewater system in the world and what it s allowed us to do is better manage the flow it s like traffic down there you got to make sure that stuff flows in the right way and when you do you re less likely to get an overflow and that means less pollution laura knoy so i ve heard about smart electrical grids this is smart kind of sewer grids pete buttigieg yeah pete buttigieg and i know i sound like a geek getting into this laura knoy no and i know mayors love to talk about that s stuff pete buttigieg it s part of what government s all about right pete buttigieg some of it s the big glamorous controversies some of it s just putting your head down finding a better way solving the problem and right now we re in talks with the epa about proving that this will be better environmentally and creating relief for low income ratepayers in south bend laura knoy well let s talk about climate change and again your plan i looked at it the other day emphasizes a lot of approaches that democrats are talking about carbon tax big investments in clean energy energy efficiency but you mayor buttigieg also talk a lot about carbon capture technology this has been called promising but unproven why do you think this is a good idea pete buttigieg well because we need all of the above we need to do everything we can to mitigate carbon to get to be a carbon neutral society by 2050 so where this conversation gets risky is there are some people especially in the so called clean coal conversation let s be clear there s no such thing who say oh well don t worry we can keep putting it in because we ll just figure out a way to take it back out we cannot let ourselves off the hook especially because that technology is unproven but we know there are things that we can do right now that we are doing right now that take carbon out of the atmosphere a good example is the original carbon capture technology which is plants and this is one of the reasons why it s so important to include rural america and agriculture as part of the solution because what you can do with cover crops soil management and other techniques can there are some estimates that would suggest we can take as much carbon out of the atmosphere just using soil as the entire global transportation sector puts it and so as we move to make sure less carbon is going in we should also pursue every strategy we can think of to get it out because there while there are some things we can act on very quickly we can double clean energy on the grid by 2025 we can move very quickly toward electric vehicles pete buttigieg there are some things some industrial processes and ships and planes that are still going to exist 10 20 30 years from now that we re going to have to figure out ways to offset what they do laura knoy does carbon capture this emphasis mayor buttigieg get americans off the hook for decreasing their fossil fuel consumption individuals companies oil producers you know we can all say hey we re just going to bury it or suck it up so let s just keep spewing it out right now pete buttigieg it s too late maybe 50 years ago somebody could have said i m sure technology will catch up we are in crisis mode right now and so this cannot be an excuse to let up one bit on preventing emissions from going into the atmosphere both through newer technologies that are less polluting and through regulation and taxation of what we have that s why we can t solve this problem without a carbon tax laura knoy last very quick question on this the role of nuclear power mayor buttigieg in your ideal energy future again given climate concerns pete buttigieg i view it as a medium term part of the energy mix we should not be turning our back on any carbon free source of power but we know the problems associated with nuclear especially waste storage and removal and so i do not think that adding new nuclear is is an attractive solution laura knoy because we ve talked to a lot of environmentalists who say nuclear is the only way out of this pete buttigieg well certainly we ve got to prioritize carbon because that s the crisis that that s most at hand but i don t think that s the only answer look at what we can do with distributed energy with solar with wind with what s sometimes called the fifth fuel which is energy efficiency and what we do to use less energy in the first place let s find solutions that don t create their own problems and that s the issue with nuclear so we shouldn t be dogmatic about it it s definitely going to be in the mix into the medium term but i don t think it s the way out lauren chooljian i won t ask you about the role of the first in the nation new hampshire primary there s been criticism from other candidates as you well know that this problem that we have that we don t look like the rest of the country means that we shouldn t have such an outsized power in our election process this has always been a criticism from other states now it s coming from other candidates you ve said that there are four states and they provide some balance but i specifically want to hear from you do you think that having such a big thumb on the scale is a problem pete buttigieg well i do think that it s important to have diverse voices from different kinds of states in this early process and that s why the role of south carolina of nevada as well as the role of iowa and of new hampshire lauren chooljian but first is a major you know you can get some serious momentum out of here i m sure you ve looked closely and hope for that yourself so i just wonder if those two states having that power but being not as racially diverse throughout the country is a concern pete buttigieg i think that s why it s so important that other states have a role too and you know the reality is that you cannot get the nomination of our party if you do not build a diverse coalition of supporters and that s gonna be our focus throughout lauren chooljian and as you know building a diverse coalition of supporters has been problematic for you lately you ve been in south carolina recently you ve been making overtures to african american voters there why do you think this has been a struggle for you pete buttigieg well i talked to a lot of voters who have felt both abused by the republican party and sometimes taken for granted by the democratic party and so when reaching out to black voters as somebody who s very much new on the scene there s a lot of work to do to establish not just what s in my plans and the frederick douglass plan has been praised as the most comprehensive plan and strategy for dealing with systemic racial inequality yet put forward by a presidential candidate pete buttigieg it s not just what s in your plans it s who are you what makes you tick what s inside you and i think that my job in this campaign is to make sure that we re reaching out to folks who have no opinion at all or don t feel like they ve gotten to know me yet and ensure that we can answer those questions as well as the policy questions about where we re going to do lauren chooljian so you think it s because you re you re new on the scene that s a big part of it pete buttigieg for example a majority of black voters in south carolina have said that they have no opinion of me obviously that means i got a lot of work to do to make sure that i ve explained who i am as well as what i plan to do lauren chooljian we got a listener question from a woman named jennifer who said i m questioning whether i want another highly privileged caucasian male representing us how will you ensure a balanced perspective in the white house pete buttigieg well balanced is incredibly important to building any team it was a focus of my administration in south bend it s one of the reasons i m proud that my campaign consists of a majority of women and over 40 percent people of color last time i checked and i will build a cabinet that reflects the diversity of experience in our country that includes racial diversity professional diversity regional diversity not only because it s the right thing to do from a justice perspective but because we will make better decisions and it will serve the country better everyone brings their own experiences and their own advantages and disadvantages to this effort i think that there is something to be said for being not only somebody who d be the first lgbt president but the first elected official ever to make the attempt someone who was told at the beginning of the outset of my time in elected office that i should never even dream of national office and while i m mindful of the privileges that go with never having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin while i am mindful of the role of sexism in our politics today i also hope that the historic qualities that so many of the candidates in the race today can bring are not overlooked laura knoy a very quick question for you on new hampshire s role and how it influences the national discussion because we do have this you know like it or not we do have this privileged position new hampshire voters four years ago managed to put the opioid crisis on the forefront for presidential candidates we could talk for half an hour about this mayor buttigieg but i did want to ask you what your approach would be towards this drug addiction crisis that we re seeing here in new hampshire and i know indiana has been hard hit as well how would your approach be different the federal government already has committed a fair bit of money toward combating opioid and drug addiction so what would you do specifically differently pete buttigieg well one of the things we need to know we need do is increase the emphasis on medication assisted treatment mat the remarkable thing about something like opioid addiction is that we know medically the means to diminish that kind of addiction through treatment but not enough providers are qualified or allowed to prescribe it or there are these caps on how many prescriptions someone can write for things like suboxone so we need to expand that we need a harm reduction mentality that i think is starting to filter through but is not all the way there laura knoy like needle exchange and so forth pete buttigieg yes they save lives and there s this idea that you can t have federal funding going to needles but it s just not consistent with what we know about what it takes to reduce the harms associated with injection drug use pete buttigieg i think there s also something deeper behind all of this in addition to all the medical and clinical and addiction interventions we need to undertake and it s asking what is leading people to self medicate there is a crisis of belonging i think in our country right now and we have to account for the fact that the number of deaths from despair is on the rise right now it s a matter of fact if we can cut it in half we will save one million lives over the next decade laura knoy i d like to ask you about that because you just said depths of despair and i ve heard you talk about that and if we can cut those by half and that s certainly a laudable goal but how does a federal government a white house and administration do anything about despair that s kind of profound can federal money actually help reduce despair can federal policy get at that pete buttigieg i would think of it in terms of two levels there is a more concrete easier to describe policy level still not easy but actionable pete buttigieg it s why i ve proposed that we invest billions of dollars in what we re calling healing and belonging grants that go into communities partly to deal with clinical and community based interventions to for example help with peer counseling to help somebody on that journey between when they recover from an overdose and the first time somebody can see them clinically sometimes that s weeks and their lives depend on surviving that period pete buttigieg things like that that they re very clear and very concrete but also anything that a community can do that builds up a sense of belonging different forms of community engagement and experience that federal dollars can help with but there s a different level that is admittedly a little harder to put it put down in black and white it s about the tone that comes from the white house it s about the message that comes from the presidency and the message coming from the white house right now for so many americans in different ways is you don t belong you re not a real american america is not for you and society already creates all these ways of challenging people s sense of belonging over economic status certainly over race gender and sexuality over disability there s so many patterns of exclusion and going back to what we said earlier about being mayor i learned that often i would earn my paycheck as mayor not in the budget or the management decisions i made or the legislation that i signed but in moments when i could call our community to an awareness of itself laura knoy well and you talked about the president and the tone that he sets and i know lauren has one last quick question lauren chooljian yeah obviously yesterday s big news that the house is going to go forward drafting articles and impeachment do you think they re moving too quickly they re trying to get this vote by december and i d also be curious to know if you think that this impeachment trial has further divided the country pete buttigieg i think that most people for better for worse have made up their mind about this already it is a painful process but the president has left congress with no choice but to go through this painful process even if the outcome is likely predetermined in the senate you still have to do it because this is a statement that will reverberate through history this is a statement to future presidents about whether or not congress and america care about abuses of power pete buttigieg but i do believe that at the back end of the impeachment process and the end of the election no matter how we envision the election playing out we re gonna be even more torn up than we are now as a country and that will be a big part of the task of the next president pete buttigieg it s a big part of what i am seeking to address is a country that needs to be unified not in the sense that we ll agree on everything we never will but that there s an understanding even among those who disagree over party or politics that this country belongs to all of us and that it s a better country when all of us know that we belong laura knoy mayor buttigieg we have run out of time i really appreciate you being with us today thank you very much this is the exchange on new hampshire public radio
believe it or not but it is december already barring a surprise christmas rally or a visit from the market grinch we have a reasonably good idea what the calendar year returns for 2019 should be on one level this doesn t matter since most investors financial horizons don t neatly overlap with calendar years unless for instance you retire on december 31 still humans like compartmentalising and we also like looking back december is the season for reflecting after all bonds the all bond index returned 8percent for the first 11 months of the year ahead of cash despite all the negativity after all this year has seen financial media saturated with articles on debt traps downgrades and unfounded fears of imf bailouts why a country that borrows in its own currency would need to turn to the imf was never clearly explained to be clear there is a lot of bad news for the bond market the government s fiscal deficits are increasing not declining and too big to fail eskom is still lurking in the shadows cap in hand for more state support more borrowing means more bond supply which should in theory suppress prices and raise yields the key thing is that the demand for bonds remains healthy due to the attractive yield also the yield is high precisely because of all the bad news which is already priced in by the time you read about something in the newspapers it has long been discounted by financial markets the yield on the 10 year south african government bond declined slightly from 9 6percent to 9 4percent during 2019 the high starting yield means return from income will probably be good even if there is some capital loss if there is a capital gain the returns can be substantial there is also the element of luck global bond yields slumped during the course of the year as investors priced in slower growth and lower interest rates this limited upward pressure on south african yields the other factor limiting the upward pressure on yields is muted inflation consumer prices have been rising at an average annual pace of 4 5percent over the past three years the latest reading was only 3 7percent property listed property had a torrid time buffeted by three broad trends first the local economy is struggling suppressing demand for property even as supply growth new malls office buildings and logistics facilities has been reasonably robust the result is rising vacancies and downward pressure on rents rental income is ultimately what property companies pay out to investors second local companies engage in a number of financial tricks to boost short term distributions these were not repeatable indefinitely and are now unwinding but caused many investors to overestimate future distribution growth third jse listed property has high exposure to uk retail which has taken the twin blows of brexit uncertainty and competition from e commerce the ftse jse all property index returned 1percent in 2019 to date an improvement from last year s 25percent slump the sector trades on a yield of almost 10percent which is attractive but there is still some risk that distributions will decline next year instead of growing as the adjustment to a new reality continues equities depending on your choice of benchmark local equities lost 10 percent in 2018 the first negative calendar year in ten this year has been better with the ftse jse all share index alsi returning 8 5 percent most of this in the first quarter this gain is ahead of cash and represents a real after inflation return of almost 5 percent closer to the historic long term average real return of 7 percent however the real return over the past five years is still basically zero and the index level is still below its january 2018 record high of 61 684 the bounce in the local equity market came despite the lack of discernible improvement in the domestic economy while there has been steady if unspectacular progress on economic policy reform and improved state governance economic activity is not accelerating and business confidence is still depressed the bureau for economic research s business confidence index hit a 20 year low level of 21 points in the second quarter with only a mild improvement in the third quarter but then the local market is largely disconnected from the domestic economy with most of the largest companies being global in nature stand out performers have been the platinum miners both impala and amplats have more than doubled this year from low levels thanks to stronger platinum group metals prices gold miners have also rallied along with the underlying dollar gold price the diversified miners anglo american in particular also had a good year among the global consumer companies british american tobacco and richemont have strongly rallied from 2018 lows naspers the largest company on the jse gained 9percent so far in 2019 but bear in mind it spun off multichoice and listed its internet businesses separately under prosus in contrast financials food producers and clothing retailers all heavily exposed to local conditions have struggled this year during the course of the year the price earnings ratio of the alsi continued to decline and is now at the lowest level since early 2013 compared to global markets whose valuations have increased this year the local market trades at a 10 year low it is therefore not the time to sell out historically buying at such valuations has rewarded patient investors south africans do have more investment options these days however and one should consider the concentrated nature of the local market as a risk factor in particular the top five shares make up 40 percent of the alsi against only 27 percent for the uk ftse 100 14 percent for the us s p 500 and 11 percent for the stoxx europe 600 index four out of the five largest shares in the alsi naspers bhp richemont and anglo american are global companies with only standard bank predominantly focused on south africa speaking of global equities it has been a phenomenal year the s p 500 gained 27 percent in the first 11 months to hit new all time records the stoxx europe 600 returned 25 percent in euros and the nikkei 225 19 percent in yen the msci all countries world index our preferred global equity benchmark covering developed and emerging markets returned 23 percent in dollars world markets have benefited from central bank easing while fears of an all out trade war and global recession have abated but bear in mind that they slumped in the last quarter of 2018 with the s p 500 suffering a 19 5 percent peak to trough decline in the 11 weeks before christmas eve at that point the us federal reserve was still on a hiking path and investors panicked that it would go too far given the weakening economic outlook currency the rand was volatile as always hitting highs of r13 27 and lows of r15 41 against the dollar during the course of the year however at the end of november the rand was only 2 percent weaker against the greenback than at the start of january exchange rate movements therefore provided only a modest boost to the rand based return of global investments hang in there putting this all together a typical balanced portfolio that complies with regulation 28 of the pension funds act could deliver double digit returns this year whereas last year it would have been flat to negative given the decline in inflation the real return which is what really matters has picked up materially from 2018 yet if you pondered your portfolio in january you would probably not have expected much from the coming year global markets had sold off sharply the previous few months and the domestic outlook was as gloomy as ever turning points in markets are unpredictable and one has to stay invested to benefit turning points also tend to happen long before the proverbial dust has settled and there is an observable improvement in economic activity next year is bound to test our patience and willpower

former vice president joe biden who has been on the campaign trail in iowa this week sat down with cnbc s john harwood to discuss a range of topics including trade health care taxes and president donald trump s standing among world leaders biden has lagged behind democratic presidential rivals mayor pete buttigieg and sens elizabeth warren and bernie sanders in recent polls of voters in iowa which will hold the first in the nation nominating contest in february he has consistently led the field in national polling averages here s a transcript of thursday s interview john harwood mr vice president thanks for joining us joe biden thanks for being out here john harwood how s that bus tour had a wild exchange this morning joe biden well that was actually a little bit of fun the fact is that we have a great bus tour we have about 660 miles we re going in day six we ve had a couple thousand people show up they re enthusiastic it was interesting the response of the crowd when that fellow spoke up john harwood let me ask you a little bit about how you get your program passed you ve made the argument that trump s an aberration if you beat him you can then bring things back to normal implement your middle class economic agenda in the way that we ve become used to we re now in a situation where republican senators are repeating what is known to be russian propaganda including propaganda about you how do you bring that back to normal joe biden well i don t hold grudges for real you ve watched me a long time i think a lot of republicans in the senate are really under enormous pressure when you have a republican party and that old joke this ain t your father s republican party saying that a poll showing they think he s better than abraham lincoln you know something s wrong and so i think there s going to be a lot of people who are going to be prepared to deal with things that they know we should be talking about john harwood but to the point about not your father s republican party some of the things on your tax and spending agenda are things that republicans blocked when you were the vice president before trump joe biden yes i agree but now we ve had trump there s two ways people get inspired john they get inspired by inspirational people like john kennedy and they get inspired by very bad people bad presidents like donald trump and what people have now seen is that his tax policy has been a disaster for the middle class disaster for them and that there is plenty of room to be able to do things that make a lot of sense i have always been at the view that the tax policy is not about punishing people it s about giving everybody a shot giving everybody an equal prospect and so when i call for for example there s overwhelming evidence now that the idea that the capital gains tax is promoting growth is just not the case we should charge people the same tax for their capital gains as their tax rate is and i think we should raise the tax rate back to for example i take it back to where it was before it was reduced it could go higher but at 39 5 40 basically if you have that as the capital gains that raises i brought along i m not going to bore you with it but you ve seen it i brought along a graph is how much money each of these things raise john harwood i have seen that graph joe biden but i think they re all realistic now i think that the possibility of saying to people look we ought to start rewarding work as much as we do well and you have a significant number of republicans who aren t multimillionaires thinking that makes a lot of sense john harwood let me go back though to the divisions a few years ago after the affordable care act passed i interviewed president obama and asked him if he was concerned that we re getting divided not just by party and ideology but also by race he said no people are going to say that the affordable care act benefits white and black alike and that is a way that s going to bridge that divide it didn t happen do you think it will be easier for you to do that than it was for him because you re a white man joe biden no john i think it did happen look at the 2018 election i went into 24 states with over 65 candidates on health care the thing about barack was i used to always say to him we ought to take a victory lap on what happened in obamacare he said we don t have time everything but locusts landed on his desk it wasn t until republicans started taking it away that all of a sudden people said whoa i didn t know that that s where i got that from and look what we did we won back 41 seats republican seats in purple and red areas you didn t hear any republicans out there saying i m going to take away your preexisting condition coverage because they figured it out the one thing that trump has done he pulled the band aid off and said this is who i am this is what we ve done whether it s for example the idea that we re in a position where there is no minimum tax on corporations that don t pay anything make billions and billions of dollars where i come from in delaware a lot of republicans do they think whoa that doesn t work that s not fair other corporations don t think it is fair so there s a lot of things that have been exposed now john harwood let me ask you about another aspect of the divide what we ve seen is a geographic divide economically and more diverse better educated more digitally focused cities are doing better higher incomes places like chickasaw county here in iowa are falling behind lesser levels of education and more and more levels of cultural resentment which has been to the benefit of the republican party what do you do about that joe biden well that s also shifted too the president has said trump said he s going to take care of the forgotten man he got elected and forgot them look what chickasaw county out here now basically a conservative area in the past but now all of a sudden they re realizing his foreign policy is killing them killing them his failure to invest in any education is killing them being able to bring teachers the attitude toward rural hospitals is killing them john harwood but we ve seen farmers say i m sticking with the president he s on my side he s giving us aid to compensate joe biden there are going to be people sticking with them remember we lost by about 172 000 votes ok so you don t have to win back you don t have to fundamentally change anything but you ve got to let people know that all the meetings i ve had i ve talked about the incredible opportunity of rural america leading american through the 21st century for real we re the only country in the world that has been able to take grave crises and turn them into real opportunities global warming agriculture is going to be the epicenter of the first and i predict to you the first area of zero net zero carbon because of the way in which the technology s changing where farmers can make a lot of money not just growing and selling their crop but with crop cover with dealing with absorbing carbon with setting up i know is not going to sound good on television but you know there s an awful lot of chicken manure in delaware because it was a big area there s an awful lot of hog manure and cattle well guess what we ve learned now how to pelletize that take out the methane use it for energy and be able to sell this pure stuff that is not damaging the environment abroad we re going to see little factories springing up all over this area or for example ethanol ethanol the salaries ethanol plants are not 15 bucks an hour 45 an hour they ve generated significant economic income john harwood let me ask you about one specific farm issue joe biden sure john harwood farm exports have been hurt by the trade war he s had subsidies to compensate if you become president do those tariffs come off on day one joe biden those tariffs come off in terms of farmers but other tariffs may go on in terms of the violation of the stealing of intellectual property violating wto john harwood so for all the people saying that the tariffs are creating uncertainty and harming the economy you think some of them are justified joe biden well for example on steel dumping it s justified it s justified the excess of steel they dump it at a lower cost it is in fact designed to drive down our steel market and our steel production but the idea of us making the farmer pay for what they ve worked like hell to do provide and have a market in china makes no sense it s not about the trade deficit what it s about is what they re doing unfairly to change world trade rules look we make up 25 of the world s economy when we were prepared to bring our allies with us china has to listen but this time we have to have labor and environmentalist at the table at the table and then what happens is we can begin to once again set the rules of fair trade internationally john harwood on the divide we re talking about sanders and warren have made a case for closing the divide with large universal programs that everybody benefits from given how popular medicare and social security as universal programs are why are they wrong joe biden well because they re not being honest about how much it will cost if you take a look at where the democratic party is and where the american people are they re not supporting medicare for all first of all it s going to take their own admission four to 10 years for it to happen number one it s going to cost between 30 trillion and 40 trillion over 10 years it s not realistic going to raise taxes on middle class people it s the exact opposite of the thing we have to do i have a really bold plan i m taking what obamacare adding a public option to it meaning medicare for people who want to buy into that or if they re already eligible for medicaid they automatically get enrolled i m further subsidizing the plans that exist under obamacare so the largest deduction you d have to pay for a copay would be 1 000 in a gold plan and you re allowed to keep your insurance if you like it john harwood nancy pelosi says medicare for all is not an idea that she s in favor of you re saying it s not a good idea even if you could pass it joe biden well i think it s not a necessary idea theoretically it makes sense on the merits but the fact is there s no way to get it done our entire budget for one year every single thing doesn t add up to what it would cost for medicare for one year it s about whether or not we can do something big that can get done and benefit people the one thing i don t like about the medicare for all there s about 160 million people who ve negotiated and taking pay cuts to get better insurance coverage with their companies and they like it john harwood do you think it is a problem economically politically even morally for democrats to be in a position of offering lots of free stuff joe biden i think there are important things we have to offer for free for people who need basic health care basic education basic needs that relate to how they can live their lives i think for many people that has to be free look he s just cut back on food stamps for god s sake going into christmas john harwood right but you ve seen the objection people say oh those democrats they re just promising this and that joe biden you have to right the market a little bit here if you have all of the tax breaks essentially all the tax breaks all of the benefits flowing through the top one 10th of 1 there s never been as great a concentration of wealth including going back to the great depression ever one of the things that worries me most about that john is the middle class is getting killed the middle class right now is in a position where more than half of them don t think the children will ever have the same standard of living they have john harwood but this is where the sanders and warren wealth tax comes in it polls pretty well critics republicans also some prominent democrats say two things about it two objections one it s not workable and two it s punitive do you agree with both of those objections joe biden parts of the plan those objections apply but here s the deal my view is you have to reform the entire tax code not just have a single tax on a single group of people for example if in fact we re able to and i think we can get it passed make you pay on capital gains clipping coupons your money making money the same rates you pay in your regular taxes if in fact you eliminate a thing called stepped up basis which is not an inheritance tax john harwood that s one of the things that you guys tried and couldn t do under obama joe biden no but we can now once the carny show comes through with the guy with the pea in the shell three shells and there s no pea under any shell the second time it comes around they figure it out they know that there are a number of things that don t make any sense in the tax code punish the working class the middle class and benefit unduly people who in fact don t need those tax cuts and here s the point john it is a political dynamic that allows the demagogues to go out and spread and split the country in two it s not just we need a middle class it s not just being fair it s taking away the argument he s used so well the reason why you re not having your job is not paying as much because of all those immigrants the reason why is and so on and we ve got to end it and there s a way to do it it s within our wheelhouse to be able to do it john harwood treasury secretary mnuchin today said that he opposed a financial transaction tax which some in the race of supported because it would destroy financial markets is that why you ve rejected that idea joe biden no i still think we should do that i think we should have a financial transaction tax but i focused on what i think i could get done get done quickly and pay for everything i m talking about because look the president has increased with his profligate tax cut to the very wealthy the deficit by 1 trillion 900 billion it can t be sustained it can t be sustained and the argument i use when he passed it though when i was against it i was asked to go to the house and speak in the steps of the capitol and what i pointed out was it s all designed to be able to justify doing away with the entire safety net the reason why we have to cut the safety net now is we have this terrible deficit when they controlled the congress before 18 what was the first thing the budget committee do they move to increase taxes on medicare by over 500 billion john harwood but now here s what some democrats are saying they re saying that we ve seen that politically deficits don t matter all that much economically it s actually helped trump s economy in the short term given all that would it be ok with you to increase spending more than the amount you could raise taxes to pay for it joe biden it depends on the circumstance we find ourselves when we get elected look what we had to do we in order to be able to get out of the financial recession which was the greatest recession sort of a depression in american history the president asked me to chair the recovery act which had 900 billion in it and we did it most even conservative economists acknowledged it probably saved us from a depression but what we did at the same time was we were able to invest it in things that in fact grew the economy at the same time that s the exact opposite of what trump has done what he has done hasn t grown the economy it hasn t grown the economy there are circumstances where you have to spend in order to generate economic growth but there has to be a way that you can catch up to that otherwise you end up in a situation where you have to make terrible terrible choices john harwood do you still favor the balanced budget amendment that you voted for in 1995 joe biden no because we re in a different place now i hope it s not true but we re likely to inherit a recession at least a significant economic slowdown that doesn t make sense john harwood do you think that vote was a mistake joe biden no not then everything s context one of the reasons i like giving an interview with you is you know the context i m not being a wise guy 1995 was a very different place than we find ourselves today this is about how do we grow the economy for example it makes a lot of sense that we say that ok why is it if you give a charitable contribution i won t say you i mean you editorially someone in the 20 tax bracket gets to take a 20 break for that well somebody who is in the 40 tax bracket they in fact get to deduct 40 of it well why is that what does that do i limit for example no tax break that you get no deduction can you take that s more than what 28 john harwood another thing obama tried to do couldn t get done joe biden but we ll get it done because things have changed john harwood right a couple of economic points quickly cause i know our time is short sen warren came out today with a new proposal on limiting mega mergers looking back on your time in the obama administration do you think you guys were too slack on antitrust enforcement and that concentration among big corporations is a big economic problem joe biden it is a big economic problem and one of the things that i ve said i would do as president is set up within the justice department an entire new entity to go back and look at the mega mergers that have occurred and those who that are being proposed to occur there s a lot of concentration of power and make a judgment whether or not it made sense for that to happen one of the things that always happens from one administration to the next even within the same party is you go back and you look at the consequences and what was done there s too much concentration of power and i don t disagree with elizabeth s point how we go about making that judgment remains to be seen i don t think you go about and making judgment by picking a particular company i think you talk about what happened when we concentrated the power john harwood do you think you guys should have done more in the obama administration joe biden look remember everything landed on the president s plate but locusts we finally got to the place where we got not only the car out of the ditch and kept from going over the cliff we put new tires on it we began to tune the engine it was running 40 miles an hour we were ready to make it run faster we lost the democrats lost the election and so we re faced with a different problem now how do we go back and regain the momentum that we d gotten going there s a lot of things you can go back in every administration and say well maybe would have done something differently but at the moment there wasn t much else that could be done at that time john harwood president trump has been very strong in ripping fed chair powell do you think powell is doing a good job and is he the kind of person you would keep or put on the fed joe biden i m not going to get into the personalities but i do say this the president should not be trying to pressure the fed we did not do that that s supposed to be an independent entity out here it s just like how he pressures the military and intervenes in the chain of command it s his way of abusing power across the board it s a big mistake a big mistake and i would not do that john harwood you ve got an ad out today that says the world s laughing at president trump very strong ad on the wake of this recent nato meeting and the president trump responded not directly to the ad but he said all we found over there was deep respect for the united states in the meeting do you think he actually believes that or do you think that privately he fears that he s being mocked ridiculed that he s not respected joe biden how could he not know that how could he not know that he turned around and he called the prime minister of canada two faced he turned around the idea he doesn t know that i mean look this president thinks if he says the lie long enough and often enough and repeats it enough somehow people will believe it look the reason why is just i m not happy that the president of the united states got mocked but what it says is we lack the respect of the rest of the world that we had in spades before john harwood well here s the related question that if he does know and the question is does he care i ask for this reason first of all you may remember john kerry who endorsed you today got mocked in 2004 as being too french a couple of the people in those videos where emmanuel macron and justin trudeau do you think as an elite non elite matter he doesn t care joe biden i don t think it s about being elite i think it s about being smart or not so smart i think it s about being mean spirited or not mean spirited it s about coddling russia is trying to break up europe and nato or sticking with our friends john harwood that s the point i was getting to those people in that video were leaders of nato vladimir putin wants nato weakened and divided nancy pelosi today when she was announcing the drafting of articles of impeachment said that in essence the russia of 2016 scandal and the ukraine scandal are different pieces of the same story that all roads lead to putin do you see it that way yourself joe biden i do in europe absolutely positively i know putin i ve had private time with putin i ve looked in his eyes as they say this is a guy who had one overarching desire to break up nato and to have america pull away from europe the euro atlantic alliance because that s the one thing he cannot penetrate if it s strong but if you have 28 nations all going their own way he becomes significantly more powerful and what happens when you live next door to the bear and you don t have anybody protecting you and doesn t have that shotgun out to make sure the bear doesn t get you then in fact you begin to make accommodations john harwood and why do you think president trump wants to help him joe biden i don t think the president of the united states today has any notion of geopolitical concerns i remember he said seriously a couple of months into his administration you know this job s harder than running a real estate empire he knows nothing about foreign policy he knows nothing about nuclear deterrent he knows nothing i actually privately encouraged a number of generals senior state department people foreign policy experts to stay in the administration don t leave look what s happened john harwood but is your judgment then that it s ignorance that he doesn t understand geopolitics as opposed to he is purposely helping russia and putin because he s compromised in some way joe biden all i know is the results are the same i can t read his mind he has done things that seem to me to be completely contrary to reality when he stands before in the whole world at a g 20 meeting and says that i believe vladimir putin did not interfere in our elections and these 18 intelligence agencies that work for us in fact do they think he did but i think they re wrong what is that about john harwood that s the question joe biden i don t know but the result is the same it has drastically weakened our standing around the world poll came out not long ago gallup and pew showing that we ranked just below china in respect and just above russia what s going on look when we are not leading we ve led the world by the example not just of our power but the power of our example there s three things i ve learned i ve learned vladimir putin doesn t want me to be president that s why he s spending a lot of money on these bots trying to tell any lies about me i ve learned that kim jong un thinks i am a rabid dog should be beaten to death with a stick and he gets a love letter from trump and i learned that donald trump doesn t want me to be the nominee this president is the most unusual politician i ve ever worked with and he doesn t seem to have any sense of who we are he s ripping the soul out of this country he really is i sometimes sit back and wonder whoa i don t know whether well i shouldn t speculate because i don t know to be honest

the pioneer graham towers 1934 1954 mr towers was very much a man about town when at 37 he was named the world s youngest central bank chief and set about to build the bank of canada from scratch with his wife molly he lived the high life in ottawa as part of the establishment born in september 1897 he studied economics at mcgill university served as a supply officer in the first world war and on the advice of stephen leacock was hired by royal bank of canada from there he was tapped as the first governor of the bank of canada whose shares at the time were owned by the public though it would be nationalized during his tenure which ran until early 1955 almost the end of three terms these were different times central banking was new to canada the bank s policy rate was fixed and commercial bank lending rates were capped thus there was trouble in trying to strike a grand vision it was the war effort that helped pull canada out of its economic malaise ho the canadian press
expand eddie adams ap photo proponents of the free market such as nobel winning economist milton friedman pictured in 1977 continue to influence theory and policy the economists hour false prophets free markets and the fracture of society by binyamin appelbaum little brown the great reversal how america gave up on free markets by thomas philippon harvard university press since the 2008 financial crisis the once stellar reputation of the economics profession has fallen into disgrace not only had the discipline s heavy hitters mostly failed to foresee the crash indeed in 2002 ben bernanke famously said such things were no longer possible many subsequently backed a policy of austerity that is spending cuts and tax increases to reduce the budget deficit which dramatically slowed the post crisis recovery in both europe and the united states it turns out that the hegemonic belief within economics that markets generally work best when left to themselves was catastrophically mistaken since then there has been a gradual reconsideration of attitudes within economics with insurgents like thomas piketty contesting the pre crisis hegemonic view a pair of books one by a critical outsider one by a practicing insider makes for a nice window into the profession s brain to see how far the process has gone the former is the economists hour false prophets free markets and the fracture of society by new york times economics reporter binyamin appelbaum the latter is the great reversal how america gave up on free markets by nyu professor thomas philippon they reveal that while economics has come a great distance since 2008 the bankrupt pre crisis ideology still holds too much sway appelbaum s excellent book covers much history of economic policy but at bottom it is about politics and ideology it s a truism today to recognize that after the great depression and the shattering world war it spawned classical liberalism and traditional laissez faire economics were profoundly discredited political leaders the world over took it for granted that the economy could not be left to its own devices lest it implode and bring another hitler to power the result under the heavy domestic regulation of the new deal state the close international trade control of the bretton woods system and the vast subsidies of the marshall plan was the greatest economic boom in world history the economists hour is about what came next how a new generation of free market ideologues often called neoliberals wormed their way into power and influence drove out the postwar belief in a controlled economy and replaced it with an updated version of the old 1920s free market dogma appelbaum takes readers through several case studies the end of the military draft the end of antitrust enforcement the rollback of the regulatory state the rise of so called cost benefit analysis the end of controls on international trade the dictatorship of augusto pinochet and so on the key political strategy as often as not carried out unconsciously was controlling the terms of debate and the subjects of discussion rather than argue whether or not ordinary citizens should be forced to take part in america s wars or if a professional military was a threat to democracy economist walter oi changed the subject to efficiency arguing that a volunteer army would be good for the economy the draft was subsequently abolished similar political jujitsu brought down one pillar after another of the new deal state predictions of faster cheaper service from economist alfred kahn obliterated regulations on airlines and trucking thereby evading discussions of whether all american communities should be connected to the same transport network preposterous revisionist history from robert bork recast antitrust law as solely about protecting the consumer instead of protecting society as a whole from concentrated economic power this allowed merging corporations to claim they would reduce prices through economies of scale and all but ended antitrust enforcement predictions of skyrocketing growth from comparative advantage brought down restrictions on international trade the absolutely crack brained efficient market hypothesis featured in loony theories like economist eugene fama s 1965 paper arguing that stock prices fully reflected all available information and thus ruling out financial bubbles by definition led to repeated rounds of financial deregulation nearly all of these moves led to disaster ending the draft was arguably morally defensible but also enabled the succeeding generation of gruesome military adventurism by placing no broad sacrifice upon the public ending antitrust enforcement led to a quick roll up of american markets into monopolies and oligopolies ending trade controls especially with china devastated america s industrial base and threw millions out of work and pretending that financial crises are impossible didn t stop them from happening like clockwork culminating in the global disaster of 2008 even airline deregulation has been heavily overrated as matt stoller argues data showing post deregulation price declines fail to note that the trend line followed the pre deregulation price decline almost exactly today detailed regulation decisions are made by oligopolist executives instead of democratically accountable state authorities expand federal reserve alan greenspan fed chair from 1987 to 2006 appelbaum is rightly scornful about all this as he points out it is rather ironic that most of these free market dogmatists lived through the depression and some of the most prominent ones like milton friedman and alan greenspan worked for the government only truly evidence proof zealots a minority of ultra liberal economic theologians as historian eric hobsbawm called them could both live through the greatest imaginable failure of laissez faire economics and spend time living off state employment and still conclude that government can do almost nothing to help its citizens appelbaum gets considerable wry amusement from friedman s extraordinarily arrogant brittle mind in particular at one point during the second world war he worked at a state funded think tank testing alloys for the blades of jet engine turbines despite the fact that he had no special training in metallurgy friedman came up with his own alloy which by his calculations should have lasted 200 hours in testing it lasted two friedman later said the experience shaped his lifelong skepticism of complicated formulas and forecasting appelbaum notes i ll bet it did philippon s book meanwhile has a jarringly twofold character in the dr jekyll half of the book he has several technical and rigorous explorations of empirical economic questions that are masterpieces of careful reasoning for instance he examines money in politics and carefully knocks down tendentious arguments that such behavior does not simply reflect the rich purchasing policy outcomes that benefit themselves europe by contrast has maintained some reasonable controls on the amount of money the rich are allowed to dump into the political system and thus avoided a lot of awful policy some of philippon s findings are eye popping for example in america he top 0 01 percent of donors contribute an astounding 40 percent of all contributions he writes while after adjusting for the economic size total contributions in the us are fifty times larger than those in most european countries philippon also provides conclusive proof that american business has become more concentrated and its markets more dominated by a few enormous firms he digs deep into data revealing declining american business investment and slow productivity growth and provides a strong argument that declining competition leading to stagnant monopolists who rake in easy profits without having to invest further is at least partly to blame on the other hand philippon shows that europe has maintained a semblance of effective antitrust regulation preventing the same level of market domination as in the u s the result is much cheaper prices for things like airlines internet and cellphone service americans are being radically overcharged for those and many other things because our markets are significantly more monopolized thus he comes to the surprising conclusion that europe is more free markety than the united states only truly evidence proof zealots could both live through the greatest imaginable failure of laissez faire the depression and spend time living off state employment and still conclude that government can do almost nothing to help its citizens but that leads me to the mr hyde half of the book in which philippon displays an unthinking knee jerk faith in the exhausted free market nostrums appelbaum destroys a faith that is sharply inconsistent with many of the results philippon derives one rather contrarian point of the book is that many of the problems afflicting america are the result of abandoning free market policies but to start with antitrust regulation is just that regulation where meddling government bureaucrats decide whether firms have amassed too much power whether or not two companies can merge or if so what compensatory steps they should take while the goal is to allow free market competition it is not exactly a free market policy by the traditional meaning of the term in his discussion of the financial sector philippon is comically trusting toward traditional market based explanations of what banks do financial intermediation arises from the need for expertise in channeling capital from savers to borrows he asserts a definition straight out of a milton friedman style econ 101 textbook he then spends the rest of the chapter mystified at the gigantic profits in the financial sector intermediation costs around 200 basis points about the same as a century ago the more you think about it the more puzzling it becomes this is only confusing if you accept the ideological presupposition about what finance is for it very obviously has other functions than intermediation most notably controlling non financial businesses so as to extract money from them indeed earlier in the book philippon notes that the corporate profit rate has soared in the united states and firms are spending that money on payments to shareholders the payout rate has increased substantially primarily driven by share buybacks that in turn is mostly the result of pressure from finance most clearly in the form of shareholder tyranny where big investors demand companies disgorge the cash as barry lynn writes in his book cornered market concentration has often been directly orchestrated by wall street buccaneers who use vast sums of borrowed money to conduct roll up operations on whole sectors reducing competition and raking in easy profits just as notable are the absences from philippon s book he barely discusses the crash of 2008 or the ensuing binge of austerity across the developed world which led directly to a lost decade of weak growth this would seem to be important when talking about finance in line with neoliberal arguments from larry summers he celebrates the political independence of the european central bank but does not mention how it deliberately caused a bank run in greece when its government tried to escape the economically backward austerity straitjacket and in his discussions of how europe has maintained a reasonable labor share of national income a metric which has fallen sharply in the united states he does not mention the continent s heavy unionization labor unions of course are directly anti market with one of their primary objectives being to set wages higher than they would be in a free market so while there is a lot of good work in the great reversal the economics profession as a whole has a great deal to learn from outsiders like appelbaum my generation of economists is less interested in ideology philippon writes this book shows that such a position is not only impossible but dangerous answering any question about economics or politics worth asking will inherently require some kind of normative moral framework data alone cannot tell you whether it is good or bad for the labor share of income to go down for instance but moreover if you try to avoid ideology you end up making assumptions based on status quo thinking and then grow confused about stone obvious things like why jamie dimon is so rich a mind requires structure to operate clearly or it will get lost in space

investment thesis investment management companies perform well when the global economy is growing as investors tend to flock to equity securities generally such investments bear higher costs than fixed income or passive investment solutions enabling asset management companies to earn higher fees that result in profit margin expansion considering the global economy grew steadily in the decade following the financial crisis of 2008 it doesn t come as a surprise that many of the leading companies in this industry have provided stellar returns to investors advertisement advertisement the share price performance of major investment management companies in the last 10 years the industry however is going through dynamic changes the secular growth of passive investment products which have lower fees is proving to be an obstacle for many companies but not for blackrock inc nyse blk the company certainly is the leader of this space and enjoys significant competitive advantages even though shares have appreciated 123 over the past decade there is still upside potential the stock was trading with a dividend yield of 2 7 at the market price of around 497 on friday company profile and business strategy blackrock is an asset management company providing a suite of investment products and solutions to institutional corporate and retail clients at the end of the first quarter the company was ranked number one in regard to assets under management advertisement advertisement top 10 asset managers by aum as of march 31 2019 source adv ratings one of the primary reasons blackrock has been so successful is because of the extensive products and solutions offered which represent various asset classes styles regions and markets product categories source company website the global footprint of the company has been another factor in its success the rising income levels of emerging markets such as the asia pacific and latin america regions created a demand for wealth management products in the last several years which was addressed by blackrock because of its reach in these regions advertisement advertisement over the last five years the company has focused on diversifying its business operations as a result the company now provides investment management risk management solutions and portfolio construction software tools to integrate all these operations into a single ecosystem the one blackrock model was introduced these changes indicate that offering all in one solutions to clients is one of the company s primary business strategies global offices source company website keeping up with technological advancements and providing a streamlined experience to clients is also a business objective of blackrock as confirmed by the management in the third quarter earnings conference call advertisement advertisement distributing wealth to shareholders through buybacks and dividends has always been a priority as well which the management expects to continue indefinitely industry analysis the asset management industry is at a crossroads historically companies focused on providing active investment products in a bid to help clients generate alpha returns however in the last decade passive investment products have garnered unfathomable attention and investors have poured trillions of dollars into such solutions a paper drafted by four federal reserve system governors in september confirmed that this shift will change the financial systems for many years the shift from active to passive investment strategies has profoundly affected the asset management industry in the past couple of decades and the ongoing nature of the shift suggests that its effects will continue to ripple through the financial system for years to come advertisement advertisement benjamin phillips a consultant with casey quirk believes passive investment assets under management will soon overtake that of active investments source bloomberg companies that have failed to address this new development are falling behind the early adopters of such strategies blackrock was one of the first to address this shift and as a result has a market share of 20 currently source bloomberg companies that continue to provide innovative and thematic passive solutions will likely generate economic profits in the next 10 years pricewaterhousecoopers projects a huge increase in assets under management in 2020 and a shift in the investor base the volume of investable assets is expected to grow faster in south america asia africa and the middle east in comparison to developed regions such as north america and europe therefore investment management companies with a solid presence in these regions will be in a better position to exploit the available growth opportunities advertisement advertisement technological developments will also be at the heart of the industry in the next five years the growth of robo advisory solutions is one such aspect that needs to be addressed by industry participants according to data from backend benchmarking 440 billion in assets is currently being managed by automated investment solutions providers companies with a strong balance sheet and a healthy cash position would be able to either acquire small companies providing these types of services or develop a platform to roll out automated products in the future addressing this growing shift early would be key to staying relevant in the changing industry finally the industry is seeing an increased level of regulation from governing authorities so failing to comply with these standards might result in significant losses however morningstar analysts predict that smaller scale companies might find it difficult to absorb this pressure from regulators in the short term which could be beneficial for industry leaders financial performance the performance of equity markets has been stellar in the last 12 months however there has been some significant volatility at times as a result of trade tensions between the u s and china geopolitical uncertainty and unstable oil prices over this same period however blackrock has generated approximately 350 billion 5 of total organic growth this is an indication of the effectiveness of its business structure advertisement advertisement in the third quarter the company reported net inflows of 84 billion supported by 51 billion of inflows to the company s passive investment solutions source company filings the company s operating profit margin has declined at a steady rate from 40 83 in 2014 to 38 51 in the trailing 12 month period this doesn t come as a surprise considering the growth of low fee generating passive products at the end of the third quarter active products represented only 27 of total assets under management but generated 47 of base fees this is a clear indication that these products have better margins based on these factors it s fair to conclude that margins will compress further in the future management is optimistic however that this compression will partly be offset by the growth of assets source third quarter earnings presentation advertisement advertisement blackrock s debt maturities are well staged which is an indication of the high quality capital management practices being deployed in the next 11 years there are four years in which no maturities occur leaving ample time for the company to prepare its finances to honor upcoming repayments this reduces the company s refinancing risk source company filings according to data from gurufocus blackrock s debt to equity ratio is 0 19 which is indicative of a strong balance sheet position blackrock is generating organic growth even under volatile market conditions and analysts predict mid single digit revenue growth for the next five years as well the company continues to repurchase stock on the open market reducing the number of shares outstanding this will help per share earnings figures in the future dividends on the other hand have grown steadily since the third quarter of 2017 amid slow growth the company will deliver attractive returns to its shareholders in the coming years based on its ability to pounce on market opportunities according to gregory warren the morningstar analyst covering blackrock the company has a wide economic moat resulting from the significant switching costs of changing wealth from one investment manager to another this moat will help generate alpha returns as well advertisement advertisement outlook blackrock is investing to enhance its product offering to capture long term returns from developing trends in the industry for instance the iconic ishares exchange traded fund offering has been refreshed with new funds addressing higher growth segments such as factor investing sustainable investing and megatrend funds as these themes gain traction just like high tech investing did over the last couple of decades blackrock will be the go to investment solutions provider for clients capital expenditures have increased in the last three years as the company has started developing the necessary infrastructure to roll out new fund categories and will likely remain elevated over the next several years as well despite several reports by the international monetary fund and the world bank the federal reserve believes the american economy will continue to grow over the next several years in the third quarter the americas contributed to 66 of base fees and continued economic growth in the u s will positively impact blackrock s earnings trade tensions on the other hand are expected to subside as the two nations will eventually come to an agreement a couple of weeks ago chinese officials confirmed to the south china morning post that a trade deal is likely within the next several months this will be a tailwind for blackrock since a continuation of the current bull market would lead to higher net inflows blackrock is addressing the threat posed by robo advisory services as well the acquisition of futureadvisor in 2015 is finally set to pay dividends as investors embrace automated investing solutions the outlook for the company is positive and blackrock will likely benefit from the industry wide developments while some of its peers might struggle this is a result of the company s careful planning to invest in technologically advanced solutions and competitive advantages valuation blackrock is a mature company that continues to grow at steady rates a discounted cash flow model was used to derive an intrinsic value estimate for its shares considering growth could last several years before slowing down the below table shows the revenue estimates for the company through 2023 fiscal year ending

estimate per share comes to 542 which indicates an upside of 11 from the market price of 497 on friday risks the possibility of a global economic slowdown is the biggest risk of investing in blackrock if this risk materializes fund flows will turn negative as investors park investable assets in their cash accounts as opposed to higher fee generating investment products this will compress profit margins leading to earnings erosion a further appreciation of the u s dollar against emerging market currencies is another risk for investors as this would negatively impact the company s total revenue conclusion blackrock is one of the leading asset management companies in the world it is benefiting from the secular trend of investors embracing passive investment solutions even though fees of these products are lower than that of actively managed peers the sheer size of the assets under management is helping blackrock generate sufficient returns for this reason shares deserve to trade

the nation s first past the post system it means that the seats won by each party in parliament don t depend on the percentage of the total vote they received nationwide but rather on how those votes are distributed regionally the bottom line is take uk polls with a pinch of salt they are useful for gauging sentiment but don t accurately translate into seats in parliament which is what determines who governs as for the market reaction a clear tory majority would be the most bullish outcome for the pound it could end britain s political paralysis and allow the brexit process to move forward alleviating some of the uncertainty that has haunted the economy the most catastrophic outcome would be a hung parliament where no party gains a majority it would imply even more deadlock and uncertainty much like this year now in terms of how the risks are distributed the pound has moved higher lately on growing expectations for a strong tory victory which implies that this is now the market s baseline scenario therefore sterling could still soar in that case but any gains may be smaller in magnitude compared to the losses the currency may record on a hung parliament as that would catch investors by surprise for example cable could approach the 1 35 region if the tories win big but perhaps drop towards the 1 25 territory on an inconclusive outcome from 1 31 currently fed meeting may help dollar recover if powell holds the line in the states the spotlight will fall on the fed meeting on wednesday markets are confident rates will be kept unchanged pricing in no chance of a rate cut as policymakers have been clear that they will stay on hold for some time unless of course economic data deteriorate hence the market reaction will depend on the updated economic forecasts the so called dot plot where policymakers submit their interest rate projections for the coming years and chairman powell s remarks overall there s no real argument for the fed to deviate from its neutral stance the economy has lost momentum amid weakness in manufacturing and investment but the overall picture is still solid consumption the backbone of us growth is healthy supported by growing real wages and a tight labor market meanwhile the truce in the trade war is holding and there s a real prospect for more de escalation if the much touted phase one deal is reached soon all told powell is likely to hold the line and reaffirm that the fed will only act again if the situation demands it something that currently doesn t look likely assuming the dot plot paints a similar picture with the committee signaling no rate cuts next year that could give the dollar a shot in the arm as easing expectations are priced out at the time of writing markets are fully pricing in one more quarter point cut by november 2020 as for the data cpi inflation figures for november will see the light on wednesday before the fed decision retail sales numbers for the same month will follow on friday ecb still begging for fiscal stimulus the european central bank ecb announces its own decision on thursday and not much is expected either after delivering a stimulus package back in september that several policymakers opposed investors have concluded the governing council is so fragmented that there s almost no prospect of further action in the coming months even if the struggling euro area economy could use some more juice chances are that christine lagarde will pick up where mario draghi left off and spend most of her time calling on national governments to launch a fiscal stimulus package that kickstarts growth judging by recent comments from chancellor merkel that remains unlikely so lagarde s calls will probably fall on deaf ears the joker in all this is germany s spd party it is currently in a coalition government with merkel s cdu but has recently changed its leadership with the new leaders demanding much higher spending on education infrastructure and green energy for the alliance to continue hence merkel now faces a choice increase spending or go to new elections make no mistake this is the biggest variable for the euro any signs that substantial fiscal stimulus is coming could see the currency stage a spectacular rally until then though the outlook remains grim on the data front germany s zew survey for december is due on tuesday chinese export inflation data eyed as tariff deadline looms in the world s second largest economy trade data for november will be released over the weekend and inflation figures for that month will follow on tuesday markets typically pay most attention to exports and producer prices the former seen as a gauge of global demand and the latter of factory activity in china while these could be important for global risk appetite the main factor will be what happens in the trade saga this week is crucial because unless a phase one deal is reached or at least appears imminent then the trump administration will slap tariffs on almost all remaining imports from china on december 15 how likely is that markets appear confident it won t happen both sides want this skinny deal trump to score a victory before he hits the campaign trail and china to alleviate some economic pressure also markets are calculating that the last thing trump wants is to really hit the us consumer and risk hurting the economy a weak economy certainly doesn t help presidents get re elected the most likely outcome may be trump postponing the tariffs not cancelling them which could prove somewhat neutral for risk sentiment however the risk is clearly that he pulls the trigger something that would generate another wave of risk aversion snb prepared to cut but fx intervention remains the main tool in switzerland the local central bank will announce its decision on thursday not much is expected with markets pricing in a negligible chance for a rate cut even though switzerland has fallen back into deflation since the snb already has the lowest rates globally it doesn t have many bullets left in the chamber maybe it can cut rates once more but that s it and investors don t think this is the time most probably the snb will reiterate that it s prepared to cut rates if needed but that it will continue to use fx intervention as its primary tool to keep the franc from appreciating a reinforcement of the easing bias may hurt the franc but only slightly as this is what investors expect already finally in japan the second reading of gdp for q3 will be released early on monday while the boj s tankan survey for q4 is due on friday however the yen is usually oblivious to economic data what matters most for the haven currency is global risk appetite and therefore how the trade war plays out

to drop bills that would prohibit local governments from forbidding the use of plastic bags gov mike dewine opposes a pair of bills offered by fellow republicans that would forbid municipalities and counties from banning single use plastic bags by groceries and other stores some local governments including cuyahoga county and the columbus suburb of bexley are trying to regulate the use of plastic

be released into the wild once they transform into butterflies this is a really exciting breakthrough says tia perry a keeper in the butterfly conservation lab perry says wild silverspots lay their eggs in the oregon zoo lab each year but this is the first time a female butterfly bred in captivity at the request of the u s fish and wildlife service the zoo s lab held back 22 pupae from this year

the main event will be the uk general election on thursday which could decide what form brexit takes and shape the pound s fortunes for months central bank meetings will serve as a prelude the fed is set to keep rates unchanged and may reinforce the message that it will remain on hold for a while the ecb will hold its first gathering under the leadership of christine lagarde but is unlikely to provide any fireworks instead trade news could dominate with the white house expected to decide whether it will fire another volley of tariffs on december 15 uk election get ready for explosive moves in the pound in brexit land all eyes will be on the general election the results will start to roll in early on friday at around 02 00 gmt opinion polls suggest the tories are going to run away with it as they are leading labour by ten percentage points on average however things are not so straightforward remember a very similar situation played out back in 2017 every pollster had the conservatives securing a clear majority in parliament but labour ultimately smashed expectations and denied the tories that majority polls are inherently unreliable in predicting uk elections due to the nation s first past the post system it means that the seats won by each party in parliament don t depend on the percentage of the total vote they received nationwide but rather on how those votes are distributed regionally the bottom line is take uk polls with a pinch of salt they are useful for gauging sentiment but don t accurately translate into seats in parliament which is what determines who governs as for the market reaction a clear tory majority would be the most bullish outcome for the pound it could end britain s political paralysis and allow the brexit process to move forward alleviating some of the uncertainty that has haunted the economy the most catastrophic outcome would be a hung parliament where no party gains a majority it would imply even more deadlock and uncertainty much like this year now in terms of how the risks are distributed the pound has moved higher lately on growing expectations for a strong tory victory which implies that this is now the market s baseline scenario therefore sterling could still soar in that case but any gains may be smaller in magnitude compared to the losses the currency may record on a hung parliament as that would catch investors by surprise for example cable could approach the 1 35 region if the tories win big but perhaps drop towards the 1 25 territory on an inconclusive outcome from 1 31 currently fed meeting may help dollar recover if powell holds the line in the states the spotlight will fall on the fed meeting on wednesday markets are confident rates will be kept unchanged pricing in no chance of a rate cut as policymakers have been clear that they will stay on hold for some time unless of course economic data deteriorate hence the market reaction will depend on the updated economic forecasts the so called dot plot where policymakers submit their interest rate projections for the coming years and chairman powell s remarks overall there s no real argument for the fed to deviate from its neutral stance the economy has lost momentum amid weakness in manufacturing and investment but the overall picture is still solid consumption the backbone of us growth is healthy supported by growing real wages and a tight labor market meanwhile the truce in the trade war is holding and there s a real prospect for more de escalation if the much touted phase one deal is reached soon all told powell is likely to hold the line and reaffirm that the fed will only act again if the situation demands it something that currently doesn t look likely assuming the dot plot paints a similar picture with the committee signaling no rate cuts next year that could give the dollar a shot in the arm as easing expectations are priced out at the time of writing markets are fully pricing in one more quarter point cut by november 2020 as for the data cpi inflation figures for november will see the light on wednesday before the fed decision retail sales numbers for the same month will follow on friday ecb still begging for fiscal stimulus the european central bank ecb announces its own decision on thursday and not much is expected either after delivering a stimulus package back in september that several policymakers opposed investors have concluded the governing council is so fragmented that there s almost no prospect of further action in the coming months even if the struggling euro area economy could use some more juice chances are that christine lagarde will pick up where mario draghi left off and spend most of her time calling on national governments to launch a fiscal stimulus package that kickstarts growth judging by recent comments from chancellor merkel that remains unlikely so lagarde s calls will probably fall on deaf ears the joker in all this is germany s spd party it is currently in a coalition government with merkel s cdu but has recently changed its leadership with the new leaders demanding much higher spending on education infrastructure and green energy for the alliance to continue hence merkel now faces a choice increase spending or go to new elections make no mistake this is the biggest variable for the euro any signs that substantial fiscal stimulus is coming could see the currency stage a spectacular rally until then though the outlook remains grim on the data front germany s zew survey for december is due on tuesday chinese export inflation data eyed as tariff deadline looms in the world s second largest economy trade data for november will be released over the weekend and inflation figures for that month will follow on tuesday markets typically pay most attention to exports and producer prices the former seen as a gauge of global demand and the latter of factory activity in china while these could be important for global risk appetite the main factor will be what happens in the trade saga this week is crucial because unless a phase one deal is reached or at least appears imminent then the trump administration will slap tariffs on almost all remaining imports from china on december 15 how likely is that markets appear confident it won t happen both sides want this skinny deal trump to score a victory before he hits the campaign trail and china to alleviate some economic pressure also markets are calculating that the last thing trump wants is to really hit the us consumer and risk hurting the economy a weak economy certainly doesn t help presidents get re elected the most likely outcome may be trump postponing the tariffs not cancelling them which could prove somewhat neutral for risk sentiment however the risk is clearly that he pulls the trigger something that would generate another wave of risk aversion snb prepared to cut but fx intervention remains the main tool in switzerland the local central bank will announce its decision on thursday not much is expected with markets pricing in a negligible chance for a rate cut even though switzerland has fallen back into deflation since the snb already has the lowest rates globally it doesn t have many bullets left in the chamber maybe it can cut rates once more but that s it and investors don t think this is the time most probably the snb will reiterate that it s prepared to cut rates if needed but that it will continue to use fx intervention as its primary tool to keep the franc from appreciating a reinforcement of the easing bias may hurt the franc but only slightly as this is what investors expect already finally in japan the second reading of gdp for q3 will be released early on monday while the boj s tankan survey for q4 is due on friday however the yen is usually oblivious to economic data what matters most for the haven currency is global risk appetite and therefore how the trade war plays out
dec 5 reuters 1 election night fever more than three years after britons narrowly voted to leave the european union the dec 12 general election will effectively offer them another vote on how they want brexit to proceed and if they still think it should go ahead opinion polls showing the conservative party with a big lead have fuelled a scintillating pound rally and short sterling positions have been cut to seven month lows the belief is the conservatives will quickly implement brexit and end the uncertainty that s weighed on the economy since 2016 polls patchy track record worries some people though and that s evident in derivative markets where two week risk reversals an indicator of bullish to bearish bets are at two month highs and while currency volatility everywhere is at record lows sterling vol is approaching this year s highs what are the risks one that the polls have got it wrong and britain will get another hung parliament second if a conservative win is already priced in traders may be tempted to take profits pushing sterling lower and focus will shift to the 11 month window for britain to sign trade deals with the european union that prospect will likely

loanmaking too should rebound from the 22 month lows of october a seasonally slow month full of holidays but pressure is building for more fiscal and monetary policy measures consumer demand is soft meaning the data may reveal falling imports it might all hinge on what happens in the run up to dec 15 authorities will be looking for assurances from washington on either holding off the tariff hikes

to monitor the economy jerome powell s post meeting press conference may yield more interesting headlines he could address tightness in the short term interbank lending markets that sent repo rates briefly to 10 in september since then the fed has been stabilizing repo markets by offering to buy securities nearly every day but given traders fears of another spike at year end the central bank is considering a standing repo facility that would allow banks to borrow as needed instead of queuing up in daily operations reporters may also seek cues from powell on mooted changes to the fed s monetary policy framework especially after fed governor lael brainard s recent comments endorsing a move to targeting average inflation from the current 2 upper limit the question is all the more

the situation seemed dire the federal government had a ton of debt to sell and many market watchers maybe most of them were growing worried about how it could it wasn t just a matter of demand more so the issue of financing the repo market was sending some very negative signals and if the repo market isn t working properly the ability of the system to absorb treasury issuance is in doubt the headline for one financial times article was talking about how repo was being undermined at a particularly sticky moment the reduction in liquidity in the 5 800bn treasury market comes at a time when conditions have become strained as the calendar year draws to a close if you recall last year the gc repo rate ended 2018 with an enormous spike there are growing concerns repo rates at the end of this year despite hastened federal reserve activities are in for something similar but neither of those were the subject of the article quoted above the year was instead 2008 back then treasury experts saw short term money rates drop to zero and linked them to persistent liquidity problems in repo funny that the article above was written on the occasion of the fomc voting for zirp that fateful december one strategist from bank of america had said low rates are having a corrosive effect on the repo market which will impair liquidity in treasuries we are getting close to a situation where structural damage caused by low interest rates outweighs any benefit from easier monetary policy the thinking went like this at such low levels there would be little or no room left from which dealers could pocket their small spread treasury owners like the ability to sell a repo is technically but not legally a repurchase agreement meaning you sell it today and agree to buy it back tomorrow or some other specified date into the market so as to finance that very position cash lenders wanted the ability to borrow a security they don t and do not want to own for all that to happen you have to have dealer banks intermediate in the middle matching prospective treasury owners with eager treasury borrowers without them collateral flow will break down as it had more than a decade ago but there were huge problems in repo long before zirp in december 2008 by the score of repo fails the failure of one or the other counterparty to unwind the repurchase in a timely manner the entire system collateral had seized up the prior october people today still think the panic of 2008 had something to do with wall street and the stock market it wasn t not really that was a mere symptom according to estimates provided by the federal reserve s new york branch the one which is responsible for dealing with dealers primary dealers had reported to it nearly 800 billion combined to deliver plus to receive in repo fails during the week of september 3 2008 you might remember how immediately following the end of that particular week fannie and freddie were forced into federal government conservatorship yet the 4 week t bill s equivalent yield was still a comparatively robust 1 53 the week of september 17 the one begun with lehman aig wachovia etc repo fails would jump to 577 billion and then skyrocket to an incomprehensible 3 5 trillion for the final week of that historic month and fails began the next one nearer 5 trillion when stocks finally melted down was that because short term rates were plummeting all over the place leaving dealers to sit it out unable to charge their spread or was it because these same financial institutions had a front row seat for what stupidity had really kept the collateral flow flowing up until that time what is a repo fail you give me a ust likely a t bill as collateral for me to lend you cash overnight the following day we are supposed to exchange them back with you giving me a tiny bit more cash as interest for the loan but what if i decide i don t want the cash back because i d rather keep the t bill that s a repo fail and it is one of the most puzzling aspects of systemic liquidity after all we are all taught that cash is the most liquid instrument and therefore in times of stress and uncertainty that s what everyone wants cash not collateral yet what the 2008 episode showed was that during times of massive strain system participants prefer the collateral to cash therefore during the worst liquidity panic in four generations nothing like this seen since the great depression the repo market broke down for the inelasticity of collateral not cash while this was going on ben bernanke would have you believe he was fighting the good fight he said so to congress on september 23 just as repo fails were about to enter the trillions the federal reserve took a number of actions to increase liquidity and stabilize markets notably to address dollar funding pressures worldwide we announced a significant expansion of reciprocal currency arrangements with foreign central banks including an approximate doubling of the existing swap lines with the european central bank and the swiss national bank and the authorization of new swap facilities with the bank of japan the bank of england and the bank of canada we will continue to work closely with colleagues at other central banks to address ongoing liquidity pressures there are a couple of things which truly stand out in what he testified first the federal reserve s chairman talked about how he was going to increase liquidity and stabilize markets he and the other fomc members kept saying those exact things over and over and over liquidity and stabilize did they not even remotely bernanke said liquidity but there was increasingly none markets stabilized worst panic since 1929 and it was a global panic that s the other aspect you should take note from just this one piece of testimony the chairman said address dollar funding pressures worldwide using swap lines with reciprocal major foreign central banks excuse me why didn t anyone ask how it could be that banks in germany canada or japan were begging their local central bankers for funding in us dollars preoccupied by the official story about a us housing bubble gone wrong due to greedy wall street bankers and their prepackaged toxic mortgage loans neither congress nor the public caught on to what should have been the period s main message combining all these elements repo collateral global funding in dollars ineffective central bank that was 2008 s global financial crisis in a nutshell not subprime mortgages to make matters worse to add insult to grave global economic injury the us central bank had classified this period as one having abundant reserves i m not making this up for all the things the federal reserve was doing for presumably liquidity and stability they ended up creating a large amount of bank reserves and as money rates tumbled officials connected the one to the other for the first time in history a worldwide bank panic alongside an overabundance of cash you re probably scratching your head at this point at least that s what they tried to say and still claim to this very day the doctrine of ample or abundant reserves they may have been abundant but that only goes on to establish how they must have been and continue to be largely irrelevant the fed wasn t entirely powerless though during september 2008 the central bank undertook billions in reverse repos while also working out an arrangement with the treasury department to essentially create off the books treasury securities supplementary financing account a reverse repo is the same repo transaction from the perspective of the other side the fed borrowing cash from the market on collateral of ust instruments it holds in soma the cash was coming in the securities going out but bernanke wasn t doing these things to alleviate the collateral squeeze he was doing them because the federal funds rate kept coming in way way underneath the fed s policy target again these people thought there was too much cash during a global bank panic they couldn t stop both the reverse repos as well as the sfa were designed and intended to soak up all those supposedly excess reserves frbny s press release announcing the program explicitly stated as much funds in this account serve to drain reserves from the banking system and will therefore offset the reserve impact of recent federal reserve lending and liquidity initiatives in other words it was quite by accident that the fed added a little more collateral back into a system desperately starved of it because the central bank was responding to its perceptions of its mandate in terms of reserves the inelasticity in collateral would continue as would the panic by the second week in december 2008 repo fails were still more than 600 billion the middle week the one during which the fomc voted for zirp near 900 billion yet again on december 9 2008 the federal government auctioned off 30 billion in 4 week bills at a calculated yield of zero some of those securities were overbid meaning that they yielded to the buyer a negative return back to that financial times article were the negative yields responsible for the mess in repo and collateral the disincentive for dealers to intermediate or were the negative and zero yields an indication of demand for collateral perhaps even among the dealers themselves remember this was december several months into the paradigm of abundant reserves and it was the cusp of the fed s qe the money printing ben bernanke was always too happy to let you believe he would undertake but didn t qe was never money printing it was a misleading extension of the ample reserves framework the crisis would continue for another three months by then more than 7 million americans thrown out of work for reasons they still don t know what were we missing short answer securities lending a repurchase agreement sounds easy and terrific and these are done occasionally worldwide on a dvp basis that is delivery versus payment you borrow cash from me i get a ust as collateral from you and both are exchanged one for one via a custodian but in common eurodollar practice especially in some of those vast undiscovered offshore spaces you borrow cash from me as i borrow a ust from you as you may have borrowed the thing yourself we are both borrowers and lenders but of different things with often the same purpose the one is more powerful and useful than the other collateral over cash that s why its inelasticity mattered a whole lot more than any elasticity in terms of bank reserves securities lending is essentially the fiat nature of collateral which acts as its own kind of currency another misconception of the crisis aig was bailed out because of its credit default swaps no it nearly failed because of its securities lending practices as i wrote last year one of aig s insurance subs would lend securities to another special purpose subsidiary aig global securities lending acting as agent this latter firm would then relend the same securities to banks and broker dealers who had created a need for them in burgeoning repo derivatives and offshore fx markets these banks or brokers would deposit cash with aig global securities lending as collateral for the securities cash was collateral for the collateral they sought see what i mean about capitalism while aig would then use that cash to invest unwisely in subprime mortgages and other risky forms of junk the firm s real problem was the liquidity bottleneck this process of collateral transformation had created while specifically leading to its own near demise those other dealers lining up to borrow this already borrowed aig collateral had undertaken similar designs the idea of detached money dealers running matched books is a fiction demonstrated not just by aig but also a few others you ve heard about bear lehman and probably a few more you didn t or have forgotten dexia mf global in other words a dealer isn t always just standing in the middle of two other repo counterparties matching demand for collateral with its supply they often straddle the line on either side making bets as to which way is the most profitable and taking risks by doing so they aren t just making money off the minute spread in repo they never made much money off the spread to begin with they have as i said a better than front row seat for collateral flow because they aren t just in the audience dispassionately watching the repo theater unfold aig may have been an insurance company but aiggsl was more so a money dealer let s go back to bernanke again testifying to congress in late september 2008 what did he tell both the house and senate about aig in the case of aig the federal reserve with the support of the treasury provided an emergency credit line to facilitate an orderly resolution the federal reserve took this action because it judged that in light of the prevailing market conditions and the size and composition of aig s obligations a disorderly failure of aig would have severely threatened global financial stability and consequently the performance of the u s economy sure but what does that really mean another question never asked aig was handled in an orderly fashion and what good did it do functionally how was aig really connected to everyone else in what actual capacities did the size and composition of aig s obligations impact the entire global financial system credit default swaps were one thing yes but what do you think happened when aiggsl could no longer supply collateral to the marketplace via its transformation archetype and it wasn t just aig obviously other dealers who were doing similar things clamped down on them too the size fluidity and flexibility of the systemic collateral pool were all negatively impacted therefore 5 trillion in repo fails while the mainstream media focused on subprime mortgages and the s p 500 but as i wrote before back then there were few if any answers who had ever heard of repo the bernanke s of the world didn t talk about it and with his and other s abundant reserves they mentioned it even less if that was possible many experts even by december 2008 were more concerned with how what they saw as a quaint repo mechanism could harm the federal government s ability to finance its ballooning deficits they worried interest rates were going to rise quickly as if that was the big thing upon which to focus everyone s attention as it related to repo repo collateral global funding in dollars ineffective central bank here we are again with the same issues if not quite to the same level over the last several weeks since mid october 2019 i will point out primary dealer holdings of t bills have skyrocketed now eleven years after the somehow global financial crisis you might correctly surmise that the appropriate lessons haven t yet been learned that repo remains largely a mainstream mystery not just in the sense of the public s lack of awareness but also that of policymakers once more they promise ample or abundant reserves not qe and voice how these are necessary if only to keep treasury yields from jumping if only those were our real concerns maybe if someone could address dollar funding pressures worldwide and do it right with some understanding of collateral we aren t going to repeat 2008 but that doesn t mean repo problems and their main part in an ever growing global dollar shortage won t cause what is really serious and unnecessary harm how is it that the us again flirts with something like recession bad enough check out other parts of the world like china and india

out of their funk advertisement fiscal hawks argue such proposals will merely sow the seeds for more trouble but the needle seems to be shifting on how much debt an economy can safely carry central bankers and policymakers from european central bank president christine lagarde to the international monetary fund have been urging governments to do more arguing it s a good time to borrow for

the load gets too heavy while solid economic growth is the easiest way out that isn t always forthcoming instead policy makers have to navigate balances and trade offs between austerity financial

morning brits are called to vote in a national survey for the fourth time in as many years and after just half the usual parliamentarian term the house of commons twists and turns around brexit are

table while markets wish to cancel brexit altogether they fear the uncertainty of renegotiating the deal the governability of a coalition or minority government that would emerge and most importantly corbyn s hard left policies here are five scenarios 1 a landslide majority such as of 68 votes that yougov projected in its mrp poll would be an optimal outcome that would send sterling higher 2 a small majority could also be pound positive but if johnson has to depend on hard brexiteers gbp usd may eventually drop after an initial gain 3 the third option is a hung parliament with the tories scrambling to make a deal with the northern irish democratic unionist party dup this time the small faction will probably demand more than the previous agreement with his predecessor theresa may however if a government is formed sterling could rise after an initial drop 4 the fourth option is that labour could form a coalition or a minority government if the liberal democrats are in a position to condition collaboration on having a different pm instead of corbyn the initial downfall of the pound could be followed by a surge 5 the fifth option is that corbyn enters downing street in

by gabriel burin buenos aires reuters brazil s real will trade not far off record lows into the new year receiving eventual support from a tentative economic recovery after months of unconvincing macro performance that has dragged the currency down a reuters poll showed the real was seen at 3 97 per dollar in 1 year implying a 5 5 appreciation from wednesday but a 1 8 drop compared to the forecast in november s survey according to the median view of 27 strategists polled dec 2 4 brazil s currency fell to a record low of 4 26 against the u s dollar in late november and is trading not far above that rate now economists in the survey pegged it at 4 195 per dollar in one month and 4 10 in three months our models still suggest a fair value for the brl around 4 00 4 10 said flavio serrano chief economist at haitong brasil faster growth should boost investment he added which would aid the battered currency somewhat the real rose slightly this week following the announcement of the strongest quarterly gross domestic product gdp growth since early last year driven by a solid performance in agriculture and a sharp rebound in industry however an overall slow economy has hurt the currency as president jair bolsonaro s reforms focused on macroeconomic goals have so far failed to materialize big capital spending plans notably in the oil sector tensions over welfare spending cuts and the environment have also weighed still latin america s top economy looks safe from the ructions that are rippling through other markets in the region policy easing to boost growth has been another source of foreign exchange weakness brazil s central bank stands ready to lower its interest rate by another 50 basis points to a fresh record low of 4 50 its president said this week the currency has lost almost 8 in 2019 and is set to close its 8th year in the red since the decade started a persistent depreciation that aroused u s president donald trump s anger this week mexico peso stable for now with protectionist worries centered in other places for the time being the survey reflected a relatively stable prospect for the mexican peso the currency s 1 year median forecast was 19 73 per dollar inside recent ranges lately it has been falling slowly toward 20 per dollar after two months of gains in september october amid growing caution about the chances of ratifying a continental trade deal this year due to resistance by some u s democrats and as in brazil lower carry trade rate differentials are a factor too the peso will maintain a weak performance mainly due to erosion of carry and volatility associated with external premiums banorte wrote in a report this week in line with many emerging market countries mexico s central bank is leaving the door open to future rate cuts resulting from weaker than anticipated economic activity and cooling inflation but contrary to the pesos of argentina chile and colombia mexico s currency is finishing 2019 basically at the same level where it started the 4th year in a row it will close near 20 per dollar despite some episodes of volatility a similar narrative could have applied for chile s currency but an outbreak of mass protests in october changed everything and now the peso is forecast to trade at 750 per dollar in 12 months very close to today s depressed levels as chile descended into chaos argentina was enacting strict capital controls to avoid further international reserve losses over political fears in practice these emergency steps froze the interbank value of the peso halting months of depreciation estimates for the currency showed an unusually calm trajectory at the start of 2020 the peso has also kept its composure in parallel markets where it could be more reactive once a newly elected peronist government announces its plans reporting and polling by gabriel burin additional polling by miguel ángel gutiérrez in mexico city sujith pai in bengaluru editing by ross finley and nick zieminski

earnings release this morning we have scheduled one hour for the call bruce will start with a few opening comments lisa will discuss q3 results from a merchandising perspective jonathan will review the financial highlights from q3 and the outlook for the fourth quarter and bruce will complete our prepared remarks before taking your questions i will now turn the call over to bruce bruce thorn president chief executive officer thank you andy and good morning everyone i will start with a few comments on the third quarter before talking about what we are seeing so far in q4 and then give you a preview of what you can expect from big lots in 2020 it is important to put all of that into the context of the transformational strategic journey we are undertaking where we remain very confident that we are on a path to delivering significant improvements in underlying operating performance and free cash flow and most importantly in long term shareholder value creation starting with q3 our results were in line with our guidance coming into the quarter comps decelerated from q2 but strengthened on a two year basis gross margin rate was slightly down but again in line with our guidance we continue to maintain excellent expense control which helped us to deliver adjusted eps in the upper part of our guidance range before i dive deeper into the third quarter results in our transformation efforts i am pleased to report that we are off to a solid start in the fourth quarter jonathan will give more color on our outlook in a moment but despite the adverse effect of the holiday shopping calendar compression we believe we are on track to deliver a positive comp for the quarter sales in the month of november which included thanksgiving and black friday were ahead of plan and we are excited by the response from customers to our holiday assortments given our transformational journey as you would expect we are heavily focused on our plans for 2020 and beyond after a year of transition and restructuring in 2019 we expect 2020 to deliver a significant improvement in comps and return to earnings growth as the fruits of our transformational efforts begin to be realized returning to ebit and eps growth will be a key step on our journey and we expect the rate of progress to accelerate in 2021 and 2022 as andy mentioned we will hold an investor event in the first quarter of 2020 at which time we will share more details on our strategy and roadmap but i want to take a few moments now to discuss some of the key growth levers we see for 2020 and beyond our store of the future rollout remains a central component of our strategy to provide a new and compelling experience for our customer we ended q3 with 452 stores or 32 of our fleet in the store of the future format the sales lift for year one stores continue to be in the high single digits with the large majority of the increase coming from the high margin merchandise categories located in the front of the store that is furniture seasonal and soft home sales growth in these stores is driven by both a bigger basket and increases in transactions in addition net promoter scores which are based on actual customer survey results are significantly up in these stores further validating that this format is resonating in total for the peak holiday selling season we have approximately 250 more store of the future stores this year compared to last year for 2020 we expect our ongoing store of the future rollout to continue to deliver at least 1 point of comp and we have enhancements to the new format which should drive incremental growth next year and in the years to come for instance on our lastearnings call we talked about a new initiative called the the lot that we have been testing in a number of stores in these stores we carved out an area of approximately 500 square feet near the front of the store where we are featuring a series of programs focused on events that so far have included dorm savings backyard bargains tailgating and halloween the lot is proving to be a great way to bring newness freshness and novelty our test stores have been experiencing a 1 to 2 total store comp lift with our theme presentations and based on customer intercepts it is produced favorable feedback and repeat shopping trips we will roll out the lot to all of our stores of the future stores in 2020 which including both existing and new conversions will be well over half of the fleet in these stores we will also rollout a new checkout experience featuring a reconfigured and streamline queue line that will enhance customer experience increased product density and build a bigger basket supported by new fixturing and product assortments including new impulse items this initiative has also been a successfully tested over the past few months another growth lever in 2020 will be broyhill which will be rolled out in all stores and also be available online this iconic brand will drive growth with special emphasis on our better and best offerings in indoor and outdoor furniture soft and hard home initial product is arriving this month to support our introduction of broyhill in january and the full chain wide rollout is scheduled for april 2020 it will be supported with marketing messaging through our print circular and digital channels and through beautifully designed in store signage all based on extensive work that has been done on brand positioning and guidelines another chain wide launch coming during 2020 is the traffic drivers program we have discussed on prior calls we believe our customer often shops big lots first and our goal for her is to find even more items on our list at our stores this initiative focuses on reconfiguring our food and consumables assortments to strike the right balance between surprise and delight values from closeouts in every aisle and consistent offerings and trusted brand name never outs to support this product mix rebalancing footage from food staple items will be reallocated to food entertainment and consumables a current coolers which typically occupy approximately 20 linear feed and our low productivity low margin and expensive to maintain will be replaced by a smaller end cap cooler the extra square footage will be allocated to more productive categories all while maintaining our eligibility to accept snap and ebt as a form of payment the traffic drivers initiative will involve some margin investment during the initial rollout but once again we are confident based on our testing that it will drive incremental sales over time we expect it to become accretive through driving incremental traffic this program will also be rolled out across the chain we expect all of these initiatives to drive a meaningful benefit to store comps in 2020 and we are excited by our customers reaction to the new experiences and assortments we are bringing to in our stores meanwhile our excitement about our e commerce business is also growing q3 was our first full quarter with bopis that is buy online pick up in store this convenient shopping option is now available in all stores and our customers response continues to exceed expectations bopis has nearly doubled the number of viewable skus online and we continue to receive more orders per day per store than anticipated and the average order value continues to trend higher than our original estimates furniture has been her most popular choice and she frequently makes additional purchases in store when she picks up her order bopis is an excellent way for us to capitalize on the continued strong growth in our online traffic cyber monday was a record setting day for our e commerce platform with record visits an excellent conversion rate and 3 times the demand of our previous highest day the rollout of bopis has also meant that our e commerce operation as a whole is now profitable in 2020 it will remain a major area of focus and opportunity finally our crm efforts will also be a major focus in 2020 our loyalty program big rewards also had another great quarter with record setting performance we ended q3 with 18 8 million active members another all time high adding 500 000 this quarter which is a 15 increase over last year we also achieved record loyalty program penetration for the sales and transactions in q3 the marketing team continues to do a very good job leveraging this base of loyal customers with messages through email social and digital channels we know our rewards members shop our stores more frequently and typically drive a bigger basket highlighting the importance of these loyal customers alongside these growth initiatives we continue to focus on driving savings through our fund the journey initiative and jonathan will speak more to that in a moment we are taking a highly disciplined approach to both opex and capex and while some of these savings are being reinvested to support our growth initiatives the sustainable benefits they deliver will continue beyond these investments in summary we expect to close out 2019 on a positive note and as we enter 2020 we do so with the expectation that accelerated top line growth discipline and judicious management of operating expenses and lower capex is expected to drive a significant improvement in normalized free cash flow before handing over i would like to take a moment to welcome a new member to the executive team andrej mueller recently joined big lots as the executive vice president of business strategy this is an

results and will return to make some closing remarks in a few moments lisa bachmann executive vice president chief merchandising officer and chief operating officer thank you and good morning everyone total sales increased 1 6 in the third quarter and comps were essentially flat which was in line with our guidance from a merchandise category perspective furniture was the top performer comping up mid single digits which is on top of a 12 5 increase last year all four departments that is mattresses upholstery case goods and ready to assemble were up in q3 with mattresses posting a low double digit increase driven by our transition to the sealy assortment which is now complete and has stepped up newness in our better and best assortment upholstery was driven by our motion sets and sectionals our casegoods experienced strong sales in our master bedroom offerings our two financing options for in store purchases remained very popular and continue to perform very well easy leasing the lease to purchase program offered through progressive grew double digits in q3 with penetration of furniture sales in the low 20 range once again this quarter this is quite an accomplishment considering the highly successful labor day promotion we ran last year and the big lots credit card had another excellent quarter with significant growth not only in furniture transactions but across all other categories in the store we re improving the card program with refreshed creative more prominent in store signage a new card design and the addition of exclusive events for cardholders seasonal was up low single digits in the quarter which is on top of the nearly 8 increase for the same period last year q3 is a transition quarter for our seasonal business as we sell through our outdoor living assortments remaining from spring we set and sell through halloween and harvest and then quickly turn our attention toward the holidays and christmas trend i m pleased to report we exit lawn and garden in summer quite well we had good results in halloween and early christmas trends look promising our seasonal business comped up in all three months of the third quarter with sales accelerating to mid single digit range in october consumables was also up low single digits congratulations to the team who are celebrating their fourth consecutive quarter of positive comps the performance in q3 was broad based with all five departments posting increases and it was consistent with positive comps in each month of the quarter similar to q2 we experienced strength and cleaning aids in our housekeeping business in our never out sets in health and beauty paper and pet also posted good results in the quarter in part by leveraging new presentations on themed and caps soft home was essentially flat in q3 fashion bedding home decor and home organization were strong in the third quarter but offset by declines in other categories specifically window we recently launched dream street our own brand in new bedding storage furniture and decorative accessories this fill the white space opportunity in the soft home category and repurposed space vacated by stationery from earlier this year food was down in q3 as planned some bright spots included candy snacks and beverages where we are increasing space as part of the traffic driver initiative bruce discussed a few moments ago it was offset by a softness in staple type items once again this quarter we continue to see encouraging trends coming from our food reset that was completed at the beginning of q2 which redirected inventory and space to entertaining categories where we have a high permission to play and finally hard home and electronics toys accessories were down in q3 reflecting a strategic decision to move space to other categories however we did see good performance in kitchen appliances and tabletop now let me address the topic of import tariffs since the first announcement well over a year ago we have been carefully reviewing the products on each of the four lists and assessing the potential impact we have developed short term measures including working with manufacturers to reduce overall costs adjusting retail prices where appropriate evaluating the overall number of units purchased and in some cases absorbing the impact in margin in addition the team has successfully expanded its global sourcing and we see an even greater opportunity over the next several years to further reduce our china exposure before handing the call over i want to take a moment to thank our team for their extraordinary efforts and unwavering support to fuel our operation north star growth strategies the team has spent countless hours working on the rollout of these initiatives while working very hard to deliver q4 our most important quarter of the year i truly appreciate their partnership and support during this transformation and i m confident we ll close this year with strength and carry the momentum into 2020 i ll now turn the call over to jonathan for insight on the numbers and our guidance for 2019 jonathan ramsden executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer good morning everyone and thanks lisa and i would like to add my thanks to our entire team for their incredible hard work and commitment during this period of significant change for the company net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 were 1 168 billion up 1 6 versus the 1 149 billion we reported last year the increase in total sales resulted from sales growth in high volume new and relocated stores not included in the comp base and a higher store count year over year comparable sales for stores open at least 15 months plus e commerce sales decreased 0 1 compared to our guidance of approximately flat in terms of the cadence throughout the quarter sales trends were slow in the month of august toughest comparison to the last year but improved sequentially in september and october in line with our expectations coming into the quarter the adjusted net loss for the third quarter was 7 million or 0 18 per share which compares to our guidance of a net loss of 0 15 to 0 25 per share and to last year s q3 net loss of 6 6 million or 0 16 per share the gross margin rate for q3 was 39 7 which was down 20 basis points from last year s third quarter rate as anticipated a higher markdown rate in promotional selling was only partially offset by continued favorability in merchandise mix and shrink total adjusted expense dollars were 468 million down slightly from the 469 million we reported last year the adjusted expense rate in q3 was 40 1 70 basis points improvement versus last year expense leverage resulted from lower store payroll and corporate headquarters expense partially offset by higher depreciation occupancy and other charges interest expense for the quarter was 5 4 million compared to 3 1 million last year reflecting higher average debt and a higher average interest rate compared to last year the adjusted income tax benefit rate in q3 was 31 7 which was lower than last year s rate of 48 1 which benefited from a number of discrete items moving on to the balance sheet inventory ended the third quarter of fiscal 2019 of 1 117 billion compared to 1 074 billion last year with the 4 increase coming from planned year over year sales increases and inventory builds in certain merchandise categories including furniture and soft home during q3 we opened 21 stores and closed 14 stores leaving us with 1 418 stores and total selling square footage of 32 million capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2019 was 69 million additionally the company has reinvested approximately 69 million of the proceeds from the sale of our legacy california dc to exercise a purchase option on our corporate headquarters real estate here in columbus effective through a qualified intermediary to accommodate a 10 31 tax deferred exchange the sale of our legacy dc in rancho cucamonga california which was completed at the end of the quarter realized proceeds of approximately 190 million electing a 10 31 exchange and purchasing our headquarters building enabled us to defer approximately 15 million of taxes that would otherwise have been payable on that sale in addition to which we will eliminate approximately 6 million in annual lease payments going forward net of the reinvestment proceeds from the sale of the california dc were used to pay down a portion of our revolver debt at the end of the quarter we had 501 million of long term debt compared to 488 million a year ago at quarter end total debt included 68 million relating to the secured equipment term agreement we entered into at the beginning of the quarter proceeds from which were used to pay down our revolver as announced in a separate press release earlier today on december 4 2019 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0 30 per common share this dividend payment of approximately 12 million is payable on december 30 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on december 16 year to date approximately 87 million has been returned to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments now turning to forward guidance for q4 we expect eps to be in the range of 2 40 to 2 55 per diluted share which compares to net income of 2 68 per diluted share for the same period last year our guidance assumes comparable sales increasing slightly with the positive spread to total sales growth similar to q3 the growth in total sales reflects more productive new store openings as well as a slightly higher year over year store count we expect our gross margin rate for the fourth quarter to remain under pressure driven in part by absorbing some of the impact from tariffs as well as from anticipated higher levels of promotional selling fourth quarter expenses will be adversely affected by the year over year restoration of bonus accruals california dc transition costs and other items mitigated by our continued excellent progress on fund from the journey savings in terms of our outlook for the full year we are maintaining our guidance for adjusted net income to be in the range of 3 70 to 3 85 per diluted share which compares to last year s adjusted eps of 4 04 as is been in the case in the past quarterly eps figures were not sum to the full year figure due to the impact of the timing of share repurchases on the calculation inventory on hand at the end of q4 is expected to be down slightly to last year reflecting a favorable inventory to sales trend coming into 2020 q4 ending inventory will include the impact of investments we are making to prepare for the broyhill rollout and also some transitionally inventory build relating to the move to our new california dc we foresee ending fiscal 2019 with total long term debt close to or somewhat lower than the prior year figure of 374 million full year capital expenditures excluding the like kind exchange of the columbus headquarters building are expected to be approximately 250 million as bruce referenced earlier we are committed to a highly disciplined approach to operating and capital expenditure management regarding capex we are planning for a significant reduction in expenditures in 2020 below the figure of 250 million i just referenced alongside that our efforts to increase the savings from our fund the journey initiative will continue we previously spoke to 100 million opportunity from this initiative over a three year period based on the work we have done since that initial estimate we now expect to exceed that goal by the end of 2020 and then we will continue to drive the overall figure higher as a reminder these savings are gross and encompass both gross margin and sg a benefits portion of which will be offset by growth investments we will provide an update in more detail at our investor event in march all of our commentary has been on a non gaap basis which excludes the gain on the sale of our distribution center in rancho cucamonga california and costs associated with our strategic transformation merchandise category exits and legal settlement contingencies in our press release we provided gaap guidance for fiscal 2019 the level of non gaap activity on an after tax basis is approximately 98 1 million or 2 49 per diluted share for the fiscal year i ll now turn the call back over to bruce bruce thorn president chief executive officer thanks jonathan before we open the lines for questions i want to share a few closing comments over the thanksgiving weekend i walked to our stores and i believe the product assortments and value propositions look very good our merchandise strategy is anchored on trend right tasteful assortments coordinated across the categories of furniture christmas trend soft and hard home consumables food and toys create relevance because they are a destination for our customer as she prepares for the holidays at this point in the season it comes down to one thing execution which is all about our people i want to take a moment to thank our associates in the field our distribution centers and here in the corporate office for their dedication passion and contributions we ve been facing uncertainty in our business a result of a highly competitive and evolving retail environment the trade war and the impact of tariffs and the team has been working very hard to transform our company as part of operation north star as i mentioned in my opening remarks i am confident we will navigate through this environment to deliver a good outcome for 2019 and i m also confident that 2020 will be a year of significantly improved performance for the company as the fruits of all these efforts start to be realized i ll now turn the call back over to andy andrew d regrut vice president investor relations thanks bruce kevin we would now like to open the lines for questions questions and answers operator thank you we ll now be conducting a question and answer session our first question today is coming from brad thomas from keybanc capital markets your line is now live brad thomas keybanc capital markets analyst hey good morning everybody thank you for taking the question i was hoping you could give us a little bit more of a preview of what you might tell us in march about 2020 and talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes from a margin standpoint and how you may be able to stabilize or drive some margin opportunity jonathan ramsden executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer sure brad good morning it s jonathan yes so i think the headlines of what we are speaking to you for 2020 are first of all an acceleration in the comp that we spoke to and bruce enumerated a number of the drivers that we expect will drive that come forward and we can certainly go back over those as that s helpful we do plan to reduce capex meaningfully in 2020 we have some very high return projects that we will still be moving forward with including store of the future but we are confident we can get that capex figure down and then as we referenced earlier in the comments we expect to drive ebit and eps improvement the eps improvement will be somewhat greater than ebit due to lower debt levels year over year but we are confident that we are on a track to deliver all of those things we still have obviously a lot of work to do before we fully lock down the plan and there is some still some investment decisions we have to make but we are confident at this point in those broad parameters for 2020 in terms of the gross margin rate just a couple of comments on that yes we have got the tariff cost impact built into that we have our mitigating actions offsetting that including working with our vendors passing some of that impact along in terms of higher aurs and absorbing some of it in gross margin we will have a favorable mix benefit in 2020 on gross margin rate which is important but we re also providing in our outlook or in our thinking at least the expectation that we ll also continue to need to be more promotional so all of those things are baked in to our outlook at this point for 2020 brad thomas keybanc capital markets analyst very helpful and if i could ask a follow up on guidance for 4q obviously you ve given the eps range but could you help us fine tune our models in terms of your thinking on some of the gross margin and sg a puts and takes for 4q jonathan ramsden executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer yes i mean a little i mean we said we expect slight improvement in comps and we believe we re on track to do that we are going to continue to have some gross margin rate pressure as we did in q3 partly from absorbing some of the tariff impact but also from some increased plan increased promotional activity and then as i alluded to a couple of minutes ago there are some expense headwinds in q4 that we re lapping which weren t there in q3 particularly with regard to the restoration of the bonus accrual and also some transition costs as we complete the transition of the california dc so we are prepared to a few months leasing back the facility until we re fully transition so there is an incremental couple of million of expense in q4 related to that so i think gross margin rate pressure continues and expense in q4 is more challenging than it was in q3 because primarily because of those two items brad thomas keybanc capital markets analyst that s very helpful thank you jonathan and good luck in keeping up the momentum through 4q jonathan ramsden executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer thank you operator thank you our next question today is coming from peter keith from piper jaffray your line is now live peter keith piper jaffray analyst hi good morning everyone i wanted to dig into a few of the categories more specifically the the food category which i know you talked about it earlier in the year trying to be more focused on event so it sounds like you had that all set at the end of q2 but the food category was still down in q3 could you give us a thought on how that might trend with q4 and the tougher compare and then looking at to 2020 lisa bachmann executive vice president chief merchandising officer and chief operating officer good morning peter food as you commented was down in q3 and i do want to say that was we were planned to be down in q3 as we ve talked about we ve continued to move space away from food especially within the stable staple type of items we have leaned into some of the entertaining types of product that excuse me like the gift giving for food as well as our snacks beverage and candy all of which have been a nice bright light for us that space has been moved over into the consumable categories where we ve continued to expand some of our national brands and as you can see with the results in consumables we continue to see the positive growth as a result of moving that space so as we look to q4 again we believe that food will be slightly down that s embedded into our forecast and we will continue to support the efforts of north star initiative which will again for next year look to move additional space to consumables operator thank you our next question is coming from joseph feldman from telsey advisory group your line is now live joseph feldman telsey advisory group analyst hi guys good morning thanks for taking the question actually did i also wanted to ask a little more detail on that reallocation of the food you mentioned it s going toward entertainment and you guys feel you have a right to play in the space can you talk a little more about that and like what type of products within entertainment and just to help clarify that lisa bachmann executive vice president chief merchandising officer and chief operating officer sure again a lot of what we ve looked at here is a combination of some of the consumer insight studies that we ve done at the beginning of the year as well as testing that we ve done in our point of sale results so when we talk about entertaining food we re really leaning into things like snack so salty snacks candy beverages and during fourth quarter we actually do a very nice business with our food gifts and so those are the categories that we re going to provide more and more space for more offerings for jennifer and really move away not eliminate but move away from some of the staple items that we currently carry bruce thorn president chief executive officer yes and joseph this is bruce if i can add just a little bit more on to what lisa said we re thinning down some of the food staples where in the past we may have had multiple types of catch up or canopies that are very competitive in the marketplace or slim down that staples invest into the areas we know we can win in and then take some of that space and like she mentioned earlier give that to a more competitive position that we have and consumables which is house cleaning etc and so its planned down its expected down but in the areas we want to play we want to be able to win joseph feldman telsey advisory group analyst got it got it and if i could follow up bruce your comment at the very start of the call you said fourth quarter is off to a really solid start and then the guidance for the comp was just up slightly i guess is that what you meant to say i guess when i heard you say that i got more excited that maybe it was you could do a plus one maybe even more than that this quarter i m just trying to reconcile the two comments bruce thorn president chief executive officer you get to tease that comp out i mean aren t you joseph yes look the way i feel about fourth quarter is that first off i think we ve got a really healthy customer out there the sentiment customer consumer sentiment is strong confidence still seems strong all accounts we re seeing healthy progress when we take this thanksgiving shift that s happening in the fourth quarter and compared to other years like that and put that into our plan and look at the performance we had across black friday cyber monday and cyber monday weeks ongoing we feel very good about how we re performing against plan albeit it s early in the quarter so we re still we still got nearly almost two months left to go but we re really pleased with the strong performance against our plan for the fourth quarter at this point jonathan ramsden executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer i ll just add to that joseph just a reminder that we are up against that calendar shift so whatever comp we deliver is in fact stronger than that because of the adverse calendar shift effect joseph feldman telsey advisory group analyst thank you for that and good luck with the quarter guys i appreciate it jonathan ramsden executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer thank you joseph operator thank you our next question today is coming from karen short from barclays your line is now live renato basanta barclays analyst hey good morning this is actually renato basanta on the line for karen so my first question is really on the story of the future performance but more specifically it s a year two performance i think you had quite a few stores that recently anniversaried the remodel so i was hoping you could talk about performance there specifically if you can talk to the year two left and the gap in performance versus the rest of the chain that would be helpful thanks bruce thorn president chief executive officer hi renato this is bruce i will take it and if others want to join they will follow up first off i just want to reiterate we re very pleased with our store of the future progress it continues to be a great platform for us to build more and more growth shoots on top of i ll just reiterate a high single digit lift year one year two we ve got some more markets and the best way i would sum it up as they continue to perform better than our legacy stores which is encouraging the return continues to be strong i mean double or actually double our weighted average cost of return and then also what i really like about it and we ve mentioned it before is that it really puts our showcase categories right upfront from the furniture the soft home the seasonal all upfront low side visions to the back where you can see the pantry the food and consumables it s a great way to shop and as we look toward the future we re taking this phased approach we ve got a lot of good things coming out of operation north star that we re going to be able to phase in and hang on to the store of the future in fact the way we start thinking about store of the future right now is in terms of years so what we re talking about for next year store of the future 2020 which will start including the lot it will start including the queue traffic drivers will be in it increased density and so on so we re really excited about how the store of the future 2020 is going to evolve and keep getting better so to answer your question we feel good about it and year two is performing better than legacy jonathan ramsden executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer i ll just add from a capital standpoint bruce mentioned the lot in queue line and we re seeing very very strong returns on investment on those initiatives so we are prioritizing rolling those initiatives out to our existing store of the future stores to continue to drive as bruce referenced to continue to drive forward the performance of those stores alongside that we will absolutely be continuing with our store of the future rollout on a similar or slightly accelerated pace to 2019 renato basanta barclays analyst okay that s helpful and then just a question on inventory it s running a bit higher than sales growth how are you feeling today about the levels and makeup of your inventory and when should we expect inventory to grow more in line with sales growth lisa bachmann executive vice president chief merchandising officer and chief operating officer i ll jump in there and start on the category basis our largest investment coming out of q3 and inventory was positioned in furniture and as we had mentioned in the earlier remarks furniture was up mid single digits in q3 and that comp continue to build throughout the quarter and actually straight into november as well so the inventory positioning there is really in line with sales and our expectation for fourth quarter and we saw strong results as in thanksgiving and black friday as well the other portion of our inventories within the soft home category and again we re very well positioned for fourth quarter performance we do very strong businesses with our cold weather product and we also just launched our own brand dream street which is the children decor product and seeding so we re really feeling very good about where that increase in inventory is positioned as we head through the quarter and we end the quarter for q4 we re currently forecasting to come in slightly down to last year which will well position us as we make the turn into 2020 renato basanta barclays analyst okay that s helpful and then just my last question is really about your store footprint i think you ve talked in the past about net positive store growth as we look to next year and beyond i was hoping you could flesh out your thoughts on store growth and why sort of an environment where most retailers are scaling back on physical stores you feel like you can grow the store fleet thank you bruce thorn president chief executive officer yes renato bruce here and then i ll hand it off to jonathan to get some more specifics from our research study early on last year in operation north star we did a geographical study of all the markets we play and the competitive set and our ability to grow it gave us great support and understanding that our footprint could expand and in areas that we didn t think possible so that is now becoming part of our real estate strategy it s taken a while to build that back up again we ve done a nice job over the last several years in terms of cleaning up our fleet of stores to a very productive amount of stores and as we look at our competitive set the things that we re adding what our customers are saying it does look like we have expansion opportunity along with increased presence in e com especially with the use of bopus so becoming more of an omni channel customer and becoming more convenient to our customer is definitely a growth strategy for us with that in mind we re slightly net positive stores in 2019 this year we will continue in 2020 and then 21 could mean an acceleration of that jonathan ramsden executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer and just to add a couple of more data points around that i think you re seeing in q3 an acceleration of the spread between comp and total reported sales to a very healthy level we anticipate that to continue in q4 and through 2020 and frankly beyond as bruce just referenced so that s going to be we think an important part of our growth and it s about opening more continue to open more productive new stores but also we re looking very closely at store closures we ve been closing a lot of stores over the past few years and we re looking at how we can go through that lower tier of underperforming stores and you take actions that will enable them to be profitable and provide a good return going forward and that will be another way that we can continue to drive that non component of our growth renato basanta barclays analyst okay great that s very helpful best of luck jonathan ramsden executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer thank you bruce thorn president chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from paul trussell from deutsche bank your line is now live paul trussell deutsche bank analyst hey good morning bruce thorn president chief executive officer good morning paul paul trussell deutsche bank analyst solid results can we talk a little bit about one is just the home category especially the soft home category and what you re seeing there and how you re thinking about that business on the go forward basis and then separately and completely different i would love to for you to give a few more details around e commerce especially what you ve seen as you rolled out bopus and how you re thinking about scaling both on the top line and from a profitability standpoint thank you lisa bachmann executive vice president chief merchandising officer and chief operating officer good morning paul i ll start out talking a little bit about the home category and we really as you know within the store of the future of furniture and home is front and center and we feel very very good about the growth that we are experiencing and will continue to experience in the category as we look to broyhill i think that s some newness that we will be bringing into our assortment at the end of the year and throughout 2020 our broyhill own brand will be represented both in soft home as well as indoor outdoor furniture so within the soft home categories you ll see it in rug home decor and by the time we hit spring of 2020 you will also see an expansion within our never out programs across our towels our bedding so we feel very very strongly about our own brand presence and especially the impact that it will have on our furniture and soft home categories as i mentioned earlier the dream street launched just happened as well and every week we re seeing that volume build week over week so we feel very very confident about the growth of that category and again optimizing that also in 2020 bruce thorn president chief executive officer yes and i ll take the second part of that paul but just before i do that i just want to add on soft home 22 quarters of positive growth this last quarter just flattish with all the things we ve got going on behind dream street and everything that lisa mentioned we re feeling very strong about our positioning in soft home but now getting on to the e commerce bopus question in 2018 we did roughly 41 million in sales and in 2019 we are now on course to double more than double that we did 3 times of volume q3 over q3 and we re off to a really nice start we made a decision early in the year to really lean in and launch bopus earlier based off the customer insight studies that we conducted as part of operation north star and we think we ve got a bright future with bopus and e commerce and our stores working hand in hand together one thing that i m very excited about we re all very excited about is that we get great traffic to our website and that s many times a difficult thing for retailers not for us we get great traffic we know through the studies that we ve done that our customer starts many of our journeys online mobile device and they all over half of them have a amazon prime account so getting that traffic and being relevant for her is extremely important what we ve learned through this process is that we think we ve got a long runway of expanding bopus for the full year into 2020 we do have some fixes from a funnel discovery while its strong as you go through and view the card and try to work through it she has some difficulty there so we ve got some navigation work that we need to do and the teams all over that and also check out and then finally delivery we re looking at smart ways to minimize cost of delivery and make it more easy for her so a lot of things to come but being but we re being very circumspect about how we add cost to this model and maintain our profitability as we go strongly 2020 and beyond paul trussell deutsche bank analyst thanks for the color and best of luck bruce thorn president chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from jason haas from bank of america merrill lynch your line is now live jason haas bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks for taking my question could you discuss your progress toward the 100 million in cost takeout my understanding is that labor optimization was one of the first big pieces but just curious going forward kind of what other areas you re looking at to achieve that goal thanks jonathan ramsden executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer yes hey jason it s jonathan i ll be happy to take that yes so we ve spoken i think a couple of quarters back to 100 million opportunity which was coming sort of i think 40 million in 19 and 30 million incrementally in each of the next couple of years as we said in our prepared comments we think we re going to get year two and beyond the 100 million by the end of 2020 so we re running kind of well ahead of that schedule and we think there is significant upside opportunity beyond that figure and we will i thin we ll be able to give some more color on that when we get to the investor event in march the store labor was a big component of that the stores organization has done an outstanding job frankly throughout the year of taking cost out and the reorganization in that part of the business was a big driver of the reduction some of the so the fund the journey savings are a combination of about just one important caveat on that we were able to take that cost out in the stores while maintaining a very strong net promoter score so we were really pleased about that so just as a reminder the savings come both from gross margin and from sg a store labor was a meaningful piece there were some corporate headquarters savings that we implemented through the year we re working through what we call indirect spend goods not for resale we ve had good results on that so far but that s one of the areas where there s a lot more upside to come over the next year in particular and then on the gross margin components there are elements around what we call strategic vendor management to drive incremental benefit out of cogs also we re driving shrink here down we referenced in q3 we had a benefit from shrink and we think that s a great opportunity there going forward and also in some of our in store markdown so those various projects are all in different stages but i think the headline there is that we re confident that we re going to be pass the 100 million figure by the end of 2020 and that number is going to keep moving higher as we go forward jason haas bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you and then as a follow up i had a question somewhat similar on the guidance for the lower capex next year i think you said below 250 million and i m just trying to figure out what the drivers are of that based on the breakout that you had given for 2019 i m specifically curious if you found a way to lower the capex investment in the store of the future and then just reconciling that with the fact that you ll be rolling out the lot to more stores and then it sounds like the freezer cooler reductions will have some cost associated with it so any color there would be helpful thanks jonathan ramsden executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer yeah absolutely so i think a reasonable assumption at this point for 2020 will be capex in the range of around 200 million so 50 million or so lower than where we ve been this year to your point one of the big drivers of that is while we are continuing with the pace and even slight accelerating store of the future in 2020 we re getting the cost of that down significantly so we do that in a couple of different ways one is we re just continuing to identify which of the elements of that really are the most meaningful to our customer and reduce the cost per store we re also looking at some different tiering of store of the rollout so we have a sort of full model for the store of the future conversion but also a couple of slightly lighter versions of that where we don t incorporate all of the components that we do in the full and a big driver of that is something like flooring for example where we have new stores that we re converting where we are finding we don t need to spend as much on redoing the floors in those stores and that has been a big driver of the expense in the full model of the store of the future some other same as around fixturing some other items in the full store remodel that we are selectively taking out of some of the lower tier conversions and then on a like for like basis the full conversion is also coming down relative to where we were so stores of the future capex is a big driver of that reduction there are some other puts and takes but that s certainly one of the major components bruce thorn president chief executive officer and if i could just add on in terms of adding the lot one of the things we love about the lot is that it gives like we said the store 1 to 2 comp lift it s 500 square feet it s minimal investment in capex and opex and it s a really nice roi so while we re rolling it out which will be at least 700 ish plus stores next year it s not capital intensive jason haas bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it that makes sense and if i could flip in a really quick follow up i m just curious if you could provide an update for the e commerce sales and ebit guidance i think on the last call it was you had said you would be over 55 million in terms of sales i m not sure if there s any update you provide there that would be helpful thanks bruce thorn president chief executive officer yes jason i ll give you that update happy to state that we re exceeding that we should be over 2 times of what we were last year jonathan ramsden executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer just add one point to my prior comment one of the other drivers of the capex reduction is the av dc investment rolling off in 2020 jason haas bank of america merrill lynch analyst of course okay that makes sense thank you bruce thorn president chief executive officer thank you operator

white house it s the economy stupid has been a catchphrase of u s presidential politics since the 1992 campaign when bill clinton unseated incumbent george h w bush nearly three decades later u s president donald trump is hoping that simple message in 2020 will help foil his eventual democratic party challenger trump in tweets at political rallies and in remarks to reporters constantly emphasizes the performance of the u s economy stock market surges low unemployment rates and his tax cuts to boast he is doing a great job as president economists and political analysts are divided on whether that message will enable the incumbent to stay in office beyond january 2021 culture war partisan split ever since clinton we ve all kind of assumed that should be true and i think for the most part it is said ryan mcmaken senior editor and economist at the mises institute a politics and economics research group in alabama he cautioned though that trump finds himself on one side of a culture war that his predecessors did not have to confront as well as a deep partisan divide on consumer confidence policy analyst james pethokoukis at the washington based american enterprise institute a public policy research group also is cautious about the economy prevailing over all other issues just having a strong economy is not going to guarantee you re election he said people often point back to the 2000 election which occurred after a decade of tremendous economic growth any way you want to measure it gross domestic product jobs and wage growth and yet al gore still lost that election to george w bush mcmaken questioned whether voters in key swing states such as wisconsin michigan pennsylvania and ohio who cast ballots for trump in 2016 were experiencing enough of the touted economic performance to vote again for the president overall however it s not a bad economy to run on if you re donald trump said pethokoukis trump said to have concerns about the direction of the economy ahead of next november s election will likely push for more tax cuts passage of a renegotiated north american trade pact and continued pressure on the country s central banking system the federal reserve to lower interest rates trouble ahead there are rumblings of economic storm clouds on the horizon the impact can be seen in trump s trade war with china which has hurt u s farmers and raised prices for consumer goods it s also reflected in the institute for supply management s manufacturing index an underperforming u s private sector job quality index and a ballooning record national debt in addition to the worrying level of money owed to creditors by middle class americans we ve actually been in a sort of a manufacturing recession seen a shrinkage of factory jobs the exact kinds of jobs that i m sure that people voting for the president thought would be a lot better now said pethokoukis so far none of this has prompted a major stock market correction there seems to be a lot of adaptations in the markets to trump s america that may work to his advantage said the mises institute s mcmaken analysts note a lack of emphasis on economic platforms so far by the leading democratic u s presidential candidates seeking to oust trump next year but such a platform is likely to be touted when the opposition party holds its convention next july in milwaukee and picks its campaign ticket pethokoukis suggested the democratic party should devise a plan with a goal to boost american worker productivity which has flatlined for years the great divide mcmaken pointed out that the widening chasm between the well off and those struggling economically in the united states makes trump vulnerable something emphasized by left leaning democratic presidential contenders such as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren on the ground level i would say just in general the economy isn t doing as well concluded mcmaken amid an impeachment drive by the democrats trump is repeatedly hammering on a specific message to those questioning his suitability for office while being impressed with the performance of their pension accounts during his presidency love me or hate me you ve got to vote for me trump said at a rally in new hampshire in august warning that americans investments portfolios would go down the tubes if he lost next year s election
democratic socialists of america dsa and its two predecessor organizations the democratic socialist organizing committee dsoc and the new american movement nam emerged in the early 1970s during a long term rightist movement in the united states the dsa s contribution to the american left was its new founded identity as a radical organization born out of a merger between the dsoc and nam dsa also sought to become a democratic socialist party which fostered the inclusion members similar to that of the bernie sander s presidential campaigns 2016 2020 nevertheless it was under the leadership of dsa michael harrington s penetrating critique of american culture in the other america 1963 that catalyzed the nascent civil rights movement its leaders and the kennedy administrations to prioritize combating racism poverty and inequality this in turn set the stage for martin luther king s poor people s campaign and eventually king s denunciation of american global hegemony these events thus presaged the johnson administration s great society war on poverty the foundations of democratic socialism and in root the dsa have its origins in the eighteenth century during the breakdown of feudal europe specifically england where the medieval guilds and the protection of workers rights was subsequently replaced as a commodity or as marx describes as commodity fetishism the emergence of capitalism during this period further reinforced the domination of capital over labor and the horror this unleashed on labor in the industrial revolution confronting this crisis were religious leaders bishop joseph butler and reverend john wesley philosophers and economic reformers john locke and adam smith arguing that labor creates profit and value not capital moreover they argued that workers possess a property right to the profits and value they create this implied that labor rightfully must direct the control of capital since this determines how and to whom surplus value will be distributed in a democratic manner robert owen and the industrial revolution the origins of this position can be traced to such reformers as robert owen i argue that owen s model represents the initial development of what today has become known as democratic socialism the injustices and oppression of the industrial revolution provided the context for a democratic socialist economy movement led by robert owen 1771 1858 and the utopian socialists private property understood as the exclusive right of industrialists was identified as the source of existing exploitation and inequality while the industrial revolution brought about unprecedented wealth it is without question that only capitalists received the lion s share though labor created massive profits surplus value for the capitalist class labor received a subsistence wage barely enough to survive owen and the utopian socialists sought to counter this injustice by opting for labor s democratic ownership of capital and the surplus value labor produced put in other terms labor had a property right to the profits they created the industrial revolution that gathered momentum in eighteenth century europe and the united states created the historical context for democratic socialism utopians argued that private property capital was the source of existing inequalities but the framework of their thought based on conceptions of a preindustrial society is today remote the extensive development of factory production and the social conditions that ensued and the laissez faire interpretation of these events favored by conventional economists created the conditions in which modern socialism was born nonetheless the industrial revolution brought about unprecedented increases in productivity based on the development of factories and the widespread use of machinery the major cost of these innovations was borne by society s least powerful the working class or for all intents and purposes the vast majority of poor in 1750 the working class in europe specifically england and the united states lived near subsistence levels and the purchasing power of wages deteriorated considerably during the second half of the eighteenth century national income grew over this period so that workers relative living standards fell and the potential consumption they involuntarily sacrificed financed the investment required for industrialization had working class incomes kept in step with national income the average worker would have been approximately 50 percent richer in 1840 than thirty years earlier the industrial revolution replaced traditional occupations typically rural farming or guild status as an artisan in various crafts this change resulted from the breakdown of the old feudal societies of europe and the industrialization of those same economies due to mechanistic innovations in the means of production mechanization facilitated the division of labor creating tasks that women and children could perform entire families often worked to achieve subsistence the conditions under which labor was performed were unregulated and dangerous and involved long hours in dehumanizing conditions moreover the growth of factory production stimulated urbanization in europe and the united states as a result roads water sewage waste management public health and provisions for open spaces failed to keep pace with urban migration while housing was concentrated in crowded slums the inevitable result manifested itself in air and water pollution epidemics of typhoid and cholera and widespread respiratory and intestinal disease with a consequent low expectation of life successive administrations in england specifically during the nineteenth century industrial revolution were slow to intervene and remedy social problems and maintain the price of bread and impeded or subverted the development of trade unions within this context it can be asserted that the period of napoleonic war and the subsequent economic crisis constituted the bleakest chapter in british labor history precisely because the foundations of modern industry were erected on the suffering of workers denied access to the fruits of an expanding economy by contrast capitalists enjoyed absolute power over their labor force thus the industrial revolution created the modern working class nominally free but able to live only by selling their labor power suffice it to say britain witnessed a considerable development of radical economic doctrines in the first half of the nineteenth century the radical response owen s prestige was based on his reputation as a businessman an economic theorist and a social reformer from the age of ten he served as a draper s apprentice but at twenty he was the manager of a large cotton factory at new lanark which became renowned throughout britain for its conditions of work owen was a benevolent autocrat who insisted on strict industrial discipline but in combination with living wages a decent work environment abolition of child labor and compulsory education for workers children the profitability of new lanark demonstrated the shortsightedness of other capitalists notion that profit maximization is best achieved through the alienation and exploitation of labor new lanark provided a viable moral counter strategy to neoliberal market rationality late eighteenth and early nineteenth century industrialization rested on three sets of institutional principles 1 the absolute nature of private property 2 a self regulating laissez faire market economy and 3 the transformation of labor into a commodity while owen accepted industrial innovations he did not agree with the unrestrained rule of private capital self regulating markets and the exploitation of human labor he argued these three economic truths were the ultimate causes of contemporary inequalities and social injustice and thus urged their elimination owen believed that an industrial economy if it is to be moral must be created based on the principles that every person must be treated with dignity and the proceeds of production were divided equitably the operation of any economy was then to be criticized and evaluated according to such principles owen believed that a more just and efficient economy should be focused on his experimental model at new lanark thus owen s political economy was based on three important radical tenants the first tenant is based on what owen described as an economy of high wages owen held the view that a wage increase or higher labor costs leads to 1 an improvement in the living standards of workers 2 which then leads to greater efficiency and production by workers in other words increased wages generate additional revenue for both company and workers yet owen s theory conflicted with the prevailing orthodoxy which argued that any wage increase occurred at the expense of profits and hence led to a diminution in employment and economic activity nevertheless by extending the economy of high wages from an individual firm to the nation owen embraced an embryonic under consumption theory of depressions he advocated a high wage policy that maintained purchasing power as a cure for unemployment and promotion of economic growth the second tenant on which owen based his political economy was a belief that an individualistic economy is inequitable irrational and antisocial moreover private ownership is an institution whereby one class gains power over the rest in order to maximize profits in contrast owen did not attack industry or new technology as it manifested itself in the burgeoning industrial revolution rather he denounced private ownership of the means of production the spread of unfettered and unregulated economic competition and elements of narcissistic individualism propagated through enlightenment liberalism owen argued to the contrary that private ownership and unrestrained competition destroys social cohesion furthermore he argued that individuals by themselves cannot simply improve their own lot in life rather it was within the context of a community and its many support networks that the betterment of individuals was realized the third tenant is based on owen s labor theory of value premised upon the priority of labor he viewed human labor as the natural standard of value and that this concept required capital and machinery to become the servant of labor owen believed that capital and profit are designed to serve the human person and community as its first moral priority public policy and not the market should determine the amount of labor expended on commodities and workers ought to be compensated based on both human needs and effort owen argued for economic cooperation rather than competition through a network of self governing communes where private ownership of the means of production was transformed into a democratic alliance eliminating any labor ownership conflict owen argued that capital and profit should never come at the expense of labor owen as social reformer owen s career as a national reformer can be understood in different stages between the publication of towards a new view of society in 1813 and a report to the county of lanark in 1821 he concentrated on ameliorating existing social problems such as poverty child labor inhumane work hours and unemployment he thought that these social injustices could be avoided if other manufacturers replicated new lanark on grounds of enlightened self interest indeed his arguments applied to capitalists more concerned with long term profitability than with immediate gains but he found that his appeals met with little response he then attempted to persuade government to alleviate poverty and inequality and was popular in official circles after 1815 only by virtue of the fact that he focused on the importance of environmental improvements more than his personal brand of socialism as he advanced beyond the role of wealthy philanthropist to structural reforms that threatened the establishment power centers he became decreasingly influential in elite circles between 1824 1835 owen established what he described as communist communities the cities of orbiston near glasgow tytherley in hampshire and new harmony in indiana were three of the most prominent the aim was to settle unemployed laborers on the land in self governed villages of unity and cooperation such schemes reflected his conviction that society as then constituted would permit cooperatives to supplant existing institutional structures owen did this by attempting to persuade the rich and influential about his ideas for social and economic transformation nevertheless the owenite settlements were challenged partly because of the hostile external environment of the business community and the agricultural depression which generated an influx of unemployed workers which exceeded capacity consequently an excess supply of labor to the villages of cooperation proved counterproductive to the communist communities yet not insurmountable owen persisted in his collectivist experimentations in 1824 the london co operative society was formed as a store for cooperative trading designed to supersede competitive distribution and allow craftsmen to exchange goods without capitalist intermediaries it aimed to sell at trade prices and use the savings accumulated through elimination of retailers profits to financially bolster socialist communities the next envisaged stage of development involved members cooperation to produce directly for each other rather than choosing between capitalist goods sold in their stores for example the london society opened an exchange bazaar for societies and individuals to engage in mutual exchange owen returned from the united states in 1829 after establishing more than three hundred cooperative societies in the united states and england this figure rose to almost five hundred by 1832 although many pursued solely educational objectives cooperative stores bought wholesale and sold retail the commodities demanded by their members but cooperative producers faced the difficult problem of obtaining a market for all their products this problem stimulated development of labor exchanges where workmen and producers cooperatives could exchange products directly and thus dispense with both employers and merchants the most important such institution the national equitable labor exchange was established by owen in 1832 and stimulated the formation of similar exchanges in provincial cities they sought to secure a wider market for cooperative groups and to enable them to exchange their products at an equitable valuation resting on labor time owen appointed trade union valuers to price goods on the basis of the cost of raw materials plus the amount of labor time expended on them a new currency of labor notes was issued for the conduct of transactions crucial weaknesses emerged however labor and commercial prices coexisted goods the exchanges offered more cheaply were soon disposed of while the more expensive remained unsold exchanges would not control their stocks to demand levels and movements in the manner of capitalist retailers since they had to take what members brought them consequently they became overstocked where there were many cooperative producers and understocked in trades where there were few in particular their supplies were concentrated on goods that could be produced by craftsmen possessing little capital despite this major weakness they enjoyed considerable success for a time but collapsed in the general crash of the movement in 1834 even then some exchanges balanced their books while the national equitable labor exchange incurred a heavy debt which then fell to owen when owen returned to england in 1829 he found that a trade union movement had emerged after the repeal of the combination acts in 1824 and in 1829 he witnessed the formation of the first modern national union the operative spinners while this was happening the next two years saw much social unrest in the form of agricultural riots and a wave of strike activity in the northern textile towns as a means of achieving the eight hour workday then by 1832 several distinct but related bodies such as the owenite societies cooperative stores cooperative producers labor exchange and trade unions looked to owen for leadership most were growing rapidly as workers disillusioned by the terms of the 1832 reform act swung away from political mobilization toward organized labor action owen sought the fusion of these groups into one national organization centrally directed and under worker control which would challenge and transform economic relations through its practice of cooperative production by 1833 the operative builders union obu was the largest in the country with a membership of sixty thousand the obu adopted an owenite agenda to take over the construction industry and reorganize it as a national guild to implement this program none of its members would work for capitalist builders who refused to join the guild the owners attempted to destroy the obu by a lockout by forcing those reemployed to sign a document i e a written pledge not to join a union which gives the employer the right to fire them if they violate the pledge the workers lost as the obu simultaneously fought the lockout and attempted to launch the guild with inadequate financial resources its members were then forced back to work by various regions during 1834 and by the end of that year the obu ceased to exist it split into craft sections with a greatly reduced membership owen nevertheless sought to unite all the associations intended for the improvement of the working class to this end he inspired the formation of the grand national consolidated trades union gnctu which was intended to be a single inclusive union aiming to supersede capitalism by a cooperative system based on workers control of production it sought to implement on an economy wide basis a plan similar to the obu guild for construction ultimately the gnctu would control through its constituent members all industry thereby taking over the functions of capitalists parliament and local government it would become the locus of economic and ultimately political power the gnctu s formation was followed by feverish organization by discounting cooperative retail and producer societies unions alone attracted over one million members as with the obu owners reacted to the gnctu by presenting the document to workers with the threat of a lockout if not signed this response originated in derby it was imitated in other towns but derby remained the test struggle the workers lost being forced back to work after a lockout lasting four months given the repeal of the combination acts the case was pursued under the 1797 naval mutinies act which was never intended to apply to trade unions nonetheless this opportunity for the government to deter union organization arose because many unions adopted secret initiation ceremonies under the threat of employer retaliation as a result the gnctu encountered severe administrative problems the recruits it made and the disputes it faced were so abundant that urgent problems of management were inevitably ignored internal dissention developed and owen became disillusioned he hoped to initiate bloodless revolution by providing examples of the benefits derived from cooperation accordingly he dissolved the gnctu in august 1834 arguing for a return to education and the need for an ethical appeal in preference to coercion the gnctu faded away but some of its constituent groups and elements of its cooperative ideology remained owen returned to establishing villages of cooperation e g queenswood in 1839 and in 1844 the rochdale pioneers cooperative society developed from a local owenite body however after 1834 the thrust of working class agitation moved from industrial to political arenas focusing on the demands of the chartists the grand national consolidated trades union was undoubtedly a failure in its implementation yet it was attempting an impossible task that no leadership could have achieved this is because trade unions were still learning the art of organizing into a cohesive effective unit at the time workers were only able to accomplish sporadic results from organizing into unions and cooperatives however they were unable to achieve any sustained action by contrast having just won a significant political victory in the 1832 reform act factory owners and burgeoning industrialists were determined in their resolve to counter any form of organized labor movement or cooperative based industry they also possessed the support of a whig government determined to show that the reform act would not destroy property rights against such power workers were poorly paid uneducated and only beginning to understand the importance to organized efforts to seek improved working conditions and living wage salaries although owen s innovations beyond the sphere of new lanark failed during his lifetime he left an enduring legacy to the future of radical theory the influence of owen s would be 1 he established a personal example of one who cast aside his personal wealth in an endeavor to secure a more just future for others 2 the economic measures at new lanark illustrated that a policy of high wages and improved conditions need not destroy profitability 3 many of owen s theoretical innovations e g labor value to replace money as an equitable labor exchange are not inherently impractical 4 his theories of and attempts to establish workers cooperatives made owen the instigator of a significant movement of later times as developments from the rochdale pioneers of 1844 demonstrate and 5 owen s appreciation of the role of trade unions in replacing individual worker motivations by collective policy provided a clue to improving quantitative and qualitative living standards and also pointed to a force that could potentially be harnessed for achieving a future transformation of just and productive economic relations owen s approach to resolving economic injustice epitomized the utopian approach to resolving exploitation he hoped for individual conversion then government action yet this was an unrealistic ambition given the existing power structure at the time what owen lacked was a theory of class struggle believing instead that the transition to socialism or a more democratic economy would occur through the influence of reason and persuasion nevertheless the idea of reconciling capital and labor and owen s worker co operatives represents what is arguably the initial stages of democratic socialism in the tradition of michael harrington s democratic socialists of america and the radical legacy of bernie sanders cornel west and alexandria ocasio cortez notes marx in capital discusses the expropriation of agricultural land from the poor who are dependent on that very land for their basic needs the historical context of the enclosure movement was based on a policy measure initiated by the aristocracy and wealthy land owners in eighteenth and nineteenth century england the movement was aimed at confiscating land that was owned in common by a village or at least available to the village for grazing animals and growing food the enclosure movement was designed to expropriate village land and redistribute it to the aristocracy and wealthy for their ownership in 1845 british parliament passed the enclosure act of 1845 in which the british government started enclosing land walls fences or hedges and awarding this land to the aristocracy and wealthy land owners who arguably knew how to make more efficient use of it the consequence for the people who were using this land was often eviction sending many of them to slums in the cities in hopes of finding work in low paying jobs such as factory work spawned by the industrial revolution the most well known enclosure movements were in the british isles but the practice had its roots in the netherlands and caught on to some degree throughout northern europe and elsewhere as industrialization spread edward j martin graduate center for public policy and administration california state university long beach sign up for countercurrents daily news letter

analyzing the capacity of iran non oil exports to the region no 2 countries to create global interdependence and also to emerge of a global village is assumed to be one of the most important effects of the structural transformation in economy globalization phenomenon with regard to the growing trend of this novel phenomenon and the necessity for a broad participation of countries in international arena depicted the role of countries in international competitiveness more effectively this article reviews the capacity for iran export non oil to region no 2 using the gravity model during the period 2011 to 2015 the estimated results indicated that iran amongst countries in region no 2 had the highest potential export to iraq and the least potential allocated to armenia moreover the highest percentage of unused capacity of iran belonged to azerbaijan and the lowest unused capacity referred to armenia 1 introduction trade portrays an important role in the dynamism and countries economic growth most countries are anxious to expand trade with other countries and produce goods thanks to their comparative advantage in order to enlarge their economic growth one of the most important problems of developing countries is monocularity and their reliance on the exporting primary and raw materials which has left negative effects in the economic political social and even cultural structures whereas a large portion of iran foreign exchange earnings is obtained merely by issuing one item or more primary and raw materials whenever they are exposed to external pressures they tended to be extremely delicate and fragile at least in the long run obviously in such circumstances any abnormal fluctuations in the price of this commodity or the limited commodities that made up the main income sources would have a profound effect on their economic political social and even cultural structures the gravity model seeks to answer the question of why business relations are very strong among some countries in order to answer this question the variables in it especially the gap variable and gross domestic product are applied to highlight the causes of the development of international trade another advantage of this model is the business model test with availability and reliability of information data controllability and the number of appropriate variables gravity models are an appropriate tool for estimating trade potential and widely used in international trade to describe a bilateral trade flow in the international economy these models allow us to estimate bilateral trade potential at specific times and at the same time the exporting and importing countries perspectives can be foreseen in fact in the framework of this model existing barriers and constraints can be introduced into quantitative and qualitative variables and their impact on bilateral trade can be investigated iran has trade exchanges with 100 countries about 40 of which are the neighbored countries which if we add services surely more share of the volume of trade between iran and neighboring countries will increase for iran in recent years iraq has been one of the main export destinations and always been at the top of the list of 100 major countries of exporting destination according to the itc statistics in 2015 iraq has been exported to more than 5 8 billion and ranked second in iran s export markets turkey is ranked seventh in the list of 100 exporting destinations countries turkey non oil exports products accounted for 3 18 percent of iran s total export value on the other hand armenia has imported 3 billion and 500 million from other iranian neighbors of which 8 4 million of including 198 million in oil and gas armenia import referred to iran market according to existing reports iran is the 15th largest exporter to azerbaijan the total amount of azerbaijani exports in 2015 is 21 7 billion and the positive annual trade balance of 12 5 billion indicated its high financial potential for imports from iran in 2015 russia according to the same statistics imported totally 177 billion goods from the world its trade balance was approximately 156 billion in 2015 based on the customs of the islamic republic of iran reports the export of goods from iran to russia in 2015 was equivalent to 240 million currently iran domestic market facing a stagflation which has a negative effect on products competitiveness of in domestic and foreign markets which ultimately restricts their sale within and outside iran borders it is necessary to diversify the country s economy and provide suitable solutions to reduce reliance on oil revenues and tend to non oil exports spouting which can lead to lower inflation new job opportunities growth of productive investment and so on hence law reform especially in foreign trade sector attracting domestic and foreign investment as well as helping to strengthen the competitiveness of national economies in the international arena is urgent to increase the share of global trade therefore the present study has been carried out considering the importance of non oil exports getting out of the oil dependent economy the necessity to increase the gdp based revenue and exit from the stagflation iran s non oil export capacity to five neighboring countries was reviewed theoretical literatures the gravity model was introduced by tienbergen in 1963 and developed by linnman aitken in his article on gravity models matyas states that this model plays an important role in empirical studies especially in the field of business cycle forecasting and useful for policy analysis evenett and keller finestra marcosen and rose have extracted the gravity model from the theoretical model of huckcher o hallon or new ideas of international tradel anderson attempting to examine the theoretical basis of the gravity model further it has been expanded in 1979 to examine the architecture of commerce in canada after the country s trade with the united states which showed that comparison with trade in canadian domestic provinces was increased more than the trade of canadian border provinces with states of the united states therefore there is still no general basis for the gravity model although relatively few domestic studies have examined the factors affecting iranian trade and the interrelationship between trade and other economic variables a comprehensive study of the capacity and potential of exporting non oil goods to countries in region 2 has not been conducted using a gravity model with the ability to justify the new and innovative aspect of research table 1 2 methodology 2 1 sample data selection in this study the data covering the period 2005 2015 iran s non oil exports to five neighboring countries russia turkey armenia azerbaijan and iraq from trade map website and the iranian customs organization were used data on gross domestic product from the world bank website and the distance between tehran and capital of the trading countries have been extracted from the indo website 2 2 model and econometrics the gravity model that we take under consideration and use with variations has long been used table 1 summarizes the backgrounds of domestic and foreign research related to the topic the model form used is as follows l x i j t β 0 β 1 l g d p i t β 2 l g d p j t β 3 l p o p i t β 4 l p o p j t β 5 l d i j β 6 l e i t β 7 l e j t β 8 c o s x i m j β 9 d 1 β 10 d 2 u i j t l logarithm operator x ijt real export of the country i the

between the capital of dukshor and ij e jt and e it the real exchange rate of both countries i and j following these variables a set of virtual variables will be added to explain other effects on mutual trade flow in the country as follows d 1 the virtual variable of common border and d 2 is the virtual variables of the common religion which if there is a subscription between two countries consider one and otherwise zero cosm i m j exports exact index of country i to j country similarity between exporting and importing countries c o s x i m j k x i k m j k x i k 2 m j k 2 3 analysis of findings analysis of findings according to theoretical foundations we expect β 1 and β 2 to be positive the sign β 3 and β 4 can be positive or negative the β 5 sign should be negative as expected the sign β 7 and β 6 can be positive or negative and eventually the β 8 β 9 and β 10 mark should also be positive now after the model s approval phase we are looking for the best way to estimate potential trade flows between countries in region 2 which also includes individual effects for each trading country in other words it eliminates the heterogeneity bias according to similar studies in order to select the appropriate method for estimating the model the results of the f statistic and selecting between the fixed effect method and the random effects method are derived from the results of the hausman statistics in this test if h0 hypothesis rejected it shows there is a constant effect model and if h0 hypothesis accepted random effect model should be used for calculation the results indicated as follows table 2 according to the results of the hausman test we cannot rule out the zero hypotheses on the compatibility of the coefficients therefore the random effects method is chosen as a more efficient method also in terms of r2 the random effects method has more explanatory power and this is another confirmation of the choice of this method the f index also shows a much higher rate than the fixed effects method in the randomized effects method the results of this estimation show that the coefficient of gross domestic product variables which indicates the size of the economies of the countries is statistically significant and has a sign when gdp of importing country and gdp of exporting country increased one percent the volume of trade will increase by 1 8 and 0 07 respectively the smallness of this figure in relation to importing countries is indicative of the rivalry of these countries in the business in the case of f statistics table 3 the probability of accepting the h0 hypothesis is shown in parenthesis the country s population variable is negative which indicates that with one percent population increase in exporting countries their bilateral trade volume is reduced by 1 61 while the coefficient for the population of the importing country is 0 74 the negative coefficient of population in exporting countries suggests that the increase in population increase table 3 results of gravity model estimation by random effects method source researcher s computing domestic production and consumption and they are less inclined to bilateral trade the population positive coefficient in importing country states that the increase in population in these countries has not made them more intrusive and the demand for imports remains strong and it does not diminish the negative sign of exchange rate coefficients variable in exporting and importing countries indicates that the increase in exchange rate has led to a reduction in the volume of bilateral trade meanwhile the exchange rate in exporting countries is affected more the virtual variables of the common border and common religion between exporting and importing countries are 95 meaningful and have the expected positive sign the effect of these two variables on bilateral trade will increase 0 86 and 0 91 percent among exporting countries respectively the formation of regional convergence becomes smoother when there are cultural ethnic and linguistic commonalities among nations of a region distinguish the nations of a region from each other in the light of historical and a cultural tie in turn contributes to the growth of trade and other economic relations in the region the existence of historical and cultural ties will also enhance the sense of identity and share common interests and destinies among member states in a regional order strengthening the sense of regional collective identity and the general belief in having shared destiny contributes to the formation of joint institutions in the region and facilitates the process of regional convergence as the statistics of iraqi imports from iran show the distance variable is statistically significant and negatively as expected the distance coefficient of 0 13 percent indicates that countries with more distant countries tend to be less willing to enter into bilateral trade however given the small size of this coefficient and the presence of water land borders between the caspian coastal countries and their adjacency it can be argued that transport costs are not a serious obstacle to economic cooperation what links the countries of a regional geographic unit to each other is the existence of roads and networks the member states of a regional geographic unit may be connected by sea or through land the continuity of the member states of an open sea region is one of the ideal conditions for the transport of goods easier and cheaper with each other the existence of a high sea between member states of a regional unit places them in comparison with drought bound countries in a more regional context for regional convergence drought affected countries are less likely to face major natural barriers they can enjoy the benefits of geographical closeness for regional convergence adding variable of angle cousin between exporting country i and importing country j to study the economies effects of the member states on the flow of trade show that this variable is of the expected magnitude and is statistically meaningful and has a significant positive effect on bilateral trade adding this variable increases 0 03 percent model s explanatory power the export potential of iran to the countries of region 2 is calculated using the results of the model during the study period table 4 iran had the highest exports in iraq turkey russia azerbaijan and armenia respectively iran s greatest export potential is among the countries of region 2 related to iraq and the least potential is refer to armenia the most unexploded export capacities of iran among the countries of region 2 belong to iraq turkey azerbaijan russia and armenia respectively 32 and the least unused capacity to armenia the highest percentage of unused capacity in iran is also in azerbaijan 80 1 and the least unused capacity was allocated to armenia 58 8 totally iran s export potential to countries in the region 2 amounted to 22 201 billion dollars which only 7 490 billion dollar is used in terms of these four criteria existing export export potential unused table 4 non oil export potential of iran to the countries of the region 2011 2015 figures are in millions of dollars and percent capacity and unused export potential percentage in terms of these four criteria export export potential unused export capacity and unused capacity of export potential all five countries of turkey azerbaijan russia armenia iraq are suitable alternatives for expanding trade cooperation 4 conclusions and suggestions based on the study findings it would be better for iran to establish regionally convergent with countries that enjoy higher incomes respectively russia turkey iraq azerbaijan and armenia in terms of the income variable in importing countries 1 8 based on the coefficient of distance variable 0 13 it is better for iran to establish a regional convergence with countries closer to it azerbaijan iraq turkey armenia russia looking at the results of distance variable coefficient in importing country in order to sum up the trade preferences with the countries of this region especially russia and turkey due to the size of these coefficients and comparison of them we conclude that the coefficient and effect of income variable on bilateral trade is far more than the distance variable so the results of income variable are more important and the expansion of trade with russia and turkey iraq is recommended looking at the figures one can find that iran s largest export potential is among the countries of region 2 to iraq and the least potential belongs to armenia the most unexploited export capacity of iran among the countries of region 2 belongs to iraq turkey azerbaijan and armenia the highest percentage of unused capacity of the country is azerbaijan 80 1 the least unused capacity belongs to armenia 58 8 overall and iran s export potential to countries in region 2 was 22 13 billion of which only 4 790 billion was used in terms of these four criteria available export export potential unused export capacity and unused export capacity percentage all five countries of turkey azerbaijan russia armenia iraq are good alternatives for expanding trade cooperation the results showed that there is a high trade potential between iran and any country in region 2 the expansion of trade with these countries and the creation of a trade blend could increase iran s trade flows to these countries in fact with this process iran can take advantage of the static and dynamic benefits of trade creation notes iran shares land borders with eight countries and seven other countries neighboring with maritime borders therefore we divided iran s neighbors into four regions region 1 includes the countries of kazakhstan and turkmenistan region 2 including russia azerbaijan armenia turkey and iraq region 3 including kuwait uae qatar bahrain and saudi arabia the fourth region includes afghanistan pakistan and oman in this study we are looking to explore iran s capacity for further production and export to countries in region no 2

today s big picture asian equities closed mostly higher for the day and the week as well european equities are trading higher on the day and us equity futures point to a positive start ahead of today s november employment report one of the more significant risks in the market today is that it is wearing blinders and rose colored glasses optimistic about a us china trade deal and utterly ignoring the impact of the upcoming brexit and the impeachment process there was a hint of progress today on the us china trade war this morning china s finance ministry announced that china will waive import tariffs for some us shipments of soybeans and pork based on applications by individual domestic firms but did not identify the specific quantities larry kudlow white house national economic council director is slated to appear on cnbc this morning to answer questions about the latest development on the trade front we suspect at least one of the questions will center around president trump s comment yesterday that trade talks are going very well and something could happen regarding tariffs set to be imposed on december 15 anyone who has owned a magic 8 ball knows very well something can mean many different things another positive sign comes from hong kong where the region s police in a rare move are allowing a demonstration sunday organized by the civil human rights front the new police commissioner urged demonstrators to remain peaceful as he left for a courtesy visit to beijing this could be a conciliatory move by china towards both the locals and western nations that have expressed displeasure over how the situation has been handled british pound sterling hit a 7 month high versus the dollar yesterday and reached its highest level against the euro since may 2017 on the belief that the upcoming general election will give prime minister boris johnson s conservative party a definitive majority the assumption is that if the conservatives get a majority enacting brexit will be less damaging to the uk economy than a labor led government that has promised to tax more and spend more another example of less bad is just great the election is only one week away with the conservatives holding a 10 lead over labor data download household spending in japan fell more than expected down 5 1 yoy in october versus expectations for a 3 decline average cash earnings were also less than expected rising just 0 5 yoy versus expectations for 1 1 japan s leading economic index came in slightly below expectations for 92 at 91 8 falling from the previous 91 9 the nations coincident index was even weaker than expectations for 101 5 at just 94 8 germany s industrial production was a big miss to the downside falling 1 7 mom in october versus expectations for a 0 1 increase production of capital goods fell by 4 4 mom the steepest 1 month decline in over 5 years output fell 5 3 on an annual basis the worst decline in a decade with germany having been a significant contributor to growth in the eurozone concern is rising over just how weak growth will be for the final quarter of 2019 france s balance of trade was better than expected in october at 4 73 billion versus the prior 5 42 billion and expectations for 4 8 billion italy s retail sales declined less than expected mom in october falling 0 2 versus expectations for a 0 4 decline and in line with yoy expectations for 1 growth later this morning we will get the non farm payrolls for november which includes earning and hours worked keep in mind there will be some noise in the data from the end of the general motors gm strike overall the labor market has been like a bad date sending mixed signals lately there were elevated readings in weekly jobless claims in november but then the last two weeks saw them back down with the latest 203k the lowest weekly print in over six months wednesday s adp private payroll s report showed 70k fewer new jobs than were expected and the latest ism manufacturing employment index is in contraction and non manufacturing is weaker than a year ago the jolts report from the bureau of labor statistics has shown job openings peaked between november 2018 and january 2019 and have been ticking downward since then with openings now 5 below where they were a year ago we will be looking most closely at temp worker employment as that tends to be the most leading indicator within payrolls which overall tends to be a lagging indicator however the numbers come out we don t think the report will have a material effect on the fed s decision next week concerning rates this morning will also bring the michigan consumer sentiment report and wholesale inventories then later this afternoon we ll get the usual weekly baker hughes oil rig count and consumer credit change for october early this morning baker hughes bkr published its baker hughes international rig count for november 2019 which fell 34 rigs vs october to 1 096 on a year over year basis the november 2019 rig count was 105 higher and sticking with oil it s being reported that opec has agreed in principle to cut production by an additional 500k barrels per day through the end of march 2020 the cancellation of opec s customary post meeting press conference suggests at least some of its non opec allies may have yet to get on board and now for something completely different as we mentioned yesterday france is enduring another strike quel surprise in protest against proposed changes to the nation s pension scheme this time it is impacting transportation and schools yesterday the national rail company canceled around 90 of its trains the metro closed 11 of 16 lines and the eurostar cut its timetable approximately 55 of teaching staff nationwide joined the walk out which allowed them to be a part of the over 300 000 people demonstrating in over 40 cities today france s civil aviation directorate is planning to cancel 20 of all flights going in and out of paris and other large cities for tourists this means the eiffel tower and orsay museum were closed yesterday and likely will be today as well zut alors for a nation whose economy has been struggling with growth this is yet another headwind to put the strike in context according to data from statista france experiences the most number of strike days per 1 000 employed out of a selection of oecd countries

money into financial markets and economies next year although at a slower pace than recently the combined monthly balance sheet expansion of the federal reserve european central bank and bank of japan will end this year at the highest level since 2017 as each sucks up bonds either to boost their economies or ease strains in money markets according to bloomberg while the rate of buying will peak at the turn of the year and slow throughout 2020 the expansion still marks a reversal from the start of this year when the total balance sheet was shrinking with the fed actively paring its holdings and only the boj adding purchases debatable is how potent the buying will prove as the world economy remains threatened by the u s china trade war advertisement 2 story continues below this advertisement

bloomberg calculations show the combined balance sheet growth of the three biggest central banks will reach almost 100 billion a month by the end of this year the spike will fade somewhat in 2020 reaching about 50 billion by the middle of next year one difference from previous episodes of qe is that although the ecb and boj are actively seeking to stoke economic growth by restraining market borrowing costs the fed argues it s purchasing treasury bills at an initial monthly pace of 60 billion because of recent turmoil in money markets one force which is back in evidence is central bank liquidity matt king global head of credit product strategy at citigroup inc wrote in a recent note to clients despite the fed s protestations that its adjustment to bank reserves is not qe its turnaround this year has helped drive global central bank securities purchases from 10 year lows to decade average levels nevertheless investors are welcoming the extra liquidity that s despite fed

effect is psychological said stephen stanley amherst pierpont chief economist the fed is expanding the balance sheet the public sees this as an easier monetary policy even as the fed insists that it is not a change in policy and thus asset prices rise whether the bigger balance sheets will actually power economic demand is still in doubt though global growth remains modest despite a decade of ultra loose monetary policy there is plenty of liquidity sloshing around but firms are reluctant to invest said chua hak bin at maybank kim eng research pte in singapore pointing to the u s china trade war as a source of uncertainty ben emons managing director for global macro strategy at medley global advisors in new york is more optimistic he argues that the renewed burst of qe will be more effective than previous cycles given the world economy isn t in crisis and so the liquidity is more likely to spur spending at the fed the balance sheet is growing faster than when it was first on its way to 4 trillion six years ago the institution had been gradually shrinking its massive securities holdings but the process drained too much cash out of the system contributing to a spike in market rates in september it reversed course to restore ample liquidity and officials have uniformly argued it s not aimed at affecting asset prices advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement

with borrowing costs at multi decade lows governments seemingly can take on much more debt without any great concern about long term consequences but the real risks and costs of higher public borrowing may be hidden cambridge with interest rates on government debt at multi decade lows a number of leading economists have argued that almost every advanced economy can allow debt to drift up toward japanese levels over 150 of gdp even by the most conservative measure without any great concern about long term consequences advocates of much higher debt might be right but they tend to downplay or ignore everything that can go wrong first and foremost the new view of debt understates the risks to other claimants on public tax revenues such as pensioners who might be thought of as junior debt holders in the twenty first century welfare state after all most social security systems are debt like in the sense that the government takes money from you now and promises to pay it back with interest when you are old and for governments this junior debt is massive relative to the senior market debt that sits atop it indeed governments in oecd countries are currently paying out an average of 8 of gdp in old age pensions and a staggering 16 in the case of italy and greece actuarially future taxes earmarked for paying pensions swamp future taxes earmarked for paying debt by a significant multiple although many governments have been trying to adjust pensions downward gradually as europe did during the financial crisis and mexico and brazil have done under duress more recently unfortunately slow growth and aging populations mean much remains to be done thus even if it seems that governments can take on much more debt without having to pay significantly higher market interest the real risks and costs may be hidden economists alan auerbach and laurence kotlikoff made a similar point in an influential series of papers back in the 1990s second and perhaps even more critically the current complacency regarding much higher debt implicitly assumes that the next crisis will look just like the last one in 2008 when interest rates on government debt collapsed but history suggests that this is a dangerous assumption for example the next wave of crises could easily stem from a sudden realization that climate change is accelerating much faster than previously thought requiring governments simultaneously to stall the capitalist engine and spend vast sums on preventive measures and remediation not to mention dealing with climate refugees and the next global conflagration could be a cyber war with unknown ramifications for growth and interest rates moreover aggressive experimentation with much higher debt might cause a corresponding shift in market sentiment an example of the nobel laureate economist robert lucas s critique that big shifts in policy can backfire owing to big shifts in expectations and frankly any realistic assessment of current global economic risks must acknowledge that the world s most important economy is in state of political paralysis with impulsive decision making leaving it ill equipped to deal with an outside the box crisis should one arise subscribe to ps digital subscribe to ps digital access every new ps commentary our entire on point suite of subscriber exclusive content including longer reads insider interviews big picture big question and say more and the full ps archive subscribe now the bottom line is that there is no guarantee that interest rates will fall in the next global crisis none of the preceding arguments undermine the strong case for investing now in high return infrastructure projects including in education that more than pay for themselves in the long run as long as governments adhere to sound debt management criteria balancing risk and cost when choosing maturities today s ultra low interest rates offer great opportunities but the broader claim that issuing government debt has become a veritable free lunch similar to government profits from currency issuance has been dangerously overblown if the aim of government policy is to reduce inequality the only sustainable long term solution involves raising taxes on high earners debt is not a magic shortcut for giving to the poor without taking from the rich true in many advanced economies current real inflation adjusted interest rates on government debt are below the real rate of economic growth presumably therefore governments can take on much more debt without ever having to raise taxes after all as long as income is growing faster than the stock of public debt simple arithmetic shows that the ratio of debt to gdp income will fall over time yet things are not quite so simple interest rates are ultra low in part because global investors are starved of safe assets that will still pay out in the event of a sharp downturn or economic catastrophe but can governments in fact provide that insurance for free if there is a risk that interest rates will rise in the next major systemic crisis a recent international monetary fund study of 55 countries over the last 200 years showed that although economic growth exceeded interest rates on government debt almost half the time this was not a good predictor of whether the surveyed countries were safe from interest rate spikes in a crisis last but not least how sure can investors be that they will come first in line in the next crisis as they did in 2008 will the united states government again put wall street before main street and honor debts to china ahead of obligations to pensioners modern economies have many important uses for debt but it is never a risk free option for governments which is why it should be taken on and managed wisely even when rock bottom borrowing costs prevail
in mid november in a surprise overnight announcement the revolutionary regime in iran hiked the price of gasoline by standards anywhere else in the world it is still pitifully cheap a litre of gas increased from eight cents to twelve cents or to fifty cents per gallon for the first fifteen gallons each month that s about a tankful for a large car after that gas went up to ninety cents per gallon the u s average is around two dollars and sixty cents per gallon the price hike nevertheless triggered instant outrage during the next four days protests erupted in a hundred cities across the country the theocracy responded with ruthless brutality hundreds at least were killed as the truth is trickling out of iran it appears the regime could have murdered over a thousand iranian citizens since the protests began brian hook the u s special representative for iran said at a state department briefing about the unrest on thursday at least seven thousand were detained and many thousands were wounded he said to curtail the protests and contain reports about it iran cut off access to the internet after access was restored the state department set up a tip line on telegram for iranians to submit video photos and other evidence of the government crackdown hook said that it received more than thirty two thousand responses the protests represented the widest unrest since the 2009 green movement uprising over alleged fraud in a presidential election they were the deadliest since the 1979 revolution which ousted the last dynasty by the government s own count protesters torched more than seven hundred and thirty banks destroyed a hundred and forty government sites and attacked fifty police force bases the protests quickly escalated from being about the price of gasoline to being about the future of the theocracy have shame dictator leave the country alone protesters shouted in mashhad iran s holy city normally a bastion of conservative support for the islamic republic the term dictator refers to ayatollah ali khamenei iran s supreme leader for the past three decades in the oil rich khuzestan province demonstrators chanted against president hassan rouhani have shame rouhani leave the country alone the november unrest is at least as serious a threat to the longevity of the islamic republic as the post election upheaval in 2009 was at that time and arguably more challenging to overcome or durably repair suzanne maloney the deputy director of the foreign policy program at the brookings institution told me back then the main schism was within the political establishment and secondarily within the politically engaged middle class a decade later she said the fissures run deeper into the core constituency of the regime and the disaffection is more systemic and more intense the internal tensions including the government s brutal response are indicative of a system whose resilience is dangerously fraying she said she compared it to a slow motion metastasis that is echoing across the political establishment the economy and society utopian ideologies and revolutionary regimes are often undone by a confluence of political and economic factors which is exactly what is happening in iran the political unrest intersected with chronic economic challenges produced by the trump administration s maximum pressure campaign combined with regime mismanagement and corruption the united states reimposed sweeping economic sanctions a year ago a few months after walking away from the historic nuclear deal that was brokered between iran and the world s six major powers in 2015 sanctions have cut off iran s ability to export oil its primary source of revenue in 2016 it exported 3 2 million barrels of oil per day this fall it s been down to about three hundred thousand barrels of oil the value of iran s rial has also plummeted slashing consumer buying power for daily goods and raising the price of all imports in 2015 the rial traded at just over thirty thousand rials to the dollar today it trades at almost a hundred and thirty thousand rials to the dollar although the rial had stabilized food inflation was until recently between sixty per cent and seventy per cent during a twelve month period adnan mazarei an iran specialist at the peterson institute for international economics and the former deputy director of the international monetary fund s middle east department told me in october the i m f downgraded its economic forecast for iran its economy is expected to contract by 9 5 per cent this year its worst performance in thirty five years since the nineteen eighties when the country faced challenges during eight years of war with iraq the price hike was actually a smart move economically according to the i m f iran has long provided subsidies for basic commodities that it cannot afford because its population has mushroomed from just over thirty million at the time of the revolution forty years ago to more than eighty million today the plan was designed to help the poor it cut subsidies that also helped the rich consume even more it included doling out millions in cash to the lower classes to compensate for the price hike under the current circumstances that the country is facing the most unprecedented sanctions and pressures the main reason for adjusting prices is to promote social justice or to move toward that ali rabiei the government spokesman told a local news agency the mistake was failing to provide advance warning or details mazarei said iran s supreme leader blamed the united states and israel for fomenting the unrest and local thugs for exploiting it security forces put down a very dangerous deep conspiracy that cost so much money and effort khamenei said in comments to the basij a paramilitary force under the revolutionary guard in such incidents hooligans spiteful and evil people often enter the field and sometimes some youths driven by emotion accompany them and commit seditious acts such deeds do not fix anything other than adding insecurity to the problems iran s revolutionary guard the élite force created to preserve the revolution has vowed to quash any future unrest if necessary we will take decisive and revolutionary action against any continued moves to disturb the people s peace and security it said in a statement for now the islamic republic may be able to contain the unrest the violence is not necessarily a precursor to more massive political violence in iran nor is it the desperate and bloody response of a regime verging on collapse elizabeth rosenberg a former treasury specialist now at the center for a new american security told me despite iran s struggles under powerful sanctions it would be folly to underestimate the staying power of iran s regime élites who are experts at repressive rule and economic resilience in conditions of extreme hardship she said we should not expect a fatal turning point for the revolution any time soon the november protests are the fourth major challenge to the revolution in july 1999 students protested for five days against the closure of a reformist newspaper it was put down by force when security forces raided dormitories and campuses in 2009 millions rose up across the country to protest voter fraud in the reëlection of president mahmoud ahmadinejad the demonstrations ran on sporadically for more than eight months thousands were arrested including former government officials and members of parliament who backed the protests two of the opposition s presidential candidates former prime minister mir hossein mousavi and former parliamentary speaker mehdi karroubi are still under house arrest in late 2017 and early 2018 protests lasted for weeks in thirty of iran s thirty one provinces over economic issues including unemployment and unpaid wages

white house it s the economy stupid has been a catchphrase of u s presidential politics since the 1992 campaign when bill clinton unseated incumbent george h w bush nearly three decades later u s president donald trump is hoping that simple message in 2020 will help foil his eventual democratic party challenger trump in tweets at political rallies and in remarks to reporters constantly emphasizes the performance of the u s economy stock market surges low unemployment rates and his tax cuts to boast he is doing a great job as president economists and political analysts are divided on whether that message will enable the incumbent to stay in office beyond january 2021 culture war partisan split ever since clinton we ve all kind of assumed that should be true and i think for the most part it is said ryan mcmaken senior editor and economist at the mises institute a politics and economics research group in alabama he cautioned though that trump finds himself on one side of a culture war that his predecessors did not have to confront as well as a deep partisan divide on consumer confidence policy analyst james pethokoukis at the washington based american enterprise institute a public policy research group also is cautious about the economy prevailing over all other issues just having a strong economy is not going to guarantee you re election he said people often point back to the 2000 election which occurred after a decade of tremendous economic growth any way you want to measure it gross domestic product jobs and wage growth and yet al gore still lost that election to george w bush mcmaken questioned whether voters in key swing states such as wisconsin michigan pennsylvania and ohio who cast ballots for trump in 2016 were experiencing enough of the touted economic performance to vote again for the president overall however it s not a bad economy to run on if you re donald trump said pethokoukis trump said to have concerns about the direction of the economy ahead of next november s election will likely push for more tax cuts passage of a renegotiated north american trade pact and continued pressure on the country s central banking system the federal reserve to lower interest rates trouble ahead there are rumblings of economic storm clouds on the horizon the impact can be seen in trump s trade war with china which has hurt u s farmers and raised prices for consumer goods it s also reflected in the institute for supply management s manufacturing index an underperforming u s private sector job quality index and a ballooning record national debt in addition to the worrying level of money owed to creditors by middle class americans we ve actually been in a sort of a manufacturing recession seen a shrinkage of factory jobs the exact kinds of jobs that i m sure that people voting for the president thought would be a lot better now said pethokoukis so far none of this has prompted a major stock market correction there seems to be a lot of adaptations in the markets to trump s america that may work to his advantage said the mises institute s mcmaken analysts note a lack of emphasis on economic platforms so far by the leading democratic u s presidential candidates seeking to oust trump next year but such a platform is likely to be touted when the opposition party holds its convention next july in milwaukee and picks its campaign ticket pethokoukis suggested the democratic party should devise a plan with a goal to boost american worker productivity which has flatlined for years the great divide mcmaken pointed out that the widening chasm between the well off and those struggling economically in the united states makes trump vulnerable something emphasized by left leaning democratic presidential contenders such as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren on the ground level i would say just in general the economy isn t doing as well concluded mcmaken amid an impeachment drive by the democrats trump is repeatedly hammering on a specific message to those questioning his suitability for office while being impressed with the performance of their pension accounts during his presidency love me or hate me you ve got to vote for me trump said at a rally in new hampshire in august warning that americans investments portfolios would go down the tubes if he lost next year s election

london world shares ticked up on friday buoyed by comments from us president donald trump that talks aimed at dialling down the damaging trade war with china were moving right along trump s relatively upbeat tone in comments on thursday was enough to encourage riskier bets by investors despite a lack of agreement over whether existing tariffs should be dropped as part of an initial deal to ease the long standoff european shares including the broader euro stoxx 600 gained 0 3 per cent in early trade with indexes in frankfurt and paris up by similar amounts the cautiously buoyant mood mirrored an appetite for riskier bets in asia where msci s broadest index of asia pacific shares outside japan was up 0 5pc the msci world equity index which tracks shares in 47 countries added 0 2pc to 554 91 points not far off a record high of 550 63 hit last january but still on track for a weekly fall investors were hoping the two sides can reach a compromise to at least avoid their worst fear that the united states goes ahead with its final batch of tariffs on about 156 billion of chinese exports due to take effect on december 15 trump s remarks came after chinese officials reiterated demands that some us tariffs be rolled back if the sides are to reach a so called phase one deal markets had expected the sides to seal the initial deal in november instead investors are nervously watching the approaching deadline for the new us levies the difficulty with this is it s very difficult to time and to trade said jeremy gatto a multi asset investment manager at unigestion we are relatively favourable towards riskier assets in general but with hedges gatto said those hedges include currencies such as the us dollar japanese yen and australian dollar as well as options investors have already taken precautions against a possible slide in stocks by buying put options with demand for put options to hedge exposure to the s p500 index climbing in recent days in one sign of detente china said it would waive import tariffs imposed last year on some us soybean and pork shipments beijing is rushing to source more meat to fill a gap in protein supplies china stocks posted their biggest weekly advance in nearly two months with the blue chips up 0 6pc investors were looking out for us jobs data due out at 1330 gmt the non farm payrolls report is expected to show 180 000 new jobs were created in november up from 128 000 a month earlier signs of buoyancy in the labour market would soothe anxiety over the impact of the trade war markets are in consolidation phase said salman ahmed chief investment strategist at lombard odier it s wait and watch for first how does the non farm payrolls look and more importantly the december 15 tariff deadline in other economic data german industrial output fell unexpectedly in october pointing to persistent weakness in the backbone of the economy berlin said however that new orders and business expectations suggest output may stabilise while markets have largely priced in the view that the world economy has dodged the bullet of recession there are still signs of fragility in many major economies oil lost ground as investors awaited a meeting of opec and its allies later on friday which is expected to formally agree to more output curbs in early 2020 details of the agreement and how the cuts will be distributed among producers still need to be ratified at a meeting of opec and non opec nations otherwise known as opec in vienna brent crude futures were flat at 63 46 a barrel after earlier gaining ground the agreement coincided with the initial public offering of state oil firm saudi aramco which was priced at the top of its range and raised 25 6 billion in the world s biggest ipo in currencies the british pound stepped back some 0 2pc sterling spiked to a seven month high of 1 3166 on thursday on bets that next week s election will give the conservative party the majority it needs to deliver brexit ending near term uncertainty the pound last stood at 1 313 it hit 2 1 2 year highs versus the euro against a basket of currencies the dollar has dropped every day this week falling to a one month low of 97 356 on thursday the index was last down a smidgeon at 97 370 and has lost nearly 1pc this week

an internal memo addressed to federal finance minister bill morneau in august outlined a range of fiscal and monetary policies the liberals and the bank of canada could employ in the event of economic shocks a range that includes lowering interest rates even further and relying on employment insurance the august memo marked secret was released to cbc last month through the federal access to information act it s leading some economists to call on the government to prioritize some tools over others and to consider at least one unprecedented economic strategy the unredacted portions of the memo don t cite any specific recession warning signs but the document does note that since the 1970s canada has experienced four significant recessions one per decade canada s last recession happened in 2008 09 triggered by the u s housing bubble of note canada has never experienced a significant recession that was not also suffered by the united states the briefing note says on average since the 1970s recessions in canada resulted in the equivalent of 550 000 job losses and a 4 per cent decline in real gdp now the fallout from the united kingdom s protracted political brawl over leaving the european union trade disputes between the u s and other countries and the ongoing protests in hong kong have some business analysts predicting economic turmoil the latest gdp figures show canada s economic growth in the third quarter slowed due to a drop in exports statistics canada reported last week that canada s real gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 1 3 per cent in the last three months compared with 3 7 per cent in the previous quarter the briefing note gives morneau an overview of the tools he and bank of canada gov stephen poloz could use in the event of an economic downturn they include reducing interest rates below zero so called negative interest rates increasing government spending offering more grants to businesses and households and increasing the money supply through quantitative and credit easing the memo outlines the proposed sequencing of policy tools should canada experience a recession the details are blanked out in the document obtained by cbc news because since they contain advice by or for a government institution or cabinet minister they are exempted from access laws stimulus disappointed last time economists who spoke with cbc news said the department of finance and the bank of canada can t expect the playbook they used the 2008 09 recession to work next time conference board of canada chief economist pedro antunes said strategies such as lowering interest rates already at record lows and quantitative easing weren t as effective as expected during the last downturn and won t help pull canada out of the next economic downturn either quantitative easing involves central banks buying assets such as government and corporate bonds from commercial banks and financial institutions increasing the supply of money in the system the goal is to lower interest rates and leave financial institutions flush with cash which in theory should allow them to lend more to stimulate economic activity we really didn t see that having a big impact globally or in canada in terms of driving investment antunes said it was more of a consumer led kind of recovery antunes and other economists said stimulus backfired in the last recession instead of expanding their businesses and hiring more people businesses seemed to hoard the injection of new money created through the monetary policy of central banks although the briefing note touches on this point antunes said he would have liked to see infrastructure investment which spurs private sector spending and job creation play a more prominent role in the government s recession toolkit prime minister justin trudeau makes an announcement on the trans mountain expansion project with minister of finance bill morneau in ottawa june 18 2019 sean kilpatrick canadian press the fraser institute however argues that since it takes years for infrastructure projects to get built they re not that useful in fighting recessions the centre right think tank points out that before workers are hired and the first shovel hits the ground such projects have to go through feasibility studies design changes legislative funding allocations and consultations with indigenous communities provinces territories and municipalities before they even make it to tender i think the evidence is overwhelmingly clear that it s almost impossible to do that in a short period of time said jason clemens the fraser institute s executive vice president and so by the time those projects get shovels in the ground the recession is over the liberal government isn t helping matters by racking up back to back deficits which could tie its hands when the next recession hits clemens said the sections of the briefing note that are not blacked out say nothing about how the liberals would manage deficits and debt during a recession clemens said the government should rely on automatic stabilizers like employment insurance which ramps up spending when the number of jobless canadians increases to keep the economy on an even keel helicopter money but david macdonald an economist with the canadian centre for policy alternatives said ei doesn t always help the people who need it most because some canadians the self employed and workers who don t receive enough hours don t qualify for benefits that s why he and at least one european economic think tank are calling for an unprecedented response to the next recession central banks working with finance ministers giving money directly to businesses or citizens governments typically deliver such benefits to citizens not the bank of canada everyone gets 100 or 200 a month or lower income families get more and upper income families get less macdonald said economists acknowledge this helicopter money concept is an extreme form of economic stimulus still it s been suggested by former u s federal reserve chair ben bernanke as a strategy to fight deflation this is something that s starting to be discussed but hasn t been implemented macdonald said but i think these are the types of things that the bank of canada is certainly thinking about going into the next recession where s the plan for alberta and saskatchewan economist and columnist erica ifill notes the toolkit doesn t seem to have anything to say about the sorts of targeted regional strategies the government or the bank of canada could undertake to stimulate regional economies i don t see in the briefing note the economic position of the west and any analysis around that ifill said i m really concerned with the west suffering as they are right now that the federal government is not looking at them as a specific case the bank of canada headquarters in ottawa sean kilpatrick canadian press ifill is calling on both the federal government and the bank of canada to consider economic stimulus packages tailored for canada s regions a department of finance spokesperson downplayed the significance of the memo saying that economic growth in canada remains stable and unemployment is low this note provides an update on the department s work on the general mechanics of the federal government toolkit to respond to potential slowdowns in the economy said ministerial spokesperson pierre olivier herbert

by lance roberts this is the most prosperous economy the world has ever seen and it s going to be a very prosperous economy for the next 100 years jamie dimon that s what the head of jp morgan chase told viewers in a recent 60 minutes interview the consumer which is 70 of the u s economy is quite strong confidence is very high their balance sheets are in great shape and you see that the strength of the american consumer is driving the american economy and the global economy and while business slowed down my current view is that no it just was a slowdown not a petering out jamie dimon if you re in the top 1 2 of income earners like jamie i am sure it feels that way for everyone else not so much this isn t the first time that i have discussed dimon s distorted views and just as we discussed then even just marginally scratching the surface on the economy and the household balance sheet reveals an uglier truth the most prosperous economy let s start with the most prosperous economy in the world claim as we recently discussed in socialism rises how did a country which was once the shining beacon of capitalism become a country on the brink of socialism changes like these don t happen in a vacuum it is the result of years of a burgeoning divide between the wealthy and everyone else it is also a function of a 40 year process of capitalism morphing an entire population into debt slaves to sustain economic prosperity it is a myth that the economy has grown by roughly 5 since 1980 in reality economic growth rates have been on a steady decline over the past 40 years which has been supported by a massive push into deficit spending by consumers with the slowest average annual growth rate in history it is hard to suggest the economy has been the best it has ever been however if an economy is truly prosperous it should benefit the majority of economic participants which brings us to claim about household balance sheet health for billionaires the grass is always green if you are in the upper 20 of income earners not to mention the top 01 like mr dimon i am quite sure the economic grass is very green if you are in the bottom 80 the view is more akin to a dirt lot since 1980 as noted by a recent study from chicago booth review the wealth gap has progressively gotten worse the data set reveals since 1980 a sharp divergence in the growth experienced by the bottom 50 percent versus the rest of the economy the researchers write the average pretax income of the bottom 50 percent of us adults has stagnated since 1980 while the share of income of us adults in the bottom half of the distribution collapsed from 20 percent in 1980 to 12 percent in 2014 in a mirror image move the top 1 percent commanded 12 percent of income in 1980 but 20 percent in 2014 the top 1 percent of us adults now earns on average 81 times more than the bottom 50 percent of adults in 1981 they earned 27 times what the lower half earned the issue is the other 80 are just struggling to get by as recently discussed in the wall street journal the american middle class is falling deeper into debt to maintain a middle class lifestyle cars college houses and medical care have become steadily more costly but incomes have been largely stagnant for two decades despite a recent uptick filling the gap between earning and spending is an explosion of finance into nearly every corner of the consumer economy consumer debt not counting mortgages has climbed to 4 trillion higher than it has ever been even after adjusting for inflation mortgage debt slid after the financial crisis a decade ago but is rebounding wsj the ability to simply maintain a certain standard of living has become problematic for many which forces them further into debt the debt surge is partly by design a byproduct of low borrowing costs the federal reserve engineered after the financial crisis to get the economy moving it has reshaped both borrowers and lenders consumers increasingly need it companies increasingly can t sell their goods without it and the economy which counts on consumer spending for more than two thirds of gdp would struggle without a plentiful supply of credit wsj i show the gap between the standard of living and real disposable incomes below beginning in 1990 incomes alone were no longer able to meet the standard of living so consumers turned to debt to fill the gap however following the financial crisis even the combined levels of income and debt no longer fill the gap currently there is almost a 2600 annual deficit that cannot be filled note this deficit accrues every year which is why consumer credit keeps hitting new records but this is where it gets interesting mr dimon claims the household balance sheet is in great shape however this suggestion which has been repeated by much of the mainstream media is based on the following chart we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the problem with the chart is that it is an illusion created by the skew in disposable incomes by the top 20 of income earners needless to say the top 5 the wall street journal exposed this issue in their recent analysis median household income in the u s was 61 372 at the end of 2017 according to the census bureau when inflation is taken into account that is just above the 1999 level without adjusting for inflation over the three decades through 2017 incomes are up 135 wsj the median net worth of households in the middle 20 of income rose 4 in inflation adjusted terms to 81 900 between 1989 and 2016 the latest available data for households in the top 20 median net worth more than doubled to 811 860 and for the top 1 the increase was 178 to 11 206 000 put differently the value of assets for all u s households increased from 1989 through 2016 by an inflation adjusted 58 trillion a third of the gain 19 trillion went to the wealthiest 1 according to a journal analysis of fed data on the surface things look pretty good but if you dig a little deeper you see different subpopulations are not performing as well said cris deritis deputy chief economist at moody s analytics wsj with this understanding we need to recalibrate the debt to income chart above to adjust for the bottom 80 of income earnings versus those in the top 20 clearly the household balance sheet is not nearly as healthy as mr dimon suggests of course the only saving grace for many american households is that artificially low interest rates have reduced the average debt service levels unfortunately those in the bottom 80 are still having a large chunk of their median disposable income eaten up by debt payments this reduces discretionary spending capacity even further the problem is quite clear with interest rates already at historic lows the consumer already heavily leveraged and wage growth stagnant the capability to increase consumption to foster higher rates of economic growth is limited with respect to those who say the debt doesn t matter i respectfully argue that you looking at a very skewed view of the world driven by those at the top mr dimon s last call what mr dimon tends to forget is that it was the u s taxpayer who bailed out the financial system him included following the financial crisis despite massive fraud in the major banks related to the mortgage crisis only small penalties were paid for their criminal acts and no one went to jail the top 5 banks which were 40 of the banking system prior to the financial crisis became 60 afterwards through it all mr dimon became substantially wealthier while the american population suffered the consequences yes this is the greatest economy ever if you are at the top of heap with household debt corporate debt and government debt now at records the next crisis will once again require taxpayers to bail it out since it was mr dimon s bank that lent the money to zombie companies households again which can t afford it and took on excessive risks in financial assets he will gladly accept the next bailout while taxpayers suffer the fallout for the top 20 of the population that have money actually invested or directly benefit from surging asset prices like mr dimon life is great however for the vast majority of american s the job competition is high wages growth is stagnant and making ends meet is a daily challenge while mr dimon s view of america is certainly uplifting it is delusional but of course give any person a billion dollars and they will likely become just as detached from economic realities does america have greatest hand ever dealt the data certainly doesn t suggest such however that can change we just have to stop hoping that we can magically cure a debt problem by adding more debt and then shuffling it between central banks but then again such a statement is also delusional

recent jumps in equity prices and bond yields suggest that recession fears are receding but the global economic expansion cannot last forever and when the next recession comes central banks may not be adequately prepared to respond enhancing central bank credibility to bolster the effectiveness of monetary policy is thus an urgent priority before the 2008 financial crisis central bankers could rely on slashing interest rates to spur consumption investment and employment but that playbook no longer works as well as it once did one reason is elevated uncertainty owing to globalisation societal ageing changing consumer preferences growing income and wealth inequality rising healthcare costs rapid technological change and other factors even in the absence of recession for many households and businesses the future seems daunting and unpredictable this uncertainty will exacerbate the downturn when it comes when uncertainty spikes low or even negative real inflation adjusted interest rates may not induce higher spending rather savings may rise and investment may falter even as interest rates plunge if governments are unwilling or unable to boost demand with fiscal policy the result will be a prolonged and deep economic slump few would doubt that monetary policy should be eased in such circumstances in theory central banks have extraordinary means to respond through negative interest rates asset purchases forward guidance and the like yet in practice central banks face tight constraints which means that their response to the next recession may prove insufficient broadly these constraints fall into two categories laws or established policies that define what monetary policy can do and political and institutional limits that hem in central banks decision making the legal limitations vary according to the political and institutional environment and history of a central bank s jurisdiction in conducting open market operations for example the us federal reserve may purchase only debt securities issued or guaranteed by the us federal government in contrast the bank of japan may purchase private sector securities such as equities or corporate bonds giving it potentially greater latitude to expand its balance sheet and stimulate corporate finance such differences could matter in the event of a severe slump that requires extraordinary measures to take an extreme example the fed cannot unilaterally create helicopter money a metaphor invoked by milton friedman to describe how a central bank might distribute cash directly to individuals in order to stimulate consumption to create cash a central bank liability the fed must purchase an asset yet because private sector ious are not eligible assets the fed cannot distribute cash directly to the bank accounts of ordinary americans nor could it drop 20 bills from the sky even if it had the helicopters so in the us case helicopter money would actually have to be a fiscal transfer from the federal government to its citizens underwritten by fed purchases of treasury securities as such it is a policy that only congress and the president can enact the problem is that legislating such measures would take considerable time whereas the next economic or financial crisis will probably require swift and decisive action to be sure helicopter money is typically viewed as a last resort but even less heterodox policies may be hamstrung by policy norms for example the fed has been reluctant to endorse the option of breaching the zero lower bound zlb and introducing negative policy rates yet if the equilibrium real interest rate falls below zero as seems likely in the next recession that self imposed zlb limitation could pose problems in fact the fed s own staff has estimated that the zlb floor could prevent it from delivering an appropriately low real interest rate as often as 40 of the time given plausible estimates of the neutral real policy rate and the odds of below trend growth such failures could threaten the next recovery and even the fed s independence central bankers also face political and institutional constraints in europe financial institutions particularly the bundesbank pensioners and savers dislike negative interest rates whether these constituencies opposition to monetary policy easing has prevented the european central bank from acting as forcefully as it might otherwise have done is an open question but clearly an air of timidity has damaged the ecb s credibility the ecb staunchly opposes high inflation but has been tolerant of below target inflation in 2012 then ecb president mario draghi famously committed to do whatever it takes to save the euro yet he never mustered the same resolve to ensure that inflation would reach the bank s mandated target economists agree that credibility reinforces monetary policy effectiveness if consumers workers and businesses don t believe that a central bank is committed to achieving its mandate they will adjust their behaviour accordingly low inflation expectations will lead to low inflation outcomes those outcomes are not costless when inflation is too low it is harder to push down real interest rates particularly if citizens oppose negative nominal rates in such circumstances a central bank that is unwilling to commit to its inflation target partly surrenders its most important policy tool the ability to cut real interest rates in the event of a downturn forfeiting policy tools is especially problematic now that the traditional transmission channels for monetary policy are proving less effective easing policy is less likely to depreciate the currency and boost net exports if other central banks are doing the same and while loose monetary policies may boost asset prices consumption won t increase much if the benefits are accruing only to the wealthy whenever the next downturn comes it will be too late to remedy central banks shortcomings but by making changes before they are necessary central banks can restore their credibility for example the ecb could immediately announce a whatever it takes commitment to a symmetric inflation target and then back it up with a round of easing doing this when confidence in growth is returning would send a powerful signal that the policy change is structural and not just another belated cyclical band aid central bankers should also revisit legal and self imposed policy constraints with an eye toward amending or removing those that could hinder policy flexibility in tail risk scenarios demonstrating a willingness to act before the crisis arrives is a costless way for central banks to safeguard their most important asset the belief that they know what they re doing bm

open this photo in gallery the u s labor department issued its november jobs report on friday the associated press u s job growth increased by the most in 10 months in november as the health care industry boosted hiring and production workers at general motors returned to work after a strike the strongest sign yet the economy is in no danger of stalling the unemployment rate ticked back down to its lowest level in nearly half a century and wage gains remained near their strongest in a decade according to the labor department s monthly employment report which was released on friday the numbers suggest consumers will keep the longest economic expansion in history now in its 11th year chugging along into next year when americans will vote in the presidential election the report added to other fairly upbeat data on the trade deficit housing and orders for big ticket goods together the improving data appear to validate the federal reserve s decision in october to signal no further interest rate cuts are needed for now the u s central bank cut rates three times this year starting in july when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008 federal reserve policy makers are expected to highlight the economy s resilience when they meet on dec 10 11 though trade tensions continue to reverberate in the background this was a strong report with a solid rise in payrolls another drop in the unemployment rate and decent growth in hourly earnings said chris low chief economist at fhn financial in new york the fed will see this as clear vindication of their decision to stop cutting rates nonfarm payrolls increased by 266 000 jobs last month lifted by the gain of 60 200 health care workers the most since march and increased hiring at restaurants and bars the government s survey of establishments showed manufacturing recouped all the 43 000 positions lost in october but colder than normal temperatures in november curbed hiring at construction sites and helped to sink mining payrolls the largest increase in payrolls since january pushed job growth well above its monthly average of 180 000 this year economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 180 000 jobs in november the economy created 41 000 more jobs in september and october than previously estimated even discounting the roughly 46 000 returning gm employees employment growth exceeded 200 000 jobs last month the robust payroll gains suggest the trump administration s 17 month trade war with china which has plunged manufacturing into recession has not yet spilled over to the broader economy some economists said this could buy the trump administration more time as it negotiates a phase one trade deal with china top white house economic adviser larry kudlow said on friday the dec 15 deadline remained in place for a new round of u s tariffs on chinese goods set to kick in adding there s no arbitrary deadline on trade talks the report alleviates pressure on the trump administration to make a trade deal with china giving negotiators more leverage to push for a harder line said daniel zhao a senior economist at glassdoor in san francisco the dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies snapping a five day losing streak u s treasury prices fell stocks on wall street rallied after a roller coaster week steady wage gains the u s china trade spat has bruised business confidence and undercut capital expenditure tipping manufacturing into recession the magnitude of last month s increase in payrolls is at odds with other labour market data job openings are near a 1 1 2 year low small business hiring intentions have softened relative to 2018 and the institute for supply management survey s measure of factory employment has contracted for four straight months while this morning s reading is a definite improvement it does little to explain waning momentum over the past ten months said lindsey piegza chief economist at stifel in chicago it remains to be seen if such strength signals a turning point to more robust hiring patterns though the labour market remains resilient despite the business investment downturn hiring has slowed from last year s average monthly gain of 223 000 because of ebbing demand and a shortage of workers the government has said it could cut job growth for the 12 months through march 2019 by at least 500 000 jobs when it publishes its annual revision next february still job creation is well over the roughly 100 000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population the unemployment rate fell one tenth of a percentage point to 3 5 per cent per cent matching september s reading which was the lowest level since december 1969 a broader measure of unemployment which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment fell to 6 9 per cent from 7 0 per cent in october the labour force participation rate or the proportion of working age americans who have a job or are looking for one dipped to 63 2 per cent in november from more than a six year high of 63 3 per cent in october average hourly earnings rose seven cents or 0 2 per cent after increasing 0 4 per cent in october in the 12 months through november wages rose 3 1 per cent after advancing 3 2 per cent in october wages were held back by the concentration of hiring in low paying industries average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers considered a more reliable wage measure increased 0 3 per cent and were up 3 7 per cent on a year on year basis in november that should keep consumer spending in good shape in the coming months said sarah house a senior economist at wells fargo securities in charlotte

stocks have been buoyed in recent weeks by the prospect of a light at the end of the trade war tunnel with investors anticipating an imminent phase one deal with china that upward trajectory abruptly reversed on tuesday after president donald trump said there might be no resolution until after the 2020 election in some ways i like the idea of waiting until after the election for the china deal trump told reporters from the nato summit that begins today in london adding i have no deadline the benchmark dow jones index fell 400 points shortly after opening its biggest drop in two months in response to the news economists top concern is a tranche of tariffs on 156 billion in chinese imports primarily consumer goods that is set to take effect on dec 15 a trade deal was widely expected to suspend the implementation of those tariffs now all bets are off i think it has to go into effect otherwise trump loses his credibility said mitchell goldberg president of clientfirst strategy i think investors are factoring in that it s going to go into effect he said predicting that the market could fall by up to 10 percent goldberg remained optimistic though that a broader market rout was unlikely this is not going to be in my opinion a repeat of year end 2018 he said pointing out that concerns about inflation and higher interest rates that triggered a december selloff turned out to be unfounded i still think the market has a lot of wind at its back he said listing corporate buybacks low interest rates and solid consumer spending some experts are less sanguine saying investors have been viewing the trade war through rose colored glasses markets have been far too complacent in the whole treatment of this trade war said jacob kirkegaard senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics i think they re also greatly underestimating the longer run effects of this trade war he said slapping a new round of tariffs on everything from coats to computers would send shock waves through the consumer economy and threaten to derail consumer spending kirkegaard said i certainly don t think markets are pricing that in i think the reaction to that will be significantly more negative than what we ve seen in markets to date nothing good will come out of it said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics referring to the trump s statements on tuesday zandi said if what he means is if he allows the tariff increases he s threatening on dec 15 to go into effect then i think we get a recession next year on those grounds some economists argue that the tariffs almost certainly will be suspended or delayed the economic fallout would be too great to risk i suspect even the china hawks in the white house don t really want to impose the december tariffs they were supposed to be a threat to win concessions from china actually implementing them would just put up prices for american families said mark williams chief asia economist at capital economics in addition to pinching household budgets and reducing consumer spending power more tariffs could hurt american job growth as well zandi estimated that the trade war thus far has probably cost the labor market around 40 000 jobs each month it s obvious in manufacturing he said adding that more tariffs could accelerate job losses on monday the president blamed the federal reserve for the contraction in manufacturing writing in a pair of tweets manufacturers are being held back by the strong dollar which is being propped up by the ridiculous policies of the federal reserve the fed should lower rates there is almost no inflation and loosen making us competitive with other nations and manufacturing will soar but economists say trade policy not monetary policy is the hurdle facing american manufacturing which dropped for the fourth month in a row according to figures released monday from the institute for supply management global trade remains the most significant cross industry issue timothy fiore chair of the ism s manufacturing business survey committee said in a statement and unlike last year there are fewer mitigating actions the federal reserve could take if the market plummets this time i think it s very unlikely that the fed is going to somehow surprise the markets by easing more kirkegaard said the fed has pretty clearly signaled that they re on hold now that means there is no parachute if there is a significant contraction

people in need the question is does foreign aid really work or is the traditional government funded model flawed leading to waste and negative unintended consequences matt answers those questions and provides insight as to what is the best way to help lift people out of poverty matt is president of atlas network a nonprofit organization connecting a global network of more than 475 free market organizations in over 90 countries matt writes speaks and consults internationally on the topics of economics and institution building his work has appeared in forbes harvard s education next real clear politics washington times among others matt is also the author of a new book called poverty and freedom case studies on global economic development beverly h welcome to she thinks a podcast where you re allowed to think for yourself i m your host beverly hallberg and on this episode we focus on the issue of foreign aid with approximately 50 billion american tax payer dollars sent overseas each year to help people in need the question is does foreign aid really work or is the traditional government funded modeled flawed leading to waste and negative unintended consequences well matt warner is here with us today to answer these questions and provide insights on what is the best way to help people in poverty matt warner is the author of a new book called poverty and freedom case studies on global economic development and matt is also the president of the atlas network a nonprofit organization connecting a global network of more than 475 free market organizations in over 90 countries matt writes speaks and consults internationally on the topics of economics and institution building and his work has appeared in forbes harvard s education next real clear politics washington times among others matt thank you so much for joining us today matt warner thank you happy to be here beverly h and where i want to start is just this issue of foreign aid i think so often as americans we are not fully aware of how much money is sent overseas what it is sent for give us a little breakdown to start off with of the background of how americans send foreign aid and the purpose of it matt warner sure so historically foreign aid has been something that the marshall plan after world war ii where we were looking at how to rebuild countries around the world and establish more stability that became more formalized in the early 60s with legislation major legislation out of congress where we started to institutionalize in our country a foreign aid model and a set of of institutions to advance foreign aid matt warner fast forward to today and most of our foreign aid is handled through the usaid the agency in charge of it but not exclusively there s actually up to 20 different entities among the federal government that have some type of foreign aid apparatus and for the most part foreign aid is used in about four buckets it s a longterm development attacking major issues like hiv aids et cetera humanitarian disaster relief that s a sizable piece some institutional and political stability support and then about a third of it is military support and so that s going to again try to create stability around the world matt warner and of course when i think americans think about foreign aid they think about helping the desperately poor around the world and trying to make the world a better place and the interesting thing that we ve seen in the last couple of decades is a really strong effort to start to ask tough questions about the efficacy of foreign aid and whether it s actually making a difference beverly h and i think one of the things that we can point out is that americans are very generous i think if americans thought that this money was going to something really beneficial to people overseas especially in helping them get out of poverty we would say that we should continue doing this so it s not the generosity that s being questioned it s as you said is this working and so break it down for us i know your book poverty and freedom it deals with case studies on what can work but let s start with why foreign aid often doesn t work even if it has good intentions behind it matt warner well i think we ve all seen recently whether you re paying attention to the headlines related to ukraine with both joe biden and donald trump being questioned in terms of how they ve used foreign aid to influence other countries for different ends there is a very natural inclination for foreign aid to be politicized and often intentionally so i mean it s seen as on the one hand something that we re doing to make the world a better place on the other hand from a holding government accountable from the taxpayer s point of view what is this doing to advance our national interest so at the crosshairs of these two things you end up with a a set of objectives that may or may not at the end of the day actually match needs on the ground in countries and i ll point to some examples real quick of what hasn t worked matt warner one of the more celebrated traditional approaches that kind of backfired was a 300 million investment under jeffrey sachs to attack all the symptoms of poverty at once this was his theory that there s this poverty trap that people in poor places are stuck within and if you start to do better in one way too many other things hold you back after 300 million in 10 years the first independent evaluation of his approach done by britain s department of aid said that not only did they find no evidence that anybody escaped poverty longterm but that many of the good things that did happen could have been done much much cheaper matt warner and so this gets at the heart of why is it that if we have money resources and technical knowledge that s still not enough to go and help people escape poverty and that gets to something fundamental about the nature of economic development which is that it is something that is complex iterative and is a function of individual choices in different places around the world beverly h well i know that you have coined a term it s the outsider s dilemma which is really the crux of why it just doesn t work even when you have good intentions the aid that we send doesn t lead to the outcome that we re hoping for so what is this outsider s dilemma and why do you think this is the crux as to why foreign aid doesn t lead to the good work that we hope it will matt warner well i mean i think many of us can relate to the idea that maybe there s someone in our life or in our family that we want to see them do better in life but try as we might we can t control them and make decisions for them and the fact is even if we could we probably wouldn t get it right this gets to the fundamental issue of why individual freedom is so important it isn t just about human dignity which is super important that we acknowledge that nobody should be able to have power over someone else but also that the choices that individuals make every day now represent their own sense of their trade offs in local conditions matt warner so the outsider s dilemma says wanting to help is good but interfering in someone else s life if you really aren t in a proper place to be making decisions on their behalf can actually do more harm than good and i ll point to if listeners are interested in reading more about this there s books by angus deaton the great escape also chris doing more harm than good there is a real question that not only is foreign aid often ineffective but often it starts to create moral questions of whether we ve actually made places worse off or made it even harder for them to get to where they need to go and so in beverly h and of course there s your book as well so the people could read this about this in your book property and freedom and i know while you deal with case studies of what can work you ve also delved into what hasn t worked you ve even given some very clear examples what are some of those examples of ways that we tried to help and then actually led to more harm than good matt warner well i mean you can look actually across both humanitarian and economic development for example coming in and telling the villagers in uganda to switch from growing bananas to growing corn because it ll get higher crop yields and you give them money to do that they trust you sounds good to them they switch their crops to corn and indeed they do have higher crop yields but there s no market for corn and there s nowhere to get it to transport it for sale and so it ends up rotting and attracting a rat infestation in the local village and so you end up with resentment on the part of the villagers who initially thought that you were there to help and obviously nobody wants to see those kinds of things happen matt warner but even the smartest people with big pocketbooks don t understand that economies develop because individuals make choices and they face trade offs that they understand better than anybody else and what they really need is more freedom so in the book i talk about examples of local think tanks who have local knowledge who aren t outsiders who are working for systemic change that removes barriers for individuals to be able to make more choices and there are some great examples from countries all over the world where you re seeing think tanks achieve these reforms and the payoffs start showing up immediately beverly h and i know that you had a conference last last month and you brought in some of these leaders from these organizations across the world you also have some great videos featuring some of these case studies on your website atlasnetwork org but give us an example of one of the case studies you highlighted in the book on how when the initiative was locally led it led to much better outcomes than foreign aid could ever lead to matt warner you bet so as a grant maker atlas network we have standards that our grantees need to meet but we don t prescribe the content or the substance or the strategy of what our grantees are trying to do so a partner of ours in burundi a country in africa that is scores very low on international indices of freedom and ease of doing business by the world bank et cetera it s a tough place to thrive a fairly authoritarian government we have a modest think tank partner there who is actually just very inspirational and enterprising and they do a lot with a little and they came to us with a set of plans that they wanted to advance to change the rhetoric in the country to say let s stop holding ourselves back and let s believe in ourselves as modest entrepreneurs and here are the things that the government can change in order to help support our country becoming more prosperous matt warner and that was a message that resonated with both government and with people and one of the outcomes of that is that they lowered it the cost to register a business formally it had previously been pretty cost prohibitive about 78 us to register your business formally this is in a country with a 300 gdp per capita and they dropped that down to 22 us and they immediately saw within a year a 49 increase in formal registrations of businesses let me explain one person s story of the difference that this made matt warner there s a gentleman named papa coriander or that s how he s known locally because he creates products out of coriander drinks and other foodstuffs and he had a business for years extremely modest barely getting by where he would create products out of coriander and in fact because he was in the informal sector and hadn t registered as a legal business because it was too cost prohibitive he had no legal protection and he had been jailed several times this happens often around the world if you re not a legal business then police can just take all of your inventory and take your cash and you have no recourse once he was able to become a formal business and join the legal sector not only do you have protections but that allows you to grow and to start to establish yourself and within one year after this change and him registering he now has 100 employees he went from 2 to 100 that s explosive growth and really has huge ripple effects in a country like like burundi beverly h and i think a natural question that people would have is is first of all how do you find these individuals if this is the right way to do it find people on the ground who are doing good i think it s hard for people to know okay then how do you get the money to them how do you find the people who are doing good especially when you consider that often so many times bad actors get ahold of foreign aid whether that s a government or people behaving poorly who have some type of influence in the region how do you connect with the people who want to do good matt warner well that s a great question and it s a real challenge and that s one of the things that our organization has identified as a value add that we can provide we have a robust team that is constantly spending time getting to know reaching out inviting people to our events and to our trainings so that we can learn who s trustworthy who s the real deal who s really being innovative and holding themselves to account and unfortunately if you step back into the broader ngo foreign aid world there s a real culture of opportunism and tell me what i need to say to get funded and i ll say it that kind of thing and so what our job is at atlas network through both our grantmaking and the training programs that we do is to really develop a sophisticated understanding of who is out there doing this for the right reasons trying to make the world a better place and has a deep understanding of economic freedom and its importance in society beverly h so are you suggesting then that america should not give out any foreign aid that that should be eliminated altogether what s your perspective on that matt warner well i ll put it this way i don t think discontinuing foreign aid would create some sort of a crisis we recently this year had a political drama over threats to rescind unspent foreign aid funds and of course the the aid organizations that depend on that money were facing existential crisis at that and my message to them is why are you pinning your ability to do good in the world on political benefactors you ought to transition to a diversified voluntary funding model where you aren t dependent on politicians for your resources to do what you think is so important but i will say that our focus at atlas network is on expanding what we re doing as an alternative and that s really what s most important and making sure that all of the great projects that we learn about around the world that promise to remove barriers for people living in very modest circumstances that those organizations are funded and able to achieve these kinds of things matt warner there s a another great example if i may that sort of highlights how important it is to get the local vision driving these projects we have a partner in sri lanka advocata institute who among other things identified that one of the reasons that participation in school in the workforce among girls and women was lagging in their country was an absurd number of artificial costs imposed on sanitary napkins that made it such that very few women and girls were able to afford what they needed in order to take care of themselves and be able to continue to attend school regularly and attend work regularly they did a campaign in the country to point this out there was over 100 increase on the cost as a consequence of various taxes and tariffs they ve succeeded so far in eliminating one of those tariffs roughly about 30 of the artificial cost has been removed but they re fighting on and trying to remove the remaining 60 and you can imagine what kind of impact that can have when you realize all the little ways that add up that bad government policy holds people back in poor places beverly h and just kind of rounding out the conversation we started up top you were talking about the situation the controversy surrounding president trump and the ukrainian president you talked about the politics kind of leaving that specific issue aside but thinking about this as a whole do you find whether it s from the united states using foreign aid as leverage which plenty of past presidents have done and also the politics that are played by the other countries do politics play a big role in foreign aid obviously the method that you re talking about does it in a different way it does development differently but do you find that politics are often a big role matt warner absolutely so if you think in the two categories are donor countries and recipient countries and in recipient countries they public choice theory someone in government isn t immune to incentives just because they re in government and you see lots of in fact it s sort of considered business as usual that there s going to be some set of basically corrupt practices in terms of conditions put on yes we will accept this funding but you have to use our airplanes and you have to make these kinds of payments and there s a paper by nathan nunn out of harvard where he tracks that not only is there some high expectation of 50 even of aid dollars being siphoned off but he s even identified cases where 100 of the funds were siphoned off and not able to land in their specific areas matt warner and look the other important issue that that comes up and is what are the implications for the evolution of these local democracies when our foreign government is creating a completely different set of incentives for local politicians to pay attention to it becomes they by nature are less sensitized to what their people want and are paying more attention to what they need to do to get something from us and this gets to another issue that i think is worth throwing in here right here at the end is i recently attended earlier this fall an event at the center for global development that was hosted by an organization called black women and development and i went to observe and learn and i learned quite a lot which was they are focusing on how they who have a lot of experience going around the world supporting aid projects these are very experienced professional women in the aid industry starting to ask the question what does it mean to get consent from the people that we re trying to serve matt warner and they gave examples of responding to earthquake in haiti and that the actual operations on the ground were a bunch of white educated people behind closed doors making decisions on behalf of haitians who are kept out of the process and so this really gets to some fundamental not only questions of efficacy but questions of morality and ethics we believe in democracy and i don t believe that we should be inadvertently purchasing away democratic institutions from other countries because we run roughshod with our good intentions beverly h and just kind of to finish up on that i think there s also this other side where people are incentivized to give when they know exactly what they re giving to and know that it could be of help i think when we realize our tax money is going to obviously the united states united states is going to determine how to use that money where people themselves are disconnected from the people they re helping i even think about when there was hurricane katrina it was often just the local community it was churches who went out there and helped and it was the local community that really helped to build and people coming in from other places so i think that there s also this aspect where people want to help people and when government s in the middle it takes away that human connection that often leads to to better outcomes beverly h so i just want to thank you for the work that you re doing the work that atlas is doing do get his new book matt warner s new book is called poverty and freedom case

please god make me good but not yet said augustine of hippo 354 430 on his way to eventually becoming a saint of the catholic church he was trying to overcome the temptation of concubinage or women of easy virtue which were common in the breakdown of roman society in the late fourth century augustine was eventually successful and helped establish christian morality as it existed for the next 1500 years it is becoming increasingly apparent that the phd standard has not and will never provide a stable reliable and uniform monetary system upon which rational economic calculation and rising prosperity can be based instead the phd types seem to be getting ready to double down on the sort of silliness that hasn t worked very well thus far and might lead to eventual disaster these academics and central bankers with phds remain very eager to convince anyone who will listen why they really really should be allowed to manage our monetary systems mostly this is because their very very good ideas will help to fix the problems left by the last generation of phd bearing money manipulators these range from cpi targeting fans to the advocates of modern monetary theory but there is another group of leaders i call them the grownups that seems to be looking at these claims with increasing skepticism these are generalist leaders such as presidents and prime ministers the leadership of china the higher minded elements of the deep state within the cia nsa or kremlin and military men who regard economic performance as an important part of national security these people can see the obvious the world gold standard system worked very well over a period of centuries prior to its dissolution in 1971 and we don t seem to have developed any viable alternatives since then it seems like today s national leaders are gradually reaching a consensus about how the world s monetary system should be structured they are getting ready to return to a gold standard system but not yet value of the u s dollar compared to gold 1790 2019 nathan lewis jim reid global head of thematic research at deutschebank recently suggested that fiat currencies might disappear before 2030 reid said that gold the once and future money is a likely successor as a high profile representative of current davos set thinking he is worth quoting at length we have lived in an era of fiat money since the early 1970s since then virtually all money in existence has only had a value based on trust and in particular trust in governments ability to maintain its value prior to this period most of the money in existence through history was backed by a commodity usually a precious metal like gold or silver when money broke loose from such an arrangement inflation tended to increase often dramatically and when money returned to it inflation was becalmed we think fiat money systems should be inherently unstable and prone to high inflation all other things being equal politically it is always too tempting to create money when nothing is backing it the forces that have held the current fiat system together now look fragile and they could unravel in the 2020s if so that will start to lead to a backlash against fiat money and demand for alternative currencies such as gold or crypto could soar malaysia s prime minister mohammad mahathir recently restated his long held desire for an international currency system based on gold mahathir has served as a representative of both the smaller asian countries and also the islamic world some people think that muammar qaddafi of libya was deposed in part because he was aiming to establish a pan african and pan islamic gold based currency china and russia have been making gold friendly statements for years backing this up with an apparent agenda to increase their gold bullion reserves president trump has consistently favored gold standard fans he has nominated three stephen moore herman cain and judy shelton to the federal reserve his economic advisor lawrence kudlow vice president mike pence and trump appointed world bank president david malpass have also indicated their friendliness toward the idea jim rickards also a member of the davos set suggested in aftermath 2019 that a mar a lago agreement may be in our future similar to the bretton woods agreement that re established the world gold standard in 1944 actually a better location would be trump s doral resort in florida recently proposed as a site for a g7 international monetary meeting in 2020 people have tasted the consequences of monetary immorality they are getting ready to be good again but there is a problem to establish a worldwide gold standard system today would mean that all existing debts and commitments government bonds social security medicare public and private pensions state debts and commitments would have to be paid back in hard money or renegotiated this can be done the british government had debts estimated at 178 of gdp at the end of the napoleonic wars in 1815 debt service costs absorbed 53 of central government tax revenue it would have been an easy matter to attempt to get out of these by devaluing the british pound which had been a floating currency for eighteen years by that point many promoted exactly this solution but instead the pound was returned to gold taxes were reduced spending was slashed britain became the most successful developed country of the nineteenth century and due mostly to rising gdp the debt gdp ratio eventually fell below 30 i describe this in more detail in the magic formula value of british pound compared to gold 1550 2017 nathan lewis today we do not seem to have that degree of fortitude the political battles to reform healthcare the welfare system social security the bad habit of chronic deficits the underfunded pensions the bankrupt states the student loans the tax system seem insurmountable congress squandering years with russiagate and impeachment does not seem able to accomplish anything at all the urge to maintain the status quo is intense britain did not have any kind of welfare system in the early nineteenth century with all the complications and expectations that involves i sense along with jim reid that with our growing political consensus around a long term gold standard solution we are also coming to a consensus about a short term period of housecleaning a cutting of the gordian knot a cleaning of augean stables in which all these issues are in effect made irrelevant by the printing press isn t that exactly what the modern monetary theory people are promising basically this is the period that in rickards book comes before the meeting in florida if that s the way we re going to do it then so be it let s try to keep things from getting too out of hand life in argentina is still tolerable today life in venezuela is not and then afterwards after the lessons have been learned and the decrepit old institutions are no more let s re establish the world gold standard system

republicans have rallied to president trump s defense with a vigor and ferocity that might even have surprised the president it was only a few years ago that many of them suggested he was not really a republican and certainly not a conservative but now republicans love trump and purist conservative groups such as the tea party patriots freedomworks and the club for growth are mobilizing their millions of supporters to fight for the president why the answer given most often is that trump has delivered on the republican agenda that when you look past the circus and the histrionics the president has been a reliable and staunch conservative and while this is undeniably true in some areas it s mostly in the realm of social and cultural policy appointing judges tightening rules related to abortion immigration and asylum etc in what republicans used to call the core of their agenda limited government trump has been profoundly unconservative take the issue that produced the tea party the united states runaway debt it was the prospect of mortgage relief for homeowners that began the movement but the broader issue was always the dangers of deficit spending according to fivethirtyeight in 2011 there were more than 8 000 mentions of the deficit during congressional proceedings in this generation a defining responsibility of government is to steer our nation clear of a debt crisis while there is still time said future house speaker paul d ryan in 2012 advertisement in his first year in office trump with the eager assistance of a republican house and senate blew up the u s budget with a tax cut that ballooned the deficit this year to about 1 trillion and will add nearly 2 trillion to the national debt over 10 years the hypocrisy of republicans about deficits which they care about only when democrats are in power has been often noted but what is more striking is that this abandonment of limited government and fiscal conservatism is part of a larger remake of conservatism itself trump has now added more than 88 billion in taxes in the form of tariffs according to the right leaning tax foundation despite what the president says tariffs are taxes on foreign goods paid by u s consumers this has had the effect of reducing gross domestic product and denting the wages of americans even the administration acknowledges the pain caused by its trade wars responding to one bad policy with another massive subsidies to favored victims farmers have been hit hard but trump recently explained that they can t be too angry with him because i gave them 12 billion and i gave them 16 billion this year that dwarfs the 12 billion the 2009 auto bailout cost the federal government follow this author fareed zakaria s opinions follow remember that free market ideology was born in opposition to tariffs protectionism and mercantilism which were the central focus of writers such as adam smith and david ricardo for decades conservatives including margaret thatcher and ronald reagan preached to the world the virtues of free trade but perhaps even more they believed in the idea that governments should not pick winners and losers in the economy an idea so fundamental to republicanism that trump tweeted it out in 2015 soon after announcing his candidacy advertisement yet the trump administration has behaved like a central planning agency granting exemptions on tariffs to favored companies and industries while refusing them to others salmon cod bibles and fracking chemicals are among the products that have escaped being taxed for now waivers are temporary so companies have had to reapply in true soviet style lobbyists lawyers and corporate executives now line up to petition government officials for these treasured waivers which are granted in an opaque process apparently sometimes by trump himself he initially tweeted that apple would not get one but after chief executive tim cook met with him it did all this favoritism fits very well with trump s desire to engage in industrial policy and one shaped to fulfill his own personal agenda not some national economic one he consistently helps companies and workers in key battleground states he hopes to win in 2020 he urged the tennessee valley authority to reconsider shutting down a power plant that buys coal from a major trump donor when he decides that he doesn t like a company or its chief executive such as jeff bezos he attacks them by name amazon claims it was unfairly rejected for a defense department contract worth up to 10 billion for this reason bezos amazon s founder and chief executive owns the post on the core issue that used to define the gop economics the party s agenda today is state planning and crony capitalism and this is what so called conservatives are doubling down to defend advertisement
