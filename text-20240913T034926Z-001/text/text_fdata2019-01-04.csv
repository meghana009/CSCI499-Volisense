by yaleglobal online governments contend with debt and sluggish growth many worldwide risks known and unknown could add complications by david dapice mick jagger of the rolling stones once studied economics but gave it up for singing when asked why he left economics he reputedly said there are too many variables anyone skilled in forecasting or not must share the feeling the us economy finished the year with low unemployment and inflation gdp growth near 3 percent and a volatile stock market up from the 2016 presidential election if not for the year despite high corporate profits though investors are nervous about hard to predict variables in short there are risks many anticipated and others unknown while most economists see us growth near 3 percent for 2018 few would rule out a recession as possible if not probable by 2020 indeed four out of five chief financial officers from major companies expect a recession by 2020 likewise the international monetary fund forecast the world economy would grow at 3 7 percent in 2018 and this year but the forecast is fragile dependent on a lack of major shocks the trade war looks likely to be extended and intensified if escalated it will slow growth in both the united states and china as well as countries that sell to them this is because tariffs act much like an oil price increase in an oil importing country creating price pressures while decreasing economic activity oil is not greatly responsive to prices in the short term it takes time to do much more than turn down the thermostat or drive less anything transported by oil or using oil most products costs more people have less to spend after paying for more costly oil while imports from china may be more price responsive it takes time to shift production elsewhere the dislocation to us farmers and other exporters hurts economic activity while imports cost more economic activity slows even as prices rise the us federal reserve in a bind must decide whether to cut interest rates allowing inflation to grow or raise them and increase unemployment the trade war alone would not be a huge concern us trade with china is 3 to 4 percent of gdp and even with tariffs the impact is only a few tenths of a percent in lost growth however china is slowing and has a lot of bad debt in its credit system a sharper decline in growth is a real possibility despite china s ability to pump up credit growth again something that aggravates its long term problems with lots of empty real estate and a shrinking workforce china is in a weaker position than a few years ago many emerging markets export to china and weaker demand for raw materials would hurt their growth emerging markets are already stressed many governments or local corporations borrowed us dollars at a time when interest rates were low and now the strong dollar and rising interest rates make repayments burdensome the imf shows china growing at 6 percent or a bit more for 2019 to 2021 but again this assumes no major disruption improving projected growth in latin america and africa depend on this assumption then of course there is the overall uncertainty for europe brexit exitaly france s yellow vest clashes political uncertainty in germany if the euro were to fail or a major economy such as italy faced rising interest rates that create greece like problems the path is uncertain would the european central bank again do whatever it takes and expand buying of government bonds would germany veto this the members of the italian coalition unaccustomed to governing struggle to compromise even with each other given the size of italy s economy and its debt held by many euro banks a debt implosion would have a significant contractionary impact on euro bank lending and the eu economy as a whole the obvious solution is to create money but that may not happen brexit in contrast would be terrible for the united kingdom if disorderly but not a disaster for the european union the imf shows eu growth falling from 2 7 percent in 2017 to 1 8 percent by 2020 and this could be optimistic economists forecast the us economy to slow to a respectable if unexciting 2 5 percent or so in 2019 but below 2 percent after that this reflects sluggish productivity growth and a stable labor force as baby boomers retire and the forecast assumes no major disruption from a government shutdown or constitutional crisis still there is a reckoning from the tax cut and 2018 spending spree curiously begun at a time of full employment the government is generating trillion dollar deficits when revenues are high long term treasury yields are falling now suggesting slowing growth this could lead to lower short term treasury rates and a weaker dollar which ironically would tend to drive up borrowing costs especially with the huge deficits higher long term interest rates which the federal reserve does not normally control would hurt housing autos and some investment raise the deficit in itself and make loans for infrastructure repair more expensive the reduction in fiscal space essentially the flexibility to react to adverse events with fiscal policy is another real uncertainty weighing on investment it is useful when thinking about economic growth to take the perspective of a business new investments must pay for themselves this may be easier with new software which saves labor and can pay for itself in a year or less but is much harder with a factory or piece of machinery while the outlook is muddy brexit uncertainty has depressed investment in the united kingdom for example one reason donald trump s attempt to encourage coal is not working is uncertainty over a possible carbon tax or similar regulation consider investing in europe with the eu s existential problems or the united states with its inability to conduct sustainable fiscal policy or repair infrastructure businesses and investors prefer caution to a near death experience or bankruptcy this caution translates into lower productivity growth in the united states labor productivity growth has been less than 1 percent a year since 2010 with slow growth in the number of workers and slow growth in output per worker and depressed investment levels it is not surprising that overall growth is slowing then add the list of unknown unknowns will there be a cyber apocalypse the question was raised not by some wild eyed cyber punk but the us 2018 economic report of the president the hacking of a half billion names from a major hotel chain attributed to official chinese hackers gives some idea of what might happen if the financial system or the utility grid came under determined attacks from an unfriendly government or criminal group disruptions to oil supply if iran blocked routes is another low probability event that cannot be ignored though oil stockpiles and alternative sources would soften that blow to an extent such shocks would be severe and hard to predict both known risks and unknown shocks could interact to produce more severe and surprising outcomes the upside of these problems even migration and climate change is that they are amenable to better policy which does not make those policies popular or easy the political class must find a way to be honest with voters and persuade them that what is necessary is reasonable that requires listening as well as making speeches nations can tackle these challenges together or find them impossible to resolve alone david dapice is the economist of the vietnam and myanmar program at harvard university s kennedy school of government
as we step into a new year the world is facing a decisive turning point the crisis of capitalism is reaching a new level one that threatens to overthrow the entire existing world order that was painfully put together after the second world war 10 years after the financial collapse of 2008 the bourgeoisie is nowhere near solving the economic crisis all the sacrifices and pain of the last 10 years have not solved the crisis but only increased the suffering impoverishment and desperation of the masses while a tiny minority of parasites have acquired obscene levels of wealth but politics in the last analysis is concentrated economics a decade ago we predicted that all the attempts of governments to restore the economic equilibrium would only serve to destroy the social and political equilibrium we see this in one country after another in europe we have the simmering brexit crisis in itself a highly destabilising element in the situation it has thrown britain into a deep crisis with no clear end in sight not long ago britain was perhaps the most politically stable country in europe now it is one of the most unstable countries a few weeks ago on channel 4 news the well known conservative political commentator matthew parris was asked if he thought that the present crisis was the most serious one in british history he answered as follows i can remember the suez crisis of 1956 that was a very serious crisis and i have since lived through other ones but always in the past no matter how deep the crisis i always had the sensation that someone somewhere had a plan clear idea of how to get out of the crisis i no longer have that feeling in just over a week s time the british prime minister theresa may will present her ill fated deal for the approval of the british parliament her chances of success resemble those of a snowball in hell but having defeated the deal so painfully put together with eu what will happen next the possibility of britain leaving the eu without a deal is a finished recipe for unprecedented economic social and political chaos not just in britain but throughout europe the possibility of britain leaving the eu without a deal is a finished recipe for unprecedented economic social and political chaos not just in britain but throughout europe image socialist appeal it is a measure of the complete bankruptcy of the british political establishment that such a scenario could even be contemplated but the clock is ticking and britain is running out of time whatever alternative is proposed will be disastrous the only question is the degree of the disaster the stage is set in any case for a very stormy period for britain but the crisis of europe does not end there in germany which for decades was the real motor force behind the european economy the long domination of the two major political parties the christian democrats and social democrats is on the point of collapse angela merkel giving up her position as leader of the christian democrats was merely a symptom of the underlying political tensions that are a portent of a growing social polarisation the same phenomenon can be observed in many countries in france the electoral victory of emmanuel macron was heralded as a great victory for the political centre like st george and the dragon macron miraculously came down from the clouds to slay the evil dragon of extremism of the left and right but it did not take long for the man who was widely believed to walk on water to sink beneath the stormy waves of the class struggle the absurd illusions of the political commentators who saw in this petty political narcissist a saviour not only for france but for the whole of europe evaporated like a drop of water on a hot stove the collapse of macron s popularity has been far swifter and more catastrophic than that of his unfortunate predecessor françois hollande the polls that gave him over 70 percent support at the time of his election were below 20 percent in december this dramatic turnabout was the direct result of something that was not supposed to happen the direct revolutionary action of the masses in a matter of weeks the workers and youth of france succeeded in demolishing the false image of invulnerability of the french president who was reduced to pleading with them to allow him to rule the man who boasted that he would never surrender to the street was forced to carry out a humiliating u turn in the end though that will not be enough to save him france and germany for decades the destiny of europe was decided by two countries france and germany in the beginning the french ruling class with its exaggerated sense of importance wanted to tie germany to its side providing the economic basis for a united europe while france would provide the political leadership a vain hope in the end it is economic power that decides politics not vice versa nowadays only a fool can fail to understand that it is germany and not france that decides all the fundamental questions in europe macron s ambition that he would dictate to berlin and even to washington was soon exposed as the ridiculous illusion it always was merkel s crisis will not serve to increase the power and authority of the french president who now finds himself in the unenviable position of the emperor who paraded his nakedness under the guise of a suit of new clothes even when hiding behind a gilded desk his political nakedness is clear to all the growing split between france and germany is based neither on religious principles morality philosophy or humanitarianism but on hard cash which under capitalism replaces the heart and soul as the real motor force of society under conditions of capitalist crisis there is no way that this split can be healed it threatens to provoke an existential crisis at the very heart of the european union macron displays a most touching sympathy for the problems of italy and other mediterranean nations who have regrettably fallen into debt in recent years wrapping himself in the flag of european solidarity he pleads with the eu to show humanitarianism and generosity after all did not our lord himself say and forgive us our debts macron the moderate saviour of europe proved to be an emperor in new clothes and not even a golden desk could conceal his political nakedness image révolution it is a well known fact that few pleasures in life can compare with the gentle art of spending other people s money when macron pleads for debt forgiveness he is well aware that those who must forgive are not to be found in paris but in berlin and those who pull the strings of the bundesbank are not overly keen on forgiving debts or anything else as the people of greece will willingly testify in his own country emmanuel macron the rich man s president was hellbent on carrying out a policy of deep cuts together with tax relief for the rich but macron s surrender to the gilets jaunes protesters promising a 10bn 11 4bn package will mean that france s budget deficit is set like italy s to overtake the limits allowed by the eurozone this fact goes some way to explain the different attitudes adopted by the rulers of france and germany all the factors are combining to accentuate the centrifugal tendencies aggravating the contradictions and tensions between nations that the eu was formed to prevent to add fuel to the flames we have the simmering crisis caused by the flood of refugees knocking on europe s doors this in turn has opened up new fault lines between germany and its eastern european satellites poland and hungary are in a direct confrontation with the european union over the question of immigration backed from the sidelines by the right wing government of austria in germany the reactionary anti immigrant alternative for germany afd party is gaining ground particularly in four eastern german states the stage is therefore set for a grand political drama in europe the crisis over brexit is merely the curtain raiser the federalist vision for europe has sunk without trace far from moving towards greater unity the european union is fragmenting before our very eyes new fault lines emerge the political tensions between france and germany are merely a surface expression of deep seated economic divisions between the north and south of europe recently a new block has emerged yet another fault line alongside the many other cracks that threaten the european union with a breakup some have baptised it a new hanseatic league harking back to the powerful group of merchant states around the baltic area that dominated a great part of europe s financial life in the mediaeval period a chasm has opened up between the poorer countries of southern europe and the more prosperous economies of the north denmark sweden finland estonia latvia lithuania the netherlands and ireland are relatively small countries in the broader european context but they have clubbed together to resist the claims of southern european countries on europe s budget to cover huge deficits after years of austerity cuts and terrible suffering greece has been reduced to ruin by the iron embrace of berlin and brussels nothing has been solved and the crisis has now spread to italy where the accumulated deficit amounts to 130 percent of gdp the anti eu coalition in rome approved a budget that violated the limits imposed by brussels provoking an open confrontation for the time being the cracks have been papered over but the crisis of italy remains and has far more serious implications for the eu than greece ever had when all is said and done greece is a relatively small economy on the periphery of europe by contrast italy is the third biggest economy of the eurozone the italian government hoped that by pumping money into the economy they could make it grow again but if the italian treasury had been forced to pay huge fines it would have wiped out whatever impact the extra spending might have had staring down the barrel of a gun luigi di maio the leader of the five star movement m5s and matteo salvini of the northern league saw that discretion was the better part of valour swallowed hard and threw in the towel in the end a shaky agreement was cobbled together the european commission grudgingly agreed to a compromise plan italy undertook to trim its nominal budget deficit from 2 4 percent of gdp to 2 percent the commission reluctantly agreed that the structural deficit which leaves out one off measures and cyclical effects should remain unchanged next year the solution on the table is not ideal european commission vice president valdis dombrovskis grumbled that was an understatement of genius the deal allows the commission to avoid legal action against italy provided that the measures are fully implemented that subordinate clause indicates that the clash with italy has not been resolved only delayed next year s budget did not offer solutions for the country s long term problems why did the european commission agree to an unsatisfactory deal the answer is to be found not in economics but in politics they had just allowed france s president to get away with promising up to 10bn in extra spending to quell the rebellion of the gilets jaunes yellow vests that threatened to push france s budget deficit next year well over the euro zone s limit of 3 percent of gdp they were therefore scarcely in a position to put much pressure on the italians whose projected deficit was actually below 3 percent of gdp but there were clearly other more serious considerations in an interview with corriere della sera a daily the italian prime minister giuseppe conte said he had reminded the commission that his government faced a duty to maintain social stability in italy that was a scarcely veiled threat either you stop putting pressure on us or italy will face a social explosion that will have repercussions beyond our borders the warning was not lost on the men in brussels it may be said that italy is too big to fail but one must add that it is also too big to save there is not enough money in the bundesbank to bail out ailing italian capitalism this drama has not yet been played out to the end a worldwide crisis in the 1920s trotsky predicted that the centre of world history which had already passed from the mediterranean to the atlantic would in future pass from the atlantic to the pacific that remarkable prediction is now a fact europe is falling behind america and china in the race for new artificial intelligence technologies in 2019 india will probably overtake both britain and france at least in absolute terms to become the world s fifth largest economy the future of world history will be finally decided not by europe but the pacific but this process itself is full of contradictions the fate of the world economy depends to a large extent on china which until recently was one of its main motor forces but china depends to a large extent on exports falling demand in europe and the usa has created a crisis of overproduction in steel and other key sectors of the chinese economy china s growth rate has slowed to about 6 5 percent china has now emerged as a world power that is increasingly coming into conflict with the united states image the white house though this may seem like a high figure when compared to the miserable rates of growth in europe and the usa it is alarmingly slow when compared to the past it has been generally accepted that anything less than an 8 percent growth rate for china is dangerously low since that is the rate required to keep up with the growth of its population in order to stimulate exports china has resorted to dumping large amounts of cheap steel on the world market this has led to a serious crisis of steel in europe and howls of protest from the americans in particular it is one of the main factors that led to the present trade war between the usa and china china has now emerged as a world power that is increasingly coming into conflict with the united states the trade war between these two countries is a clear manifestation of this fact nevertheless the usa still retains its dominant position in the world economy and politics the combination of rising interest rates and a soaring dollar has served to attract large amounts of speculative capital to the usa with disastrous effects for the so called emerging markets in latin america asia and the middle east their fragile economies finding themselves at the mercy of the all powerful dollar which is squeezing them aggravating indebtedness and snatching away precious investments in the last period the so called emerging economies acted as a stimulus to world economic growth now they have shuddered to a halt turkey argentina brazil and other formerly resilient economies have collapsed into recession or in the best case scenario stagnation the real face of us imperialism donald trump s slogan make america great again is a kind of imperialist manifesto the subtext of which reads as follows we will make america great again at the expense of the rest of the world behind the swaggering boastful rhetoric lies a clear threat to the rest of the world do as we say or face the consequences president trump has very little time for america s european allies whom he correctly sees as midgets compared to the gigantic power of the usa he is irritated by the pretensions of the europeans their fussing about the world stage and their ridiculous attempts to influence us foreign policy they buzz around his head like so many annoying flies and whereas previous american presidents were content to pretend to pay them some attention his instinct is to swat them hard so they will cease to bother him trump s policy in essence is not very different to that of his predecessors they also did not hesitate to use america s economic and military strength to impose its will on the rest of the world but they did so in a different way some might say with more finesse others would say rather more truthfully with extreme hypocrisy while proclaiming the virtues of democracy justice peace and humanitarianism they did not hesitate to trample underfoot every manifestation that contradicted america s real or perceived interests donald trump does exactly the same but does not bother to proclaim values in which he has absolutely no interest and which in any case play absolutely no role in the foreign policy of american imperialism or any other brand of imperialism trump has cast aside the hypocritical mask of decency to reveal the real ugly face of american imperialism for the edification of the entire world to that extent one might say that he is refreshingly honest america still remains a colossus on the world scale its economic and military power is truly vast but america s power is not unlimited its limits have been demonstrated with brutal clarity in iraq syria and afghanistan and president trump has not been slow to draw the conclusions trump s whole instinct is inclined towards isolationism a very old and honoured tradition of a certain sector of the american ruling class as we have observed he is completely uninterested in the affairs of his european allies in a moment of unaccustomed sincerity he described them as enemies as opposed to the russians who were mere rivals as a matter of fact he does not even have much time for nato and would rather see it disbanded along with the united nations nafta the world trade organisation and all other unhealthy manifestations of extra national organisations but since regrettably he has to listen to the opinions of his numerous annoying advisers he has been compelled grudgingly to accept the existence of this inconvenient military alliance while loudly demanding that his european allies put their hands in their pockets to finance it thus relieving the burden of american taxpayers whose votes are more important to him than the opinions of people in paris berlin and london trump has cast aside the hypocritical mask of decency to reveal the real ugly face of american imperialism for the edification of the entire world image flickr gage skidmore nevertheless he has decided unilaterally to withdraw american troops from the middle east this will show the europeans that he means what he says and perhaps finally force them to put their money where their mouths are a similar motivation is behind his seemingly paradoxical attitude towards vladimir putin during his presidential campaign he lost no opportunity to praise the man in the kremlin calling him a real smart guy and a man with whom one could do business these remarks did not go down well with the us military establishment nor with the hawks of the republican party and they provided his political enemies with a golden opportunity to attack him alleging russian complicity in his presidential campaign the campaign on so called russian interference in the election has rumbled on relentlessly ever since although it has generated more heat than light the idea that the victory of trump was caused by russian interference would not seem credible to a six year old child of average intelligence it is merely a reflection of the inability of the democrats to accept that the american public was utterly alienated from the existing political establishment and motivated by a deep desire for change under pressure from his adversaries trump was forced to blow hot and cold in relation to russia but his decision to withdraw from syria indicates that he has not changed his position since the election once again trump s isolationist instincts have prevailed john kelly the white house chief of staff and jim mattis secretary of defence resigned in protest but protests and resignations have had no effect on trump in the past and there is no reason to believe that this time will be any different but isolationism by no means signifies abstentionism that is rendered impossible by the unstoppable trend to unify all the disparate economies in the world into a single world market globalisation is merely an expression of a phenomenon that was already predicted by marx and engels in the communist manifesto over 150 years ago that prediction has been brilliantly borne out by the history of the world particularly over the last 50 years no country no matter how big and powerful can escape the irresistible pull of the world market all the talk about national sovereignty gaining control of our own frontiers and so on is just so much hot air the storm clouds gather hanging over the whole unstable equation like a menacing storm cloud is the imminent threat of a new world recession this is now accepted by all serious economists the question is not if it will happen only when the global economic instability is reflected in the constant gyrations of the stock markets following falls in october and stagnation in november the s p 500 slumped by 15 percent between 30 november and 24 december despite a brief recovery of 5 percent the day after christmas the index finished the year 6 percent below where it started the first trading day of 2019 showed further instability with falling stocks in asia and turbulence in europe the unexpected news of a slump in apple s sales caused a wave of alarm the company issued a warning of a sharp slowdown in china s economy and weak sales in other emerging markets this meant that revenues in the fourth quarter would undershoot expectations by up to 10 percent following soon after was news that china s manufacturing sector contracted in december which unnerved investors globally s p 500 futures dipped before wall street reopened on 3 january these feverish swings on the stock exchanges of the world are an indication of extreme nervousness and increasing worry about the future perspectives of the world economy while it is true that the movements of the stock markets do not accurately reflect the state of the real economy they nevertheless serve as a useful barometer to measure the current state of mind of investors a recent article in the economist voiced its concern but the rotten performance of stock markets last year which has been maintained at the start of this one can be traced in part to growing worry about the state of the world economy and to its two biggest economies in particular the article continues according to the economist intelligence unit eiu our sister company america will grow by 2 3 this year that is substantially down on an estimated growth rate of 2 9 for last year as the federal reserve tightens monetary policy and as the effects of last year s tax cuts ebb china s forecast growth rate is much higher at 6 3 but that is still down on its estimated 2018 performance and plenty fear worse because of the trade war with america and china s campaign to rein in debt europe presents a gloomier picture still britain which is due to leave the european union in march is forecast to grow by a tepid 1 5 france faces less uncertainty but fares no better italy a perennial economic disappointment is tipped to notch up growth of just 0 4 that makes it the seventh worst performer in the eiu s table of forecasts those below it are all forecast to contract in 2019 none more precipitously than venezuela which has been in freefall for years as one might expect the economist necessarily tries to find some crumbs of comfort pointing out that india was expected to grow at the same rate as last year 7 4 percent but as we know every silver lining has a cloud and it is not for nothing that economics is known as the dismal science with a wry sense of humour the author concludes but the economy that is expected to perform best in 2019 syria with forecast growth of 9 9 is a sobering reminder that a high number can reflect the worst of starting points there is growing alarm in the ranks of the most serious bourgeois economists this alarm is well founded the total return capital gains or losses plus dividends from the s p 500 index of leading american shares was negative for the first time in a decade matters were even worse in other markets the shanghai index fell by a quarter there is a stampede of investors from risky assets including the so called emerging markets into safer havens treasury bonds and gold outstripped stocks anticipating hard times the capitalists are now hoarding cash instead of investing in production everything suggests that when it comes the next recession will be far worse than the crisis of 2008 the main reason for this is that over the last decade the bourgeoisie has used up all the instruments that have been traditionally utilised to prevent recessions or to limit their duration and depth the capitalists have basically two weapons to hand with which to confront recession the first of these is the lowering of interest rates but in their desperate attempts to climb out of the last recession they have reduced interest rates to historically unprecedented levels typically in the region of zero the scope for further rate reductions is therefore negligible even in the usa where the federal reserve has increased rates several times over the last year or so the margin for manoeuvre is still very restricted the second weapon is to increase the amount of money in circulation through intervention by the state and central banks but here there is a problem vast amounts of money were pumped into the economy over the last decade to bail out the private banks all that has been achieved has been to transform what was originally a gigantic black hole in the spreadsheets of the banks into a gigantic black hole in the public finances everywhere they have piled up huge deficits which act as a gigantic drag on the economy the bourgeoisie is struggling to reduce the debts not increase them still further given this fact there is no way that the bourgeois can yet again plunder the state in order to drag itself out of the hole the dilemma of the bourgeois is illustrated by the fact that the european central bank announced the end of monetary stimulus quantitative easing at the very time when there are signs that the european economy is slowing but the european bourgeois obsessed with the problem of brexit and immigration seem oblivious to the danger the ecb is doing the very opposite of what is needed from a capitalist point of view all this raises serious questions about the future of the euro and ultimately the eu itself the situation on the other side of the atlantic is no better the year 2019 has been celebrated by america s political rulers by an unsightly brawl that led to the partial shutdown of the government on 22 december during a televised meeting in december with nancy pelosi and chuck schumer democratic leaders in the house and senate mr trump was heard to say i will shut down the government if i don t get my wall and he was as good as his word it is true that such shutdowns have occurred before but none have lasted as long as this this reflects a deep crisis in the whole political system with a congress controlled by the democrats bitterly hostile to the president predictably an agreement has been stitched up at the last minute but trump is threatening to veto the deal and none of the underlying contradictions have been resolved to add to the general chaos there is a continuing and bitter dispute between the president and the us federal reserve as a result of the latter s insistence in raising interest rates but while the politicians bicker about economic policy the markets are set to deliver their verdict without consulting the men in washington donald trump is a man who seems to have been lucky most of his life a lucky man tends to be a gambler since past bets have been successful why not continue gambling but history shows that for every gambler the day must come when his lucky streak runs out trump had the good fortune to enter the white house at the time when the us economy was doing pretty well he could claim the credit for things that were really none of his doing but those who supported him could not see the difference his luck held he could argue with some degree of correctness that his tax cutting measures helped to boost the economy for a time but in economics as in nature sooner or later everything turns into its opposite the short term effects of president trump s stimulus package which came into force a year ago are wearing off at a time when there are clear signs of economic slowdowns in china and europe trump s imposition of tariffs and the threat of further trade disputes act as a further deterrent to investment profit forecasts have been scaled back the nervousness of the stock markets reflects concerns about the real economy the usa is about to enter the most turbulent period in its entire history and donald s lucky streak is about to come to a bumpy end a crisis of leadership society is increasingly divided between a small group of people who control the system and the overwhelming majority who are getting poorer and are in open rebellion against the system everywhere we look we see growing discontent anger fury and a hatred of the existing order this expresses itself in different ways in different countries but everywhere we see that the masses the workers and youth are beginning to move to challenge the old order and fight against it 2018 saw an upsurge in the mass movement in many different countries iran iraq tunisia spain catalonia pakistan russia togo hungary and of course france the recent events in france provide a crushing answer to all the cynics and sceptics who doubt the ability of the working class to change society like a thunderbolt from a clear blue sky the workers and youth took to the streets and in a couple of weeks brought the government to its knees if that movement had been equipped with a serious leadership it could have brought down the government and prepared the way for a root and branch transformation of french society in the absence of a clear leadership and programme it is possible that the movement will die down for a time but the underlying contradictions remain the government of macron is like a ship that has been holed below the water level it can continue to float for a while but its days are numbered the workers and youth now feel the power of collective class action they will not be bought off by partial and temporary concessions sooner or later they will move into action again this time with a clearer vision of what is needed a militant programme to kick out a hated president and to fight for a government that will act in the interests of the working class this spontaneous movement of the masses is the prior condition for socialist revolution but in and of itself it is not sufficient to guarantee success in 1938 trotsky wrote that one could reduce the crisis of humanity to the crisis of leadership of the proletariat that statement is even more true today than when it was written the history of war gives us many examples where a big army of brave soldiers has been defeated by a far smaller force of disciplined troops led by experienced officers and the war between the classes has many points of similarity with war between nations the recent events in france provide a crushing answer to all the cynics and sceptics who doubt the ability of the working class to change society image twitter cgt the cowardly evasions and half measures of the reformists far from solving the crisis will merely impart to it an even more convulsive painful and destructive character it is the task of revolutionaries to ensure that this long and painful death agony of capitalism is cut short as soon as possible and with the least possible suffering for the working class for this to occur decisive action is necessary only the marxists are capable of providing the leadership that will guarantee such a peaceful and painless outcome from the present crisis it is true that the forces of marxism on a world scale have been thrown back for a long period by objective factors the betrayals of reformism and stalinism allowed capitalism to survive but their actions were made possible by the ability of capitalism to achieve a relative stability and to make certain concessions to the working class but this period is now at an end for decades we have been swimming against the stream just to maintain our forces intact in that period was a considerable feat but now the tide of history has begun to turn instead of swimming against the current we are beginning to swim with it all the old certainties are disappearing the old illusions are gradually being burnt out of the consciousness of the working class the masses are being forced at last to face reality they are slowly beginning to draw conclusions that is our great strength and the great weakness of capitalism and reformism our international lacks the huge financial resources of the reformist parties but in the most important field we are immeasurably stronger than any other tendency in the world we have the ideas of marxism and it is the power of ideas that can change the world we must have complete confidence in our ideas programme and perspectives and confidence in the working class the only class that can change society above all we must have confidence in ourselves for if we do not do this work nobody else will do it for us
we are living in a time of prescriptions for america s economic woes that carry little meaning forget what you hear on tv unfettered free trade tariffs de facto open borders immigration a consequence of a political dysfunction that precludes genuine immigration reform and market fundamentalism have done little to eliminate the paucity of quality employment opportunities a good new year s resolution therefore would be constructing new policies that solve this problem in a viable long lasting way even if it means discarding increasingly outdated shibboleths much of the story of the u s and other western democracies over the past 40 years has been the loss of highly skilled well paying jobs displaced in many instances by the proliferation of low wage and low productivity jobs in health care food service or becoming a gig driver for uber the effects have been confirmed in a recent study by mckinsey which showed that income growth has stagnated or fallen for the majority of households in the advanced economies over the past few decades the only way to fix this is with direct government spending into the economy that involvement must be via spending on badly needed public goods such as infrastructure and publicly funded education but that is not the only legitimate role for the state we also need a well designed industrial policy that focuses on the creation of quality private sector jobs capable of profitably supporting workers with solid middle class incomes these must be accompanied by social policies on immigration environmentalism and trade that do not simply treat worker displacement as an unfortunate by product negative externality in econ speak cast on the scrap heap of progress similarly workers should not be viewed as deplorables if and when they understandably object to disproportionately bearing the restructuring costs as the economy moves toward greater environmental sustainability free market fundamentalism has done a great job of extracting value from the economy and largely distributing its gains to the top 1 percent when governments occasionally find a way to redistribute the benefits of that value extraction to the broader population whether via a minimum wage tighter regulation state intervention or similar policy these measures are invariably castigated as wrongheaded inevitably leading to less efficiency sub optimal growth and lower standards of living but from whose perspective here s the thing reiterating superficial reforms of outdated notions of free trade liberalized immigration and comparative advantage while ignoring the social pathologies created by these long standing policies hardly constitutes a realistic policy response it evokes the definition of madness long attributed to einstein furthermore in a hyper globalized world it is harder to make the case that any nation possesses greater comparative advantage other than those obtained through lower labor costs and mercantilist manipulation indeed neither capacity nor comparative advantage is fixed both are chosen they are decisions not fate even natural resources while still a factor provide much less relative advantage than in earlier times basically any nation can produce anything the only issue is relative cost since the developed countries cannot thrive as the lower cost producers via labor advantage the only tool left in the pursuit of economic health is to combat mercantilism with mercantilism or reverse mercantilism if you prefer the policy tools may involve forms of protectionism but the same results might also be achieved via taxation since unemployment is the source of the extended pay benefits provided by the government the government can for example permanently tax the source of the unemployment u s corporations that have historically resorted to offshoring taxation done in this manner will help restore a permanent incentive to invest in plants and equipment in the u s ultimately the aim is to change the labor share of the production equation so that production vastly increases general welfare and living standards for the largest possible majority of people by conducting policy with a view toward favoring labor over capital the aim is to produce a larger economy and more stable albeit restrained profits investors in the stock market might not benefit as much but the rest of us will there is however a chicken and egg element to the concept of warranted industrial policy we cannot overstress profits or overprice goods until we have channeled sufficient incomes to households for them to afford higher priced goods otherwise we have an even bigger personal debt problem than we do now average american household debt stands at around 130 000 it was a key insight of the noted british economist of the late 19th early 20th century john atkinson hobson whose theory of under consumption as i have written before challenged the prevailing ideology of the day which considered wage suppression to be good for business and society in fact as hobson pointed out labor is not just a cost input but an important source of demand so restricting the former s purchasing power can lead to sub optimal economic growth a better policy response which runs contrary to today s prevailing neoliberal theology is to gradually enhance purchasing power by gradually removing direct burdens on households that limit their truly disposable income state assumption of medical and education costs and a reform of the tax system so that it no longer gears fiscal policy benefits largely toward the top 1 percent who have the highest savings propensities another aspect to this may entail some form of managed trade as well via local content requirements lcrs here s how this would work every large nation or bloc it doesn t work for small countries would be allowed to adopt local content requirements for the industries it wants ranging from zero to 100 percent 100 representing the highest military or economic importance the rest of the world can compete for the remaining share of the national bloc market free trade theologians will no doubt rebel but the virtue of this idea is that it reduces the incentive for mercantilism precisely because lcrs make it impossible to drive your trading partner out of a desired industry by dumping likewise currency manipulation doesn t work to wipe out your trading partner because a large percentage of say semiconductor chips must be made in the u s under this program whether the dollar is high or low import substitution via local content requirements is often derided by free market theologians it is true that import substitution partial or total can have its own pathologies but it has one significant virtue there is no incentive for dumping motivated overproduction no rational private firm is going to make products far in excess of demand in the local market national or bloc and there would be no point in governments subsidizing products to dump them abroad because dumping would be deterred by foreign in market production rules of various kinds quotas tariffs local content requirements granted this wouldn t entirely deter dumping which could still pay off for mercantilist regimes that want to corner the free shares of nations bloc markets but it would greatly lower the stakes no major nation or bloc need worry that it will lose any industry it wants to keep to predatory trade practices the idea of eliminating everybody s tariffs instead of granting market access on a case by case basis seems to have come from the wilsonian wing of the democratic party led by cordell hull the tennessee senator who subsequently became fdr s secretary of state for 11 years hull and other southerners had always been for free trade because they had no industries in need of infant industry protection and wanted to sell cotton soybeans beef and any other farm products to the markets of the european empires u s manufacturing was part of the free trade coalition during the brief moment of u s global manufacturing monopoly from the 1940s to the 70s but the postwar recovery of east asia and germany caused a crisis that u s firms solved by offshoring to cheap labor locales rather than pressing to alter trade regimes or investing to move higher up the technology curve to offset the impact of rising labor costs part of our policy challenge today springs from the fact that we are an advanced industrial economy operating with rules set by long dead agrarians and justified by an agrarian economic philosophy adam smith like the french physiocrats favored farming over premodern sweatshop manufacturing which they all thought was dehumanizing they didn t grasp machine based manufacturing which came later accordingly the 2020s need to be devoted to the end of the 40 year reagan thatcher experiment with unmanaged capitalism based on these archaic rules simply letting markets be markets the dictum of the anti trust brigade does not necessarily provide optimal outcomes in fact it represents a kind of neoliberalism on steroids the state needs to be involved so as to rectify the imbalances created by head to head competition with highly managed state supported forms of capitalism a necessary corollary is that export processing zones epzs should be outlawed many of them in china or elsewhere require by local law a majority of goods produced to be sold outside of the country in which they are made protecting local national champions while encouraging dumping and mercantilism the key to understanding contemporary global production is our bizarre new quasi medieval system of territorial enclave arbitrage epzs physical production and tax havens finance and ip add to that phenomenon the fact that there are elites willing to pay an illegal immigrant servant class off the books and you have a system of indentured servitude created by corporations and the rich that evades labor unions taxes and labor laws this new parallel world order of enclaves is incompatible with a global westphalian system of industrial nation states based at least in theory on popular sovereignty more and more of the national working class population gets priced out of the high urban living costs of our major cities and into post industrial heartlands with no high value added industry and no way to use the ballot box in democratic government to tax the rich to pay even for basic services and social insurance thus the yellow vests in france and similar phenomena elsewhere here s another aspect that would undoubtedly help labor but no doubt be greeted with profound misgivings by much of the liberal punditocracy immigration reform we also need an immigration reform bill not based on building a useless 2 000 mile wall but one predicated on the barbara jordan commission s guiding principles listed below clear goals and priorities must define u s immigration policy effective policy means enforcement of immigration limits regular review is needed to ensure flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances in the united states immigration policy should be comprehensible and its implementation efficient sponsors are responsible for ensuring that immigrants do not become burdens on the american taxpayer immigration policy must protect u s workers against unfair competition from foreign workers with an appropriately higher level of protection for the most vulnerable in our society both temporary and permanent admissions categories must be seen as integral parts of a cohesive immigration policy a sound immigration policy supports americanization meaning that immigrants share with americans such values as the belief in liberty democracy and equal opportunity fundamental immigration reform requires a period of transition to get from the present system to the new one for those who chafe against the enforcement of immigration limits it s worth noting that in the words of professor bill mitchell corporations love free movement of both capital and people because in the latter case they can use the excess supply of labour to batter the existing workers and their organisations into accepting worse pay and conditions but to ensure that the immigration laws are both humane and equitable rather than placing the burden of enforcement on the immigrants themselves immigration limits are best achieved by mandating e verify for all employers and capping the number of contractors an employer can hire as a percentage of full time workers immigration should also prioritize entrants on the basis of skill not family or race once we have a proper functioning immigration system labor markets will likely tighten and the minimum wage can be raised without expanding the black market in labor this would also help to redress somewhat the significant power imbalance between capital and labor as the former relies on an army of unemployed to mitigate wage increases the traditional rebuttal from the likes of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd or the harvard economics department is that rising wages dwindling capacity and continuing trade frictions all spell inflation loss of competitiveness and with it less profitability and economic prosperity the loss of competitiveness is addressed via the local content requirement rules the other thing that never seems to occur to our experts is that productive and absorptive capacity themselves both grow as wealth and income rise beyond the top income recipients ultimately the end goal is to produce a larger proportion of our own consumption at least for the remaining quarter to half century before the new entrants to the global economy consume a larger proportion of their own production policy can work from two ends one provide lift from the bottom by assuming more social expense currently borne by households and firms in health care for example and two provide suction from above by sucking up the underemployed into better paying public infrastructure jobs one thing is clear the status quo is not working and some radical rethink is going to be required when the next economic crisis befalls

new york january 4 the december jobs report printed well above forecast at 312 000 new jobs the consensus estimate had been just 178 000 revisions for november 21 000 and october 37 00 jobs netted 58 000 more jobs the revisions resulted in average three months job creation of 254 000 jobs and six months average jobs creation of 222 000 the unemployment rate was 3 9 percent up 2 10ths of a percentage point from november but down 2 10ths of a percentage point from december 2017 the u 6 unemployment at 7 6 percent remained unchanged from november but is down 0 5 percentage points since last year it is still a low u 6 number nominal average weekly wages increased by 3 15 percent year on year up from 2 75 percent last month at a rate that is higher than inflation real wages increased by just 1 18 percent down from last monthâ s 0 75 assuming the november trimmed mean pce annual inflation rate of 2 0 analysis details and outlook this good december jobs report should not be taken as a harbinger of a stronger economy in our view as with our november report we see a flashing red light requiring investors and businesses to stop and assess conditions before moving forward if anything this jobs data is nebulous particularly given some of the reported statistical anomalies that occur at year end in the bls data we anticipate 2018q4 to print in the range of 2 7 to 3 2 percent let s look at our exclusive jobs creation by average weekly wages for the october jobs report december jobs creation by average weekly wage source the stuyvesant square consultancy compiled from bls establishment data for december 2018 the number of people employed increased by about 142 000 down from the 221 000 increase in november some 419 000 individuals joined the workforce compared to more joined the workforce compared to 127 000 last month the increase likely caused the slight increase in the unemployment rate the jolts survey for october the latest available data released december 10th showed 119 000 new job openings from september to october thatâ s an improvement over the 284 000 fewer job openings from august to september itâ s also a huge 1 020 000 jump from october of last year oil pricing and geopolitical concerns we re heartened to see fuel prices continuing below the 3 per gallon threshold gasoline prices for december are 10 2 percent lower than last month 5 3 percent lower than last year and the lowest for a december since 2016 overall they are the lowest since july 2017 oil prices too as measured by west texas intermediate crude have fallen sharply by more than 12 percent from last month and by more than 23 percent from last year with further respect to oil while our concerns for political stability in iraq have been allayed largely with the election of iraqâ s consensus secularist leaders as president and prime minister local reportage indicates that remnants of former al qaeda members may be reforming as a group â guardians of religionâ us sanctions against iran will also adversely affect the economy of its neighbor iraq thereby putting pressure on the countryâ s political regime iraqâ s exports of oil to developing economies

remain concerned about iranâ s belligerent rhetoric and sanctions against iran precipitating some unforeseen flashpoint in the region the round of sanctions the white house imposed in november are claimed to be the harshest in our 40 year dealing with the islamic republic iran has said several times that they would cease all flow of oil through the straits of hormuz if iran could not sell oil because of u s sanctions as of december 31 the carrier group u s s john stennis cvn 74 has replaced the essex arg in the persian gulf just off qatar it appears the national command authority will continue to deter if not intimidate iranâ s leadership from pursuing misadventures in the straits by maintaining a significant naval force in the gulf nevertheless europe is anxious to strengthen the international role of the euro and its ministers would like to undermine the us â exorbitant privilegeâ as the worldâ s reserve currency european allies that supported the joint comprehensive plan of action â jcpoaâ on iranâ s nuclear arms development now have a ready excuse to abandon the usd as the currency for its oil trading as we discussed in greater detail here we think this currency strategy not an iranian military initiative in the straits of hormuz would have a greater effect to retaliate against the usa but would not amount to an act of war by threatening a vital american interest the effort to â de dollarizeâ oil measure taken by iran together with our putative â alliesâ in the eu who still support the jcpoa â iran dealâ notwithstanding reported violations could greatly diminish the usd status as the worldâ s reserve currency and wreak economic hardship upon the usa we continue to be concerned about the us possibly sanctioning saudi arabia â ksaâ over the murder of washington post columnist jamal khashoggi as we have stated since the first reports of the murder implicating the kingdom and possible sanctions retortion might result particularly by ksa repricing its oil in euro yuan or perhaps even some new opec backed currency we think the implications of that upon the usd as the worldâ s reserve currency and on us interest rates would be staggering dollar denominated debt corollary to our concerns about oil was and is our concern that higher rates and a stronger dollar impinge developing nations ability to repay dollar and euro denominated debt they owe to american and european banks china for example has 750 billion in usd denominated offshore corporate dollar bonds or â ocdbâ nomura has warned to monitor the situation and expressed concerns about the bond rollovers could be problematic given the decline of the yuan we have had similar concerns for some time with other developing economies particularly india where the usd inr exchange rate is set anticipated to end the year at 1 70 the inr traded at its lowest point in history in october 1 74 and remains high at 1 69 today there will be enormous pressure on developing nations to raise rates to keep their currencies at relative parity with the dollar and the euro which will in turn slow those economies this is why we continue to be circumspect about normalizing rates too quickly even in light of todayâ s nominally â greatâ jobs report it threatens the economic health and well being of developing economies and puts additional pressure on the already struggling pigs in the eurozone other macro data october freight flows increased year on year and also up from september we re also heartened that people are taking home more cash from the tax cut so that debt service will account for a lesser percentage of disposable income data released early last month for 2018q2 continued to support our thesis we have expected since the tax bill passed that together with cheaper gasoline prices should help maintain consumer spending we note these other developments since our november jobs report the wholesale trade report for october reported last month showed sales up 6 8 percent year on year and inventories up 0 8 percent from last year both of those are down considerably from last month the inventory to sales ratio was 1 28 percent unchanged from the same period last year but up from 1 26 percent in september building permits for november released december 18th increased 1 6 percent from october and 0 4 percent from last year housing starts increased by 3 2 percent month to month but fell 3 6 percent year on year the ism manufacturing report for december released january 3rd showed continuing growth at 54 1 but down significantly from octoberâ s 59 3 the ism non manufacturing report for september the latest available released december 6th printed at 60 7 thatâ s up from octoberâ s 60 3 personal income outlays for november released december 21st showed disposable income increased by 0 2 percent in current dollars and also up 0 2 percent in chained 2012 dollars those are down from 0 5 and 0 3 percent in october respectively personal consumption expenditures pce for november increased 0 4 percent in current dollars and 0 3 percent in chained 2012 dollars thatâ s down from 0 8 percent and 0 6 percent from october current and chained dollars respectively the ibd tipp economic optimism index released december 4th dipped sharply to 52 6 by 6 7 percentage points anything above 50 indicates growth fed normalizing as stated above we have been concerned for some time about the fed tightening rates too much too quickly while inflation for personal consumption expenditures less food and energy or real pce had hit the fed s target of 2 percent weâ re seeing that slip somewhat in the last couple of months we continue to believe that moves toward normalization should take place more slowly and only after growth had become decidedly more robust over several more quarters at least four quarters of consistent 3 to 3 5 percent gdp growth we are only halfway to that goal as of 2018q3 as we have illustrated in our gdp reports for 2018q3 and 2018q2 the better than expected gdp reports for those quarters included a lot of â shiftingâ from and to earlier or later quarters and as we noted in our 2018q3 report there were signs of slowing with 200 bps of the 3 5 percent gdp growth coming from inventory restocking we would like to see steady consistent growth in each of the four categories of gdp growth we have long held the view that trimmed mean pce produced by the dallas fed is a better measure of inflation in the day to day costs of most americans it is currently around 2 percent but it has been volatile the 3 percent rate the fed adopted in december and the jobs report from today which we believe to be overblown will likely push the fed to higher rates particularly if there is a dearth of new data because of the government shutdown we continue to be troubled by the volatility of the yield curve as we have discussed repeatedly the 3 month 10 year curve has nearly halved from just 85 bps last month to just 45 bps yesterday we believe it is yet another sign that fed rate hikes are premature and are outpacing the economy s growth we started 2017 with a spread of the 3 month 10 year yield curve two of nearly 200 bps on january 3 the 3 month 10 year yield curve was just 15 bps apart the fed mostly affects short term rates principally the 3 month hence our using that and the ten year versus the 2 year 10 year used by most we also saw yield curve inversions this week among the shorter term rates the 10 year rate is moving back down increasing the likelihood that yield curves will invert we would like to see a minimum of two quarters of at least a 150 bps spread between the 3 mo and 10 yr yield before the fed considers another rate increase that higher 150 bps spread from the current 2 25 percent three month rate would show a holistic appetite among investors for increased risk as signalled by moving away from treasuries and into â risk onâ assets treasury yields are inversely proportional to risk so the lower the treasury rate the more dollars invested there and not in risk on assets while we dogmatically prefer a strong dollar from a high demand for us goods and services we re wary of dollar strength that is attributable to the fed s interest rate hikes more than demand for u s goods and services we think a stable or even a lower fed rate would help on a number of fronts not least of which would be relieving foreign debtors of usd debt obligations they might not be able to meet with a strong dollar we remain unperturbed by the trade dispute with china and by the trump tariffs but weâ re not willing to ignore the â herd instinctâ of ignorant investors who buy into the lie that â tariffs cause or worsen depressionsâ milton friedmanâ s estate has a nobel prize that says otherwise we support the president s more diligent management of trade to defend against cheating and to oppose tariff and non tariff barriers weâ re hopeful too that chinaâ s president xi will agree in the current talks to ensure china us bilateral trade agreement that will address us concerns like mandatory joint ventures chinese and enhanced protections of us intellectual property xi has shown little tolerance for corruption among chinese officials in his efforts to make china a respected member of the family of nations we only hope that he will extend that attitude to end chinaâ s more egregious trade cheating that said we would like to see the president engage americaâ s asian and european allies to step up to join a coalition of the willing to challenge china s decades old unfair trade practices and thefts of intellectual property because the one on one dispute could simply trigger mutual retaliation there is more power in american dealings with xi from a multilateral â weâ than a unilateral â usâ moreover china can t afford a restless or even a rebellious populace being unemployed its leaders need exports to the u s and europe more than the west needs access to chinaâ s markets losing american sales in chinese markets might hurt american and european companies bottom line and anger american farmers losing chinese jobs to american tariffs might collapse chinaâ s government particularly given the chinese firmsâ inability to roll over its usd denominated debt while ceos seem concerned about margins if china manufacturing sites are lost in a trade war we note that contract producers in most businesses are available in other locations and at lower wages than china and that continuing thefts of intellectual property present a longer term threat to us businesses we remain bullish on india and believe it is a much more promising venue for low wage manufacturing investment over the long term however again the fedâ s overly aggressive rate increases risk a â sudden stop â as discussed earlier weâ re circumspect about the rate of gdp growth reflected in the last three reported quarters we continue to believe the favorable numbers from 2018q1 and 2018q2 arose largely from stacking up gdp from prior and later quarters as discussed here then 2018q3 at 3 5 percent had a huge 2 percent bump from an inventory build our doubts will continue until we see two consecutive quarters of increases in all four categories of gdp i e personal consumption expenditures net exports gross domestic investment and government consumption expenditures fed chair powell said today that the fed was â patientâ and would look for â signs of weaknessâ weâ re hoping that translates into inaction in the months to come summary we predicted a slowing economy in our november jobs report and we are inclined to continue that view with the december report given that the big jobs increases came at the lower end of the wage scale and these inverting shorter term yield curve inversions we estimate 2018q4 gdp will print at 2 7 to 3 2 percent we expect 2019 q1 to print at 2 5 to 3 0 percent in equities weâ re inclined to stand pat with these sectors as follows outperform consumer discretionaries in the mid to high end retail sector trucking on speculation of consolidation and acquisition companies or reits that own real estate in sectors identified as opportunity zones under the tax cut and jobs creation act of 2017 perform consumer staples energy utilities telecom and materials and industrials lower end consumer discretionaries like dollar stores the asset light hospitality sector on speculation of stabilizing franchisee property values and room rental costs certain leisure and hospitality underperform healthcare financials and technology currencies of developing nations such as inr some of the pigs currencies too author s note our commentaries most often tend to be event driven they are mostly written from a public policy economic or political geopolitical perspective some are written from a management consulting perspective for companies that we believe to be under performing and include strategies that we would recommend were the companies our clients others discuss new management strategies we believe will fail this approach lends special value to contrarian investors to uncover potential opportunities in companies that are otherwise in downturn opinions with respect to such companies here however assume the company will not change
8 71 while the media s conspicuous blackout of coverage is partly to blame the deafening silence from across the atlantic in the united states is really because of the lack of class consciousness on its political left with the exception of occupy wall street the american left has been so preoccupied with an endless race to the bottom in the two party culture wars it is unable to comprehend an upheaval undivided by the contaminants of identity politics a political opposition that isn t fractured on social issues is simply unimaginable not to say the masses in france are exempt from the internal contradictions of the working class but the fetishization of lifestyle politics in the u s has truly become its weakness we will have to wait and see whether the yellow vests transform into a global movement or arrive in america but for now the seeming lack of solidarity stateside equates to a complicity with macron s agenda maximilien robespierre s real crime in the eyes of bourgeois historians was attempting to fulfill the egalitarian ideals of republicanism by transferring political power from the aristocracy and nouveaux riche directly into the hands of the working class just as the paris commune did nearly 80 years later it is for this reason he subsequently became one of the most misunderstood and unfairly maligned figures in world history perhaps one day to be absolved the u s reaction to the yellow vests is a continuation of the denial and suppression of the class conflict inherent in the french revolution which continues to seethe beneath the surfaces of capitalism today in today s political climate it is easy to forget that there have been periods where the american left was actually engaged with the crisis of global capitalism in what seems like aeons ago the anti globalization movement in the wake of nafta culminated in huge protests in seattle in 1999 which saw nearly 50 000 march against the world trade organization following the 2008 financial collapse it briefly reemerged in the occupy movement which was also swiftly put down by corporate state repression currently the political space once inhabited by the anti globalization left has been supplanted by the anti globalist rhetoric mostly associated with right wing populism globalism and globalization may have qualitatively different meanings but they nevertheless are interrelated although it is shortsighted there are core accuracies in the former s narrative that should be acknowledged the idea of a shadowy world government isn t exclusively adhered to by anti establishment conservatives and it is right to suspect there is a worldwide cabal of secretive billionaire power brokers controlling events behind the scenes there is indeed a new world order with zero regard for the sovereignty of nation states just as there is a deep state however it is a ruling class not of paranoiac imagination but real life and a right wing billionaire like robert mercer is as much a globalist as george soros ever since capitalism emerged it has always been global the current economic crisis is its latest cyclical downturn impoverishing and alienating working people whose increasing hardship is what has led to the trending rejection of the eu imperialism has exported capital leading to the destruction of jobs in the home sectors of western nations while outsourcing them to the third world over time deep disgruntlement among the working class has grown toward an economic system that is clearly rigged against them where the skewed distribution of capital gains and widespread tax evasion on the part of big business is camouflaged as buoyant economic growth when it came crashing down in the last recession the financial institutions responsible were bailed out using tax payer money instead of facing any consequences such grotesque unfairness has only been amplified by the austerity further transferring the burden from the 1 to the poor before the gilets jaunes the u k s brexit referendum in 2016 laid bare these deep class divisions within the european union one of the most significant events in the continent since wwii it has ultimately threatened to reshape the occident s status in the post war order as a whole brexit manifested out of divisions within britain s political parties especially the torys which had been plagued for years by internal dispute over the eu those in power were blind to the warning signs of discontent toward a world economy in crisis and were shocked by the plebiscite in which the working class defied the powers that be against all odds with more than half voting to leave in general well to do brits were hard remainers while those suffering most severely from the destruction of industry unemployment and austerity overwhelmingly chose to leave in what was described as a peasants revolt by the media the value of the pound sterling quickly plunged and not long after the status of the united kingdom as a whole came into question as britain found itself at odds with scotland s unanimous decision to remain brexit tugged at the bonds holding the eu together and suddenly the collective standing clout of its member states is at stake in a potential breakup of the entire bloc euroscepticism is also by no means a distinctly british phenomenon as distrust has soared in countries hit the hardest by neoliberalism like greece 80 with spain and france not far behind in fact before there was brexit there was fear among the elite of a grexit in response to its unprecedented debt crisis manufactured by the international monetary fund imf the greek people elected the coalition of the radical left syriza to a majority of legislative seats to the hellenic parliament during its 2015 bailout referendum unfortunately the synthetic alliance turned out to be anything but radical and a trojan horse of the establishment syriza was elected on its promise to rescind the terms of greek membership in the eu but shortly after taking office it betrayed its constituency and agreed to the troika s mass privatization even its former finance minister yanis varousfakis admitted that syriza was a controlled opposition and auxiliary apart from suffering collective amnesia regarding the eu s neoliberal policies apparently the modern left is also in serious need of a history lesson regarding the eu federation s fascist origins it has been truly puzzling to see self proclaimed progressives mourning britain s decision to withdraw from a continental union that was historically masterminded by former fifth columnists of nazi germany it was in the aftermath of wwii s devastation that the 1951 treaty of paris established the nucleus of the eu in the

the first supranational institution and that thus they are laying the true foundation of an organized europe this europe remains open to all european countries that have freedom of choice we profoundly hope that other countries will join us in our common endeavor the idea of forming a supranational union was conceived by the french statesman robert schuman who during the outbreak of wwii served as the under secretary of state for refugees in the reynaud government when nazi germany invaded france in 1940 schuman by all accounts willingly voted to grant absolute dictatorial powers to marshall philippe pétain to become head of state of the newly formed vichy government the puppet regime that ruled nazi occupied france until the allied invasion in 1944 by doing so he retained his position in parliament though he later chose to resign following the war like all vichy collaborators schuman was initially charged with the offense of indignité nationale national unworthiness and stripped of his civil rights as a traitor more than 4 000 alleged quislings were summarily executed following operation overlord and the normandy landings but the future eu designer was fortunate enough to have friends in high places schuman s clemency was granted by none other than general charles de gaulle himself the leader of the resistance during the war and future french president instantly schuman s turncoat reputation was rehabilitated and his wartime activity whitewashed even though he had knowingly voted full authority to pétain the retention of his post in the vichy government was veneered to have occurred somehow without his knowledge or consent marshal pétain meets with adolf hitler in 1940 schuman is officially regarded as one of the eleven men who were founding fathers of what later became the eu one of the other major figures that contributed to the federal integration of the continent was konrad adenauer the first chancellor of the federal republic of germany the nuremberg trials may have tried and executed most of the top leadership of the nazi party but the post war government that became west germany was saturated with former third reich officials despite the purported post war denazification policy inscribed in the potsdam agreement many figures who had directly participated in the holocaust were appointed to high positions in adenauer s administration and never prosecuted for their atrocities one such war criminal was the former ministry of the interior and drafter of the nuremberg race statutes in the years following wwii there was also concern among the elite of anti americanism growing in western europe the annual bilderberg group conference was established in 1954 by prince bernard of the netherlands himself a former reiter ss corps and nazi party member to promote atlanticism and facilitate cooperation between american and european leaders invitations to the bilderberg club meetings were extended to only the most exclusive paragons in politics academia the media industry and finance in 2009 wikileaks e european unity the discussion on this subject revealed general support for the idea of european integration and unification among the participants from the six countries of the european coal and steel community and a recognition of the urgency of the problem while members of the group held different views as to the method by which a common market could be set up there was a general recognition of the dangers inherent in the present divided markets of europe and the pressing need to bring the german people together with the other peoples of europe into a common market that the six countries of the coal and steel community had definitely decided to establish a common market and that experts were now working this out was felt to be a most encouraging step forward and it was hoped that other countries would subsequently join it prince bernard presides over the first annual bilderberg meeting in 1954 at the 1955 conference the rudimentary idea for a european currency or what became the eurozone was even discussed three years before the treaty of rome which established the european economic community without the public s knowledge a european speaker expressed concern about the need to achieve a common currency and indicated that in his view this necessarily implied the creation of a central political authority the mysterious bilderberg gatherings are still held to this day under notorious secrecy and are frequently the subject of wild speculation one can imagine a topic behind the scenes at this year s meeting would be how to address the growth of anti eu populism and uprisings like the gilet jaunes hitlerite expansionism had been carried out on the führer s vision for a european federation in the third reich in many respects the eu is a rebranded realization of his plans for empire building how ironic that liberals are clinging to a multinational political union founded by fascist colluders while the same economic bloc is being opposed by today s far right after its new islamophobic facelift while nationalism may have played an instrumental role in brexit there is a manufactured hysteria hatched by the establishment which successfully reduced the complex range of reasons for the leave eu vote to racism and flag waving they are now repeating this pattern by overstating the presence of the far right among the yellow vests such delirium not only demonizes workers but coercively repositions the left into supporting something it otherwise shouldn t the eu and by default its laissez faire policies thereby driving the masses further into the arms of the same far right echoes of this can be seen in the u s with the vapid response to journalist angela nagle s there is no doubt brexit and trump pushed the xenophobia button and could not have come about without it however such criticism means nothing when it comes from moral posturers who claim to stand with refugees while supporting the very humanitarian interventionist policies displacing them nativism was not the sole reason the majority voted to leave the eu and many working class minorities also fundamentally migrants seek asylum on europe s doorstep because of nato s imperial expansion and the unexpected arrival of brexit has threatened to weaken the eu s military arm already desperate to reinvent itself and a new enemy in russia despite its functional obsolescence the shock of the referendum has inconveniently undermined nato s ability to pressure moscow and beijing a step forward for mitigating world peace in the long run and a silver lining to its outcome it is the task of the left to reject the eu s neoliberal project while transmitting the message that capital not refugees is the cause of the plight of the masses it is also necessary to have faith in the people something cynical liberals lack racism may historically be the achilles heel of the working class but underlying brexit the election of trump and the yellow vests is the spirit of defiance in working people albeit one of political confusion in need of guidance if the yellow vests are today s sans culottes like those which became the revolutionary partisans in the french revolution they will eventually need a jacobin club relatively progressive but ultimately reformist figures like mélenchon are no such spearhead and will only lead them down the same dead end of syriza the absence of any such vanguard has forced the working class to take matters into their own hands in the interim if history is any guide the gilets jaunes will be stamped out until a new cadre takes the reins whose objective is as lenin said not to champion the degrading of the revolutionary to the level of an amateur but to raise the amateurs to the level of revolutionaries we also cannot fall into ideological fantasies that we live in permanent revolutionary circumstances or that a spontaneous uprising can become comprehensive simply because of ingenious leadership nevertheless as mao tse tung wrote a single spark can start a prairie fire and hopefully the yellow vests are that

president dwight eisenhower by 1951 motivated by the desire to quickly rearm and integrate west germany into nato in the new cold war the policy of denazification was prematurely ended and countless

can assume that if the safety vests were ready made off the assembly line of ngos like the raised fist flags of serbia s otpor movement the presstitutes would be telling a different story it turned out that a crisis was not averted but merely postponed when macron defeated his demagogue opponent le pen in the 2017 french election while it is true that the gilets jaunes were partly impelled by an increase on fuel prices contrary to the prevailing narrative their official demands are not limited to a carbon tax they also consist of explicit ultimatums to increase the minimum wage improve the standard of living and an end to austerity among other legitimate grievances nce tawhile pushing through enormous tax breaks for the wealthy like himself it was just a matter of time until the french people had enough of the country s privatization it is only a shock to the oblivious establishment why the former rothschild banker turned politician who addressed the nation seated at a gold desk while paris was ablaze is suddenly in jeopardy of losing power as the masses starved under her husband louis xiv it serves as a reminder of the historically revisionist understanding of french politics in the u s that is long established the middle class dominated left wing in america ascribes to a historical reinterpretation of the french revolution that is a large contributor of its aversion to transformative praxis in favor of incrementalism the late italian marxist philosopher and historian who died in june of this year offered the most thorough understanding of its misreading of history in seminal works such as war and revolution rethinking the twentieth century the liberal rereading of the french revolution is the ideological basis for its rejection of the revolutionary tradition from the jacobins to the bolsheviks that has neutralized the modern left to this day according to its revised history the inevitable outcome of comprehensive systemic change is robespierre s so called reign of terror or the purges of the stalin era in the soviet union in its view what began with the locke and montesquieu influenced reforms of the constitutional monarchy was hijacked by the radical jacobin and sans culotte factions losurdo explains that counter revolutionaries eager to discredit the image of rebellion overemphasize its violence and bloodshed and never properly contextualize it as self defense against the real reign of terror by the ruling class the idea behind this recasting of history is to conflate revolutionary politics with nazi germany whose racially motivated genocide was truly the inheritor of the legacy of european colonialism not the ancestry of the jacobins or the russian revolution
although a slowdown was inevitable in china after four decades of breakneck growth beijing should try to stop further deceleration this year otherwise china s economic financial and social stability will be jeopardised this can be achieved if the government adjusts its macroeconomic policy a lack of progress on institutional reform together with obstacles to structural adjustment has fuelled doubts among many foreign and domestic observers about china s growth prospects some even anticipate a financial crisis caused by a bursting housing bubble or debt defaults by local governments and corporations the trade war with the united states only deepens such worries china s economic performance in 2018 was rather disappointing according to official statistics the country s growth rate up to the end of the third quarter was 6 7 per cent the lowest since the global financial crisis a decade ago the real situation was probably even worse begin with monetary policy the people s bank of china is currently responsible for at a minimum maintaining the stability of economic growth employment prices and the exchange rate that is too many objectives to pursue simultaneously as evident from sudden and frequent monetary policy reversals since late 2011 the pboc has changed its policy stance four times in response to fluctuations in housing prices but its manoeuvres have often undermined its other objectives for example while tightening monetary policy can rein in runaway housing prices it compounds the growth slowdown in fact monetary tightening might not even be called for though many argue that the pboc s past liquidity injections especially its large stimulus in response to the 2008 global economic crisis caused the real estate bubble housing prices began to skyrocket long before indeed it is not at all clear that increasing the money supply raises prices it may even work the other way around because rising housing prices have absorbed too much liquidity the pboc has to increase the money supply to support the real economy with china s growth steadily declining and the consumer price index hovering around 2 per cent the pboc would do well to adopt more expansionary monetary policy fiscal levers can be used to contain housing prices which given popular frustration at the real estate market remains an important objective of course expansionary monetary policy would put downward pressure on the renminbi compounding the effects of the us federal reserve s ongoing normalisation of interest rates but that needs to be allowed to happen with the pboc no longer shouldering the responsibility for maintaining exchange rate stability the people s bank of china is currently responsible for maintaining the stability of economic growth employment prices and the exchange rate that may be too many objectives to pursue simultaneously photo reuters for too long china s obsession with currency stability has deprived the pboc of true monetary autonomy it is time to move on chinese enterprises should have learned by now how to protect themselves from exchange rate fluctuations and china maintains capital controls that effectively protect it against an excessively sharp devaluation let alone a run on the renminbi in any event the more important challenge for china s leaders is to devise a new approach to fiscal policy even us president donald trump s administration with its limited understanding of economics recognises that the government has a vital role in strengthening areas in which the private sector has insufficient incentive to invest but which are important to national security and economic stability at the end of 2017 china s official public debt to gdp ratio stood at 36 2 per cent the real figure is probably significantly higher if one accounts for contingent liabilities especially the debts owned by local government financing vehicles but even then china is in a stronger fiscal position than most countries especially bearing in mind that not all local government debts are bad debts this means china still has room to pursue expansionary fiscal policy with a focus on reversing the investment slowdown that fuelled the decline in gdp growth in 2018 in the first three quarters of 2018 fixed investment grew by just 5 4 per cent year on year compared to 7 5 per cent in 2017 largely because growth in infrastructure investment which accounted for some 27 per cent of fixed investment plummeted from 19 8 per cent in 2017 to just 3 3 per cent in 2018 a major concern here relates to the efficiency of infrastructure investments but the concern that inefficient investments are fuelling debt accumulation can be addressed effectively with better designed projects and appropriate limitations on the role of local governments in particular rather than permit local governments to borrow from commercial banks to fund infrastructure investments the central government should foot the bill the combination of higher expenditures and lower revenues resulting from tax cuts and fee reductions may cause china s budget deficit to gdp ratio to exceed 3 per cent but like the 7 yuan threshold for the us dollar exchange rate that threshold should not be considered sacred as long as interest rates for government bonds can be kept low the government should not be afraid to issue more of them expansionary macroeconomic policy alone will not resolve all of china s problems in the long term and it undoubtedly carries significant risks but given the paramount importance of stabilising growth the chinese authorities need to use all of the tools at their disposal

the mexican peso ends 2018 with a slight decline against the us dollar however is among the top performers across emerging market currencies after having remained relatively stable while emerging assets registered significant losses the year 2019 presents major challenges with a new political scenario in mexico an economy growing slowly and a global context with increasing fears volatility has almost everything in favor to remain elevated another year over the dollar rose against most of the emerging currencies throughout 2018 including among these the mexican peso the rise against this currency was less than 2 which placed the mxn as one of the strongest the usd mxn throughout 2018 can be divided into two parts during the first half of the year rose in the run up to the presidential elections in mexico in a context of markets concern about the expected victory of andrés manuel lópez obrador and the dollar s strong rise against emerging currencies in the second half of the year the best moment of the mexican peso took place after moderation in amlo s tone which led the usd mxn to 18 40 the emerging currencies did not stop being under pressure and with the end of the honeymoon between amlo and the markets after the citizen consultation for the new airport the dollar flew up to 20 60 during the year traded above 18 00 and below 21 00 the price range the distance between the maximum and the minimum was the lowest since 2014 even in spite of the lower volatility it continued to offer interesting trading opportunities the long term trend in continues to point higher but in 2018 the usd mxn failed to surpass 21 00 prices near that level represent a concern to officials of the central bank and also of the executive power in the last month of the year the usd mxn moved faster breaking the 20 00 20 60 range late in december the pair continues in a consolidation mode with risks in both directions amlo s intentions to improve relations with the market have paid off but the distrust of investors is still there the broad legislative majority of morena amlo s party is another risk to mexican assets n economy inflation growth and income to the downside the mexican economy is expected to grow between 1 5 and 2 5 in 2019 and inflation to slow down according to projections released by the central bank averaging 3 85 at the end of the year a level still above the target of banxico the government plans to obtain a primary fiscal surplus despite the increase in spending in 2019 through better collection and cutting certain expenses a recovery in the price of oil would provide more funds to the government the market received the economic package budget and other economic initiatives relatively well the main domestic risk to growth is the lack of confidence of businesspeople towards the administration of andrés manuel lópez obrador each day will be an opportunity to improve relationships but at the same time with risks of worsening the cancellation of the new texcoco airport under construction left a precedent that might weigh on the level of investment in 2019 on the inflation side the deceleration is expected to continue at a gradual pace and no greater domestic risks are now glimpsed as indicated by the central bank the main threat is the exchange rate a rise in the dollar would be the factor that triggers an increase in inflation for this reason monetary policy could continue with high rates if the us dollar appreciates or if inflation remains at high levels an external crisis is expected to have an impact in mexico both on the activity and the exchange rate leading to the possibility of further adjustments in monetary policy if under such scenario the exchange rate remains steady or appreciates banxico could look for ways to reduce the rate to boost activity the t mec trade agreement which replaces nafta is another risk if the project fails to pass any parliament the current agreement will come into risk generating great uncertainty and could strongly impact foreign trade and drag the rest of the sectors another source of the external risks comes from latin america with an a priori focus on argentina brazil and venezuela in 2018 there was a currency crisis in argentina although there has been some calm during the last two months 2019 can be another difficult year considering that external vulnerabilities have not yet been overcome and above all there will be presidential elections in brazil at the beginning of 2019 jair bolsonaro will assume the presidency a great unknown while in venezuela the severe economic crisis continues with ongoing hyperinflation argentina and venezuela contagion risk is limited but they are part of the global context monetary policy between the exchange rate and the context the central bank of mexico ends 2018 with the highest interest rate in years months ago the speculation was about the possibility of a rate cut at the end of the year what changed the mexican peso lost ground inflation slowed at a slower pace than expected the investment outlook clouded and to complete the picture the external context changed for the worst in 2019 we do not rule out further increases in the key rate if the dollar rises significantly the exchange rate has become the critical variable a drop in the interest rate should not occur until at least the second quarter for it to happen the exchange rate should look stable and inflation should be at the central bank s target or very close in addition there should not be critical external risks the governing board of banxico will have several new members in 2019 its independence from the executive power will be tested if there are signs that they are influenced in their decisions by the lópez obrador team it would be a clear negative signal not only for the peso but for mexican assets in general usd mxn long term technical analysis the mexican peso is on track to close the year with a minor loss against the dollar the chart shows that it could rise usd mxn decline particularly early in 2019 as long as a weekly close does not occur well above 20 60 a good global climate an improvement in the confidence of investors towards the new administration a favorable arrangement with the bondholders of the international airport under construction to be canceled soon a good relationship between amlo and trump are all factors that can be positive for the mexican peso the 19 40 zone can be reached easily in a positive context below the area between 18 40 and 18 60 should offer support during the first half of the year and mark a limit to the appreciation of the mxn although if it breaks lower it could signal more losses ahead over the medium term the chart shows increasing odds of breaking during 2019 the limits of 2018 such a scenario would favor volatility during the last quarter of 2018 the dollar failed to hold above 20 50 60 to resume the bullish path it needs to consolidate on top and then a test of 21 00 would be expected if it keeps rising above approaching 22 00 the word intervention or talks about more rate hikes would hit the wires there are details both from the fundamental and technical point of view which can lead to 2019 being a year of high volatility in usd mxn in several directions usd mxn elliot wave analysis by gregor horvat usdmxn turned sharply down from 22 00 in 2017 and then moved into a recovery mode in 2018 which is seen as a corrective rise we labeled this as wave b that belongs to deeper ongoing retracement with

investment guru byron wien is certainly looking at the year ahead through a rose colored crystal ball the vice chairman in the private wealth solutions group at blackstone issued his list of 10 surprises for 2019 which included no additional federal reserve rate hikes a 15 percent s p 500 rally and not a recession in sight this is the 34th year wien has given his views on a number of economic financial market and political surprises for the coming year wien defines a surprise as an event that the average investor would only assign a one out of three chance of taking place but which wien believes is probable having a better than 50 likelihood of happening wien started the tradition in 1986 when he was the chief u s investment strategist at morgan stanley byron joined blackstone in september 2009 as a senior advisor to both the firm and its clients in analyzing economic political market and social trends his 10 surprises for 2019 the weakening world economy encourages the federal reserve to stop raising the federal funds rate during the year inflation remains subdued and the 10 year treasury yield stays below 3 5 the yield curve remains positive partly because of no further rate increases by the federal reserve and more attractive valuations as a result of the market decline at the end of 2018 the s p 500 gains 15 for the year rallies and corrections occur but improved earnings enable equities to move higher in a reasonably benign interest rate environment traditional drivers of gdp growth capital spending and housing make only modest gains in 2019 the expansion continues however because of consumer and government spending a recession before 2021 seems unlikely the better tone in the financial markets discourages precious metal investors gold drops to 1 000 as the equity markets in the united states and elsewhere improve the profit outlook for emerging markets brightens and investor interest intensifies because the price earnings ratio is attractive compared to developed markets and historical levels continuous expansion of the middle class in the emerging markets provides the consumer buying thrust for earnings growth china leads and the shanghai composite rises 25 the brazil equity market also comes to life under the country s new conservative leadership march 29 comes and goes and there is no brexit deal parliament fails to approve one and theresa may arguing that a change in leadership won t help the situation remains in office a second referendum is held and the u k votes to remain the dollar stabilizes at year end 2018 levels and stays there throughout the year because of concern about the economy the federal reserve stops shrinking its balance sheet which is interpreted negatively by currency traders the flow of foreign capital into united states assets slows because of a softer monetary policy and a lack of need for new capital for business expansion the mueller investigation results in indictments against members of the trump organization closest to the president but the evidence doesn t support any direct action against trump himself nevertheless an exodus of trump s most trusted advisors results in a crisis in confidence that the administration has the people and the process to accomplish important goals congress however with a democratic majority gets more done than expected particularly on trade policy progress is made in preserving important parts of the affordable care act and immigration policy a federal infrastructure program to be implemented in 2020 is announced growth stocks continue to provide leadership in the u s equity market technology and biotech do well as a result of continued strong earnings value stocks other than energy related businesses disappoint because of the slowing economy every year there are always a few surprises that do not make the 10 because either i do not think they are as relevant as those on the basic list or i am not comfortable with the idea that they are probable he said he offerd four other possible stunners
what gets in january 02 2019 the economics and politics of revoking nafta raphael auer barthélémy bonadio andrei levchenko nber working paper december 2018 abstract we provide a quantitative assessment of both the aggregate and the distributional effects of revoking nafta using a multi country multi sector multi factor model of world production and trade with global input output linkages revoking nafta would reduce us welfare by about 0 2 and canadian and mexican welfare by about 2 the distributional impacts of revoking nafta across workers in different sectors are an order of magnitude larger in all three countries ranging from 2 7 to 2 26 in the united states we combine the quantitative results with information on the geographic distribution of sectoral employment and compute average real wage changes in each us congressional district mexican state and canadian province we then examine the political correlates of the economic effects congressional district level real wage changes are negatively correlated with the trump vote share in 2016 districts that voted more for trump would on average experience greater real wage reductions if nafta is revoked a trump effect on the eu s popularity the u s presidential election as a natural experiment lara minkus emanuel deutschmann jan delhey perspectives on politics forthcoming abstract did the election of donald trump affect the popularity of the european union eu in europe theoretically both a positive rally effect due to a perceived external threat and a negative domino effect due to resignation among europhiles and or reinforcement among europhobe nationalists are plausible we treat trump s unexpected victory as an external shock and use a eurobarometer survey that was conducted in all eu 28 member states four days prior to control group and six days after the election treatment group as source material for a natural experiment the analysis reveals that the election of trump caused a significant increase in the eu s popularity in europe immediately after the election this trump effect is considerable in size roughly equivalent to three years of education gains in popularity were particularly high among respondents who perceived their country as economically struggling and surprisingly among the political right suggesting that trump s victory broadened and ideologically diversified the eu s base of support the good the bad and the ugly chinese imports european union anti dumping measures and firm performance liza jabbour et al journal of international economics march 2019 pages 1 20 abstract this paper analyses the effects of the european union s anti dumping tariffs against chinese imports on all affected firms the good european import competing firms the bad chinese exporters and the ugly european importers of dumped products the results show that temporary import tariffs are beneficial to the least productive good eu producers but harms the most productive ugly eu importers overall the net effects of anti dumping policy on european employment and exports are largely negative also tariffs enhance the productivity of surviving bad chinese exporters and widens the productivity gap with european competitors macroeconomic consequences of tariffs davide furceri et al nber working paper december 2018 abstract we study the macroeconomic consequences of tariffs we estimate impulse response functions from local projections using a panel of annual data that spans 151 countries over 1963 2014 we find that tariff increases lead in the medium term to economically and statistically significant declines in domestic output and productivity tariff increases also result in more unemployment higher inequality and real exchange rate appreciation but only small effects on the trade balance the effects on output and productivity tend to be magnified when tariffs rise during expansions for advanced economies and when tariffs go up not down our results are robust to a large number of perturbations to our methodology and we complement our analysis with industry level data automation and offshoring in durable goods manufacturing an indiana case study timothy slaper economic development quarterly forthcoming abstract the loss of manufacturing jobs is largely attributed to either offshoring or automation using state level data from the annual survey of manufactures and unit record administrative data from the indiana department of workforce development we determine the drivers of durable goods manufacturing employment losses in indiana we test a simple model that explains changes in industry production employment by changes in output wages intermediate input consumption productivity capital to labor ratios or a proxy related to these explanatory variables using the unit record data the authors assess the consequences of large layoff events on the wages of those who remain employed at a particular manufacturing establishment the data suggest that offshoring was the primary driver for employment losses and productivity gains in indiana not automation we also find that average wages for workers at establishments that experienced large redundancy events rose for those workers who remained after large layoff events the imf as a biased global insurance mechanism asymmetrical moral hazard reserve accumulation and financial crises phillip lipscy haillie na kyung lee international organization forthcoming abstract a large literature has established that the international monetary fund imf is heavily politicized we argue that this politicization has important consequences for international reserve accumulation and financial crises the imf generates moral hazard asymmetrically reducing the expected costs of risky lending and policies for states that are politically influential vis à vis the institution using a panel data set covering 1980 to 2010 we show that proxies for political influence over the imf are associated with outcomes indicative of moral hazard lower international reserves and more frequent financial crises we support our causal claims by applying the synthetic control method to taiwan which was expelled from the imf in 1980 consistent with our predictions taiwan s expulsion led to a sharp increase in precautionary international reserves and exceptionally conservative financial policies the rise of the dollar and fall of the euro as international currencies matteo maggiori brent neiman jesse schreger nber working paper december 2018 abstract the modern notion of an international currency involves use in areas of international finance and trade that extend well beyond central banks coffers in addition to their important roles as foreign exchange reserves international currencies are most frequently used to denominate corporate and government bonds bank loans and import and export invoices these currencies offer unrivaled liquidity constituting large shares of the volume on global foreign exchange markets and are commonly chosen as the anchors targeted by countries with pegged or managed exchange rate regimes in this short article we provide evidence suggesting a recent rise in the use of the dollar and fall of the use in the euro with similar patterns manifesting across all these aspects of international currency use population relatedness and cross country idea flows evidence from book translations andrew dickens journal of economic growth december 2018 pages 367 386 abstract this paper establishes a robust relationship between idea flows across countries as captured by book translations and two measures of population relatedness i argue that linguistic distance imposes a cost on idea flows whereas genetic distance captures an incentive to communicate when dissimilar countries have more to learn from each other consistent with this hypothesis i find that linguistic distance is negatively

the term decoupling referring to the severing of trade ties between the united states and china has to quote one commentator become the talk of washington the two countries are embroiled in what has been widely described as a new cold war in which in the words of former treasury secretary hank paulson an iron curtain has descended over the pacific in place of what the washington post called a bipartisan consensus in favor of broad engagement with china substantial sections of the american foreign policy establishment are supporting the trump administration s policy of disentangling the myriad economic links between the world s two largest economies amid the growth of protectionism and military conflict but thursday s events have given a hint of what such a decoupling will look like in the 21st century globalized economy amid bear markets in germany china and japan a relentless fall in commodity prices signs of slumping consumer spending and mounting layoffs and plant closures in auto and other industries the american ruling class fears that the global slowdown is spreading to the united states for the first time in 16 years apple inc the world s most profitable company was forced to cut its sales projections for the coming year citing the deepening economic slump in china and attributing it to the us trade war the announcement prompted a 660 point selloff on the dow after closing the worst december since the 1930s the us markets have had their poorest two day start for a new trading year since the collapse of the dot com bubble apple ceo tim cook wrote while we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration particularly in greater china he continued we believe the economic environment in china has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the united states a trader cited by the wall street journal was more direct all of it is coming home to roost more directly in the united states the slowdown is here and happening the speed of the reversal in sentiment is striking just weeks after federal reserve officials penciled in two interest rate increases in 2019 half of investors now expect the central bank to cut rates this year up from about 10 percent a day earlier wrote the wall street journal the same day as apple s warnings the ism manufacturing index for the us posted its biggest one month fall in factory activity since the 2008 financial crisis these figures have prompted warnings that us growth will not merely see a gradual slowdown over the course of several years as is broadly predicted by global institutions but could follow china and other developing countries into a sharp and deep recession such a recession international in scope and intensified by trade war could spark a global financial crisis on the scale of or larger than the 2008 crash this is because none of the fundamental causes of the 2008 crisis have been addressed the holes in the banks balance sheets were simply filled with money spit out by central banks through quantitative easing and ultra low interest rates the economic recovery since 2008 has been financed by an expansion of global debt which according to figures published by the international monetary fund last month has hit an all time high of 184 trillion meanwhile events like malaysia s 1mdb scam in which global financial institutions such as goldman sachs extracted hundreds of millions of dollars in fees to facilitate the theft of billions of dollars show that the types of large scale fraud that led to the 2008 financial crisis remain prevalent but unlike the 2008 crisis in which the major economies vowed to cooperate and pledged to avoid trade war the united states has initiated trade war measures against not just china but also against dozens of other countries including its european nato allies as in the 1930s these trade conflicts have the potential of magnifying the scale of a global recession the growth of great power competition and the resulting trade and military conflicts do not arise from the mind of us president donald trump rather they represent the assertion of a fundamental and insoluble contradiction of capitalism the conflict between global production and the nation state system that is why despite the unprecedented worldwide integration of economic life communications and scientific research the ruling elites all over the world are pursuing nationalist trade policies and military rearmament writing just months after the collapse of lehman brothers wsws international editorial board chairman david north observed the most essential feature of a historically significant crisis is that it leads to a situation where the major class forces within the affected country and countries are compelled to formulate and adopt an independent position in relationship to the crisis the ruling elites in the united states and all over the world responded to the 2008 financial crash by seeking to make the working class bear the full brunt of the crisis the investments of the financial oligarchy were made whole then doubled and tripled as a result of bank bailouts deregulation and tax cuts meanwhile the working class faced a decade of stagnant and declining wages spearheaded by the expansion of low wage production at the us automakers as part of their restructuring carried out by the obama administration and its trade union partners with the eruption of a new global recession the ruling elite will operate on the basis of the same playbook intensifying the ruthless policy of austerity it has pursued since the financial crisis but the past decade has not been in vain the year 2018 saw a substantial growth of the class struggle including a wave of strikes and protests by teachers in the united states strikes by delivery and logistics workers airline pilots auto workers and others on virtually every continent and explosive protests by workers from iran to latin america the year concluded with the eruption of mass anti austerity protests in france independent of the trade unions and moves to form rank and file committees by auto workers in the united states and plantation workers in sri lanka the ruling elites with their legitimization of trade war and great power conflict and their efforts to rehabilitate the fascist legacy of the 1930s are paving the way for a repeat of all the horrors that characterized that decade only the independent revolutionary movement of the working class offers humanity a way forward out of this morass in the face of renewed attacks by the ruling elite workers all over the world must enter into struggle under the banner of socialist internationalism with the aim of overthrowing the capitalist system and securing a peaceful and prosperous socialist future

us should save more spend less yang trade disputes central bank governor yang chin long said that trade deficits cannot be fought with tariffs and monetary policy as they point to macroeconomic imbalances by crystal hsu staff reporter the us should spend less and increase savings rather than use tariffs and foreign exchange rates to solve its trade imbalances with other countries the head of the central bank said yesterday tariffs and foreign exchange rates are no panacea for trade imbalances central bank governor yang chin long 楊金龍 told an economic forum on the us trade disputes with other countries the us current account deficit reflects the world s largest economy s lack of domestic savings and the solution lies in less consumption and more savings yang said citing global economists the global division of labor also contributes to washington s discontent as it has economic benefits for all countries that take part in international trade but also causes trade imbalances and income inequality yang said by imposing punitive tariffs on goods from a particular country the us simply seeks to shift its trade deficit to its trade rivals especially china while failing to address the deficit s causes the governor said a concerted effort by advanced and developing economies is required to address trade imbalances through policy tools yang said countries with trade surpluses should seek to increase domestic demand and cut dependence on exports while nations with trade deficits should raise domestic savings and lower spending and investment he said the us has to maintain a large current account deficit to fulfill its role as a global liquidity supplier as the world shows stronger demand for reserve assets chief among them the us dollar yang said he said that he supports a multipolar international monetary regime under which the euro and chinese yuan would assume more importance to ease the burden on the greenback as the core reserve currency however a multipolar system is unlikely to materialize in the near future as europe has yet to fully emerge from its debt crisis and beijing has maintained tight capital controls he said advanced and developing economies should join hands in reducing trade imbalances as all have a stake in globalization yang said taiwan would take a hit if trade tensions weaken demand for technology products as the nation is deeply embedded in the global technology supply chain he said the trade conflict poses both a challenge and opportunity for taiwan depending on how it deals with it yang said the government is taking measures to foster capital repatriation which could help create jobs and drive private investment he said the central bank would do its part and keep the local currency relatively stable despite market volatility he added the new taiwan dollar lost 2 96 percent against us dollar last year showing more resilience than the taiex which lost 8 6 percent over the year

by lambert strether of corrente trade nafta at 25 a new beginning pt 1 2 interview part 2 2 he s trying out this usmca rebrand well that s just not what it is it s nafta 2 0 it is not the transformational replacement of the corporate rigged model of nafta but it is in some ways improved relative to the original nafta the biggest thing is the investor state dispute settlement regime under which corporations can sue governments in front of tribunals of three trade lawyers the lawyers can order the governments to pay unlimited compensation of our taxpayer money for any claim that a corporation makes that their special rights and privileges under nafta have been undermined by a domestic environmental law health regulation court ruling the three lawyers decisions are not appealable and almost 400 million is paid out under that regime and attacks the environmental health laws tax expands energy policies so that outrageous system with the u s and mexico has totally gotten rid of and with respect to mexico is largely walked back that only a limited set of claims can be made and only if a company has gone first to the domestic court systems has spent has basically gotten a final ruling from the highest court or spent two and a half years trying to exhaust the domestic remedies and then the big set of corporate rights claims aren t allowed anymore they can get money back if literally the government seizes their property through an expropriation and doesn t pay them back so that s an improvement well worth a read wallach is great deputy u s trade representative jeff gerrish and his boss ustr robert lighthizer were cut from the same cloth in many ways both worked at skadden both are seeking to revitalize the u s manufacturing base through policy and both take a hard line on china s practices if gerrish and other officials like what they hear during next week s meeting in beijing that could lead to higher level talks between lighthizer

is the sentence that gave me pause what will it take a get a country like that leaders who want it and followers followers who want leaders so modified rapture eh bernie sanders slams wall street democrats hints at 2020 our agenda terrifies the political and financial establishment in the email asking for small donations sanders then said that the elite in the united states would work to stop his candidacy if that happens the political financial and media elite of this country will stop at nothing to defeat us you know that the email read via pbs reporter yamiche alcindor we ve lived through it together once before our ideas terrify them so what they will do is try to divide us up with attacks some old some new and our political opponents will spend obscene sums of money on ads to defeat us sanders s email then noted that a centrist group called third way which the email dubbed as wall street democrats was already running ads against him in early primary states they not only want to discourage or defeat a sanders candidacy they want to make sure that the progressive agenda is not advanced by anyone the email read missed this one over the holidays racial polarization in the 2020 primary draft 12 31 18 on the suffolk usa today poll there may be significant opposition to a sanders run but it overwhelmingly comes from white voters black voters in contrast generally want sanders to run again t seems clear that broad declarations about opposition to another sanders run simplify a much more complicated racial divide david brock now david brock bernie sanders fans can t be allowed to poison another democratic primary with personal attacks in 2016 i ran a pro hillary superpac which attempted to defend the candidate against false attacks many of which came from or originated to her left though they were hardly in charge of our messaging it was made very clear to us by our allies at her campaign headquarters that any efforts on our part to push back against the left wing anti clinton brigades were unwelcome assistance they feared alienating sanders voters i don t know what brock s operational defintion of unwelcome assistance might be but since the clinton campaign gave him a million dollars to fund his troll army it s not mine david brock then dear senator sanders i m with you in the fight ahead the progressive movement is strong and growing thanks in large part to your candidacy senator sanders which electrified so many voters the bedrock american values you championed of pluralism equality and opportunity are ones i share and i hope that we can be partners in the fight ahead ah the right hand of good fellowship mainstream media is blowing its coverage of elizabeth warren s dna test oops neither of these stories included comments from any elected tribal leaders the post story didn t include comments from native people at all of the three native voices mixed in with political pundits in the times story one is a known warren critic and one is a congresswoman elect whose positive comments were buried a stunning distortion of how many tribal leaders and native people in general feel about warren s move this looks like good reporting to me but i ll make two comments 1 there is to say the least a diversity of opinion on almost every topic among elected tribal leaders the tribes most definitely are not a homogenous mass the cherokees are the only ones who matter and so far as i can tell a high authority though not the chief has spoken 2 as i keep saying warren should have asked the cherokees in what world is that hard or not the first thing to think of the democratic primary doesn t have to be a nightmare eventually i turned to the c f p b itself filling out a simple form on its website a few weeks later i was notified that the bank had been deducting money from my account for years and i was being refunded more than 11 000 having financed my own maternity leave it was money that i badly needed to me was an astonishingly user friendly tool that cut through opaque corporate bureaucracy on my behalf my experience with it shaped my perception of warren as a brilliant policy innovator and the moral let s talk about whose policy proposals are most likable a good story but reading the story and what it took to make this happen i would like to know what the cpfb s impact is for people who do not itemize their filings do not have a husband or other assistant to comb through them looking for deductions and who can expect five figure returns i agree it would be great to talk policy but medicareforall would have greater impact on me and everyone i know than anything the cpfb could ever do similarly with a jobs guarantee or even giving warren credit here a post office bank 2019 realignment and

bob sechler bsechler statesman com in 2019 the austin metro area won t find it easy to match its 2018 economic accomplishments last year got off to a fast start with the january announcement that austin had beaten out a couple of hundred other cities to make the short list of sites under consideration for a huge amazon inc project that development ended up going elsewhere but 2018 finished with a big win when apple inc unveiled plans in december to spend 1 billion on a new corporate campus in austin that eventually could employ 15 000 people in between the local economy expanded at a sizzling pace and monthly unemployment rates spent the year at near two decade lows with area businesses adding jobs as quickly as tens of thousands of new workers entered the metro area labor force a number of factors this year could slow the region s growth including the potential for softer trends nationally that percolate down to the local level as well as the constraints of an extremely stretched labor market in the austin metro area that eventually might hinder the ability of local employers to continue to raise output we are sort of running at full steam and at a certain level of tightness in the labor force you can t continue to grow at the same pace said michael sury a university of texas finance lecturer we re at that point in austin still wells fargo securities senior economist sarah house said the austin economy was so hot in 2018 that it likely will be hard for most people to even notice if its expansion is clipped by a percentage point or two in 2019 house predicts that the metro area s gross domestic product will expand by 6 percent to 6 5 percent this year down from her estimate of 7 percent to 7 5 percent for 2018 the dampening effects of a slowdown nationally will account for the bulk of the reduction she said with u s economic growth anticipated to come in at about 2 5 percent in 2019 compared to an annualized growth rate of 3 4 percent in the third quarter we continue to expect austin to outperform the state and national economies and for 2019 to be another great year house said speaking during a recent forecasting event sponsored by the greater austin chamber of commerce by a variety of measures the austin economy is beginning 2019 with strong momentum a barometer of economic activity devised by the federal reserve bank of dallas called the austin business cycle index hit its highest point of 2018 entering the final stretch of the year registering an annualized 7 9 percent growth rate in october the most recent figure available the long term average for the index is 6 percent annualized growth in addition the announcements by both apple and amazon have elevated the city s already high profile as a trendy place to do business construction on the new apple campus which will be near the company s existing main austin campus on parmer lane isn t going to start immediately and the first employees aren t expected to move in for nearly three years but that won t stop local economic development officials from using the national publicity as a calling card to try to lure other projects my economic analysis is a bit boring for austin i expect more of the same for 2019 in terms of extremely low unemployment and high growth said andrew glover an assistant professor of economics at the university of texas still glover said a slowdown at the national level has become more likely than it was a year ago and definitely would be felt in austin and elsewhere but austin will do relatively well even if the national economy takes a dip in 2019 he said because the city s economy is diversified a local labor shortage also could be on the horizon however with the austin area unemployment rate coming in at 2 7 percent in november an 18 year low for the month even as more than 35 000 new workers entered the regional labor force over the previous year probably the largest potential headwind in the austin metro area at the moment is that labor markets are so tight said chris slijk a dallas fed assistant economist but if local employers are able to hire enough workers to keep pace with demand and if growth in wages and retail sales remain stable slijk said the austin economy still should expand at a solid pace in 2019 here s a look at what the year ahead could bring for specific sectors of the austin economy housing market still hot but some signs of slowing for seven years running the austin area s housing market has seen sales and the median home sale price climb to record highs and when the final numbers come out later this month experts predict 2018 will be the region s eighth record breaker but what s in store for central texas housing market this year will austin become part of the story that s begun making national headlines about a slowdown in the u s housing market the u s housing boom is coming to an end starting in dallas proclaimed a headline in the wall street journal last month according to the story the market in the dallas area was sputtering and buyers were becoming queasy amid escalating home prices and rising mortgage rates while it s now widely accepted that the u s housing market slowed during the last half of 2018 in austin people are asking whether these national trends will show up here in 2019 said eldon rude a longtime housing analyst and principal of 360 real estate analytics an austin based market research and consulting firm in most of the reports about a housing pullback nationally rude said issues of affordability brought on by higher home prices and higher mortgage interest rates are cited as reasons for the retreat so is the austin housing market slowing due to these factors i think so but not nearly to the degree that some markets are rude said he said the gap between household incomes and home prices has worsened in recent years but hasn t become nearly as wide in the austin area as in many markets home prices in central texas have indeed risen sharply the median price of a single family home is now 308 355 up 40 percent in the last five years rude said however the disparity between incomes and home prices here remains well below some of the other major tech cities in the u s such as san jose san francisco and seattle he noted even if rising mortgage rates and home prices dampen demand such that 2018 ends up being the peak year for new home starts in the current real estate cycle 2018 would still go down as the second biggest year for new home construction in central texas since 2006 which holds the record while i don t see the pace of new home starts falling sharply in 2019 if sales do slow it won t be a result of too little demand rude said rather it will be because builders are finding it increasingly difficult to deliver new lots and homes at prices that are affordable to most prospective buyers and i don t see this situation getting any better in 2019 so yes affordability issues linked to rising home prices and higher mortgage interest rates will serve to limit the upside in terms of how many homes we build in austin this year rude said but he added that job growth will be the key driver for housing demand shonda novak big tech more growth expected in high tech sector big tech companies in the austin area had a busy year in 2018 and more of the same is expected this year dell technologies is once again the region s largest publicly traded company after shareholders in december voted to return the round rock based tech giant to the public stock markets ending its five year run as a private company shareholders of more than 61 percent of dell technologies class v common stock excluding affiliates of dell voted in favor of the complex plan as a result dec 28 became the first day of trading for class c shares of dell under the ticker symbol dell the company announced last july that it would dive back into the public waters not through an initial public offering the usual option which also hands over substantial control to the open market but through a unique avenue created by its 2016 purchase of data storage giant emc corp dell bought out shareholders of a tracking stock it formed through the emc acquisition to create a new class of publicly traded common shares the tracking stock which trades under the symbol dvmt has mirrored dell s 81 percent ownership in vmware the cloud computing subsidiary it has controlled since taking over emc dell moved forward with the initial plan despite some earlier speculation that it might reverse course and go through an ipo after reports that the company was interviewing banks meanwhile advanced micro devices made significant gains in 2018 after years of lackluster performance sending its stock soaring nearly 130 percent at one point in the year amd nonetheless has some substantial issues to sort out in 2019 after delivering weak financial guidance in october and whiffing on wall street expectations for its third quarter earnings industry analysts say the company benefited last year from demand in its graphics processor unit which has widespread adoption now in the gaming automotive and blockchain industries and the chipmaker which is headquartered in california but runs most of its operations out of austin was aided by cryptocurrencies like bitcoin using its graphics card but the share price declined more than 20 percent in after hours trading in october following amd s weak financial outlook setting the stage for it to try to right the ship in 2019 another local chipmaker samsung austin semiconductors will be spending significantly to upgrade its operations after announcing in november that it plans to invest 291 million here and retain 500 jobs in central texas in exchange for the new investment the austin city council cleared the way for the tech giant to receive state tax breaks the council approved a resolution designating the company s location as an enterprise zone which would allow samsung to get a refund on its state sales and use tax the governor s office of economic development and tourism has the final say on the texas enterprise zone designation in addition samsung and at t announced in september that the two companies will create a manufacturing focused 5g innovation zone the site will feature at t s fifth generation wireless broadband technology along with samsung s 5g network equipment nicole cobler software venture capital sectors expect to stay strong in 2019 in 2018 some of the world s largest software firms continued their vast expansions in the austin metro area job search site indeed which already has more than 2 000 employees here announced last may that it would be adding as many as 3 000 jobs in austin meanwhile software leader oracle has been building out its workforce at a new waterfront property near downtown with the site expected to eventually house roughly 3 000 workers google amazon and others also have been adding employees the growth is expected to continue in 2019 facebook which employs roughly 700 people at offices in downtown austin plans to lease a 17 story office building at the domain in north austin the american statesman reported in september the social media company already occupies three floors at a nearby building in addition google continues to build out a downtown office that now takes up 300 000 square feet in the top 10 floors where more than 800 staff members work the company said it now occupies floors 22 to 29 and it s expected to eventually occupy floors 30 and 31 as well at indeed the company will hire positions this year that include engineering marketing sales and customer support according to senior vice president paul d arcy while san francisco leads the list in technology austin is right behind with having a similar tech job mix to silicon valley austin looks to continue to grow in this sector d arcy said in an email people love austin for a number of reasons including the job market favorability and lower housing costs in comparison to other tech hubs in the u s meanwhile austin s startup scene experienced one of its largest funding years to date in 2018 even if venture capital flows in the city are still well below the amounts filtering through silicon valley austin eclipsed the 1 billion mark for venture capital in the first three quarters last year an amount that was greater than each of the past three years according to pricewaterhousecoopers and cb insights which study venture funding in the united states the dollars increased in 2018 because there were more companies worth larger investments said krishna srinivasan a partner at austin based investment firm liveoak venture partners which invested in four startups last year some of the austin area s highest investments included 250 million raised last january by wp engine which operates a managed hosting platform for websites and applications built by wordpress in addition online driver license accreditation firm aceable raised 47 million in december there is no reason that type of activity shouldn t continue in 2019 srinivasan said there is high quality talent in austin like never before he said it s not just the quantity that has gone up but the quality we expect 2019 to be as strong as 2018 sebastian herrera retail high demand makes finding space a challenge austin s hot retail sector will make finding space one of the biggest challenges of 2019 said chris ellis managing principal at endeavor real estate group there s been a lot of talk about the death of brick and mortar but that couldn t be further from what we re seeing ellis said there s still very little vacancy in the market and it s extremely tough there s not much new development creating new space and that affects both big and small tenants austin s retail occupancy rate was at 96 percent in the third quarter of 2018 according to data from nai partners the demand for space will continue to drive more mixed use projects especially in austin s urban core ellis said south congress is already changing as a result of that he said plaza saltillo is another example of a close in mixed use project that is creating much needed space endeavor is the developer overseeing the 10 acre saltillo project going up at interstate 35 and east fifth street the project adjacent to capital metro s plaza saltillo light rail station will have office space apartments restaurants and retail including a whole foods market 365 store meanwhile retail expansion outside of austin will continue at an even faster pace in 2019 ellis said georgetown s probably getting more retail development than anyone right now it s the product of a lot of new housing and many years of no new retail he said cedar park is another of the cities that is seeing strong demand and you ll start to see development further out in leander and kyle it s supply catching up with demand lori hawkins

washington it s now been one year since the republican controlled congress passed a major federal tax overhaul for individuals and businesses since that time both supporters and opponents of the tax cuts and jobs act have been monitoring its impact on americans the 2017 tax bill cut taxes for most americans including the middle class but it mostly benefited the wealthy and corporations by slashing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent in addition its treatment of pass through entities resulted in an estimated 17 billion in tax savings for millionaires in 2018 american corporations are also showering their shareholders with stock buybacks which many say is due in part to their tax savings prior to the tax plan passage at the end of december 2017 treasury secretary steven mnuchin forecast that the stock market will go up higher if republicans passed the tax overhaul package he also said that not only would the gop s tax plan pay for itself but it will pay for the debt and added it would cut down the deficits by a trillion dollars however one year later both the s p 500 and dow jones industrial average were down from where they were on december 22 2017 when president donald trump signed the tax cuts and jobs act and the united states federal budget deficit has also increased to 779 billion in fiscal year 2018 up 17 percent from the year before critics of the tax plan point to the growing deficit and the wall street tumble as proof that americans are not seeing the broad benefits proponents of the law were hoping for and are now casting fears and concerns on what the long term repercussions of the plan will be for middle class and low income americans chautauqua county s representative in congress tom reed r corning ny 23 disagrees with the recent criticism that s been expressed the past couple weeks like most republicans in congress reed voted in favor of the tax plan during a conference call on wednesday with local media wrfa asked him if the critical assessments of the plan one year later are warranted when you look at unemployment numbers that are now at historic levels when you look at the growth that we re seeing across all spectrums of the u s economy when you see the investments that are behind those job numbers when you see folks having their wages start to increase for the first time wage growth not being stagnet or decreasing but increasing that is directly attributable to the tax cut bill and that is exactly what we were designing it to do reed said reed is correct about unemployment the u s bureau of labor statistics reports the national unemployment rate decrease by 0 4 percentage points between november 2017 and november 2018 with 155 000 jobs being created in november 2018 alone unemployment figures for december 2018 will be released on friday the bureau also reported real average hourly earnings increased 0 8 percent seasonally adjusted from november 2017 to november 2018 reed also said the tax plan has allowed business opportunities to grow and that the treasury is seeing increased revenue we re allowing people to invest their money more rapidly into their entrepreneurial and innovative spirit we re allowing them to grow their businesses and create new businesses which means more jobs and now we re starting to see on the revenue side in the u s treasury coffers growth on revenue of 2 percent going in reed pointed out despite reed s assurance that the tax plan is doing what was intended critics say that while the tax cuts have juiced economic growth and injected a one time jolt into the us economy it s not going to last forever and the short term economic boon has already started to dissipate one such indicator is gross domestic product which saw growth at an estimated 4 2 percent in the second quarter of 2018 and at 3 5 percent in the third quarter of the year number for the 4th quarter have not yet been released but most economists agree those numbers aren t sustainable on an extended basis they also say the tax reform package was the wrong thing because it disproportionately benefits the wealthy and corporations and also done at wrong time because it was an attempt to deliver fiscal stimulus when the economy was already strong and it might have been a better idea to try to address the debt congressman reed said that the best way to address the debt is to not tax your way out of it but instead work to reduce government spending he said that can be done by not slashing social safety net programs but instead by establishing policies that cut healthcare costs which in turn would bring down government spending for programs like medicare without harming those who rely on it i think a lot of the health insurance reforms of the affordable care act will remain and go forward but if we can prioritize the issue of reform by focusing on health care costs you would not only be impacting the private market place but most importantly if you deploy those healthcare costs reduction measures in the space of medicaid medicare you would have a huge positive impact on the spending ledger when it comes to federal expenditures reed noted the idea of congress tackling healthcare costs has been brought up in both the house and senate earlier this year u s senator and doctor bill cassidy r la put forward six policy areas to lower healthcare costs empowering patients to reduce their healthcare costs lowering health insurance premiums ending healthcare monopolies by increasing competition decreasing drug costs for patients eliminating administrative burdens and costs reducing costs through primary care prevention and chronic disease management time will tell if new laws are passed to help control healthcare cost and if the users of healthcare take advantage of that which could help to reduce spending in programs like medicare the other option for cutting spending would be to simply restrict access to medicare to some americans currently using the program something that is unlikely to take place as long as democrats remain in control of one of the two chambers of congress it also appears only time will tell just how beneficial or problematic the gop tax reform plan of 2017 will be for america
according to its revised history the inevitable outcome of comprehensive systemic change is robespierre s so called reign of terror or the purges of the stalin era in the soviet union in its view what began with the locke and montesquieu influenced reforms of the constitutional monarchy was hijacked by the radical jacobin and sans culotte factions losurdo explains that counter revolutionaries eager to discredit the image of rebellion overemphasize its violence and bloodshed and never properly contextualize it as self defense against the real reign of terror by the ruling class the idea behind this recasting of history is to conflate revolutionary politics with nazi germany whose racially motivated genocide was truly the inheritor of the legacy of european colonialism not the ancestry of the jacobins or the russian revolution it serves as a reminder of the historically revisionist understanding of french politics in the u s that is long established the middle class dominated left wing in america subscribes to a historical reinterpretation of the french revolution that is a large contributor of its aversion to transformative praxis in favor of incrementalism the late italian marxist philosopher and historian domenico losurdo who died in june of this year offered the most thorough understanding of its misreading of history in seminal works such as war and revolution rethinking the twentieth century the liberal rereading of the french revolution is the ideological basis for its rejection of the revolutionary tradition from the jacobins to the bolsheviks that has neutralized the modern left to this day while the media s conspicuous blackout of coverage is partly to blame the deafening silence from across the atlantic in the united states is really because of the lack of class consciousness on its political left with the exception of occupy wall street the american left has been so preoccupied with an endless race to the bottom in the two party culture wars that it is unable to comprehend an upheaval undivided by the contaminants of identity politics a political opposition that isn t fractured on social issues is simply unimaginable not to say the masses in france are exempt from the internal contradictions of the working class but the fetishization of lifestyle politics in the u s has truly become its weakness we will have to wait and see whether the yellow vests transform into a global movement or arrive in america but for now the seeming lack of solidarity stateside equates to a complicity with macron s agenda it turned out that a crisis was not averted but merely postponed when macron defeated his demagogue opponent le pen in the 2017 french election while it is true that the gilets jaunes were partly impelled by an increase on fuel prices contrary to the prevailing narrative their official demands are not limited to a carbon tax they also consist of explicit ultimatums to increase the minimum wage improve the standard of living and an end to austerity among other legitimate grievances against a savage neoliberal program since taking office macron has declared war on trade unions while pushing through enormous tax breaks for the wealthy like himself it was just a matter of time until the french people had enough of the country s privatization it is only a shock to the oblivious establishment why the former rothschild banker turned politician who addressed the nation seated at a gold desk while paris was ablaze is suddenly in jeopardy of losing power the status quo s incognizance is reminiscent of the much disliked marie antoinette who during the 18th century when told the peasants had no bread is supposed to have replied let them eat cake as the masses starved under her husband louis xvi the media oligopoly initially attempted to ignore the insurrection altogether but when forced to reckon with the yellow vests they maligned the incendiary marchers using horseshoe theory to suggest a confluence between far left and far right supporters of jean luc mélenchon and marine le pen to the surprise of no one mainstream pundits have also stoked fears of russian interference behind the unrest we can assume that if the safety vests were ready made off the assembly line of ngos like the raised fist flags of serbia s otpor movement the presstitutes would be telling a different story in less than two months the yellow vests gilets jaunes movement in france has reshaped the political landscape in europe for a seventh straight week demonstrations continued across the country even after concessions from a cowed president emmanuel macron while inspiring a wave of similar gatherings in neighboring states like belgium and the netherlands just as el sisi s dictatorship banned the sale of high visibility vests to prevent copycat rallies in egypt corporate media has predictably worked overtime trying to demonize the spontaneous and mostly leaderless working class movement in the hopes it will not spread elsewhere robespierre remains one the most misunderstood and unfairly maligned figures in world history maximilien robespierre s real crime in the eyes of bourgeois historians was attempting to fulfill the egalitarian ideals of republicanism by transferring political power from the aristocracy and nouveaux riche directly into the hands of the working class just as the paris commune did nearly 80 years later it is for this reason he subsequently became one of the most misunderstood and unfairly maligned figures in world history perhaps one day to be absolved the u s reaction to the yellow vests is a continuation of the denial and suppression of the class conflict inherent in the french revolution which continues to seethe beneath the surfaces of capitalism today in today s political climate it is easy to forget that there have been periods where the american left was actually engaged with the crisis of global capitalism in what seems like aeons ago the anti globalization movement in the wake of nafta culminated in huge protests in seattle in 1999 which saw nearly 50 000 march against the world trade organization following the 2008 financial collapse it briefly reemerged in the occupy movement which was also swiftly put down by corporate state repression currently the political space once inhabited by the anti globalization left has been supplanted by the anti globalist rhetoric mostly associated with right wing populism globalism and globalization may have qualitatively different meanings but they nevertheless are interrelated although it is shortsighted there are core accuracies in the former s narrative that should be acknowledged the idea of a shadowy world government isn t exclusively adhered to by anti establishment conservatives as it is right to suspect there is a worldwide cabal of secretive billionaire power brokers controlling events behind the scenes there is indeed a new world order with zero regard for the sovereignty of nation states just as there is a deep state however it is a ruling class not of paranoiac imagination but real life and a right wing billionaire like robert mercer is as much a globalist as george soros ever since capitalism emerged it has always been global in nature as money itself the current economic crisis is its latest cyclical downturn impoverishing and alienating working people whose increasing hardship is what has led to the trending rejection of the eu imperialism has exported capital leading to the destruction of jobs in the home sectors of western nations while outsourcing them to the third world over time deep disgruntlement among the working class has grown toward an economic system that is clearly rigged against them where the skewed distribution of capital gains and widespread tax evasion on the part of big business is camouflaged as buoyant economic growth when it came crashing down in the last recession the financial institutions responsible were bailed out using tax payer money instead of facing any consequences such grotesque unfairness has only been amplified by the austerity measure imposed on the people further transferring the burden from the 1 to the poor before the gilets jaunes the u k s brexit referendum in 2016 laid bare these deep class divisions within the european union one of the most significant events in the continent since wwii it has ultimately threatened to reshape the occident s status in the post war order as a whole brexit manifested out of divisions within britain s political parties especially the tories which had been plagued for years by internal dispute over the eu those in power were blind to the warning signs of discontent toward a world economy in crisis and were shocked by the plebiscite in which the working class defied the powers that be against all odds with more than half voting to leave in general well to do brits were hard remainers while those suffering most severely from the destruction of industry unemployment and austerity overwhelmingly chose to leave in what was described as a peasants revolt by the media the value of the pound sterling quickly plunged and not long after the status of the united kingdom as a whole came into question as britain found itself at odds with scotland s unanimous decision to remain brexit tugged at the bonds holding the eu together and suddenly the collective standing clout of its member states was at stake in a potential breakup of the entire bloc euroscepticism is also by no means a distinctly british phenomenon as distrust has soared in countries hit the hardest by neoliberalism like greece 80 with spain and france not far behind in fact before there was brexit there was fear among the elite of a grexit in response to its unprecedented debt crisis manufactured by the international monetary fund imf the greek people elected the coalition of the radical left syriza a classic social democratic party with a rather fierce sounding name to a majority of legislative seats in the hellenic parliament during its 2015 bailout referendum unfortunately the synthetic alliance turned out to be anything but radical and soon showed itself a trojan horse of the establishment syriza was elected on its promise to rescind the terms of greek membership in the eu but shortly after taking office it betrayed its constituency and agreed to the eu s troika enforced mass privatization 1 even its former finance minister yanis varousfakis admitted that syriza was a controlled opposition and auxiliary of the soros foundation apart from suffering collective amnesia regarding the eu s neoliberal policies apparently the modern left is also in serious need of a history lesson regarding the federation s fascist origins it has been truly puzzling to see self proclaimed progressives mourning britain s decision to withdraw from a continental union that was historically masterminded by former fifth columnists of nazi germany it was in the aftermath of wwii s devastation that the 1951 treaty of paris established the nucleus of the eu in the european coal and steel community a cooperative union formed by france italy west germany and the three benelux states belgium luxembourg and the netherlands the europe declaration charter stated by the signature of this treaty the involved parties give proof of their determination to create the first supranational institution and that thus they are laying the true foundation of an organized europe this europe remains open to all european countries that have freedom of choice we profoundly hope that other countries will join us in our common endeavor the idea of forming a supranational union was conceived by the french statesman robert schuman who during the outbreak of wwii served as the under secretary of state for refugees in the reynaud government when nazi germany invaded france in 1940 schuman by all accounts willingly voted to grant absolute dictatorial powers to marshall philippe pétain to become head of state of the newly formed vichy government the puppet regime that ruled nazi occupied france until the allied invasion in 1944 by doing so he retained his position in parliament though he later chose to resign following the war like all vichy collaborators schuman was initially charged with the offense of indignité nationale national shame and stripped of his civil rights as a traitor more than 4 000 alleged quislings were summarily executed following operation overlord and the normandy landings but the future eu designer was fortunate enough to have friends in high places schuman s clemency was granted by none other than general charles de gaulle himself the leader of the resistance during the war and future french president instantly schuman s turncoat reputation was rehabilitated and his wartime activity whitewashed even though he had knowingly voted full authority to pétain the retention of his post in the vichy government was veneered to have occurred somehow without his knowledge or consent schuman is officially regarded as one of the eleven men who were founding fathers of what later became the eu one of the other major figures that contributed to the federal integration of the continent was konrad adenauer the first chancellor of the federal republic of germany the nuremberg trials may have tried and executed most of the top leadership of the nazi party but the post war government that became west germany was saturated with former third reich officials despite the purported post war denazification policy inscribed in the potsdam agreement many figures who had directly participated in the holocaust were appointed to high positions in adenauer s administration and never prosecuted for their atrocities needless to say adeenauer was extremely popular with the us elites and the american media one such war criminal was the former ministry of the interior and drafter of the nuremberg race statutes hans globke who became adenauer s right hand man as his secretary of state and chief of staff adenauer also successfully lobbied the allies to free most of the wehrmacht war criminals in their custody winning the support of then u s general and future president dwight eisenhower by 1951 motivated by the desire to quickly rearm and integrate west germany into nato in the new cold war the policy of denazification was prematurely ended and countless offenders were allowed to reenter branches of government military and public service their crimes against humanity took a backseat to the greater imperialist priority of rearmament against east germany and the soviets in the years following wwii there was also concern among the elite of anti americanism growing in western europe the annual bilderberg group conference was established in 1954 by prince bernard of the netherlands himself a former reiter ss corps and nazi party member to promote atlanticism and facilitate cooperation between american and european leaders invitations to the bilderberg club meetings were extended to only the most exclusive paragons in politics academia the media industry and finance in 2009 wikileaks revealed that it was at the infamous assembly where the hidden agenda of the european coal and steel community later the eu was set e european unity the discussion on this subject revealed general support for the idea of european integration and unification among the participants from the six countries of the european coal and steel community and a recognition of the urgency of the problem while members of the group held different views as to the method by which a common market could be set up there was a general recognition of the dangers inherent in the present divided markets of europe and the pressing need to bring the german people together with the other peoples of europe into a common market that the six countries of the coal and steel community had definitely decided to establish a common market and that experts were now working this out was felt to be a most encouraging step forward and it was hoped that other countries would subsequently join it

it has been two years since the explosive surge of the democratic socialists of america now the largest socialist organization in the united states and the largest since the 1940s and dsa has had some remarkable successes today as the country turns its attention to the presidential election of 2020 we ask how dsa is doing what is it accomplishing and where is it going what do the various caucuses and political tendencies within dsa propose as a future direction for the group is there a genuine left wing of dsa and if not what is the alternative in the last two years the democratic socialists of america has become a phenomenon on the american left with more than 50 000 members in scores of chapters in every state of the union dsa has now become the largest socialist organization in the united states since the 1940s when the communist party had about 100 000 members and alongside dsa the young democratic socialists of america is also spreading across college campuses bringing thousands of young people into the orbit of socialism dsa s spectacular surge has been accompanied by a growing appreciation of socialism among democrats as the gallup poll reported in august of 2018 for the first time in gallup s measurement over the past decade democrats have a more positive image of socialism than they do of capitalism attitudes toward socialism among democrats have not changed materially since 2010 with 57 today having a positive view the major change among democrats has been a less upbeat attitude toward capitalism dropping to 47 positive this year lower than in any of the three previous measures many dsa members hope that given these attitudes they can recruit more democratic party s progressives and also influence the party itself though there is great debate about the strategy the eagerness of some accompanied by the skepticism of others all of this began with bernie sanders 2016 campaign for the democratic party s presidential nomination when sanders called himself a democratic socialist young people went to google to search for the term and found dsa read about dsa and its ideas and were impressed social media and some dsa wranglers did the rest and soon the organization had 20 000 members then donald j trump won the presidency in november 2016 and frightened by the prospect another 20 000 or so joined and most recently alexandria ocasio cortez s victory in june a democratic congressional race defeating democratic caucus chair joe crowley brought in a few thousand more nothing is simpler than joining no questions asked no probationary period just go to dsa ask to join pay the minimal dues and presto you re a member here was a generation of young people largely from middle class families who after having been thrilled by president barack obama had become deeply disappointed in him even if well educated they frequently carried the burden of a large college loan debt and many of them often highly skilled became contract laborers with little job security while others serve beer in the bars or wait tables in the clubs they have grown up in a nation engaged in a permanent war in iraq afghanistan and half a dozen other countries while at the same time they have observed if they have not personally been involved in the occupy wall street movement and black lives matters they have been influenced by the successful fight of the lgbt movement to end don t ask don t tell and to gain marriage equality while mostly white in a nation where whites will soon be a minority their college experience and then their jobs brought them into contact with asian latino and black people and exposed them to all of the debates over identity politics out of all of this they have come to dsa with idealism and tremendous desire to make a better world thousands of dsa s new members mostly young people between 25 and 35 coming out of the broad progressive milieu most with no previous experience in the social movements or left groups and little experience beyond the bernie campaign signed up and soon became activists not only in political campaigns but also in dsa s working groups that are involved in a variety of social movements from health care for all to fights for low income housing from opposition to police racism and abuse and defense of immigration rights to the struggle against climate change from union organizing campaigns and strike support to building a socialist feminist movement participating in civil disobedience in various cities a several new dsa members have been arrested their first arrests fighting against trump s kidnapping of immigrant children or for some other worthy cause dsa chapters divided in big cities into several branches introduce members to socialism educate members about the history of the left and provide classes on marxist theory sprinklings of exiles and refugees from other leftist organizations who joined dsa have mostly brought leaven to the loaf and in between all the meetings and protests there are social events at the bars meet ups of black or latinx socialists of retail workers or teachers or just gatherings after the chapter meetings where over the suds every conceivable issue is discussed we have not had such a vibrant left in america for forty or fifty years no socialist group this big in 70 years and nothing exactly like this ever everyone on the left should celebrate this remarkable development which is not to say there are no problems but many are good problems almost all of them necessary ones and only a few of them seriously troubling the real issue is the direction where is dsa going and the biggest question regarding the group s future is its relationship to the democratic party a party itself in flux will dsa whose rebirth began in sanders democratic party primary campaign be able to attain escape velocity and become a truly independent socialist organization or will the greater gravity of the democratic party its size money influence connections power succeed in keeping dsa within its orbit from spring s halcyon days to fall s sturm und drang early 2017 those were the halcyon days the enormous influx of members transformed dsa into what was virtually a new organization the individuals who had joined in ones and twos or in small strings of friends found themselves in meetings with many others much like themselves forming new friendships as they revitalized old chapters formed new chapters and elected local leaderships everywhere they established new working groups and marched together behind dsa s red banners in what were for many their first picket lines or protest demonstrations dsa s national director maria svart and the organization s miniscule staff did a remarkable job of keeping on top of a group that doubled in size every few months advising new chapter leaders creating new structures and publications sending out inspiring emails urging members to keep up the fight the goodwill among the members and the good nature of most of them was remarkable to those of us who had come out of an older left made up of smaller groups formed in the social upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s and then tested in the long dry spell of the 1980s and the intermittent struggles of the 1990s and 2000s discouraging and embittering some then suddenly the new dsa a breath of fresh air the dsa newcomers as i said joined and found others like themselves perhaps too much like themselves most of dsa new members were college educated people many of them here in new york for example employed in technical jobs or with professional careers in tech publishing or design in los angeles there s quite a contingent of film industry workers others everywhere form part of the new precariat employed in coffee shops restaurants and bars or working a couple of gigs to put together the rent with their roommates few dsaers are married or have children and few are over 50 or even over 30 most members are white and the proportion of people of color in dsa is less than that in american society as a whole and similarly with union members and men generally outnumber women though the difference between the two is not extreme certainly not as out of kilter as in some small left groups that are practically boys clubs lgbt members have found themselves in a group which if not always as sensitive to such issues as it might be has proven capable of learning everywhere dsa members are conscious of these race and gender issues and anxious to make the organization more representative of the american working class as a whole at the august 2017 dsa convention its ranks swollen with younger more radical members dsa moved to the left adopting a series of measures that seemed to break with the group s social democratic past the convention delegates voted to leave the socialist international si based on the argument that the european social democrats had become the enforcers of neoliberalism and austerity while si affiliate parties in many developing countries headed up authoritarian governments the convention also voted to support the boycott divest sanctions bds campaign and to oppose efforts to criminalize the movement the delegates wanting to turn dsa in a new direction also voted to establish a people of color caucus and a labor commission and finally the convention made a single payer health care system a national objective not surprisingly given the rising temperature of politics in the country and the crises in the major political parties as that last dsa convention approached significant political differences had already appeared in the dsa differences that reflected debates on gender race and class taking place in the academia in the media and in the social movements consequently for the first time in the group s history caucuses and rival slates made their appearance and there was a serious scuffle if not a battle for leadership of the group following the convention strife continued among a scribbling minority on social media where snide matched snark and ad hominem tweets and posts sometimes verged on character assassination though the great majority of the members remained aloof from the mud and the dreck we seem to have come through the worst of that sturm und drang or to have become habituated to it and have moved on to more serious discussion and debate over our future harrington and the dsa old guard we should pause a moment to put dsa today into a little historical perspective dsa s roots go back to the social struggles of the 1950s and 1960s and the civil rights and anti war movements in those days the old socialist party in which dsa has its roots that is the party of eugene v debs who went to prison for opposing world war i had moved to the right and come out as a supporter of the u s war against vietnam the socialist party s anti stalinism too much resembled the liberal state department anti communism of americans for democratic action ada in the late 1960s michael harrington the sp s youngish leftish face he was just 40 years old then alienated the young radicals of students for a democratic society sds because he told them they weren t sufficiently anti communist causing the sp to lose its relationship to the largest and most important left movement of the 1960s sds went off to be taken over by the stalinist of the progressive labor party at that time pro communist china and the radical liberals of the revolutionary youth movement rym and the weathermen who broke windows and built bombs and carried out some bombings and armed robberies killing a few of themselves and a couple of others after harrington turned his back on sds only a small group found its way to socialist politics through groups like the international socialists i was one of those then the socialist party s support for the vietnam war finally drove harrington out of the party in 1972 and the following year he and his followers created the democratic socialist organizing committee dsoc harrington had a strategic perspective that inspired the new organization as he argued in his book socialism he believed then that if the unions the civil rights organizations and the anti war movement could be brought together within the democratic party that they could drive out the southern racists and the corrupt big city machines and transform the democratic party into a labor party at that time harrington and his friends had ties to both black leaders of the civil rights movement and to important leaders of major industrial and public employee unions while the anti war movement was still in the streets harrington s strategy seemed to have legs harrington s plan of working within a capitalist party represented a fundamental break with socialist theory and practice since karl marx initiated modern socialism in europe or since debs had led the movement in america socialists had historically rejected involvement in capitalist political parties believing that working people needed their own political party if they were to overthrow capitalism and establish a socialist order but harrington was not the first one to give up the marxist position over the century from 1870 to 1970 the various left parties had by various paths come to reject marx s admonitions about the role of capitalist parties and the capitalist states the communist party had during its popular front period in the 1930s and 1940s worked in an alliance with the progressive democrats and in other countries with other capitalist parties even conservative parties justifying its position by the need to stop the nazis during that era when the cp s american leader earl brower proclaimed that communism is twentieth century americanism the communist party had grown to 100 000 members with an estimated one million people in their periphery during the same period in europe the labor socialist and social democratic parties after more than a century of involvement in bourgeois politics and following the disastrous civil wars world wars of 1914 1945 had emerged as reformist capitalist parties the socialist parties now managed capitalism their strategy in places like scandinavia became a model for harrington s program for america harrington s political position with its resemblance to the communists popular front and to european social democracy made it possible almost a decade later for dsoc to merge with the new american movement nam a new left organization formed in 1971 some of whose leaders were former pro soviet communists while some others inclined toward communist china or fidel castro s cuba and in general many were sympathetic to the third world nationalist movements the nam also brought concerns about feminism and the environment that had not previously formed part of the dsoc worldview the combined organization had 6 000 members 5 000 from dsa and 1 000 from nam it was at this point that dsa staked out its big tent approach and conception of a mutli tendency organization the old dsa having broken with its marxist origins and with revolutionary socialism required a new theory and its intellectuals found it in interpretations of antonio gramsci s prison notebooks and in the writing of thinkers on the left of the european socialist parties like the french writer andré gorz the greek french political scientist nicos poulantzas and the british sociologist ralph milliband all of these intellectuals starting with gramsci emphasized the theory of hegemony the relative autonomy of the state from the capitalist class and the political struggle within the existing capitalist parliamentary governments as interpreted first by richard healey and later by joseph schwartz socialists should first adopt gramsci s view at least for the present that we are engaged in a war of position that is an attempt to build organizations influence politics and win hegemony while eschewing a war of movement that is a head on revolutionary confrontation with the state sometimes there was a suggestion that the long slow gradual war of position would eventually lead to the war of movement to revolution though by postponing the war of movement indefinitely revolution receded into by infinite regress not into the future but into oblivion secondly dsa s theorists argued socialists should emphasize gorz s theory of non reformist reforms that is profound reforms that would tend to break out of the limits of the capitalist system the unaddressed problem was that such reforms would either tend to strengthen the capitalist state or would tend to make capitalism less profitable leading employers and politicians to turn to the right and to repression if the latter then the right would then initiate the war of movement for which the left had not been prepared in any case in the hands of dsa s intellectual and political leaders all of this theory served primarily to justify work in the democratic party so dsa from its founding in 1982 worked in the social movements that were then in the doldrums and often endorsed candidates for election in the rightward moving democratic party in the 1990s dsa grew to 10 000 members as it worked closely with the congressional progressive caucus to oppose president bill clinton s regressive policies dsa s commitment to work in the democratic party to an alliance with the more progressive labor bureaucracy of the united auto workers afscme and the iam and its soft support for israel practically defined it as a liberal organization just as old style liberalism went into crisis and decline the new dsa that emerged two years ago after the bernie bump was fundamentally different in temperament it was made up of people furious with hillary clinton and the democratic party national committee and with its chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz at that moment many hated the democratic party altogether some wanted bernie to run as an independent or to create a new party the seething anger at the democrats made possible dsa s 2017 convention break with the socialist international and the other progressive resolutions passed at that meeting but it didn t lead to a break with the democrats and as we will see the old dsa strategy based on an orientation to the democratic party remained a powerful and attractive current but first let s look at dsa s social movement activism which constitutes most of the organization s actual work because we want to consider the relationship between social movement activism and politics dsa at work with its new members dsa has over the last two years been able to launch more campaigns enter into more coalitions and simply do vastly more work dsa s national health care campaign we need medicare for all gives the lie to theoretical debates about an irrepressible conflict between economic reductionism and concern for particularly oppressed groups by proposing a broad economic change that would particularly improve the conditions for women and people of color while medicare for all would be good for all it will be especially good for the working poor for low wage workers for the precariat for african americans latinos and women in new york city the socialist feminist working group has played a leading role in the health care campaign canvassing neighborhoods and phone banking for the new york health act today the fight for health care for all stands at the center of dsa s political program the immigrant justice working groups around the country have been fighting the role of the immigration and customs enforcement ice agents who frequently arrest people showing up in court for their immigration hearings as witnesses in criminal cases or simply as standers by who fit the profile of immigrants whatever that is some dsa members have been arrested in protests against these practices in new york dsa s ijwg protests have been accompanied by the presentation of a petition with thousands of signature demanding an end to ice in the courts to new york state chief judge janet difiore who has permitted their presence nyc dsa has worked with groups such as the new sanctuary coalition to educate immigrant communities about their rights and how to protect themselves from unlawful ice actions the dsa ijwg activists have also mobilized to show solidarity with the recent immigrant caravans some traveling across the country to welcome those seeking refuge and asylum at the border some dsa members from various chapters are now in tijuana and san diego to offer assistance to the migrants the fight against gentrification and rising housing costs as well as the protection of public housing also constitutes an important part of dsa s activism in many cities almost everywhere this is a struggle against powerful banks realtors and construction companies by working class and poor communities often made up largely of low income people of color dsa joins with these housing activists and with community organizations to educate renters about their rights sometimes creating tenant unions and organizing neighborhood meetings protest demonstrations and testifying at public hearings sometimes dsa s work in this area involves lobbying and legislation these fights may pit dsa socialists against supposed progressive local politicians in brooklyn dsa joined with the crown heights tenant s union to oppose the transformation of the city owned huge block square bedford union armory into luxury housing the coalition took the fight to the democrats progressive city council where while it didn t win all it asked for did win many more affordable housing units dsa also works on housing legislation in california dsa s housing group supported proposition 10 the affordable housing act would allow communities to expand and strengthen tenant protections legalizing rent control for every california renter regardless of what kind of home they live in the legislation was defeated 6 3 to 4 2 million votes but the defeats on these issues in new york and california are only battles in a much longer war and the question to which we turn below is what lessons are being taken from these experiences into the labor movement dsa has made labor a focus of its activity and in a way different than it did in the past harrington and the old dsa had had an alliance with the liberal wing of the labor bureaucracy most importantly walter reuther of the united auto workers reuther and his successor leonard woodcock both former socialists who supported the most liberal democrats fought for higher wages and benefits for workers but neglected rank and file workers demands for more a more human workplace those leaders also neglected the issues of black autoworkers and when the black autoworker rebellion took place in the late 1960s with the organization of the dodge revolutionary union movement drum walter reuther called the black workers racist while another uaw official called them black fascists the alliance with the uaw officials and other union leaders put the dsa at odds with activists in the unions organizing a rank and file movement in opposition to both the auto companies and the union leadership of course dsa also always had some dedicated worker activists and local union officials who tried to fight the good fight even when their leaders failed to but by the 2010s there weren t many labor activists left today the democratic socialist labor commission has nearly 700 members nationwide described as union members and stewards union staff workers center activists union officers labor journalists union retirees students in labor solidarity groups labor oriented intellectuals or in any other kind of role in the movement dsa s monthly newspaper the democratic left recently published a special labor issue that made clear the group s commitment to more democratic and militant labor unions dsa s labor work has been strengthened by several members of solidarity who joined dsa many of whom who have years of experience in the unions and have played an important role in helping to organize and to orient dsa s labor work the solidarity members and many other dsa s are committed to a rank and file approach described by kim moody decades ago and as laid out succinctly in an article jane slaughter wrote for the democratic left rank and file organizing by workers on the job and at the unions grassroots is intended to fight the bosses and when necessary to fight union officials who stand in the way it is meant both to build the labor movement and to recruit workers to socialism and to the dsa while some dsa labor activists may have other approaches this seems to be the dominant trend at the moment dsa members are now working with labor notes the labor education center that has helped rank and file labor activists come together in various unions to build a more militant and democratic labor movement while in the 1970s many young leftists went to work in the mines in steel mills auto plants at the telephone company or as truck drivers and dockworkers among many others today dsa members look to other industries as slaughter wrote to build this fight from below some dsaers are getting jobs in multiracial workplaces that show potential for ferment these include teaching healthcare and logistics dsa has on its website an article titled why socialists should become teachers which talks about the role that a few dsa members played in the recent west virginia teachers strike a few dsa members that were teachers in west virginia public schools began having conversations about new austerity measures facing public employees our wages had been stagnant for years unlike our healthcare costs which were climbing we formed a reading group held brainstorming sessions and quickly agreed that winning our demands would require militant action we had no idea that we were laying the groundwork for what would culminate in a historic successful nine day strike that spread like wildfire to oklahoma kentucky arizona colorado and beyond the article goes on to make a compelling case for dsa members to take up a career in the field of teaching a number already have and not only in west virginia other dsa members have salted that is taken jobs to support union organizing campaigns in unorganized warehouses all of this suggests that dsa stands poised to play a role in the labor movements of the coming decade and if successful and this is the hope could begin the process of transformation into a largely working class organization the issue of race given the long history of racism in america from slavery and jim crow to pervasive discrimination throughout the last century and the phenomenon of contemporary color blind racism it is not surprising that dsa like every other institution in america would also have challenges in dealing with the race issue we in dsa find ourselves dealing with a debate over economic reductionism on the one hand and identity politics on the other a false dichotomy in my view but also with tensions between members of various ethnicities and various politics over the handling of race issues a recent article in the new republic do america s socialists have a race problem suggested that dsa and in particular its momentum the call an important national group that plays a leading role in the east bay and philadelphia chapters had dealt disastrously with racial issue the article painted a false picture of an organization about to be torn about by racial issues in response nearly a dozen dsa members of color responded with an article in the call criticizing the author s method and distortions in the article the authors write contrary to what salazar s piece implies all political tendencies within dsa agree on the importance of fighting racial oppression all agree that it s a problem that dsa is largely white and all agree that dsa must be a democratically run socialist organization the main point of disagreement that remains is how to most effectively address these issues and concerns absolutely true the collective article in the call suggested that dsa would in the long run overcome its most important race problems the small percentage of members of color and particularly black members and a lack of a base in communities of color through it work in the social movements in the unions and in political campaigns that would bring about new recruits and closer community ties while there is some truth there involvement in movements and growth in members of color will have an impact but the organization most also grapple with theories and attitudes with internal structures and political processes the new republic piece focused as it was on the issue of racial tensions in dsa made it seem as if dsa was afflicted with race problems while the article in the call does not appear to recognize the depth of feeling and deep concern among many dsa members about the group s theory and practice in confronting racism we might note that adolph reed jr who is not a dsa member enters into this debate within and about dsa with the worst possible and least useful terms which side are you on demanding that the left choose between a social democratic program and the politics of racial identity politics once again the false dichotomy dsa is not the organization portrayed by salazar but the call s defensive response doesn t address the issue adequately either momentum the call tends to emphasize a universal economic program while other members while not necessarily interested in promoting identity politics want more emphasis on the issues of racial and gender oppression and on the need for the self organization of oppressed groups we need a political approach that understands that capitalism leads to both the exploitation of workers and the oppression of blacks and latinos and women and lgbt people and so we need the self organization of and the relative autonomy of those groups and their struggles within the broader fight for socialism politics socialists and the democratic party while dsa is and does many things electoral politics has probably galvanized and mobilized more members than any other activity this is not surprising given the fear that president donald j trump s authoritarian white nationalist government is perceived by many as the first step to something worse and even to fascism electoral politics offers the hope of actually changing the people and the parties that dominate government as well as altering governmental policies and the work is rewarding political campaigns provide opportunities for many to contribute creating databases developing and designing campaign materials canvassing neighborhoods identifying voters and in the end getting out the vote electoral work knocking on doors and talking with people in their homes can be interesting and fun a real learning experience for young people especially about who lives in the neighborhood and what those people are thinking in some areas such as new york city dsa has been able to mobilize hundreds of members and in one as many as 2 000 in local campaigns the sense of having worked in a common activity is also important to dsa in creating a common sense of identity the work has been so successful that today most people probably know of dsa as the group that elected two of its members alexandria ocasio cortez and rashida harbi tlaib to the u s congress as well as another the controversial julia salazar to the new york state legislature other dsa candidates also won election to their state legislatures mike sylvester in maine gabriel acevero and vaughn stewart in maryland and summer lee sarah innamorato and elizabeth fiedler in pennsylvania many other socialists won municipal elections or wee elected to democratic party positions socialist organizations have seen nothing like this since the socialist party of america of the 1900s though the strategy is quite different than it was then the socialist party of that era ran candidates on its own ballot line not in another party eugene debs the perennial presidential candidate and most prominent leader of the spa told the voters it is for me to say to the thinking workingman that he has no choice between these two capitalist parties that they are both pledged to the same system and that whether the one or the other succeeds he will still remain the wage working slave he is today dsa on the other hand has decided to run most of its candidates as democrats and though the long term strategy remains somewhat vague it may encourage illusions that the democratic party can be reformed or taken over does dsa like the old harringtonites have such a strategy or is it using the democratic party simply to build its own organization and its own electoral machines there are many views of this question within dsa including some dsaers who don t support running in the democratic party at all one can see the problems with work inside the democratic party when one looks at the record of alexandria ocasio cortez a dsa member whose victory in a democratic party congressional primary election in new york stunned the country and thrilled dsa members today ocasio cortez is an exemplar progressive participating in an illegal demonstration in nancy pelosi s office to demand a serious democratic party position on global warming calling for a green new deal opposing the amazon deal in new york city and supporting laid off workers but ocasio cortez also caused consternation in dsa when she came out in support for all democrats thereby including andrew cuomo early in september 2018 dsa members by and large loathe cuomo and her support for him shocked many the new york city dsa leadership criticized ocasio cortez for her endorsement of cuomo and other democrats writing we reject the illusion that the democratic party is or will become an institution serving the interests of the u s working class she also shocked many dsa members with her twitter message upon learning of the death of senator john mccain john mccain s legacy represents an unparalleled example of human decency and american service as an intern i learned a lot about the power of humanity in government through his deep friendship with sen kennedy that a socialist and presumably an anti imperialist and an internationalist could praise as an example of human decency a man who bombed vietnam supported the invasion of iraq in 2003 called for bombing iran and ran a racist campaign against obama was unacceptable to many in dsa incidents like these have raised questions not just about ocasio cortez but about the democratic party strategy so what next some in dsa have already come out for bernie in 2020 arguing that early involvement in his campaign will once again present progressive economic and social program popularize socialism and perhaps recruit tens of thousands more to dsa whether or not the bernie phenomenon can repeat itself remains in question there is no evil hillary clinton as a foil in the primary he will have competition from a host of other progressive democrats he will have to deal with charges of sexism in his 2016 campaign his platform will not be unique since the other candidates who will be his rivals have now adopted many of his ideas in fact the whole party may adopt them for 2020 in diluted and sometimes corrupted form having spent two years campaigning for democrats he does not have the reputation as an independent that he once had and the presence of a socialist candidate in a presidential election will no longer be a novelty then too bernie will be 79 an age many believe is too advanced for a president he would then be 83 at the end of his first term and 87 at the end of a second which is always a calculation in presidential elections such issues must affect people like ocasio cortez and many other progressives who have hesitated to endorse sanders at least so far while dsa likes sanders it is not clear that sanders values dsa sanders after all has his own electoral organization our revolution and while some dsa members work on its staff and are active within it it does not seem that they any significant political role at the sanders institute s inaugural gathering in vermont in november and december dsa members were not prominen the only dsa member among the speakers was cornel west a major black intellectual but a nominal dsa member who plays no role within the organization and is not associated with it in the public s mind so some in dsa would like to use the sanders campaign to boost its organization though it is not at all clear that sanders sees any special role for the group in his operation the context at the moment as we turn to dsa s future we should consider the state of the country today the united states despite what economists the media and politicians call a booming economy remains in turbulent political times as it has been since the 2008 great recession trump speaking to some victims of the economic crisis and to those who feared losing their social status created a new populist political force based on the conditions created by rightwing republicans and the failures of barack obama hillary clinton and the democrats trump and the republicans have since 2016 succeeded in hollowing out political democracy through gerrymandering and voter suppression in a variety of forms they have attacked and undercut social programs undermined environmental policies and regulations criminalized immigration and terrorized immigrants while at the same time enoucraging racism and contributed to the growth of a far right that includes white nationalists and neo nazis the country has for two years verged on a constitutional crisis as trump has striven to create a unitary government with the republican control of all three branches tending toward one party rule and presidential domination a situation attenuated but not resolved by the democratic party s gains in the mid term elections of 2018 when thwarted by the courts trump has attempted to rule by decree returning to the economic situation the stock market has been erratic and there are fears of a coming economic crisis in many quarters throughout all of this trump who remains in contact by twitter with his 55 million followers has held on to the 35 percent of the american population that approves of him and his policies it remains altogether possible for him to win the next presidential election given this situation as we now go into the political campaign for the presidency in 2020 with the democrats deeply divided and an array of twenty some liberal and progressive contenders vying to become the party candidate tremendous political and popular pressure will build to support first in the primary a candidate who can win and then in the election to back any democrat against trump and similar forces will come to bear all down the ballot line senators representatives governors mayors and city council members with democratic party progressives playing the key role in attempting to pull those on the left into the vortex into the maelstrom of what an older generation called bourgeois politics and behind this will be in fact the bourgeoisie with its control of finance and industry of the media and much of the social media pouring billions of dollars into the coffers of pacs and buying up politicians wholesale toward the 2019 convention what does dsa propose to do in these times dsa of course being political and being made up of that most mercurial of elements ordinary human beings is not united within dsa various currents of opinion vague political tendencies and organized caucuses discuss sometimes debate and at the convention to be held in august 2019 will vote on the organization s leadership and policies vote on its future formally that is constitutionally dsa is a genuinely democratic organization though the rapid growth of the organization the increasingly dense proliferation of chapters working groups and committees the adoption all over the country of scores of local by laws and regulations and the large proportion of new members with only a year two or three in the group means that real democratic decision making has sometimes been hard to achieve consequently some leaders held over from the old harrington dsa staff members whose focus is on maintaining the organization and the attractions of political campaigns in the democratic party as well as the relatively low level of struggle in the labor and social movements in the country have meant that dsa has continued to move along its historic social democratic trajectory despite the influx of thousands of new young and often radical members the dsa ship wobbles in its orbit but so far has not reached escape velocity that would allow it to head towards an independent political perspective the old dsa that is before the sanders campaign had already defined itself as a big tent and constitutionally permitted the existence of organized political caucuses within the group though at that time there were none even now most dsa members don t affiliate with or even identify with national caucuses and the caucuses that exist don t capture or reflect the diversity of views of all dsa members most dsa members have formed political connections through friendship networks coming out of the chapters or working groups in small cities towns and rural areas dsa members may have strong ties because they feel themselves to be part of a beleaguered radical minority some dsa members feel more comfortable with lose networks and a publication such as build that tends to emphasize local community base building rather than with political caucuses organized caucuses however are likely to play the strongest role at the coming convention while the first real caucuses began to appear just before 2017 convention when a few caucuses developed today there are several some claiming several hundred members until a few months ago dsa has slew of caucuses from the the self proclaimed marxist momentum the call to the anarchist libertarian socialist caucus from the more social democratic old guard of the north star caucus now with some new members to the process and identity oriented praxis caucus and the revolutionary socialist refoundation caucus surprisingly praxis and refoundation disbanded in 2018 while momentum the call is planning on holding a national meeting to formally launch its caucus in early 2019 and meanwhile a new communist caucus has made its debut let s turn to look at these various alternative leadership groups the north star caucus many of the signers of the north star caucus statement were members of dsoc or of nam and have been members of dsa for decades they represent the organizational and political continuity of of the group a number have been leaders in their communities in social movements and in the labor unions for just as long though they are now also joined by some younger members the first principle of the caucus is this the defeat of trumpism and the republican majorities in congress and the states is a strategic imperative for democratic socialists it is a position that by deduction commits the caucus to support of the democratic party the statement goes on to read to defeat trumpism and the republicans we must recognize that the democratic party s decades long acquiescence to neoliberal policies austerity privatization deregulation and corporate dominated globalization has played a role in the rise of racist far right populism the democratic party has been too passive as these neoliberal policies have led to the decimation of unions in the united states and to the socioeconomic devastation of large swaths of its working class what this ignores of course is that the democratic party was not simply acquiescing and being passive but that it played an active role in the adoption of neoliberal policies and austerity with the clintons and obama having a major part it is this view that sets north star apart from the other caucuses formed by younger members which take a far more critical view of the democrats the communist caucus the communist caucus which was previously simply a local group in the bay area has announced that it will now become a national caucus the core of the communist caucus comes from a group of bay area leftists who were inspired by the italian marxists of the 1970s and current left communist formations like endnotes they entered dsa s east bay chapter and became involved in housing organizing with the goal of building tenant collectives and disrupting capital flows today others come from a more ideological standpoint many of which are left communists syndicalists class struggle anarchists post trotskyist ish etc the communist caucus sees its role as combating the jacobin magazine sponsored reformist agenda of working within the democratic party see seth ackerman for an example as a spokesperson for the communist caucus said we want to help newly politicized members get involved in organizing efforts that may lead to actual disruptions of capital as it exists on an everyday level doing this type of organizing means moving away from a liberal model that makes reformist demands on the state by way of organizing potential voters they oppose within dsa other groupings that are in our view social democratic they say that they do not oppose participation in elections in theory but they offer no strategy for independent political action to the left of the democrats while the communist caucus puts its emphasis on organizing its only significant project so far is its housing work which may not be enough to convince others that it has a way forward whether or not the communist caucus can develop a national following and play a role at the dsa convention in 2019 remains to be seen the libertarian caucus ideologically similar to the communist caucus though less strident the libertarian socialist caucus which claims some 700 members nationally defines itself this way we take libertarian socialism to encompass those parts of the socialist movement including syndicalists council communists anarchists cooperativists and municipalists among many others which have historically seen the surest path to socialism as residing in the creation of independent institutions in civil society that give the working class and ordinary people direct power over their lives while the list of radical tendencies they incorporate includes people who hold a variety of views the libertarians can be thought of as opponents of centralism and believers in what an earlier generation called participatory democracy the caucus stands for things like community councils mutual aid and a strategy based on dual power by dual power they mean the construction of local anti capitalist institutions that can over time be federated into an alterative economic structure their dual power strategy document offers a number of examples from the spanish general confederation of labor to cooperation jackson though they do not discuss the dsa s actual role leaning more toward the historic models of anarchism than toward those of socialism still oddly enough the libertarian caucus has in general accepted dsa s electoralist strategy despite its reported numbers this caucus seems unlikely to have much influence on the dsa convention 2019 even though many members like things like community organizing and mutual aid programs momentum the call of all of the caucuses over the last two years momentum the call is the most serious best organized and most dynamic the momentum group with its new publication the call is laying the basis for building a national caucus with a coherent political program and a clear organizational strategy many of momentum the call leaders came first out of the young democratic socialist yds and then went to work with the leftist publication jacobin momentum the call s talented leaders take on leadership roles in important national committees and in local branches of the organization they are among the best organizers speakers and writers in dsa yet some dsa members perceive some of its leaders as arrogant its organization as overly aggressive and its behavior as insensitive on questions of race and gender momentum the call tends to emphasize centralism in a group many of whose members prefer decentralization and momentum has a national strategy when other members prefer an emphasis on local and particular issues momentum the call group s politics like jacobin s could be described as left social democratic one could say left kautskyist or something like the old communists popular front or the eurocommunism of the 1970s and 1980s momentum the call has in general been a strong supporter of the dsa s endorsements of democratic party candidates in favor of endorsing both open socialists like ocasio cortez and tlaib as well as progressives such as cynthia nixon and it supports the call for bernie sanders in 2020 momentum the call has also been a leading group in building dsa s labor work and advocating a rank and file strategy with its emphasis on institution building on labor unions and politics the call rejects the label revolutionary socialist the call writes that on the one hand we reject a strategy of gradually winning reforms which never seeks to break with the capitalist system and that on the other hand we also reject a strategy of insurrection which mistakenly seeks to adopt a model from vastly different historical conditions and apply it to our situation today their platform cites vivek chibber s essay our road to power which i have criticized elsewhere the condemnation of a strategy of insurrection is a red herring since no one in dsa and virtually none in the broader left advocates a putsch momentum the call defines itself this way we are marxists who believe in a democratic road to socialism historically the term democratic road implied a gradual peaceful electoral transition from capitalism to socialism as opposed to a revolutionary strategy the call s rejection of reformism is belied by the commitment to the democratic road as the authors know that phrase the democratic road is identified with the post war social democracies and with the parties of eurocommunism and the democratic road is identified with the disastrous experience of the chile s democratic road pursued by salvador allende and the popular unity government a leadership with a failed strategy that is celebrated in the pages of the call president salvador allende of chile committed to the democratic road consistently sought compromise with the bourgeoisie and the military used his party and labor union apparatuses to restrain the militant workers movement and when that failed called out the police to repress strikes the result was counterrevolution military dictatorship and the suppression of progressive forces for a generation another outcome might have been possible had there been party based in the working class with a revolutionary strategy not one of reformist reforms emphasizing the government s nationalization of industry at the expense of workers power the historic alternatives are not as suggested by the call insurrection versus the democratic road but reform versus revolution and that remains the fundamental underlying choice of a political perspective even when revolution is not on the agenda at the moment revolution as a slogan of the left embodies the notions of intransigence in the struggle against capitalism and the complete abolition of capitalist institutions above all the state to make way for a democratic socialism from below the other caucuses with their emphasis on building local bases of struggle to be knit together overtime have a point but they do not lay out a national strategy for an alternative politics an alternative to the left of the democratic party the left alternative at the moment the broad left of american politics is held together by opposition to trump but with the mid term victory and with the possibility of a democratic party president in 2020 there will be a tendency to divide over the question of what is desirable and necessary versus what is possible the division in the democratic party between sanders and other progressives and between progressives and standard issue democrats will also be reflected in dsa we could already see this in the debate over nyc dsa s endorsement of cynthia nixon who had supported barack obama and hillary clinton with their neoliberal policies but who underwent an overnight conversion and could suggest that she was herself a democratic socialist nyc dsa with moment folks playing a leading rule opted for nixon if you cannot already feel the undertow it is because you have not yet walked far enough into the water what then is the alternative the alternative is a revolutionary marxist perspective that while recognizing revolution is not on the agenda puts the emphasis on the dynamic of social and labor movements informed by the idea that if those movement become large enough and strong enough they will tend to demand an independent political expression either by splitting the democratic party or by launching an independent movement we should take much of inspiration our strategies and our fundamental political outlook from grassroots movement from below such as occupy wall street black lives matters and the west virginia teacher strikes we should also look attempts in the united states and abroad to build parties to the left of the democrats and the social democrats the reason for running candidates in the democratic party should be to represent those movements and forces that have the potential not to reform or capture the democratic party but to lead to its crack up for clearly a new left political party will have to come out of a combination of the movements and of the working class base of the democrats all of this should be inspired by the idea that the goal is the complete overthrow of the capitalist system the government we have can never represent the interests of working people and the oppressed it needs to be dismantled and replaced by a different more democratic kind of government while the level of community and worker struggles remains low those should be where we see our future some in dsa like to put these arguments in terms of the classical positions of the past if that is the case then we should see this as a moment for emphasizing rosa luxemburg certainly not the german social democrat karl kautsky or the italian eurocommunist enrico berlinguer or even the bolshevik vladimir lenin we certainly don t want to create today an organization that combines centralization plus reformist politics the heart of luxemburg s politics was the idea of the dynamic interaction between the economic and the political between the party and the self activity working class and popular movements the self activity of working people and the oppressed the notion of self emancipation should be for us as it was for luxemburg at the center of our politics at this stage of the movement and this moment in history at the same time of course luxemburg stood for a centralized party that could provide leadership to the working class even if she differed with both kautsky and lenin about how such a party should be organized and should operate dsa members have to decide that they want to both express the working class s needs and desires and basing themselves in the working class to lead the working class toward revolution dsa remains the most dynamic and exciting organization on the left as we head now into the unfolding crisis of the last years of the donald j trump administration we in dsa will have an opportunity to decide and then to test our strategies and to draw lessons from the experiences two years later the new dsa remains an exciting experiment one that opens up important possibilities for the future and we should take advantage of them dan la botz is a member of both solidarity and the democratic socialists of america as well as an editor of new politics

last year stephen schwarzman took home 786 5 million from the blackstone group a leading private equity firm that he co founded and has run for more than 30 years that sum included his salary bonus and incentive fees totaling 125 million plus more than 650 million blackstone paid out as dividends associated with the sizable holding of blackstone stock he retains as a founder and longtime executive it was a big payday to be sure but not out of line with previous years when schwarzman s blackstone income ranged from 425 million to 734 million nor is it out of line with increases in wealth earned by a number of other billionaire financiers and company founders the question is do they deserve such extraordinary sums schwarzman declined an invitation to talk through that question but it s a fair guess that as a staunch defender of free markets he considers his take a proper reward for his talent hard work ingenuity and willingness to take risk over many years in the past he has criticized those who blame the wealthy for stagnant middle class incomes and rising inequality and when the obama administration proposed a change in tax law that would have reduced his income an outraged and later apologetic schwarzman likened it to adolf hitler s invasion of poland advertisement in the theoretical models favored by economists what schwarzman or anyone else earns in the marketplace is thought to reflect how much we add to economic output in the language of economics our marginal productivity my own reading of the evidence is that most of the very wealthy get that way by making substantial economic contribution harvard economist greg mankiw wrote in a much remarked upon essay a few years back that was titled defending the one percent indeed if we still had an economy of independent self sufficient farmers and artisans mankiw s mental model might be the correct one someone could point to a bushel of tomatoes or a hand knit sweater and credibly make the claim i produced that it is the fruit of my labor so what i earn from it in the competitive marketplace is my property my just desert advertisement but in a modern economy creating products and services is a team sport with individuals constantly interacting with other individuals and firms in complex arrangements that make it much more difficult to determine each person s contribution to overall economic output there are differences in market power between firms and differences of individual power within firms both of which have a significant effect on exactly who earns what one of the reasons blackstone is so successful for example is that as one of the biggest private equity firms it gets a first look at most of the best investment opportunities everyone who works at or invests with blackstone benefits from that kind of market power and within blackstone schwarzman has the sole discretion in setting the bonuses for top executives according to its annual proxy filings more significantly the amount anyone earns at blackstone or any other firm is influenced by the rules laws and norms that govern business behavior and market competition advertisement as someone who buys and sells companies for example schwarzman has benefited handsomely from a uniquely american business environment in which companies are run with the single minded focus of maximizing returns to shareholders and investors rather than balancing the interests of all stakeholders the hotel companies and amusement parks that blackstone has owned hilton la quinta motel 6 six flags busch gardens have benefited from a federal minimum wage that hasn t budged in more than a decade and labor laws that now make it almost impossible for workers to vote in a union at any company that is determined to stop them over the past 30 years the weakening of antitrust enforcement and regulations meant to protect consumers and investors have boosted the profits and increased the value of blackstone owned companies in the waste management cable television telephone funeral and nursing home industries advertisement as a big investor in corporate debt blackstone also has benefited from bankruptcy rules that favor bondholders over workers as it did in the restructuring of telecom firm avaya in which 360 million in unfunded pension liabilities was effectively shifted to the government s pension guarantee agency share this article share the extraordinarily low interest rates engineered by the federal reserve in recent years have boosted valuations for the many real estate investments that blackstone has made including its 37 7 billion purchase of equity office properties at the top of the last real estate bubble low interest rates also have provided blackstone with the financial headroom to shower its investors and executives with huge one time dividends financed with debt liberalized trade treaties have made it possible for blackstone owned firms such as freescale semiconductor and trw auto parts to lower costs by moving work to low wage countries overseas the same treaties have also made it possible for blackstone to attract more foreign investors like the sovereign wealth funds of china and saudi arabia while opening new investment opportunities for blackstone abroad such as legoland and versace advertisement scharzman and his partners have benefited handsomely from the favorable tax treatment for carried interest and the ability to defer taxes on profitable investments that are exchanged for new ones and under the new law their taxes will be lower and returns higher as a result of the new lower rates for corporations and partnerships the repeal of the estate tax will also leave wealthy families with more money to invest in blackstone funds the point here is not to quarrel with these policy choices although there is much to quarrel with or to suggest that blackstone has benefited more than other firms although that is probably the case rather it is to illustrate that the amount that schwarzman or anyone else earns in any year in the marketplace is determined in no small part by rules and norms that govern market competition those rules and norms were not set in place by some all knowing invisible hand they were politically and socially determined that is why wars have been fought over them legislative battles have been waged over them and elections have been won and lost because of them and it is why blackstone and other companies spend lavishly on lobbying and electing friendly politicians who are in a position to shape them advertisement under different sets of rules and norms the market might have valued schwarzman s economic contribution last year at a measly 393 million half of what he did receive but surely still enough to persuade him to contribute his excellence markets in other words are social constructs and the idea that they generate a distribution of income based on a purely objective measure of individual economic contribution is a fiction nothing more than free market ideology when it comes to the distribution of income there is no pure market any distribution is by its nature political reflecting changing social norms and the distribution of political power to point this out is not to suggest that i know of a more objective system for determining how income should distributed rather it is to suggest that if we as a society decide that we find the current distribution of income unacceptable if it offends our moral intuitions that a single financier earns as much in a year as 15 000 elementary school teachers then it violates no great moral or economic principle to alter that distribution advertisement one way to make the distribution of income more equal would be to change some of the rules and norms that govern market competition another would be to leave the rules and norms in place and alter the distribution after the market has delivered its judgment through more progressive taxation and government spending the first has been called predistribution the second redistribution and there may be good economic and political reasons for favoring one or the other but from a moral viewpoint there is no meaningful distinction between the two both reflect the ways that societies determine the distribution of income based on subjective judgments of what is fair defenders of free markets have long argued that shifting income away from those whom the market judges more talented and more productive would be to deny them their just deserts but as a moral concept just deserts is inadequate and incomplete advertisement for in determining whether any distribution of income is just it is not enough to inquire whether someone has earned his income by playing by the rules we must also look at the distribution of income and ask whether the rules themselves are fair and just

that the fed is open to making changes in the way it shrinks its giant portfolio of bonds which affects rates on long term loans such as mortgages until recently the fed had suggested it planned to raise short term interest rates three times this year and next and powell said the fed s balance sheet was shrinking on auto pilot wall street feared that the fed might be moving too fast in raising borrowing costs said phil orlando chief equity market strategist at federated investors the fed s interest rate and bond portfolio policies were at the top of the list of things we were concerned about which is why the statement powell made today is so supportive of the market orlando said the fed understands that what they attempted to communicate last month was inartful that they didn t get

weak sales at apple and cargill us giants of technology and agriculture may be the clearest sign yet that president donald trump s quest to reset world trade carries costs at home and could isolate the united states as the increasingly fragile engine for global economic growth apple a global technology darling loved for its sleek gadgets on wednesday warned of disappointing quarterly revenues because of poor sales in china on thursday privately held grains trader cargill announced worse than expected results out of china china the world s second largest economy likely expanded at more than 6 percent last year reflecting a slowdown from years past and in recent months its most tepid rate since the depths of the global financial crisis a decade ago the us china trade war threatens a decade old hope among business and economic leaders that rising purchasing power among chinese consumers would support an era of synchronized global growth the sharp slowdown in china and weakness elsewhere also threaten to leave us consumers whose spending accounts for more than two thirds of us economic activity and who so far have been eager to spend in an era of rising household incomes and wages as the chief bulwark against a broader world downturn there is an inconsistency between the us acting as a locomotive for the world and the objective of the trump administration s policy to reduce the trade deficit that s another reason why it will be challenging for the us consumer to act as world locomotive said catherine mann global chief economist at citi and the oecd s former chief economist we are looking at this balance between the strong domestic activity and the weaker external activity in the united states germany and elsewhere she said and also the effectiveness of chinese policy to turn the trajectory of the economy there other drivers of us growth including government and business spending and net exports are all sagging or expected to do so in coming months the us economy the world s biggest is expected to slow from a very robust 2018 but should remain strong until about mid 2020 when economists polled by reuters expect it to settle at 1 8 percent in october the international monetary fund cut its 2019 global growth forecast to 3 7 percent citing the trade war and in december citi trimmed its prediction to 3 1 percent what was hailed just a year ago as an era when the world s major economies would all grow together has evolved in a more volatile direction with the united states juiced along by tax cuts and government spending while the rest of the world sputters businesses amid uncertainty have held back on the sort of investment that could boost long term growth while governments globally struggle with a combination of high debt levels and mounting infrastructure needs market alarms the us federal reserve s interest rate increases have caused investors to move in and out of various markets hitting some emerging markets hard it has also helped spark severe volatility in the us stock market and a months long selloff that analysts said signaled worries over a pending recession apple shares tumbled 9 96 percent on thursday to their lowest level since mid 2017 after the company slashed its sales forecast apple s announcement triggered memories of a technology led market decline in 2000 that preceded a mild recession it s oh so reminiscent said david rosenberg an economist at gluskin sheff associates saying it was further evidence of a deteriorating outlook for chinese manufacturing that will weigh on the global economy on thursday one fed official said further planned rate hikes should be halted until that large assortment of global issues gets resolved i would be an advocate of taking no action in the first couple of quarters this year dallas fed president robert kaplan told bloomberg television in december fed policymakers forecast a median of two more hikes this year us isolation while trump has put a march 1 deadline on striking a trade deal with beijing concerns extend beyond china to europe where a deal for britain s exit from the european union known as brexit has not been agreed with less than three months to go before the march 29 deadline but the impact of china is enormous chinese growth feeds into a variety of global prices such as oil metals and microchips driving investment and spending decisions worldwide evidence is piling up that tension between the world s two largest economies has dampened business confidence and depressed investment it could mark a turn from most of 2018 when many economists and officials said the trump administration s higher trade tariffs had yet to seriously hurt us growth kevin hassett the white house economic adviser said on thursday the sharp drop in chinese economic growth will hit us profits but sales for apple and other firms should rebound once a trade deal is struck the us manufacturing sector has begun to slow and the institute of supply management s survey of corporate purchasing managers on monday showed the largest monthly decline since the depths of the recession in december 2008 a dallas fed quarterly survey of energy firms showed a marked slowdown at the end of 2018 the rest of the world is slowing especially europe and china but the us has enough momentum said mohamed el erian the chief economic adviser of asset manager and insurer allianz the problem is policymakers are not sensitive enough to spill backs and market volatility could feed back into economic weakness by howard schneider and jonathan spicer

welcome to this week s market wrap podcast i m mike gleason coming up we ll hear a truly fascinating interview with keith weiner of monetary metals and the gold standard institute keith tells the story about a large cash sale he had a decade ago how incredibly uncomfortable it made him to have such a big cash position and how it ultimately led him to begin thinking about and pursuing a new gold standard as a solution to our nation s monetary problems he also lays out a compelling case about why the dollar or federal reserve note is deeply immoral don t miss a wonderful interview with keith weiner coming up after this week s market update precious metals markets are off to a strong start in 2019 gold and silver both closed thursday at multi month highs as the stock market reversed sharply to the downside investors were disappointed by manufacturing data showing a slowdown in industrial output they dumped economically sensitive stocks and bid the u s dollar lower on foreign currency exchanges markets now expect the federal reserve to pause its rate hiking campaign and possibly even begin cutting rates later this year the weaker dollar helped boost crude oil and precious metals prices the energy and mining sectors are among the only gainers in the stock market the hui gold miners index closed at a 5 month high on thursday as for gold itself it s down a bit today with spot prices currently coming in at 1 284 per ounce now up a mere 0 1 this week the physical gold market is likely to tighten this year analysts at refinitiv gfms project gold mining output will decrease slightly from approximately 3 282 tonnes in 2018 to 3 266 tonnes in 2019 physical silver could also see pressure from diminished mining capacity and rising investment demand as prices recover and attract more mainstream attention silver shows a gain of 1 9 this week to trade at 15 72 as of this friday morning recording platinum is up 2 6 to 817 an ounce and finally palladium continues to stay hot after putting in a record breaking 2018 it s having a great day so far today and is now up 3 9 in the first week of trading of 2019 to come in at 1 308 well as if investors didn t already have enough to worry about on thursday nancy pelosi was sworn in as the new speaker of the house of course there s nothing new about nancy pelosi or her ideas she has been representing san francisco and its values in congress for over three decades what is new is the growing contingent of avowed socialists within her ranks who are pushing her to endorse medicare for all green jobs for the politically connected and a long list of other giveaways plus the impeachment of donald trump and amnesty for illegal aliens speaker pelosi s first task will be more mundane find a way to get the government reopened she is in the difficult position of trying to negotiate a deal that will be acceptable to her left flank as well as president trump no such deal appears to be forthcoming anytime soon as both sides dig in for a fight for his part president trump graciously reached out to the new speaker and struck an optimistic tone but speaker pelosi doesn t appear willing to give trump anything for his signature issue of a border wall donald trump i just want to start off by congratulating nancy pelosi on being elected speaker of the house it s a very very great achievement and hopefully we re going to work together and we re going to get lots of things done like infrastructure and so much more i know they want to do that very badly so do i so hopefully we re going to have a lot of things that we can get done together and i think it s actually going to work out i think it ll be a little bit different than a lot of people are thinking in the strange political spectacle that is the government shutdown fight neither side actually cares about the 5 billion president trump wants for border security it s not about the money if fiscal responsibility were the issue democrats and republicans wouldn t be talking about a massive bipartisan infrastructure bill the government wouldn t be set to spend 4 4 trillion in the current fiscal year the government wouldn t be set to run a budget deficit of 1 trillion adding or subtracting 5 billion for a wall or a see through fence of the sort that democrats supported under previous administrations changes nothing about the dangerous fiscal trajectory of the country a reckoning is coming maybe not in 2019 but almost certainly by the mid 2020s some kind of funding crisis will hit it will make both sides wish it was artificial political theater like the current shutdown is in a few short years waves of retiring baby boomers will drain medicare and social security the programs will require a massive multi trillion dollar bailout but the government will likely be running routine annual budget deficits of over 1 trillion it will be carrying a growing debt to gdp ratio spiraling toward third world levels that historically trigger default or hyperinflation under our fiat monetary system though a debt default is entirely avoidable that s the good news for politicians the bad news for the rest of us is that when the federal reserve s printing press becomes fully engaged to monetize u s debt the value of the dollar will continue to fall against tangible assets the prices for everything we buy will skyrocket even faster such a scenario may still be a few years away but it is difficult to see how it could ultimately be avoided before the debt crisis turns into a currency crisis precious metals markets will reflect the gathering threats there are already enough threats from a gyrating stock market a dysfunctional political system and an unconstrained monetary system to potentially help make 2019 a big year in the gold and silver markets well now for more on how gold can play a key role in restoring sound money to monetary system and much more let s get right to this week s exclusive interview mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome in keith weiner ceo and founder of monetary metals and president of the gold standard institute usa keith is a hard money advocate who has been an outspoken proponent for the gold standard and restoring sound money to our nation s monetary system keith has a phd from the new austrian school of economics and his articles have appeared in numerous publications on internet sites throughout the globe and it s a real pleasure to have him on with us today keith thanks so much for taking the time and welcome keith weiner hey mike thanks for having me on mike gleason well keith i think a good place to start would be to have you explain a little bit about your efforts to bring about the restoration of a gold standard as a primer give us some background on why you believe it s necessary in returning confidence in the dollar and what kind of change it would bring to our nation s finances which as we both agree is quickly running off the rails so how did you get to the point why are you so passionate about this cause and ultimately why is it needed keith weiner so i was a classic computer nerd at one of the computer science school dropped out because i got bored wanted to build a software company which i did from 1994 2008 sold my software company which is called diamondware to a little company called nortel networks the transaction was august 19th 2008 that happened to be the last acquisition that nortel ever did they immediately right after that began spiraling out of control and entered bankruptcy by january 2009 and then i closed my transaction with a cash deal heading into the fall of 2008 the first it seemed very surreal to me if i was setting in 100 cash profession and too big to file banks watching everything go on sale but then as things continued to go on i began to become more and more alarmed and realized that the standard explanations for this didn t make any sense i dove deeper and deeper into markets and economics just to understand and protect myself the deeper i got in the more i realized how serious the problem was and it clicked for me that i wanted my next venture to be part of the solution and it was obvious even before i started to study economics too much it was obvious that the solution had something to do with gold if it was a normal world my next venture would have been another software company but given the world as it is i wanted to be part of the solution and that was that was gold mike gleason now as many listening may already know we are fellow travelers and with the sound money defense league a money metals public policy project we ve been working on removing the sales and capital gains taxes on gold and silver at the state level among other things you were deeply involved in the success in arizona so you know it can be an uphill battle but success is possible one of our allies in this cause is congressman alex mooney from west virginia now you recently wrote an open letter to congressman mooney about hr5404 the bill he introduced which would define the dollar as a fixed weight of gold in that letter you outlined why defining a dollar in terms of the fixed weight would be akin to price fixing and therefore dangerous but you certainly support sound money so is there a practical way to relink the dollar to gold what would a workable gold standard look like keith or would a different approach be better keith weiner so if you look back to 1792 the first coinage act the dollar was not linked to gold the dollar was a definition of a certain weight of gold or silver and so we ve had a series of evolutions or maybe arguably call them de volutions in the century since 1792 the net result of which is that by 1971 nixon infamously and if you haven t seen by the way there s a youtube of him in his little speech in 1971 infamously severing the last link between a dollar and gold so for the last 47 years the 47th anniversary will be coming up august next month after 47 years the dollar has been a pure irredeemable paper product that has no relationship whatsoever to gold to put this in perspective what that means is when somebody borrows a dollar or somebody lends a dollar there is no expectation that gold has anything to do with the transaction how do you come along and retroactively declare that actually it was a gold transaction we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us and so i think in my letter i m trying to remember what i said and what i didn t say to congressman mooney if you borrow let s say 100 000 and the government comes along and retroactively says now the dollar is linked to gold that means effectively your repaying gold so if the gold price was set low let s say a 100 that means it ll take you 1 000 ounces of gold to get out of debt you ll be working the rest of your life and your sons lives and their sons lives and probably never get out of debt on the other hand if the gold price was 50 000 then would take only two american gold eagles that you hand over to your creditor and you re out of debt and so i think it ll be the biggest worthy lobbying that washington has ever seen with all the creditors and this in counterintuitive all the creditors wanting a very low price of gold meaning that it would take lots and lots of ounces they would be paid lots and lots of ounces for debtor to get out of debt and all the debtors would want a very high price of gold which means it would take very few ounces to get out of debt so i think i said to him i applaud your intentions i applaud where you re trying to go with this obviously but i don t think that s a practical mechanism for getting there mike gleason yeah certainly sounds pretty dangerous just like you described now it seems pretty far fetched frankly to be talking about a return of some sort of gold standard yes congressman mooney introduced a bill but we doubt many of his peers in the mainstream are anywhere near supporting this kind of measure in what context do you think congress might actually pass an honest money bill keith is it going to take a total collapse in the dollar or do you sense there is the makings of a viable political movement here keith weiner all i can say of a total collapse i pray it never happens if you look at 476 ad it was pretty horrific and the recovery took about 1 500 years before the world was back to the level achieved under rome in u s history there s been a number of cases where we ve had a bad or evil institution and americans without necessarily having that crisis had come to realize is wrong and repealed it the first doesn t quite fit my criteria that being the end of slavery obviously there was a war over that but in more recent decades you had end of prohibition and you had the end of jim crow and now we are having i believe were having i think there letting them allow the end of marijuana prohibition and also what s called right to try for terminally ill patients to get access to drugs that haven t been fda approved yet in each of these cases i think it was cato institute published a book called bootleggers and baptists the analogy being the baptists are the moralizers who provide cover for an evil institution lets says prohibition as being a little bit less emotional charged and there was whole temperance movement the idea being if you drink it was sinful and so forth and there s a bootlegger that profiteer off of it and if alcohol is in the free market that s an above margin product like any agricultural commodity it s like bottled water or bottled soda there s not a lot of money to be made on it but if you make it illegal then suddenly alcohol becomes a very expensive commodity and so according to this cato book bootleggers and baptists have this unholy alliance working together to keep something illegal and yet something happened and what happened was the american public finally came to realization that this was wrong that you can t just make alcohol illegal it has all kinds of damaging consequences to doing it the government doesn t have the right to do that and when the questions starts getting made and people start coming on board with the idea that this needs to end then it comes to end and that came to its end and then subsequent to that was jim crow and now marijuana and i think generally same drivers and so could that happen with money i think it could provided people come to that same realization that what we currently have is outrageous it s unfair it s immoral when people come to that realization it will change and probably not a minute before mike gleason expand on that what s immoral about it keith weiner so when they pass a series of laws and we ll broadly call them legal tender laws we are forced to use their debt as if it were money so think about that what we call money is a dollar it says federal reserve note on the dollar bill bill being an old word for credit a note being a word for credit a promissory note we re using their debt as if it were money now fdr did this in 1933 when he made gold illegal to possess as in criminal as in go to prison for possessing gold the way it is for cocaine today when he made it illegal for people to possess gold that forces people to treat the government bond as if that was a conservative risk free asset in fact if you ask any regulated financial professional today what s a risk free asset they ll say the government bond and so it forces everybody to turn to the government and become a lender government as if that was a risk free proposition and of course i think it s probably pretty well known in your audience that the federal reserve right on their website says that their stated policy target is two percent debasement per annum so you re forced to save enough paper and they have a monetary policy of stealing two percent per year so i called it immoral because first of all you have no right to force people to use something and secondly if you do force them to use something you have no further right to then try to rob them at two percent per year mike gleason very good explanation there and it kind of leads me into my next question you spoke about bonds and i wanted to ask you about one of the benefits of gold in your view is the idea of gold bonds please explain this concept for folks who may not be familiar and tell us why you believe that states and individuals both should start adopting the issuance of gold bonds keith weiner so bonds is are the payment of interest on gold and i think sort of the broader answer to everything we ve been talking about today so far my response to congressman mooney would be if you want gold to begin circulating you have to issue a gold bond you have to pay interest on gold interest is the one thing that would pull gold out of private hoards and into circulation people have been hoarding gold for at least 5 000 years they have been hiding it from their governments and from their neighbors i had an interesting experience a couple of years ago i was giving this talk about the gold hoard and how nobody talks about how much gold they have so i was at a club called the phoenix roadrunners they re this group of gold prospectors who literally go up in dem there hills looking for gold i know they find some because at the start of the meeting they gave away like three nuggets one that somebody had contributed to the newsletter one to somebody who was really helpful with the new members and one to a third person for something or other then it was my turn to talk so i said raise your hand if you have some gold any amount of gold raise your hand you know mike not a single hand went up and there was i think 250 300 people in the room including the three people that just got handed gold nuggets not a single hand goes up so i said thanks for proving my point that people have been hiding this from everybody for thousands of years traditionally this was the sort of thing fathers didn t even tell their kids until on their deathbed they would summon their oldest son and say son we have ten ounces of gold under the kitchen floorboards under the stove or whatever they would do because it was so dangerous i mean the government could take it the government could declare you to be a criminal or a traitor your neighbors could come steal it or slit your throat in the middle of the night it was the sort of thing nobody wanted to talk about nobody wants to acknowledge having it and the thing that will pull it out is interest if you say to somebody lend me your gold i ll pay zero then the answer is i don t have any gold if you talk to somebody and said lend me your gold i ll pay you five percent well there was a semi famous incident involving j p morgan around one of the banking panics i believe it was 1907 i haven t found the documentation for that if somebody comes up to you and says mr morgan mr morgan there s a crisis in new york there s a shortage of gold what are we going to do and so he said raise the interest rate four percent he said will draw it off the continent and if you think about it in those days steamships and the costs and risks and time to get gold from europe to new york five percent he said will pull it down off the moon and so what he was doing was first of all illustrating the principle of how interest draws gold into the market and secondly bracketing it and saying four percent of hyperbole five percent is fantasy so in a talk i gave recently and i put this in one of my papers i saw a picture of a gold bond hanging on the wall of the harvard club in new york this was a railroad bond issued in 1905 it had a 92 year maturity and it paid three and a half percent interest obviously gold and so interest is the thing that makes the gold flow for a state government such as nevada and i ve been in a lot of discussions with the nevada government about this there s a completely different proposition and a very practical one actually two number one so the state has a lot of gold mining going on in nevada it s the number one state for gold mining in the u s they produce about 160 tonnes of gold here every year so the state gets i believe its five percent royalty or tax on the gold production so the state has a gold income and that s really the key to the whole thing now the state of course sells the gold or has the miners sell the gold and so the state has the dollar proceeds from the sales of the gold and the state obviously is servicing conventional dollar bonds with this gold income which means the state has a mismatch it has a gold income servicing a dollar bond or dollar liability which means if the price of gold ever goes down the state suddenly has an unexpected budget shortfall a budget deficit so the first proposition to refinancing its paper bonds with gold bonds is it will eliminate the risk of this deficit eliminate the gold price risk that it is currently incurring the second thing that i think is the more interesting one and that is the gold bond provides a mechanism to get out of debt and that mechanism is when the state options off the gold bond my proposal is don t sell it for dollars you re not trying to raise dollars if you want to raise dollars sell regular bonds and don t sell it for gold you re not trying to raise gold gold itself is not really a use to you if you re the state of nevada tell the buyers that they have to bid in existing nevada dollar bonds that is they have to tender go to the market and buy some nevada paper and then tender that redeem that ultimately for the gold bond in exchange so it s a mechanism to redeem one form of debt which is dollars which is irredeemable debt normally and exchange that for the new gold bond which the state can amortize because it has a gold income the mining tax that we just talked about now what this does is it sets up an exchange ratio between paper bonds and gold bonds so let me put some numbers to this and make this pretty straightforward so today that gold price is around 1 250 an ounce let s say the state were to sell 1 000 ounce gold bond that means that bond a thousand ounces is worth 1 25 million dollars so what you d expect to happen in the first option is that buyers say okay you re giving 1 25 million dollars worth of gold we will buy and bring it to you 1 25 million dollars worth of outstanding paper bonds to exchange for the gold bond however we re not talking about gold delivered today this is a bond we re talking about gold or dollars payable in 10 or 20 or 30 years so now you start to think the dollar s being debased at two percent per year that s the fed s target and of course they can over shoot what is that dollar going to be worth in 10 or 20 or 30 years versus what is the gold going to be worth and so what i expect will happen is the market will then offer more than 1 25 million dollars worth of outstanding nevada bonds in exchange for a thousand ounce gold bonds that as the market will retire existing nevada state debt at a discount in order to get the gold bond so that mechanism of retiring the debt at a discount is a huge benefit to the state if the state ends up retiring its debt at a 20 percent discount that s a huge benefit the state couldn t get any other way mike gleason yeah it s very fascinating hopefully something that will actually gain more traction there s some tremendous advantages in all of that as you just explained as we begin to wrap up here keith give us your take on the markets today about whether or not you think we have honest price discovery and where we go from here in the metals keith weiner the broadest thing is no we don t have honest price discovery because the government teaches us their propaganda from the age of two that gold is just a volatile commodity and the dollar is money but in a narrower sense i think anybody who wants to buy physical gold or gold futures can do so and i think there s a market that provides the clearing price for that at any given moment mike gleason well i certainly want to thank you for your time it was a very enjoyable conversation and we definitely support your efforts in pursuing and getting more traction to see sound money restored to our nations monetary system and more and more people will hopefully look at gold and silver as a solution to the global financial problems so keep up the good work and i hope we can speak with you again and follow this as it continues to develop take care keith keith weiner thanks i look forward to it mike mike gleason well that will do it for this week thanks again to keith weiner of monetary metals and the gold standard institute for more information

weak sales at apple and cargill u s giants of technology and agriculture may be the clearest sign yet that president donald trump s quest to reset world trade carries costs at home and could isolate the united states as the increasingly fragile engine for global economic growth apple a global technology darling loved for its sleek gadgets on wednesday warned of disappointing quarterly revenues because of poor sales in china on thursday privately held grains trader cargill announced worse than expected results out of china china the world s second largest economy likely expanded at more than 6 per cent last year reflecting a slowdown from years past and in recent months its most tepid rate since the depths of the global financial crisis a decade ago the u s china trade war threatens a decade old hope among business and economic leaders that rising purchasing power among chinese consumers would support an era of synchronized global growth the sharp slowdown in china and weakness elsewhere also threaten to leave u s consumers whose spending accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity and who so far have been eager to spend in an era of rising household incomes and wages as the chief bulwark against a broader world downturn there is an inconsistency between the u s acting as a locomotive for the world and the objective of the trump administration s policy to reduce the trade deficit that s another reason why it will be challenging for the u s consumer to act as world locomotive said catherine mann global chief economist at citi and the oecd s former chief economist we are looking at this balance between the strong domestic activity and the weaker external activity in the united states germany and elsewhere she said and also the effectiveness of chinese policy to turn the trajectory of the economy there other drivers of u s growth including government and business spending and net exports are all sagging or expected to do so in coming months the u s economy the world s biggest is expected to slow from a very robust 2018 but should remain strong until about mid 2020 when economists polled by reuters expect it to settle at 1 8 per cent in october the international monetary fund cut its 2019 global growth forecast to 3 7 per cent citing the trade war and in december citi trimmed its prediction to 3 1 per cent what was hailed just a year ago as an era when the world s major economies would all grow together has evolved in a more volatile direction with the united states juiced along by tax cuts and government spending while the rest of the world sputters businesses amid uncertainty have held back on the sort of investment that could boost long term growth while governments globally struggle with a combination of high debt levels and mounting infrastructure needs market alarms the u s federal reserve s interest rate increases have caused investors to move in and out of various markets hitting some emerging markets hard it has also helped spark severe volatility in the u s stock market and a months long selloff that analysts said signalled worries over a pending recession apple inc shares tumbled 9 96 per cent on thursday to their lowest level since mid 2017 after the company slashed its sales forecast apple s announcement triggered memories of a technology led market decline in 2000 that preceded a mild recession it s oh so reminiscent said david rosenberg an economist at gluskin sheff associates inc saying it was further evidence of a deteriorating outlook for chinese manufacturing that will weigh on the global economy on thursday one fed official said further planned rate hikes should be halted until that large assortment of global issues gets resolved i would be an advocate of taking no action in the first couple of quarters this year dallas fed president robert kaplan told bloomberg television in december fed policy makers forecast a median of two more hikes this year u s isolation while trump has put a march 1 deadline on striking a trade deal with beijing concerns extend beyond china to europe where a deal for britain s exit from the european union known as brexit has not been agreed with less than three months to go before the march 29 deadline but the impact of china is enormous chinese growth feeds into a variety of global prices such as oil metals and microchips driving investment and spending decisions worldwide evidence is piling up that tension between the world s two largest economies has dampened business confidence and depressed investment it could mark a turn from most of 2018 when many economists and officials said the trump administration s higher trade tariffs had yet to seriously hurt u s growth kevin hassett the white house economic adviser said on thursday the sharp drop in chinese economic growth will hit u s profits but sales for apple and other firms should rebound once a trade deal is struck the u s manufacturing sector has begun to slow and the institute of supply management s survey of corporate purchasing managers on monday showed the largest monthly decline since the depths of the recession in december 2008 a dallas fed quarterly survey of energy firms showed a marked slowdown at the end of 2018 the rest of the world is slowing especially europe and china but the u s has enough momentum said mohamed el erian the chief economic adviser of asset manager and insurer allianz the problem is policy makers are not sensitive enough to spill backs and market volatility could feed back into economic weakness

henock b taddese phd for addis standard addis abeba january 04 2018 in the sweltering heat of a washington dc summer day thousands flocked to catch a glimpse of hear from and on the off chance meet and embrace the new prime minister of ethiopia abiy ahmed this level of stardom is unparalleled in ethiopian politics probably since the time of emperor haile selassie i himself the rest of the cast was no less stellar lemma lemma they chanted after the president of the oromia region lemma megersa the self effacing politician had risen to public endearment when he faced down the so called deep state and its core interests on live tv a year or so ago like it was the most normal thing to do in the historic directly televised joint press conference from the leaders of the four constituent parties of the eprdf lemma seized every opportunity to lay bare and degrade the party s constitutive ideology the manifest lopsidedness of the power divide and all the ills that these had wrought it was a scene to savor viewers were treated to a full on and dare i say perfect display of evasive political lingo and doublespeak as the leaders professed a shared vision for a new dawn in reality one side kept at tearing down the foundations of the deeply entrenched and whole encompassing system whilst the other scrambled to salvage what it could the tables had turned team lemma had finally arrived out of the woods and onto the big stage washington dc was the first stop on a series of diaspora outreach campaigns by the new leadership amidst the euphoria the new pm reiterated his appeal to everyone to join hands and support development efforts back home the one dollar a day slogan he had inducted in parliament some months back was echoed by artist and activist tamagn beyene on stage the response was deafening the emotion gripping you couldn t hope for a better timing nor occasion six months on however the pm cut a frustrated figure as he lamented the disappointingly small number of people who had made contributions on the basis that there are around 3 million ethiopian diaspora we asked for a dollar a day but so far only 2 800 have contributed around 800 000 dollars in all not backed by actions aspirations are no better than a daydream at the time of writing which is only a couple of weeks after this renewed call from the pm the contributions have doubled and continue to rise 1 6 million dollars and counting no the pm has not lost his luster still the whole conception of the ethiopian diaspora trust fund edtf albeit a timely idea is in much need of a revision a reset to be exact to this end a review and critique of the structure of and approaches employed by edtf to date based on two strands of relevant literature the evidence from diaspora engagement efforts elsewhere and perspectives on why and how people give to philanthropic causes is due there is rich evidence in both cases to inform an effective re design of edtf and to shape the wider diaspora engagement agenda the ethiopian diaspora trust fund the set up of edtf constitutes a board of directors to oversee the operations of the fund in country a global advisory council to mobilize global support and advise on strategic directions a secretariat that includes the executive director and key staff to manage the planning for and allocation of funds and implementing agencies who will be recruited based on a proposal submission process these are ultimately accountable to the pm s office so far the global council has been established featuring prominent figures from different walks of life academia business human rights activists professionals notable and personalities among others some critical voices have argued that the membership of the council has been biased towards us residents and the male gender save this the governance set up and approaches of edtf have not drawn much attention at the same time there are some key assumptions that underlie this initiative both explicit and implicit the big one here is the reference to the 3 million strong ethiopian diaspora and the projections made on this crude count next comes the high sense of faith in the euphoric support expressed for the new leadership and its potential to translate into actual support lastly there is a sense of underestimation of the process of setting up and running a philanthropic organization the following statement on the advisory board s frequently asked questions page betrays the latter sentiment will any of the funds be used for administrative purposes no all support services are provided by unpaid volunteers including the ethiopian diaspora trust fund advisory council members contrast this with the enormity of tasks that edtf ventures to embark on the objectives stated on the edtf website actually represent the full gamut of public services normally entrusted to the state and other non state actors the fund aims to finance projects that meet critical needs selected based on their potential to make the highest positive impact on groups and communities in ethiopia in such areas as health education water and sanitation facilities habilitation and rehabilitation of persons with disability agricultural development technology women youth financial inclusion small scale entrepreneurship and other income and employment generating projects the edtf will give priority attention to projects focusing on youth women small holder farmers small enterprises and entrepreneurs who can be agents of inclusive social and economic development diaspora engagement in context in policy parlance diaspora engagement nowadays represents a gaping policy window low and middle income countries lmic are increasingly woke to the huge benefits presented by their diaspora populations the long standing designation of the diaspora by states as an unruly and at times anti peace ensemble is waning once dubbed foreign direct investment in hatred the group is rather increasingly recognized for its untapped resources and capital countries actively court their diaspora as a source of external finance that rivals if not better than other sources of external support such as the much touted official development assistance oda and private capital inflows see here and here in 2018 the world bank estimated annual remittances from lmic diaspora to reach a record 528 billion dollars this is triple the size of oda these countries receive from high income countries in addition remittances are considered more preferable to oda as they involve a more direct link between benefactors and beneficiaries in contrast to the inefficiencies and conditionalities that hamper the oda in other words remittances do away with the multi level structures of middle men associated with oda in turn avoiding myriad possibilities for mismanagement and corruption what s more remittances are considered more stable than other sources such as private capital flows as less prone to speculation capital flights etc the annual flow of remittances to sub saharan african countries stands at around 45 billion a year of which 25 billion goes to nigeria ethiopia s share stands at a paltry 0 8 billion neighboring kenya commands a significantly bigger amount at 2 1 billion forget athletics ethiopia this is the one to contend these figures are of course bound to be underestimations as remittances are also partly carried through informal routes including hawalas and personal transfers which are not captured in these statistics some concerns hang around the degree of productive investment that remittances ultimately enable especially whether they spill over to support the poorest sections of society the poorest are unlikely to have kinship in the diaspora and thereby benefit directly3 in addition the common utilization patterns of remitted resources favor consumption over investments discussed here 1 family support and housing 2 conspicuous spending and 3 productive activities still remittances represent important inflows to local economies and communities by way of boosting spending from recipient families beyond remittances enabling diaspora engagement in development a review commissioned by the department for international development dfid outlines different strategies employed by countries to engage the diaspora in development efforts these include the mobilization and channeling of diaspora resources into direct foreign investment fdi notably in china where half of the fdi comes from the diaspora selling of government bonds backed by state banks the case of the resurgent india bonds or the recent ethiopian renaissance dam bonds the 2 percent annual income tax levied by eritrea on its diaspora government led development projects supported by the diaspora linkapil in the philippines whose website claims to have mobilized over 62 million dollars as of 2017 and the padrino program in mexico that links donors to development projects identified by the president s office matching funds that compliment diaspora contributions mexico s tres por uno that matches every 3 dollars raised from the diaspora by 1 dollar from government coffers taiwan s brain trust model that focuses on attracting human capital to engage in knowledge transfer and so on a few key lessons can be gleaned from this review countries deploy a mix of these different approaches to varying degrees and usually the philanthropic aspects are subsidiary to the business and investment interests for example india chose to prioritize its diaspora mobilization in the order of direct investment portfolio investment and humanitarian or other philanthropic assistance secondly there are clear lessons about the successes of home town associations compared to national level contributions originally from mexico this concept has since been replicated in a number of countries indeed mexico has faced resistance when it sought to move to a national level effort as the prospect of supporting one s own locality continued to hold sway the logic goes people from the same locality are likely to maintain social bonds wherever they have settled making it easy to mobilize their support for their towns of origin in the case of the ethiopian diaspora similar social entities or mahbers bearing the names of the towns and localities of their members exist the kazanchis mahber in washington dc harrar mahber in london etc thirdly the review highlights the success of clearly identified and defined projects over general appeals for contributions the former affords choice to donors regarding the type of projects they may favor as well as allowing them to follow up on and potentially involve in the projects implementation crucially the review outlines the importance of developing a more accurate understanding of the diaspora it argues that the relative make up of each diaspora determines the level and type of engagement and the resultant effects for instance it makes distinctions between the largely professional indian diaspora and the more entrepreneurial chinese counterpart and how these have led to wildly contrasting impacts it would hence be highly instrumental to undertake surveys that assess the scale type and capabilities of the ethiopian diaspora as well as more in depth investigations exploring the desires preferences and sensitivities of the group this could also include a voluntary registration of the diaspora thereby easing communication and mobilization efforts equally important most philanthropic and investment initiatives are couched within broader efforts aimed at reassessing the stake of the diaspora in political social and economic processes as the diaspora are often marginalized in formal decision making processes there is need for some level of correction to facilitate an optimal level of involvement of this vital constituency citizenship and voting rights and means of political representation should all be considered as part of this corrective a number of countries have ensured political representation for their diaspora for instance mexico has designated seats for diaspora representatives in its state legislative bodies for the level of contributions that are expected a taxation without representation type arrangement just won t cut it to be fair pm abiy has already shown ample enthusiasm and support for these policy directions which are to be applauded diaspora engagement should also encompass extending a sense of concern and services to the welfare and advancement of the diaspora these includes improved advocacy and advisory support enhanced responsiveness to alleviate needs under emergency situations as well as regular activities aimed at promoting the home culture and sustaining goodwill amongst the group of particular interest the philippines actively organizes culturally tailored counseling services schools and entertainment activities in areas with high concentrations of filipino migrants china has also gone the extra mile to set up world overseas chinese museums and world overseas chinese cemetery all part of a broad effort aimed at maintaining the vibrancy and sense of belongingness of its diaspora lessons from the world of giving the question of why people choose to give money to this or that cause and why they might tighten or loosen their purse strings have long been the subject of inquiry in various fields including behavioral economics psychology and sociology among others see here and here for example giving is seldom a straight forward matter even when the appeal comes in the form of duty to the motherland why do people skip a long line of homeless and needy people to offer their money to the church as is typical in ethiopia does an act of donation reflect the severity of the state of the beneficiary or rather the state of mind of the donor at that given time are people more compelled to part with their money in the case of a one off donation or a long term commitment such questions form the bread and butter of the sprawling philanthropic sector where methods of solicitation are continuously sharpened deploying new and innovative methods by the day studies of donor behavior dispute everyday assumptions of a rational actor i e the assertion that people give donations based on a logical assessment of need instead multiple variables are known to play on the donor s behavior these range from mere inconveniences related to the timing length of commitment and mechanisms of donation to the donor s social networks the framing of messages is an equally delicate matter emphasize the severity and helplessness too much and you may just overwhelm your donors on the other hand the more you define need in a goal oriented and time bound manner the more likely you are to engage your audience etc what does this all mean to edtf the foregoing scan of evidence from diaspora engagement efforts and the world of philanthropy signals some clear directions to edtf whilst the simple message of 1 dollar a day is catchy and well crafted it needs to be reimagined and fashioned within a broader synthesis of the diaspora agenda it then needs to be articulated in the form of clearer goals and more practical evidence based strategies this of course could only come out of wide ranging research and deliberations around this crucial initiative these will all require worthwhile investments in time budget and effort whilst the volunteer based approach is laudable the aspirations of edtf and the concerns of the wider diaspora engagement agenda are no mean feat it will all require well considered strategic and operational investments these points are not made to criticism the edtf point blank but rather to capitalize on this highly opportune occasion and ensure a more effective and enduring mobilization of the diaspora as stated at the outset the popularity of the pm and the wider leadership team and the sense of public engagement is quite historic this in turn necessitates a thorough and tactical approach at all levels to ultimately enable an outcome befitting the expectations of the times here are some key recommendations consider a time bound reformulation of the 1 dollar a day slogan all the evidence suggests that an endless commitment leads to donor malaise this could possibly be restated as a time bound call for a kind of seed money to launch a whole encompassing strategy for diaspora engagement subsequently develop clear and time bound projects to be put up for diaspora contributions the evidence strongly supports tangible and clearly laid out projects that donors could choose from and potentially involve in augment existing home town associations amongst the diaspora to facilitate their involvement in specific projects in their respective home towns besides the proof of concept that underlies this strategy it would constitute a logical transitionary step for ethiopia as the country emerges from the ethnic based and disparate sense of organization over the last 27 years a town based organization may not seem like a huge leap develop adopt innovative mobilization schemes such as setting up matching funds that entice diaspora support for selected projects the philanthropic initiative for all intents and purposes could only persist as part of a wider diaspora engagement agenda the multifaceted dimensions for political economic and social integration of the diaspora need to be developed and clearly articulated diaspora that has real and significant stake is easier to mobilize than one that merely hangs on to emotional links to the homeland carefully develop the operational plans of edtf the statement that all services will be provided by volunteers and none of the funds will be used for administrative purposes grossly underestimates the complexity of the task at hand effective philanthropy involves painstaking efforts and know how in project design research monitoring evaluation financial vigilance etc last but by no means the least design and commission a series of targeted studies to gauge the size composition and capabilities of the diaspora as well as exploring effective engagement strategies with regard to the latter ascertain the complementarity of edtf to ongoing development efforts from the government donors and civil society as stated at the outset the contributions to the fund have picked up pace following the pm s renewed call still the rate falls short of the heightened expectations with more of a trend of hopeful but agonizingly slow climb the omens point to a flow stutter restart cycle which could and should be avoided in a nutshell there is an urgent need for a well designed and comprehensive strategy that considers the full scope of the evidence and the opportunities abound we ought to make the most of the strong wind in our sail i e the unprecedented change and sense of

weak sales at apple and cargill u s giants of technology and agriculture may be the clearest sign yet that president donald trump s quest to reset world trade carries costs at home and could isolate the united states as the increasingly fragile engine for global economic growth apple a global technology darling loved for its sleek gadgets on wednesday warned of disappointing quarterly revenues because of poor sales in china on thursday privately held grains trader cargill announced worse than expected results out of china china the world s second largest economy likely expanded at more than 6 percent last year reflecting a slowdown from years past and in recent months its most tepid rate since the depths of the global financial crisis a decade ago the u s china trade war threatens a decade old hope among business and economic leaders that rising purchasing power among chinese consumers would support an era of synchronized global growth the sharp slowdown in china and weakness elsewhere also threaten to leave u s consumers whose spending accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity and who so far have been eager to spend in an era of rising household incomes and wages as the chief bulwark against a broader world downturn there is an inconsistency between the u s acting as a locomotive for the world and the objective of the trump administration s policy to reduce the trade deficit that s another reason why it will be challenging for the u s consumer to act as world locomotive said catherine mann global chief economist at citi and the oecd s former chief economist we are looking at this balance between the strong domestic activity and the weaker external activity in the united states germany and elsewhere she said and also the effectiveness of chinese policy to turn the trajectory of the economy there other drivers of u s growth including government and business spending and net exports are all sagging or expected to do so in coming months the u s economy the world s biggest is expected to slow from a very robust 2018 but should remain strong until about mid 2020 when economists polled by reuters expect it to settle at 1 8 percent in october the international monetary fund cut its 2019 global growth forecast to 3 7 percent citing the trade war and in december citi trimmed its prediction to 3 1 percent what was hailed just a year ago as an era when the world s major economies would all grow together has evolved in a more volatile direction with the united states juiced along by tax cuts and government spending while the rest of the world sputters businesses amid uncertainty have held back on the sort of investment that could boost long term growth while governments globally struggle with a combination of high debt levels and mounting infrastructure needs market alarms the u s federal reserve s interest rate increases have caused investors to move in and out of various markets hitting some emerging markets hard it has also helped spark severe volatility in the u s stock market and a months long selloff that analysts said signaled worries over a pending recession apple inc shares tumbled 9 96 percent on thursday to their lowest level since mid 2017 after the company slashed its sales forecast apple s announcement triggered memories of a technology led market decline in 2000 that preceded a mild recession it s oh so reminiscent said david rosenberg an economist at gluskin sheff associates inc saying it was further evidence of a deteriorating outlook for chinese manufacturing that will weigh on the global economy on thursday one fed official said further planned rate hikes should be halted until that large assortment of global issues gets resolved i would be an advocate of taking no action in the first couple of quarters this year dallas fed president robert kaplan told bloomberg television in december fed policymakers forecast a median of two more hikes this year u s isolation while trump has put a march 1 deadline on striking a trade deal with beijing concerns extend beyond china to europe where a deal for britain s exit from the european union known as brexit has not been agreed with less than three months to go before the march 29 deadline but the impact of china is enormous chinese growth feeds into a variety of global prices such as oil metals and microchips driving investment and spending decisions worldwide evidence is piling up that tension between the world s two largest economies has dampened business confidence and depressed investment it could mark a turn from most of 2018 when many economists and officials said the trump administration s higher trade tariffs had yet to seriously hurt u s growth kevin hassett the white house economic adviser said on thursday the sharp drop in chinese economic growth will hit u s profits but sales for apple and other firms should rebound once a trade deal is struck the u s manufacturing sector has begun to slow and the institute of supply management s survey of corporate purchasing managers on monday showed the largest monthly decline since the depths of the recession in december 2008 a dallas fed quarterly survey of energy firms showed a marked slowdown at the end of 2018 the rest of the world is slowing especially europe and china but the u s has enough momentum said mohamed el erian the chief economic adviser of asset manager and insurer allianz the problem is policymakers are not sensitive enough to spill backs and market volatility could feed back into economic weakness

might be moving too fast in raising borrowing costs said phil orlando chief equity market strategist at federated investors the fed s interest rate and bond portfolio policies were at the top of the

adeel malik arab development and economies are running into the ground and oil stands in the way of change what s keeping the middle east from changing for the better the failure of arab development is multifaceted in nature and manifests itself at all levels economic political and geopolitical over the last three decades three profound shifts have marked the landscape of global political economy while these have opened new economic and political possibilities for the developing world the middle east has remained insulated from these winds of change and their transformative impact the first shift is political in nature often dubbed the third wave of democratisation and defined by a gradual opening of the political system to more representative forms of government the second shift represents successful economic diversification in several emerging economies of asia africa and latin america a third trend is represented by the growing prominence of intra regional trade in developing countries through their active participation in regional trade initiatives all of these shifts have bypassed the middle east judged by any of the above metrics the region has either stagnated regressed or severely lagged behind with the largest proportion of autocracies it is one of the few regions in the world that remains an outlier to the third wave of democratisation on the economic front the region continues to be mired in primary commodity dependence while many of its comparators have succeeded in diversifying their export structures and while the middle east has hosted numerous platforms for regional trade promotion mutual arab trade remains hopelessly inadequate over the last four decades for example intra regional trade as a share of total trade has hovered at around nine to 10 percent this stands in sharp contrast to the dramatic growth and significance of regional trade in emerging economies the region s failure in these three overlapping domains reveals the paradox of arab underdevelopment and deserves an explanation that combines the economic political and geo political aspects of development consider the region s failed attempts at economic diversification every resource rich country in the region has faithfully adhered to tall promises of diversifying their economic structure away from an excessive dependence on oil and gas revenues yet if anything the region s overall reliance on hydrocarbons has increased over time what explains this gap between intentions and outcomes to understand this one must first acknowledge that the core challenge of economic diversification is not technical but political clearly the challenge of diversification is deeper than simply learning the right lessons from successful experiences in norway malaysia or botswana after all if the recipes for diversification are so widely known why have arab countries not seriously pursued them to diversify their economies resource rich countries need to develop the non oil sector which entails among other things producing a greater number and variety of goods including those at the higher end of the value chain that involve more complex forms of production the problem is that the effects of doing so are rarely politically neutral political scientists have long recognised that structural change in the economy is usually accompanied by new forms of political contestation new sources of income breed new constituencies since economic power can easily translate into political power for this one needs to look no further than turkey whose recent political transition is undergirded by fundamental economic changes on the ground the appeal of turkey s justice and development party akp is based not just on its populist narrative but the material interests of a constituency empowered by turkey s vibrant economy in the arab milieu where the overriding concern of rulers is to separate the economy from polity a concerted drive towards economic diversification carries genuine political risks with a prolonged legacy of centralised rule dating back to the mamluk era arab regimes rest on two pillars patronage and control such a political order runs counter to the logic of a dynamic economy that requires cultivating dense economic linkages among various parts of the supply chain there is a clear danger that such vibrant linkages in the economy can serve as the basis for horizontal cooperation in this context it is hardly surprising that resource rich arab economies have consistently failed to rise up to the challenge of diversification these economies are doubly deprived in this regard suffering both from the burden of history and oil whatever weak constituency of private production was inherited by these countries was further emaciated after the discovery of oil even where rulers were more dependent on merchants prior to the discovery of oil such as kuwait oil tied down the merchant class in state contracts and other forms of patronage while the private sector has shown greater dynamism in gulf countries it still remains structurally dependent on the state diversification is further hindered by macroeconomic challenges that oil rich economies face by virtue of their exposure to commodity price cycles the pro cyclicality of fiscal policy which is a universal feature of arab resource rich economies means that oil cycles are accompanied by budgetary cycles that make planning for long term investment more difficult counter cyclical fiscal policies which require that countries spend less in periods of higher oil prices are politically difficult to implement the underlying political settlement in these countries gives rise to extensive and sticky distributive claims in the form of salaries subsidies and defence spending as is widely recognised resource rich economies also find it particularly difficult to build a productive regime for competitive diversification since the dominance of the oil sector is likely to lead to exchange rate appreciation which prices their non oil exports out of global markets but the absence of a competitive exchange rate regime is not just the consequence of a dominant oil sector an overvalued exchange is also favoured by lobbies representing the non tradeable sector which are strong and pervasive throughout the region historically economic exchange in the middle east has stayed in the hands of importers and distributors who depend on simple arbitrage opportunities and prefer a fixed and overvalued exchange rate this adverse politics of diversification is difficult to bypass in the midst of multiple development traps while the region s resource rich economies are exposed to global price shocks there are few institutional shock absorbers to mitigate the effect of such events herein lies the problem for oil rich countries the same factors that are needed to cope with oil price volatility are also needed for diversification this does not mean that diversification is impossible to achieve in these economies it is simply that diversification attempts are selective and often take forms that are politically more acceptable to local elites in the uae bahrain oman and parts of north africa liberalisation of the financial sector has provided such a politically safe avenue for diversification financial sector liberalisation has offered lucrative brokerage opportunities for state elites who through carefully brokered partnership opportunities with foreign banks have derived additional rents two additional factors make financial liberalisation a politically palatable form of diversification first the bulk of private sector credit extended by the financial sector is earmarked for real estate projects second land is principally owned by the state together this means that even when the financial sector enhances its lending to the private sector it is unlikely to give rise to independent forms of accumulation that might threaten the political order but the political challenges of diversification are by no means limited to the region s oil exporting nations even resource scarce countries are afflicted with similar constraints at varying levels of intensity consider morocco and tunisia the two countries that have had some success in developing the private sector although export structures in both countries are less concentrated than their other mena counterparts exports have expanded mostly along the intensive rather than extensive margin effectively this means that these countries have mostly relied on existing export relationships rather than establishing new products and trading partners additionally in tunisia policy regimes have traditionally segmented the offshore sector which is mainly export oriented from the onshore sector oriented towards the domestic markets furthermore economic activity remains confined to a closed circle that protects its privilege by virtue of its proximity to state elites such systematic undermining of market competition serves a larger political purpose since it provides much needed rents in countries where oil rents are either absent or scarce but where rents are nevertheless needed to solidify elite coalitions but while these market generated rents support the prevailing authoritarian order the resulting crony capitalism undermines productive capacity it militates genuine economic diversification which requires a level playing field that reduces barriers to entry and mobility this pattern of economic control is shared by other states in the region including lebanon where concessions to monopolies have long been used as a principal means of distributing privilege when pressed for reform mena countries have been reluctant to take the leap resulting in the partial reform syndrome where trade liberalisation is selectively pursued to protect elite interests in egypt for example average tariffs have fallen since the mid 1990s but their dispersion has increased at the same time this is because despite the general reduction in tariff barriers sectors dominated by connected actors continue to benefit from relatively higher protectionism thus a sector is more likely to benefit from higher trade protection if a political or army crony is active in the sector similar patterns are revealed through an analysis of non tariff barriers in tunisia the greater presence of political cronies in a sector increases the likelihood of that sector bring protected through non tariff measures which are more discretionary and non transparent in spite of the plethora of excuses used to justify flagging economies if middle eastern countries have difficulty diversifying their economies despite their tall promises and grandiose plans it is probably more to do with politics than the mere absence of good policy informed strategy or weak implementation

the uncertainty that weighed on u s businesses in 2018 is unlikely to wane this year if anything it may grow worse as corporate america faces greater scrutiny from empowered congressional democrats while contending with trump administration trade policies that have disrupted supply chains and curbed profit the white house s double digit tariffs on nearly half of u s imports from china levies on steel and aluminum shipments and uncertainty over the future of a key agreement between the u s mexico and china are all dragging on global commerce and even though manufacturers have already begun replacing chinese supplies with purchases from countries like vietnam south korea and mexico their expenses may still climb according to randy frederick vice president of trading at charles schwab co as most of these countries have higher labor costs than china those higher input costs must be absorbed by a combination of higher prices to the end consumer or lower profit margins in most cases both

effect of those cuts wanes and with democrats regaining control of the house of representatives drugmakers big banks tech giants and other sectors are bracing for not only more oversight but the risk of sweeping legislation that could crimp profits big pharma drug companies appear unfazed so far by the trump administration s attempts to lower treatment costs but the stakes will rise in 2019 with democrats in control of the house and several sweeping proposals from the administration poised to advance among other things democrats are seeking to target the patents that allow brand name drugmakers to profit from blockbuster medications for a decade or longer it s a fiercely protected part of the industry ecosystem however and alterations are unlikely to get the republican buy in necessary for passage most far reaching is a bill from sen elizabeth warren the massachusetts democrat who recently formed an exploratory committee for a 2020 presidential run that would effectively turn the federal government into a generic drug manufacturer no private manufacturer will ever be able to compete with a product that is essentially subsidized in its entirety by the federal government one drug lobbyist said what an expensive administratively complex and utterly impractical solution in addition to fending off unwanted policy shifts on capitol hill the industry will also be fighting a proposal from the trump administration to tie reimbursement rates for the sector s most lucrative medications to international pricing opponents argue such a system embraces socialist ideals given that several countries impose price controls to keep treatment costs down big tech in one of the most consequential years for social media firms in the past decade 2018 set the stage for new regulations that may force the industry to reconsider how companies gather utilize and protect user data in the aftermath of facebook s cambridge analytica scandal in which a consultant linked to trump s 2016 campaign improperly gained access to personal data of some 87 million users congress set its sights on consumer privacy protection and companies like twitter and apple were caught in its crosshairs too crafting such a measure however has been an historically difficult task and with a diverse coalition of stakeholders many that have conflicting desires the effort is expected to be one that fuels significant lobbying this year big banks large u s financial institutions just completed one of their best years ever as the gop led tax law fueled record profits and many will benefit from rising interest rates which they pass on more quickly to borrowers than depositors the latest increase in december also heightened volatility in financial markets which may benefit the trading desks of wall street firms there are pitfalls ahead however rates that remain relatively low overall may spur banks to extend riskier loans in order to grow stoking fears that lenders will be caught flat footed in the event of an economic downturn their leaders may have to address such concerns under the lights of a congressional hearing room house democrats led by financial services committee chairwoman maxine waters of california are expected to conduct more stringent oversight of the industry in 2019 than their gop colleagues did while holding the majority wells fargo the third largest u

hong kong afp there was no respite for asian investors on friday jan 4 as most regional markets suffered more losses with tokyo tanking three per cent and technology firms taking another hiding after apple s shock revenue warning the new year has proved so far to be anything but happy on trading floors as dealers face a confluence of issues including the china us trade war china s stuttering economy the us government shutdown and brexit apple has been the source of angst this week after it slashed its revenue forecasts blaming weak chinese demand for its iphones and citing the tariffs spat between washington and beijing the us tech titan plunged 10 per cent wednesday wiping us 75 billion off its value in response to the announcement and analysts said the fact such a usually safe firm was feeling the pinch was a sign of deeper problems in the global economy technology firms particularly those linked to apple were among the worst hit in asia on friday in tokyo which was returning from a four day break supplier kyocera fell 3 3 per cent japan display was 1 4 per cent off and sharp dived 4 2 per cent while alps alpine shed 5 8 per cent sony was also more than four per cent lower there were also hefty losses for aac technologies in hong kong and foxconn in taipei which had already been badly hit thursday belief in global corporate earnings is fading against the backdrop of the us china trade friction nobuhiko kuramochi head of investment information at mizuho securities in tokyo told bloomberg news deteriorating apple earnings will lead to volume cuts for suppliers while it could also mean cost cutting pressures tokyo s nikkei 225 index ended the morning down 3 0 per cent shanghai shed 0 2 per cent and sydney was one per cent lower while seoul dropped 0 1 per cent and taipei sank 1 3 per cent there were also losses in wellington and jakarta however hong kong added 0 1 per cent and singapore edged up 0 3 per cent china us eye talks the losses follow sharp falls on wall street where the tech rich nasdaq lost three per cent and the dow 2 8 per cent with the us government shutdown showing no sign of ending while investors were also jolted by weak manufacturing data investors will be keeping tabs on developments in the china us trade standoff with the two sides less than two months short of a deadline to hammer out a deal before washington jacks up tariffs on a slew of chinese goods beijing said friday that a us delegation would visit china at the start of next week for the first face to face talks since donald trump and his chinese counterpart xi jinping agreed a ceasefire word of the meeting follows small signs of progress and the absence of new threats from trump while the two sides work to ease trade tensions by march 1 however there remains little hope the world s top two economies will be able to bring an end any time soon to their debilitating spat which hammered global markets for most of 2018 most immediately attention is on the release later in the day of key us jobs data for december which will give another snapshot of the economy with a strong reading likely to put pressure on the federal reserve to press on with its interest rate hikes the prospect of borrowing costs getting more expensive was another factor helping drive down equities last year on currency markets the us dollar edged back against the yen after thursday s flash crash but the greenback was down against most other high yielding and emerging market units including the south korean won south african rand and indonesian rupiah it was also down against the australian dollar a day after hitting a 10 year high
new york global stocks soared friday and reversed the big losses they suffered just a day earlier the dow jones industrial average rallied 746 points in the latest twist in a wild three months for markets hopes for progress in the u s china trade dispute a strong report on the u s jobs market and encouraging comments from the head of the u s central bank about its interest rate policy all combined to cheer investors china s commerce ministry said trade talks will be held monday and tuesday in beijing and investors will again look for signs the world s largest economic powers are resolving their dispute the tensions have dragged on for nearly a year slowing business and dragging down stock indexes worldwide meanwhile the labor department said u s employers added 312 000 jobs last month a far stronger result than experts had anticipated u s stocks have tumbled since october as investors worried that the economy might slow down dramatically because of challenges including the trade dispute and rising interest rates
a stronger than expected government report on the nation s employment situation provided investors with some good news to cap a dismal week that saw worries about global economic growth ratchet up total nonfarm payrolls in december surged 312 000 well above the 180 000 jobs economists in a briefing com consensus had been expecting november s number was revised upward from 155 000 to 176 000 the report showed that average hourly earnings on a monthly basis rose more than expected that figure came in at 0 4 instead of the 0 3 gain that had been expected over the past year average hourly earnings are up 3 2 treasury rates rose after the announcement reversing much of yesterday s fall in yields also significant is an uptick in the labor participation rate to 63 1 up from 62 9 perhaps indicating a rise in employment opportunities for previously discouraged workers jobs report comes on top of positive sentiment but overall the stock market maintained most of its gains immediately following the report trading before the jobs number saw equity index futures on the rebound after stocks tanked the day before apple inc aapl shares which had helped drag down the market yesterday were bouncing along with other tech stocks shares of netflix inc nflx and intel corporation intc were helping with the positive momentum as they rose following bullish analyst notes even yesterday s beaten down airline stocks seemed ready to rally delta airlines dal shares fell nearly 9 yesterday after reporting lower than expected revenue growth during the holiday season in response united continental ual and american airlines group aal slid 5 and 7 5 respectively all three airlines were up about 1 in premarket trade today still based on dal s results consider watching whether airline stocks will hit more turbulence as lower fuel prices could create expectations for cheaper flights which could pressure profits on the trade front news that china and the united states have scheduled trade talks in beijing for jan 7 8 was arguably also a positive for stocks with apple blaming deteriorating conditions in china for its surprise downward revenue revision and a top trump economic adviser telling cnn that other u s companies could take a hit until a deal is struck with china investors may be thinking that pressure is ratcheting up on leaders to resolve their trade differences worries over china s economy have helped drive stock market volatility of late as the trade war between the world s two largest economies drags on this week investors have seen solid evidence of problems in the chinese economy with disappointing manufacturing data and apple s lower guidance as goes apple everything that has mass in the universe has a gravitational pull the bigger the object the bigger the pull that s why newton s apple fell toward the earth while it wasn t gravity that pulled apple down on thursday its fall was still precipitous the iphone maker s shares dropped nearly 10 and helped pull down other companies in its orbit tech companies were the hardest hit with that sector the biggest loser in the s p 500 spx the declines came after aapl said its revenue for the holiday quarter ended dec 29 would be significantly lower than expected amid lower iphone sales in china as the trade war continues aapl and other tech companies are heavily tied to the world s second largest economy both for sales of their end products and for the supply chains that help make those products aapl specifically cited the ongoing trade tensions between the united states and china which have dogged wall street for months and contributed to the worst year for stocks in a decade in 2018 disappointing manufacturing data but a declining business climate in china the world s second largest economy isn t just a drag on tech companies aapl s announcement underscores an increasing worry among investors that global economic growth could be in for a slowdown the disclosure from aapl came on the heels of disappointing manufacturing data from china and europe a recent index onchina s manufacturing sector showed contraction for the first time in 19 months and recent manufacturing data across the eurozone indicated a broad based slowdown in the region if that weren t enough to spook investors about the global economy a reading on u s manufacturing came in weaker than expected on thursday also helping to push stocks lower the institute for supply management s manufacturing index fell from 59 3 to 54 1 in december while that still showed expansion it was a bigger drop than a briefing com consensus had expected economists there were forecasting the reading to come in at 57 8 that left investors to digest disappointing manufacturing data from three of the world s key economies even as they were handed a big piece of anecdotal evidence of a potential economic slowing in the form of apple s lowered guidance risk appetite muted on thursday meanwhile the u s budget impasse and partial government shutdown continued keeping about 800 000 federal workers away from their jobs it seems likely that the longer those workers remain out of their jobs the less they will spend and the more pessimistic on the economy they will become that s not good news considering recent consumer confidence numbers which fell more than expected with all the unease swirling about investors retreated from stocks and into perceived safe havens both gold and the yen climbed and u s government debt yields fell the 10 year treasury yield dropped farther away from the psychologically important 3 mark one thing to consider watching as trading unfolds today if investors and traders feel confident enough to hold onto riskier positions heading into the weekend that could bode well for bulls on monday but if not then we could see the market give back some of this morning s gains figure 1 apple and the market while correlation doesn t always mean causation apple has often been a market leader both on the upside and on the downside last year a peak for the stock purple line came at roughly the same time as a peak for the s p 500 candlestick chart recently both have been falling sharply data source s p dow jones indices chart source thethinkorswim platform from td ameritrade for illustrative purposes only past performance does not guarantee future results investors increasingly believe in dovish fed as government debt yields slumped amid safe haven bond buying on thursday the 2 year treasury yield briefly fell below the effective fed funds rate of 2 4 recall that the fed has set its target fed funds rate in a range between 2 25 and 2 5 that may mean that investors don t think the central bank will be able to raise rates as much as it has previously telegraphed the latest from the fed suggests that policy makers have been considering two interest rates hikes this year but based on futures activity the market has its own ideas futures are showing about a 6 chance of a cut in the fed funds rate by the march meeting and a greater likelihood of two cuts between now and december than even one hike according to the cme group fedwatch tool it may be worth being cautious with these predictions however as they could be setting up the market for disappointment after all the u s economy is still expanding and the fed might end up being more hawkish than the market wants earnings season coming up with all the doom and gloom swirling about the market it may be easy to forget that 2018 saw some bumper corporate earnings and this upcoming earnings season is expected to also show earnings growth according to s p global market intelligence q4 2018 earnings per share eps growth is expected to come in at 13 7 while full year 2018 eps growth is pegged at 22 5 but as investment research firm cfra reminds us s p 500 companies through q3 2018 had recorded 27 back to back quarters where actual results exceeded end of quarter estimates if that happens this upcoming earnings season investors might have something to cheer about happy job hunting there s another labor related economic report on the horizon in the form of the monthly job openings and labor turnover survey jolts report the labor turnover report focuses on job availability along with hiring and separation trends such as retirement what might matter most for this report is voluntary quits meaning workers who have the confidence to leave a job for what they believe will be a better one keep in mind that the upcoming report is for november so even if people were confident enough to leave their jobs then perhaps in hopes of making more money at a new job as the new year approached that might be reflective of stronger sentiment than what we have now still it could be interesting to see how confident people were in finding a new job even with the tight labor market especially in light of today s monster jobs report information from tda is not intended to

most of us worry we understand logically that we perhaps imagine more issues problems and crises than actually will occur but that doesn t stop us from worrying just the same our concerns generally encompass what we ve seen happen before particularly what has happened more recently we californians for instance weren t so terribly concerned about fires five years ago but having witnessed many devastating fires since then we re now more painfully aware of the risk of living here fires are now something we worry about and try to prepare for accordingly we expect in other words what happened last time or the time just before that but risk is generally not where we anticipate take the citizens of pompeii who weren t worried about mount vesuvius erupting in 79 ad the volcano hadn t erupted in almost 1 900 years and so most if not all of those living at its feet didn t know it had ever erupted at all literate greeks arrived in the area which was inhabited by tribes that had no written language only in the 8th century bc so understandably the pompeiians failed to anticipate the risk that vesuvius would erupt and they paid for that blindness with their lives for the most part we can only worry about what might erupt next if we know the horrors of a previous eruption or conflagration and fortunately we do have historical records and for many of us personal recollections of what happens when companies governments and people take on a lot of debt and so leverage particularly lower quality burgeoning corporate debt is the area we will focus on here because of such memories and history we will consider both the absolute level of leverage as well as the probability that assets and earnings may be insufficient to fully meet current obligations investors attempt to move forward using their rear view mirror for direction giving more weight to what has happened than what might a decade ago the us consumer carried too much debt at the same time us and european banks suffered with too little equity to absorb the losses of poorly underwritten loans the left side of the balance sheet wasn t right and the right didn t have much left overzealous homeowners and speculators aided and abetted by shameless bankers fostered and exacerbated the great financial crisis of 2008 09 at first pacific advisors trades portfolio we avoid using the rear view mirror except when we intend to go in reverse we prefer instead to look forward through our windshield despite it being dusty and cracked we believe that sovereign and us municipal governments and corporates are more the problem now and that their excessive leverage will either catalyze or magnify the next downturn the current debt trajectory in terms of levels and quality of credit is unsustainable and will inevitably end understanding this today will hopefully protect the capital of our investors in the future the average american today appears to be in relatively good financial shape household net worth in the united states is at a new high and debt service payments as a percent of disposable income is at a four decade low as exhibited in the following graphs net worth of us households1 household debt service payments as a percent of disposable personal income2 us households have slightly higher debt than the last recession below left but thanks largely to home price appreciation and as pointed out above their net worth is higher their stronger financial position though has been replaced by the weaker financial position of a more leveraged of corporate america below right while this has left the us consumer with a less onerous financial burden relative to income conservative investment grade bonds have almost the most leverage in at least the last quarter century the other broken pillar in the great financial crisis the big us banks also is in a much better financial position today with more equity to support what we believe are better quality loans the market cap weighted average level of tangible equity to total assets of s p 500 banks is 8 8 up from 5 4 in 2008 while their non performing loans have declined from 5 0 in 2008 to 1 1 as a percent of total loans during a similar period 5 6 this stands in stark contrast to the many european banks that have neither taken necessary loan write downs nor built necessary equity european banks have equity that is still only at 2008 us bank levels 5 4 in 2018 vs 3 7 in 2008 and the percentage of their loans that are non performing is higher 3 7 in 2017 vs 2 8 in 2008 7 8 additionally the average nation now carries more debt than it has historically most significant countries as measured by size of economy sit at or above the 90th percentile of their historic debt to gdp ratio more debt today means higher interest payments and less flexibility in the future to be sure the increase in sovereign debt has aided global economic growth but we believe it is unlikely to continue to boost economies in the same way it has in the recent past sovereigns will have their denouement and in some cases leaders may choose to inflate their way out of the debt strait jacket at the very least many countries may come to resemble the zombie corporations we address further on in this commentary and find their economic growth imperiled by an inability to increase already bloated debt levels and or be forced to pay the higher financing costs that induce recession one does not have to look back any further than the recent travails of greece higher borrowing costs and a deep recession led the market to realize that the country s total debt burden a combination of sovereign debt pensions and so forth was unsustainably high this led to riots political upheaval and of course declines in the price of greek sovereign debt holders of greek bonds other than the european central bank ultimately received mere cents on the dollar high levels of government debt in the us is not a federal issue alone state and local governments are weighed down by huge debt loads and unfunded pension liabilities meredith whitney conducted thoughtful municipal research in 2010 lamenting the sad state of municipal affairs and anticipating widespread municipal bankruptcies 10 when asked why people seemed oblivious to the problem in a 60 minutes interview she responded because they don t pay attention until they have to 11 we appreciated the problem then as we appreciate the current problem but just as before we have no ability to ascertain timing thanks to changing tax policies and the long term nature of off balance sheet liabilities like pension obligations infrastructure spending and the like nevertheless horribly weak balance sheets at the state and local level depicted in the chart below may ultimately become manifest in the form of additional chapter 9 bankruptcy filings at the municipal level as we said the question of timing eludes us again and we appreciate that merely pointing out challenges that might face us due to excessive government leverage is an exercise in incompleteness sometimes though mentioning an issue piques a reader s interest and fosters additional consideration our aptitude squares better with corporate debt and thus corporate debt is the focus of this piece the sum of us corporate bonds outstanding totaled 3 8 trillion in 2008 and has since more than doubled to the current 8 8 trillion 13 this 8 8 annual rate of increase is more than two times gdp growth in that same period the increase has aided corporate mergers and acquisitions m a leveraged buyouts and share repurchases and supported to some immeasurable level the growth in corporate earnings all of which have served as drivers of us stock market returns but we think it s safe to say at this point that there won t be the same continuing demand for corporate debt to provide the same stimulus in the future corporate debt is now at an all time high as a percent of gross domestic product corporate debt cannot continue to grow faster than the economy forever and when it slows the more recent strength in the economy and stock market will lose a significant engine of growth this begs a moment to reflect on the drivers of corporate debt growth banks curtailed lending after the great financial crisis of 2008 09 and rumblings about the fragility of our banking system continue in some quarters today still we believe those are backward looking fears the large us banks have on average better balance sheets than a decade ago meaning more conservative loan portfolios supported by more equity yet stricter underwriting by banks and a reduced willingness to lend created a credit void in the market wall street always happy to create and sell products stepped in to fill the gap with passive and active mutual funds partnerships and various structured vehicles the addition of debt to many of these portfolios allowed for the supply to meet escalating demand it can be a match made in heaven or hell when an enthusiastic seller finds an agreeable buyer and there have been plenty of those who doesn t like almost free money low base interest rates and a narrow spread to a risk free rate has led companies to refinance and add new debt with a much lower hurdle rate which allows for near term accretive activities like m a share repurchases and so forth but the longer term is something else entirely as a company s ability to satisfy its existing debt obligations may eventually be challenged by a recession due to weaker cash flow and more circumspect lenders who require a higher coupon rate to justify the perceived risk and of course the base level of interest rates might not be so low as it has been corporate bonds can be segmented into two broad categories high yield and levered loans and investment grade while high yield bonds and levered loans outstanding grew from 1 3 trillion to almost 2 4 trillion the investment grade debt market almost tripled from 2 5 trillion to 6 4 trillion 16 high yield bonds which are a reasonable proxy for levered loans now offer a prospective return to maturity of just 7 2 17 in our view that s still an unattractive yield for the risk assumed and it s a gross yield before any defaults if one were to consider the yield following some inevitable level of defaults the net yield will be lower we can debate what defaults will be but defaults have not been and most likely never will be zero using historic default rates as a rough proxy for illustrative purposes the net yield on us high yield bonds drops dramatically to just 5 1 it stands to reason that the longest economic expansion in history has bred some degree of complacency among borrowers and lenders and that future defaults may climb above the average before too long us junk bond yields fall in line with investment grade bond yields begging the question why bother the prospective net yield of high yield european bonds is just 1 7 20 far lower than even that of us bonds such unjustifiably low yields are a function of a lower european base interest rate and the european central bank s ecb market manipulating purchase of slightly more than 20 of eligible corporate bonds in the last couple of years 174 billion purchased of 850 billion eligible 21 we call this government managed capitalism the us and eu are not alone other parts of the world also have their fair share of weak corporate credits as pointed out in a 2018 mckinsey report 22 economic cycles will not be subverted despite the best efforts of central bankers and there will again be defaults quite possibly with a lower recovery in bankruptcy with only the magnitude up for argument we strongly feel that the high yield bond market s net yield does not justify the risk and we haven t touched on the rise in leverage yet some might call that prospective yield return free risk continue reading here

what s the big news from the new jobs report the big news is that the jobs market apparently didn t get the memo that the u s economy was barreling toward a recession in fact the jobs numbers came in a lot stronger than expected payrolls were up 312 000 in december compared with expectations for about 180 000 and bringing the full count of jobs added for 2018 up to 2 6 million jobs the strongest year for job gains since 2015 wage growth accelerated slightly and at 3 3 percent before inflation for mid level workers tied an earlier cyclical high weekly hours edged up slightly jobs gains for the prior two months were revised up and 70 percent of private industries added jobs on net a high share for that metric but didn t the unemployment rate go up how is that good news yes unemployment ticked up from 3 7 to 3 9 percent but its increase was mostly the result of more people coming into the labor market looking for work a very good sign at this stage of the economic expansion in fact the share of the adult population either employed or looking for work ticked up two tenths to 63 1 percent its highest level since early 2014 for reasons i ll stress below this serves as a critical reminder that the job market has more capacity to expand than many observers heretofore believed advertisement does this mean that middle and low wage workers are finally getting a piece of the action it does the figure below shows nominal wage growth for mid wage workers as this is a purer measure of the relationship between tighter job markets and wage trends e g bringing inflation into the picture invokes globally set oil prices as you see in 2018 a year in which unemployment averaged less than 4 percent the series accelerates from about 2 5 percent to north of 3 percent of course what matters most is buying power or real inflation adjusted wages here the fact of lower oil prices is boosting paychecks we don t yet know inflation for december by my guess is that real wages will be up 1 3 percent over the year that may not sound like much but it s been a while coming and for full year workers that s almost 600 more bucks great but will it last advertisement this gets back to all the less good economic news we ve been processing last year was a clear bust for financial markets which have been battered about by trump s trade war slower growth abroad lower though still healthy expected corporate earnings and fiscal stimulus slated to fade later this year in this sense the will it last question is asking who s right about the economy the stock market or the job market share this article share my answer is that the job market is right in the near term and it s also the market that s much more important to most middle and low income households the vast majority of whom hold little or no stock they depend on their paychecks not their stock portfolios the stock market is forward looking and is thus more reflective of the expected impact of the headwinds just noted especially slower global growth note for example the huge sell off earlier this week generated by apple s reporting of weak china sales moreover stronger wage growth can squeeze profit margins invoking the notion that what s good for main street is often viewed as bad for wall street advertisement putting it all together i expect the strong job market to dominate the broader economy for the near term say for most of this year the u s economy is 70 percent consumer spending so low unemployment and decent real wage gains in the hands of acquisitive americans should power things forward for the next few quarters even while the stock market periodically freaks out in the background speaking of freaking out you seem to assume the federal reserve will be fine with this job surge what if it slams on the growth brakes by raising interest rates to stave off inflationary pressures i don t think it will do that because inflation both actual and expected has been extremely well behaved even as the job market has gotten a lot hotter than the fed expected think back to the rising unemployment point i made above the one where unemployment rose mostly because of people entering the job market granted this is one month result that shouldn t be overemphasized but it s part of a broader trend wherein the strong job market pulls more people in from the sidelines the reason that s so important to the fed is that it means there s more economic capacity in this case labor supply than the fed or most other economists thought and to its credit the central bank under chairman jerome h powell has been stressing the importance of being data dependent at this point the data strongly point to the conclusion that slamming the growth brakes on the current economy would be a highly
