top policymaking position at the federal reserve the new york times and bloomberg reported in may that shelton is being vetted for the position and she told markets insider she has been contacted by the office of presidential personnel in an interview with markets insider shelton laid out what she would bring to a central bank whose policies she has long been critical of the conservative economist said she thought it would be superficial to answer yes or no to whether the central bank was independent said she wanted a zero percent inflation target and expressed support for the

full interview transcript edited for brevity and clarity below you can click here for articles on the following points from the conversation full interview gina heeb where exactly are you in the run up to the i know you haven t formally been nominated but i have seen reports that you re being vetted and then i ve also seen reports that it s not a sure thing if you could speak to that advertisement judy shelton i really can t speak to it i met with people from the office of presidential personnel and so i assume i m being considered i m also reading that i m being considered what i appreciate is that i think that the whole issue is an interesting one and deserves a lot of attention at a time when the fed itself seems to be asking questions about our models working or are mechanisms delivering the best economic performance potential because it s not that the fed creates economic growth but i think it s an important part of having the conditions out there that make it possible to generate a productive economic growth they re all really important issues i also think because we do live in an economy where international trade is very important the central banks do affect exchange rates i think it s an it s an interesting time even from an intellectual framework point of view to say how do you have something that is coherent how do you integrate domestic and international monetary policy so that you have the appropriate level playing field for free trade i like that because my name is out there people are more interested pro or against but the point is we re talking about these things i m very pleased about that and we ll just have to see what happens if anything goes any further for me advertisement heeb could you tell me a little bit about your relationship with president trump shelton i was actually an adviser to ben carson during the primary just on issues that would come up on the federal reserve but he really wasn t asked enough about it during the debate i wasn t able to really have much of an impact i don t think and then when he went with donald trump i was very happy because one thing i really liked about what donald trump was bringing up as a candidate was the issue of currency manipulation here i am someone who thought that this had been ignored for decades and here was someone at the presidential candidate level who was willing to say that he believed in free trade but that currency manipulation was an unfair trade tactic and i thought finally we re going to address this i think early on maybe it was in july or august of 2016 i wrote something for the wall street journal on trump s contribution to sound money because to me again that s an entr√©e into this whole issue of what is the importance of money and having monetary clarity to transmit price signals if you want to take a free market approach and for me that s all kind of what i would call the sound money thinking that interests me very much at right about that same time i had a note from steven mnuchin saying would you be willing to have your name as part of the trump economic advisory council i was pleased to be part of that group i ve known larry kudlow and respected him very much for a long time i ve known steven moore for a long time likewise their idea of productive economic growth and the necessary aspects of it i m aligned with them to a large extent i was happy they wanted to include me advertisement and then within a month of that i went out to one of the rallies and met trump as he was a candidate and he was traveling with mike pence i sat with him and his wife and attended the rally and met members of the team they were all there that day and then were sending memos back and forth to members of the economic team just with ideas and then i guess a few weeks before the election david malpass who was very much involved with the trump economic team asked if i would serve on the transition team i was thrilled to do that and then when trump won we jumped into action and i was the lead adviser for international affairs at the treasury and that was the landing team that we had during the transition that was a wonderful experience and i guess that was about three months because it actually included preparing papers and studies and recommendations for the incoming treasury secretary and kind of overseeing the area that david malpass was slated to become the undersecretary of international affairs so preparing positions in conjunction with david and then also briefing secretary mnuchin through his confirmation hearing and shortly after that but then i really wasn t looking for a position i loved the experience during transition but i wasn t seeking a position i just kind of said great thank you very much and i was looking forward to seeing things unfold it was several months later it was well into the summer of 2017 that david malpass at treasury asked if i would be interested in serving in this particular position and there s a lot at the european bank for reconstruction and development heeb right well it sounds like you ve had a busy few years and developed close relationships within the administration and with the president would those change if you were nominated to the fed advertisement shelton well how do you mean i mean i guess you don t give up friendships but you mean like would i take orders or something i don t know i think the people who are already there are especially aware of what are the appropriate boundaries and anyone who knows me knows i m pretty consistent in my own person i guess i don t know how else further to answer but i think that when you can work with people and you re like minded but obviously the fed is independent and i know everyone respects that i wouldn t see any conflicts at the same time i don t think that you put up artificial barriers or change your feelings of respect or friendship for people heeb what about larry kudlow i know you mentioned a close relationship with him would you guys discuss monetary policy shelton when i say close friends i ve just known him a really really long time we don t really get together socially or anything and i always took it as a professional task we would write memos he would just say what are your thoughts on this or that issue if it involved more international monetary issues i would write with great seriousness memos but i would say in more of a professional not even arm s length except that i know generally how he might feel about something and he probably knows generally how i feel the only thing he s ever said to me when we talked about whether i could throw my hat in the ring for this was i said something that while working in my current position i had really refrained from commenting i had been writing op eds i used to write more often for the wall street journal about exchange rate issues or monetary issues but i felt like since the treasury i didn t work for treasury but it involved a relationship with treasury i didn t know what was appropriate to say i don t really like feeling like i can t write things because i don t want to violate i think treasury respects the fed and vice versa advertisement and he said well one thing you would be free to say what you want if you were in line for the fed and i remember saying really don t governors have to be careful what they say in speeches and such and he says not that i know of he said i think people write what they think and i thought well that sounds liberating actually but i have no sense that i have any special in or i don t know if i m even on a short list to tell you the truth i just think he was talking generally that i agree to say what i think so that s always very appealing heeb do you worry that expressing support for fiscal policies could make people skeptical of the central bank s independence shelton i haven t really thought about that because i wouldn t be responding to i don t know why the fed is i don t know i haven t really thought about it i saw people trying to make something of if somebody wanted to meet for coffee and talk with me for me the easiest most convenient place was at the trump hotel and i saw people say oh oh she s trying to promote that i thought no it s a block or two from treasury and they leave you alone and you can have a cup of coffee and sit there and no one bothers you and there s not loud music that drives you out so anyway i don t know heeb i just came across a photo of you the other day at trump hotel i was going to ask if you frequent there advertisement shelton when i come into dc if i m in the us i basically live on an old farm a very old property and it s almost two hours away by train so for me it s easy to then get into dc and i don t have an office there i can t bring reporters into the treasury my office is back in london and so i have to meet at some hotel or coffee shop and that one happens to be very convenient because i m usually going to treasury or state or nsc or the visits that are involved with my work at ebrd after i met with james politi in london he said can i take your photo i thought well okay and then i saw people say oh she s promoting that i don t see any conflict whatsoever isn t it regular and maybe you know better than i do isn t it regular practice for the treasury secretary to meet with people at the fed to meet with chairman powell i believe so heeb that s definitely normal they usually issue a readout and as long as everything s transparent it s normal i m more so asking about these close relationships as opposed to a formal meeting because you already have these friendships within the administration shelton when i say close i don t know what people are thinking i mean i don t go out and play golf with anyone i don t i m kind of a hermit i m not very socially active i don t mean close i don t even mean picking up the phone or even emailing i don t even do that now really that was really during the campaign and just on maybe three or four issues related to the economic agendas going forward what do we think about this or what do we think about that just things that were circulated on the team it s just that i ve known larry kudlow since i think early 90 s i would say it s more of a long term respect for him as a person i just think he s great but we re not what i would call social friends only because i m not socially as i say we live on a farm and i m kind of a hermit advertisement heeb to sum it up you wouldn t allow these relationships close or not to influence your decisions as a fed board member shelton no heeb do you think that central bank independence in general has been challenged by the president he repeatedly comments on the job the fed is doing he pressures them to lower interest rates and even reportedly wanted to fire chairman jay powell shelton i would say that that s one of those things where people say oh the the independence of the federal reserve if you get on the federal reserve website it is an agency of the us government right away then you say okay but they re very independent i think some of the practices are i m not saying what i believe necessarily i m just saying let s look at the reality of sort of the sacrosanct idea that they re so independent advertisement the federal reserve purchases the debt issued by the government issued by another agency of government the treasury then the federal reserve as another independent federal agency of government purchases that debt collects the interest off that debt pays for its own and at one time was purchasing 60 percent of the debt being issued by the treasury during the crisis years then it takes the interest off that portfolio that the treasury is paying to the holder of the debt another agency of government and lives off that i mean takes its own administrative expenses out of that amount the interest on the government debt it s holding then it remits the rest of that back to the treasury and we call that revenues to the federal budget now that i think is a bit fiscally incestuous then i think okay so not so independent in a way and as you just mentioned to me it s not unusual at all for treasury officials to meet with the head of the fed i think it s healthier to be transparent i would rather have a president who says what he thinks about the policies out loud for everyone to hear instead of these little subtle meetings we re now learning about historically as to whether nixon said this or that to arthur burns or intimidated or put pressure on in these supposed behind the scenes attempts to intimidate i think paul volcker has referred to words from secretary baker i don t know that those took place but i can well imagine and i would much rather have someone if the goal is to be transparent then instead of people sort of doing the signaling that oh how dare they why not just be open about it and i think it s even sillier people who then say oh now the fed wanted to lower rates but now they can t because it will look like the president intimidated them i mean that was kindergarten to talk about these things i think everybody s professional and everyone should feel free to talk about things i don t think they re intimidated by what is said at the presidential level i think we should be happy that someone is savvy enough about the role of interest rates and the role of the federal reserve to have an opinion heeb so you re saying that the fed is not currently a completely independent institution am i getting that right advertisement shelton i m just saying that people are human and they absorb tons of information and i presume we choose people who are capable of executing their best independent judgment in the interest of the responsibility to which they have pledged their fealty and their capabilities to uphold i m not appalled at the notion that the president can have an opinion about financial markets or about monetary policy i think that the chairman of the fed is fully capable of handling it of taking into consideration whatever advice he deems appropriate from whatever sources he deems appropriate and he is his own person and intellectually secure and will do what he thinks is the best thing to do i think people harumph a lot about this without saying everyone s doing their best job let s give them credit heeb do you think the fed is currently a completely independent institution shelton i think i ve answered that heeb what was your answer sorry it wasn t clear to me advertisement shelton is the fed a completely independent institution i mean isn t that what you just asked me a moment ago heeb i wasn t clear on whether your answer was yes or no shelton well i think it would be a little bit superficial to say yes or no the fed itself calls itself an agency of government an independent agency but as i think i just walked you through the fed purchases the debt issued by treasury and takes the interest from that and then remits that back to the treasury as revenues to the federal budget i think at one point when it was really over a hundred billion that it was remitting under bernanke he even said with some pride that we are one of the larger revenue centers for the federal budget and i think they were about the sixth largest contributor to the federal budget that year so not independent fiscally just looking at the financial income statement for a consolidated government heeb but is it independent from political influences that s more so what i m asking advertisement shelton well i think that the federal reserve has to be aware of economic slash political developments at any given moment because there s a lot of interaction there and i think the fed has to take prudent consideration of what is happening politically and economically and i hope they don t have blinders on heeb but i mean for political motives or shelton hey gina i m assuming that you re just being a straight shooter with me as i m trying to be with you so if there s another answer you re looking for heeb no just a yes or no would be fine advertisement shelton well okay anything else heeb i was just seeing if you d be able to answer it in a yes or a no shelton well i really think i ve overkilled on that i see we ve almost done 30 minutes so give me your next legitimate question heeb i think that was a legitimate question so i m just going to say you didn t want to answer yes or no on that advertisement shelton wow well okay i m sorry i don t know why i thought this would be a good conversation could you give my answer which i think was more that it would be superficial to try to say yes or no to is the fed an independent agency and then sort of give my enlarged answer in terms of the intermingling with the relationship between treasury and the fed heeb i think we re saying the same thing in a different way you re saying you think it would be superficial to say yes or no and i was just saying that you weren t saying yes or no shelton that s a hot button issue it s the kind where people will say oh she doesn t believe in the independence of the federal reserve so then it will take a longer answer whereas i suppose it s easy to say no it s 100 percent independent and they should never even talk to each other that it should be more strict and i don t think they should be allowed to read newspapers you could say that but i don t think that s realistic i would say my most true answer in my opinion is that you choose professional people they rise to the position and they have integrity and they don t wear blinders but they always choose what they think is the best way to fulfill their responsibilities and i just think you give responsible people the benefit of the doubt that they are not unduly influenced that the primary goal of their service is to conduct it responsibly i don t think people are intimidated or they wouldn t be in that position advertisement heeb okay well we can move on here i recently read that you were against the fed s dual mandate there have been growing debates about how inflation should be measured even at these conferences in chicago this week what do you think the fed s mandate should be and what yardsticks should be used for measurement shelton on the dual mandate it s another one of those concepts that has taken on sacrosanct importance i wonder how much people really go back and read that legislation the humphrey hawkins legislation from 42 years ago and that was a time when i think there was a certain amount of hubris those are the phillips curve days the idea that government could fine tune economic performance and could chart it there was an overemphasis on econometrics in the quantitative approach to running the economy and controlling it that you had this perfect trade off between unemployment and inflation the mandate just said maximizing employment okay so i don t know if that s the fed s job or how you then define it we re certainly at minimal unemployment right now a 50 year low or 49 year low stable prices stable usually means no movement if that is the sacrosanct mandate then we get back into really interesting if you go back and look at the transcripts when janet yellen and alan greenspan were talking about why 2 percent versus 0 percent what is stable i mean if it s a value of a house and you have 2 percent inflation for 10 years 20 years that means the price changes what 20 to 40 percent during your ownership of your house is that still relevant is 2 percent right is it good to sort of incentivize people i think that was the argument that yellen made again the transcripts i really recommend they re fascinating to read because she convinced alan greenspan and he was probably more a zero change in prices guy a zero delta guy and she made a good case basically to say workers want to see a nominal increase in their wages it s very keynesian that ultimately money illusion even though you re not any wealthier if all prices go up two percent there s still an incentive if there are sticky wages downward nobody wants to have flat income or negative so you build in this little cushion that makes it look like you re getting ahead that s more economics as a social science and i think she got a lot of that from her husband it s very well known in that field so those are interesting arguments but to just say the fed s mandate is stable prices and not comment about why the 2 percent or some people are four percent or even six percent to give the fed more room to maneuver those are interesting questions not answered by that quote dual mandate advertisement and then to me it s actually a triple mandate that people seem to forget the third element is in the same sentence it was the maximum employment price stability and moderate long term interest rates what happened to that we have the 10 year now lower than the 3 month what happened to moderate long term interest rates that disappeared when the fed became much more activist following 2008 i don t understand why people call it the dual mandate and then they don t bring up that it was actually three things you could say from a saver s point of view that not being compensated for retirement when you re as trump used to say during the campaign people who have done all the right things to put money in savings accounts are getting creamed that was his word but i thought he was absolutely right about that maybe low rates are good for developers but they sure don t give adequate compensation to people who are saving to put away for retirement in a responsible way i wish the fed would have been more concerned about the third and for no reason less important aspect of the mandate it was a triple mandate heeb okay i have a few questions if we could just back up a little bit as far as maximum employment you said you don t know if that s the fed s job you would be against that as a congressionally mandated task for the fed shelton well what do they mean by that because what was the fed doing differently when we had high unemployment a few years before and then when the trump administration came in and we got some other things going like reducing the regulatory burden and i think a better environment from a tax point of view for business and entrepreneurship i think people are starting to see potential movement and getting an improved trade reform set of policies in place now we have low unemployment but the fed was the same fed during all of that and if people are saying the fed should maximize employment will you do that by lowering rates or raising rates advertisement i find people start arguing without knowing what they really want the fed to do are negative rates good for employment is that what people mean when they say the fed should maximize employment does that always mean they should lower the interest rate because i think some labor groups had thought that but maybe now they re reconsidering to me the only thing that really matters from a jobs point of view is getting productive economic growth you don t just want the fed to do things that are good for investors who arbitrage differential interest rates or who speculate on currencies you want to see what we re starting to get which is increased productivity which then justifies the increased wages those are things that i think have more to do with other policies that the government can be involved with including infrastructure i don t think the fed can create that i don t think just by raising or lowering interest rates you can you can create productive jobs so i would just leave it at that heeb so the mandate should be productivity growth shelton i do think stable money is very important i think you ll find many central banks that s their only mandate monetary stability you could say that and that s not very controversial advertisement but i just think that there are other factors including people s confidence about economic growth you could look at fed policies now on paying interest on excess reserves does that or does that not disincentivize banks to make loans it s the loans to small businesses or consumer loans or mortgages the kind of community bank loans that i think help to create jobs so the fed is a factor but there it might not be the rate of the interest it s whether banks decide that it s easier to leave the money sitting at the fed and collecting interest for doing nothing or to actively seek risky loans by definition the kind of loans that create more small businesses and lead to more employment i would say i want the fed s actions not to discourage employment just by raising or lowering rates if that s all the fed can do that s why i m looking at mechanisms for how they do it not just whether they re going up or down i think you had written something saying that i m in favor of zero interest rates or near zero i m not commenting i try to go out of my way to say i don t know what the interest rate should be i don t think anyone does i think that s the whole issue of you have a central bank thinking that it s smarter than the free market in terms of what the interest rates should be based on the supply of loanable funds and the demand for loanable funds i m not saying what it should be what i m talking about is a mechanism that rewards banks and pays them 2 35 percent interest for doing nothing i think that is not good for employment heeb would you instead use manipulating the balance sheet as opposed to these it sounds like you want to eliminate the interest rate on excess reserves advertisement shelton that s the primary way that they raise and lower the interest rate that was meant to be an emergency measure at the time everyone including ben bernanke thought that if you inject all this liquidity into the system in the wake of the meltdown in 2008 that that was an assumption that if you increase base money and we have the normal multiplier effect that you re looking at excessive inflation down the road and so bernanke wanted to move up the timetable for paying interest on excess reserves to lock up those reserves because then he said with all these people saying what about inflation down the line if you re going to have all of this quantitative easing he said i can stop inflation in 15 minutes that s because all you would have to do is keep raising it to the level where banks would say why should i make any loans i mean what if i could get 10 percent from the fed the point is that became a way to prevent the inflation that everyone expected when we didn t get the inflation that s when i think the fed should have been saying why is that the dog that s not barking why aren t we seeing an increase in the cpi because the goal of pumping the money in was to make it easy for companies with this low cost of capital to invest in expanded plant and equipment and then to hire people so then that would start helping that was the idea that you would be hiring these people and you d be paying them because now you had expanded production capabilities that their aggregate level of wages gave them increased purchasing power and that would have put pressure on the cpi and you would have seen the inflation so when we didn t see that after so many years i think we should have said it was a reasonable experiment maybe by the fed but where is that money going and maybe it s not doing what we thought instead of buying or investing in expansion maybe companies were buying back their own shares to a larger degree than anyone would have thought and maybe already wealthy investors are getting access to margin accounts at near zero rates where they can invest in the market and maybe governments had the opportunity to borrow big time at low rates and lock in low rates those were the unanticipated consequences where i think then the fed should have said that maybe the model isn t working the way we thought heeb you mentioned that no one knows what the interest rate should be advertisement shelton instead of saying no one knows i m just saying that having studied the soviet economy i think we had the experiment that was showing what works better central planning or market mechanisms and i m saying market mechanisms give you better outcomes in a sense by having a committee of people decide what the interest rate should be that s a closer model to central planning than having the free market find the interest rate that is appropriate for the cost of capital that s what we re pricing in the market the cost of capital and that s the interest rate i m just saying there are people who have funds they could lend and there are people who could use funds because they see productive investment opportunities and normally banks would be the financial intermediaries that charge the interest rate that allows them to connect the source to the use hopefully in the most productive way because they re good at judging risk and return and that s why we have banks heeb i m going back a few questions because i forgot to ask a follow up here you mentioned the two percent inflation target you said some people want four or six percent do you have a target shelton my sense would be genuine price stability is really i mean my ideal would be zero stable prices mean stable heeb so zero percent inflation advertisement shelton well yeah price stability means stability i m not saying the cpi measures everything i m not saying the pce measures everything what would you really want to do is the level of money and credit in an economy is calibrated to stable consistent price signals that are conveyed through time that would be the ideal heeb you said in a financial times interview the fed has a soviet style power over markets as a board member you would get just one vote and the framework would be largely the same as it is now so why do you want to be part of that shelton i don t think i want to answer that i think it would be presumptuous but i think it s good to have fresh thinking and to challenge it s hard to do i mean i will say that within the current structure i don t believe in just pulling the rug out from people and coming in and trying to blow it all up i think consistency and moving toward a better place i would want to be having the conversations asking the fed and i m very pleased to see the fed is already doing this going through self evaluation is the federal reserve functioning in a way that is setting up optimal conditions for productive economic growth i would start by looking just very generally we see around the world i think we re up to 11 trillion in securities that or have a negative interest rate and i think that situation has been largely engineered by central banks i think we have to say what is the role of central banks in a productive economy and are they helping or hurting i think it s legitimate to say are they too dominant or does it turn out that they only serve a small segment of the private sector and what is their interaction with governments and what is their impact on currency those are all the questions we should be talking about at a very basic level i m happy for the new open debate on all of these issues advertisement heeb what do you think of the fed saying it s ready to act if trade conditions worsen a lot of people saw that as a signal that they could lower rates shelton i think the market is a little bit kabuki theater and over responds in both directions to comments the fed doesn t wear blinders and is watching developments economic and political all the time as it should that was kind of just an obvious statement but i think the market grasps at clippings and overreacts for better or worse heeb but what about the actual policy move to make that statement does that signal that tariffs are hurting the american economy or have the potential to shelton what we re going through on all of that has more to do with negotiating toward a better overall trading platform more of a level playing field i see that as necessary and especially with china that had been neglected for too long and i think in the end we ll end up in a good place advertisement heeb what is necessary the tariffs or the fed response shelton i think it s appropriate on trade to use the levers that you have to work with your trade partners especially in these bilateral agreements i think that we needed to confront china and and work out a better relationship that s more equitable with more access to their markets that s just one factor in the economic outlook that the fed takes into consideration heeb are there any conditions that would call for tightening monetary policy shelton i think just the classic ones the fed is now saying that they are willing to overshoot the two percent target because they were undershooting for so long i would think that at some point we would be using if we re doing a path to phase out of paying banks on excess reserves because i think that s going to be challenged that whole practice then the fed still has 3 6 trillion in its portfolio that it can interact but then that s going to these other questions of should the fed be trying to engineer an artificial interest rate i think that s when you cause distortions advertisement heeb you support the gold standard but i haven t seen a lot of details about how it would be implemented shelton first of all whenever you see that please please try to figure out what do people mean when they attribute that to me do they mean a gold standard where we only have 261 million ounces so i don t understand do people really think that i m saying that somehow about 300 or 350 billion or so i d have to calculate it out but not a big chunk is that what they re talking about or are they talking about where during like the classical international standard i mean the government didn t stand ready to convert all they did is look at what thomas jefferson wrote on the establishment of a money unit the united states you just declare what is your measurement what do we call the us dollar he did it as so many grains of silver or so many grains of gold and you just define it bretton woods was something completely different where only a foreign central bank had the right to convert dollars into gold i m not sure what people mean when they attribute that to me or what they think i m suggesting what i said is that it s a good way to look at the virtues of what you want your monetary system to provide in terms of a monetary integrity or price signal clarity or international system of sorts that sovereign countries can voluntarily agree to abide by what do you want and do you have a universal reference or benchmark so that other countries could voluntarily agree to abide by certain rules on currency relationships it doesn t have to be gold gold is the cliche but if someone wants to suggest something different i ve heard people say sand or water or oil i just haven t seen anything better than gold heeb you re not in favor of pegging a currency to the price of gold advertisement shelton when you say pegging what do you mean by that what are you asking me heeb when a currency is defined in terms of shelton i m sure i ve never said that the fed should have a price rule to ratchet up or down interest rates in accordance with the daily price of gold but i m sure that if anything i would have said a price rule i don t think is a good idea i ve never suggested that i m not badmouthing the gold standard i m saying look to see what you like about prior systems that have worked and see if we could develop a future system that would incorporate the virtues of things that worked in the past heeb but you haven t favored a system in which the value of a currency is defined in terms of the price of gold advertisement shelton i m just saying that it s way too easy to toss out the term when the government overspends you could say oh we should just have a gold standard because then you have some discipline because then there s kind of a fiscal price to pay you could lose gold and then that shrinks your money supply and then that puts the brakes on if you re overinflating or whatever you re doing wrong i mean there s lots of aspects to it but you really have to be careful about what you mean to just say oh you favor the gold standard i would just say if you re talking about the classical international gold standard like alan greenspan like robert mundell the nobel prize winner i recognize the virtues of when we had an international voluntary currency system that honored the sovereignty of countries and that was based on their own self discipline and not say like we have problems with the euro because if one country kind of blows it whether it s greece or italy or portugal it doesn t threaten the whole system those are those are things we should be talking about

full interview transcript edited for brevity and clarity below you can click here for articles on the following points from the conversation full interview gina heeb where exactly are you in the run up to the i know you haven t formally been nominated but i have seen reports that you re being vetted and then i ve also seen reports that it s not a sure thing if you could speak to that advertisement judy shelton i really can t speak to it i met with people from the office of presidential personnel and so i assume i m being considered i m also reading that i m being considered what i appreciate is that i think that the whole issue is an interesting one and deserves a lot of attention at a time when the fed itself seems to be asking questions about our models working or are mechanisms delivering the best economic performance potential because it s not that the fed creates economic growth but i think it s an important part of having the conditions out there that make it possible to generate a productive economic growth they re all really important issues i also think because we do live in an economy where international trade is very important the central banks do affect exchange rates i think it s an it s an interesting time even from an intellectual framework point of view to say how do you have something that is coherent how do you integrate domestic and international monetary policy so that you have the appropriate level playing field for free trade i like that because my name is out there people are more interested pro or against but the point is we re talking about these things i m very pleased about that and we ll just have to see what happens if anything goes any further for me advertisement heeb could you tell me a little bit about your relationship with president trump shelton i was actually an adviser to ben carson during the primary just on issues that would come up on the federal reserve but he really wasn t asked enough about it during the debate i wasn t able to really have much of an impact i don t think and then when he went with donald trump i was very happy because one thing i really liked about what donald trump was bringing up as a candidate was the issue of currency manipulation here i am someone who thought that this had been ignored for decades and here was someone at the presidential candidate level who was willing to say that he believed in free trade but that currency manipulation was an unfair trade tactic and i thought finally we re going to address this i think early on maybe it was in july or august of 2016 i wrote something for the wall street journal on trump s contribution to sound money because to me again that s an entr√©e into this whole issue of what is the importance of money and having monetary clarity to transmit price signals if you want to take a free market approach and for me that s all kind of what i would call the sound money thinking that interests me very much at right about that same time i had a note from steven mnuchin saying would you be willing to have your name as part of the trump economic advisory council i was pleased to be part of that group i ve known larry kudlow and respected him very much for a long time i ve known steven moore for a long time likewise their idea of productive economic growth and the necessary aspects of it i m aligned with them to a large extent i was happy they wanted to include me advertisement and then within a month of that i went out to one of the rallies and met trump as he was a candidate and he was traveling with mike pence i sat with him and his wife and attended the rally and met members of the team they were all there that day and then were sending memos back and forth to members of the economic team just with ideas and then i guess a few weeks before the election david malpass who was very much involved with the trump economic team asked if i would serve on the transition team i was thrilled to do that and then when trump won we jumped into action and i was the lead adviser for international affairs at the treasury and that was the landing team that we had during the transition that was a wonderful experience and i guess that was about three months because it actually included preparing papers and studies and recommendations for the incoming treasury secretary and kind of overseeing the area that david malpass was slated to become the undersecretary of international affairs so preparing positions in conjunction with david and then also briefing secretary mnuchin through his confirmation hearing and shortly after that but then i really wasn t looking for a position i loved the experience during transition but i wasn t seeking a position i just kind of said great thank you very much and i was looking forward to seeing things unfold it was several months later it was well into the summer of 2017 that david malpass at treasury asked if i would be interested in serving in this particular position and there s a lot at the european bank for reconstruction and development heeb right well it sounds like you ve had a busy few years and developed close relationships within the administration and with the president would those change if you were nominated to the fed advertisement shelton well how do you mean i mean i guess you don t give up friendships but you mean like would i take orders or something i don t know i think the people who are already there are especially aware of what are the appropriate boundaries and anyone who knows me knows i m pretty consistent in my own person i guess i don t know how else further to answer but i think that when you can work with people and you re like minded but obviously the fed is independent and i know everyone respects that i wouldn t see any conflicts at the same time i don t think that you put up artificial barriers or change your feelings of respect or friendship for people heeb what about larry kudlow i know you mentioned a close relationship with him would you guys discuss monetary policy shelton when i say close friends i ve just known him a really really long time we don t really get together socially or anything and i always took it as a professional task we would write memos he would just say what are your thoughts on this or that issue if it involved more international monetary issues i would write with great seriousness memos but i would say in more of a professional not even arm s length except that i know generally how he might feel about something and he probably knows generally how i feel the only thing he s ever said to me when we talked about whether i could throw my hat in the ring for this was i said something that while working in my current position i had really refrained from commenting i had been writing op eds i used to write more often for the wall street journal about exchange rate issues or monetary issues but i felt like since the treasury i didn t work for treasury but it involved a relationship with treasury i didn t know what was appropriate to say i don t really like feeling like i can t write things because i don t want to violate i think treasury respects the fed and vice versa advertisement and he said well one thing you would be free to say what you want if you were in line for the fed and i remember saying really don t governors have to be careful what they say in speeches and such and he says not that i know of he said i think people write what they think and i thought well that sounds liberating actually but i have no sense that i have any special in or i don t know if i m even on a short list to tell you the truth i just think he was talking generally that i agree to say what i think so that s always very appealing heeb do you worry that expressing support for fiscal policies could make people skeptical of the central bank s independence shelton i haven t really thought about that because i wouldn t be responding to i don t know why the fed is i don t know i haven t really thought about it i saw people trying to make something of if somebody wanted to meet for coffee and talk with me for me the easiest most convenient place was at the trump hotel and i saw people say oh oh she s trying to promote that i thought no it s a block or two from treasury and they leave you alone and you can have a cup of coffee and sit there and no one bothers you and there s not loud music that drives you out so anyway i don t know heeb i just came across a photo of you the other day at trump hotel i was going to ask if you frequent there advertisement shelton when i come into dc if i m in the us i basically live on an old farm a very old property and it s almost two hours away by train so for me it s easy to then get into dc and i don t have an office there i can t bring reporters into the treasury my office is back in london and so i have to meet at some hotel or coffee shop and that one happens to be very convenient because i m usually going to treasury or state or nsc or the visits that are involved with my work at ebrd after i met with james politi in london he said can i take your photo i thought well okay and then i saw people say oh she s promoting that i don t see any conflict whatsoever isn t it regular and maybe you know better than i do isn t it regular practice for the treasury secretary to meet with people at the fed to meet with chairman powell i believe so heeb that s definitely normal they usually issue a readout and as long as everything s transparent it s normal i m more so asking about these close relationships as opposed to a formal meeting because you already have these friendships within the administration shelton when i say close i don t know what people are thinking i mean i don t go out and play golf with anyone i don t i m kind of a hermit i m not very socially active i don t mean close i don t even mean picking up the phone or even emailing i don t even do that now really that was really during the campaign and just on maybe three or four issues related to the economic agendas going forward what do we think about this or what do we think about that just things that were circulated on the team it s just that i ve known larry kudlow since i think early 90 s i would say it s more of a long term respect for him as a person i just think he s great but we re not what i would call social friends only because i m not socially as i say we live on a farm and i m kind of a hermit advertisement heeb to sum it up you wouldn t allow these relationships close or not to influence your decisions as a fed board member shelton no heeb do you think that central bank independence in general has been challenged by the president he repeatedly comments on the job the fed is doing he pressures them to lower interest rates and even reportedly wanted to fire chairman jay powell shelton i would say that that s one of those things where people say oh the the independence of the federal reserve if you get on the federal reserve website it is an agency of the us government right away then you say okay but they re very independent i think some of the practices are i m not saying what i believe necessarily i m just saying let s look at the reality of sort of the sacrosanct idea that they re so independent advertisement the federal reserve purchases the debt issued by the government issued by another agency of government the treasury then the federal reserve as another independent federal agency of government purchases that debt collects the interest off that debt pays for its own and at one time was purchasing 60 percent of the debt being issued by the treasury during the crisis years then it takes the interest off that portfolio that the treasury is paying to the holder of the debt another agency of government and lives off that i mean takes its own administrative expenses out of that amount the interest on the government debt it s holding then it remits the rest of that back to the treasury and we call that revenues to the federal budget now that i think is a bit fiscally incestuous then i think okay so not so independent in a way and as you just mentioned to me it s not unusual at all for treasury officials to meet with the head of the fed i think it s healthier to be transparent i would rather have a president who says what he thinks about the policies out loud for everyone to hear instead of these little subtle meetings we re now learning about historically as to whether nixon said this or that to arthur burns or intimidated or put pressure on in these supposed behind the scenes attempts to intimidate i think paul volcker has referred to words from secretary baker i don t know that those took place but i can well imagine and i would much rather have someone if the goal is to be transparent then instead of people sort of doing the signaling that oh how dare they why not just be open about it and i think it s even sillier people who then say oh now the fed wanted to lower rates but now they can t because it will look like the president intimidated them i mean that was kindergarten to talk about these things i think everybody s professional and everyone should feel free to talk about things i don t think they re intimidated by what is said at the presidential level i think we should be happy that someone is savvy enough about the role of interest rates and the role of the federal reserve to have an opinion heeb so you re saying that the fed is not currently a completely independent institution am i getting that right advertisement shelton i m just saying that people are human and they absorb tons of information and i presume we choose people who are capable of executing their best independent judgment in the interest of the responsibility to which they have pledged their fealty and their capabilities to uphold i m not appalled at the notion that the president can have an opinion about financial markets or about monetary policy i think that the chairman of the fed is fully capable of handling it of taking into consideration whatever advice he deems appropriate from whatever sources he deems appropriate and he is his own person and intellectually secure and will do what he thinks is the best thing to do i think people harumph a lot about this without saying everyone s doing their best job let s give them credit heeb do you think the fed is currently a completely independent institution shelton i think i ve answered that heeb what was your answer sorry it wasn t clear to me advertisement shelton is the fed a completely independent institution i mean isn t that what you just asked me a moment ago heeb i wasn t clear on whether your answer was yes or no shelton well i think it would be a little bit superficial to say yes or no the fed itself calls itself an agency of government an independent agency but as i think i just walked you through the fed purchases the debt issued by treasury and takes the interest from that and then remits that back to the treasury as revenues to the federal budget i think at one point when it was really over a hundred billion that it was remitting under bernanke he even said with some pride that we are one of the larger revenue centers for the federal budget and i think they were about the sixth largest contributor to the federal budget that year so not independent fiscally just looking at the financial income statement for a consolidated government heeb but is it independent from political influences that s more so what i m asking advertisement shelton well i think that the federal reserve has to be aware of economic slash political developments at any given moment because there s a lot of interaction there and i think the fed has to take prudent consideration of what is happening politically and economically and i hope they don t have blinders on heeb but i mean for political motives or shelton hey gina i m assuming that you re just being a straight shooter with me as i m trying to be with you so if there s another answer you re looking for heeb no just a yes or no would be fine advertisement shelton well okay anything else heeb i was just seeing if you d be able to answer it in a yes or a no shelton well i really think i ve overkilled on that i see we ve almost done 30 minutes so give me your next legitimate question heeb i think that was a legitimate question so i m just going to say you didn t want to answer yes or no on that advertisement shelton wow well okay i m sorry i don t know why i thought this would be a good conversation could you give my answer which i think was more that it would be superficial to try to say yes or no to is the fed an independent agency and then sort of give my enlarged answer in terms of the intermingling with the relationship between treasury and the fed heeb i think we re saying the same thing in a different way you re saying you think it would be superficial to say yes or no and i was just saying that you weren t saying yes or no shelton that s a hot button issue it s the kind where people will say oh she doesn t believe in the independence of the federal reserve so then it will take a longer answer whereas i suppose it s easy to say no it s 100 percent independent and they should never even talk to each other that it should be more strict and i don t think they should be allowed to read newspapers you could say that but i don t think that s realistic i would say my most true answer in my opinion is that you choose professional people they rise to the position and they have integrity and they don t wear blinders but they always choose what they think is the best way to fulfill their responsibilities and i just think you give responsible people the benefit of the doubt that they are not unduly influenced that the primary goal of their service is to conduct it responsibly i don t think people are intimidated or they wouldn t be in that position advertisement heeb okay well we can move on here i recently read that you were against the fed s dual mandate there have been growing debates about how inflation should be measured even at these conferences in chicago this week what do you think the fed s mandate should be and what yardsticks should be used for measurement shelton on the dual mandate it s another one of those concepts that has taken on sacrosanct importance i wonder how much people really go back and read that legislation the humphrey hawkins legislation from 42 years ago and that was a time when i think there was a certain amount of hubris those are the phillips curve days the idea that government could fine tune economic performance and could chart it there was an overemphasis on econometrics in the quantitative approach to running the economy and controlling it that you had this perfect trade off between unemployment and inflation the mandate just said maximizing employment okay so i don t know if that s the fed s job or how you then define it we re certainly at minimal unemployment right now a 50 year low or 49 year low stable prices stable usually means no movement if that is the sacrosanct mandate then we get back into really interesting if you go back and look at the transcripts when janet yellen and alan greenspan were talking about why 2 percent versus 0 percent what is stable i mean if it s a value of a house and you have 2 percent inflation for 10 years 20 years that means the price changes what 20 to 40 percent during your ownership of your house is that still relevant is 2 percent right is it good to sort of incentivize people i think that was the argument that yellen made again the transcripts i really recommend they re fascinating to read because she convinced alan greenspan and he was probably more a zero change in prices guy a zero delta guy and she made a good case basically to say workers want to see a nominal increase in their wages it s very keynesian that ultimately money illusion even though you re not any wealthier if all prices go up two percent there s still an incentive if there are sticky wages downward nobody wants to have flat income or negative so you build in this little cushion that makes it look like you re getting ahead that s more economics as a social science and i think she got a lot of that from her husband it s very well known in that field so those are interesting arguments but to just say the fed s mandate is stable prices and not comment about why the 2 percent or some people are four percent or even six percent to give the fed more room to maneuver those are interesting questions not answered by that quote dual mandate advertisement and then to me it s actually a triple mandate that people seem to forget the third element is in the same sentence it was the maximum employment price stability and moderate long term interest rates what happened to that we have the 10 year now lower than the 3 month what happened to moderate long term interest rates that disappeared when the fed became much more activist following 2008 i don t understand why people call it the dual mandate and then they don t bring up that it was actually three things you could say from a saver s point of view that not being compensated for retirement when you re as trump used to say during the campaign people who have done all the right things to put money in savings accounts are getting creamed that was his word but i thought he was absolutely right about that maybe low rates are good for developers but they sure don t give adequate compensation to people who are saving to put away for retirement in a responsible way i wish the fed would have been more concerned about the third and for no reason less important aspect of the mandate it was a triple mandate heeb okay i have a few questions if we could just back up a little bit as far as maximum employment you said you don t know if that s the fed s job you would be against that as a congressionally mandated task for the fed shelton well what do they mean by that because what was the fed doing differently when we had high unemployment a few years before and then when the trump administration came in and we got some other things going like reducing the regulatory burden and i think a better environment from a tax point of view for business and entrepreneurship i think people are starting to see potential movement and getting an improved trade reform set of policies in place now we have low unemployment but the fed was the same fed during all of that and if people are saying the fed should maximize employment will you do that by lowering rates or raising rates advertisement i find people start arguing without knowing what they really want the fed to do are negative rates good for employment is that what people mean when they say the fed should maximize employment does that always mean they should lower the interest rate because i think some labor groups had thought that but maybe now they re reconsidering to me the only thing that really matters from a jobs point of view is getting productive economic growth you don t just want the fed to do things that are good for investors who arbitrage differential interest rates or who speculate on currencies you want to see what we re starting to get which is increased productivity which then justifies the increased wages those are things that i think have more to do with other policies that the government can be involved with including infrastructure i don t think the fed can create that i don t think just by raising or lowering interest rates you can you can create productive jobs so i would just leave it at that heeb so the mandate should be productivity growth shelton i do think stable money is very important i think you ll find many central banks that s their only mandate monetary stability you could say that and that s not very controversial advertisement but i just think that there are other factors including people s confidence about economic growth you could look at fed policies now on paying interest on excess reserves does that or does that not disincentivize banks to make loans it s the loans to small businesses or consumer loans or mortgages the kind of community bank loans that i think help to create jobs so the fed is a factor but there it might not be the rate of the interest it s whether banks decide that it s easier to leave the money sitting at the fed and collecting interest for doing nothing or to actively seek risky loans by definition the kind of loans that create more small businesses and lead to more employment i would say i want the fed s actions not to discourage employment just by raising or lowering rates if that s all the fed can do that s why i m looking at mechanisms for how they do it not just whether they re going up or down i think you had written something saying that i m in favor of zero interest rates or near zero i m not commenting i try to go out of my way to say i don t know what the interest rate should be i don t think anyone does i think that s the whole issue of you have a central bank thinking that it s smarter than the free market in terms of what the interest rates should be based on the supply of loanable funds and the demand for loanable funds i m not saying what it should be what i m talking about is a mechanism that rewards banks and pays them 2 35 percent interest for doing nothing i think that is not good for employment heeb would you instead use manipulating the balance sheet as opposed to these it sounds like you want to eliminate the interest rate on excess reserves advertisement shelton that s the primary way that they raise and lower the interest rate that was meant to be an emergency measure at the time everyone including ben bernanke thought that if you inject all this liquidity into the system in the wake of the meltdown in 2008 that that was an assumption that if you increase base money and we have the normal multiplier effect that you re looking at excessive inflation down the road and so bernanke wanted to move up the timetable for paying interest on excess reserves to lock up those reserves because then he said with all these people saying what about inflation down the line if you re going to have all of this quantitative easing he said i can stop inflation in 15 minutes that s because all you would have to do is keep raising it to the level where banks would say why should i make any loans i mean what if i could get 10 percent from the fed the point is that became a way to prevent the inflation that everyone expected when we didn t get the inflation that s when i think the fed should have been saying why is that the dog that s not barking why aren t we seeing an increase in the cpi because the goal of pumping the money in was to make it easy for companies with this low cost of capital to invest in expanded plant and equipment and then to hire people so then that would start helping that was the idea that you would be hiring these people and you d be paying them because now you had expanded production capabilities that their aggregate level of wages gave them increased purchasing power and that would have put pressure on the cpi and you would have seen the inflation so when we didn t see that after so many years i think we should have said it was a reasonable experiment maybe by the fed but where is that money going and maybe it s not doing what we thought instead of buying or investing in expansion maybe companies were buying back their own shares to a larger degree than anyone would have thought and maybe already wealthy investors are getting access to margin accounts at near zero rates where they can invest in the market and maybe governments had the opportunity to borrow big time at low rates and lock in low rates those were the unanticipated consequences where i think then the fed should have said that maybe the model isn t working the way we thought heeb you mentioned that no one knows what the interest rate should be advertisement shelton instead of saying no one knows i m just saying that having studied the soviet economy i think we had the experiment that was showing what works better central planning or market mechanisms and i m saying market mechanisms give you better outcomes in a sense by having a committee of people decide what the interest rate should be that s a closer model to central planning than having the free market find the interest rate that is appropriate for the cost of capital that s what we re pricing in the market the cost of capital and that s the interest rate i m just saying there are people who have funds they could lend and there are people who could use funds because they see productive investment opportunities and normally banks would be the financial intermediaries that charge the interest rate that allows them to connect the source to the use hopefully in the most productive way because they re good at judging risk and return and that s why we have banks heeb i m going back a few questions because i forgot to ask a follow up here you mentioned the two percent inflation target you said some people want four or six percent do you have a target shelton my sense would be genuine price stability is really i mean my ideal would be zero stable prices mean stable heeb so zero percent inflation advertisement shelton well yeah price stability means stability i m not saying the cpi measures everything i m not saying the pce measures everything what would you really want to do is the level of money and credit in an economy is calibrated to stable consistent price signals that are conveyed through time that would be the ideal heeb you said in a financial times interview the fed has a soviet style power over markets as a board member you would get just one vote and the framework would be largely the same as it is now so why do you want to be part of that shelton i don t think i want to answer that i think it would be presumptuous but i think it s good to have fresh thinking and to challenge it s hard to do i mean i will say that within the current structure i don t believe in just pulling the rug out from people and coming in and trying to blow it all up i think consistency and moving toward a better place i would want to be having the conversations asking the fed and i m very pleased to see the fed is already doing this going through self evaluation is the federal reserve functioning in a way that is setting up optimal conditions for productive economic growth i would start by looking just very generally we see around the world i think we re up to 11 trillion in securities that or have a negative interest rate and i think that situation has been largely engineered by central banks i think we have to say what is the role of central banks in a productive economy and are they helping or hurting i think it s legitimate to say are they too dominant or does it turn out that they only serve a small segment of the private sector and what is their interaction with governments and what is their impact on currency those are all the questions we should be talking about at a very basic level i m happy for the new open debate on all of these issues advertisement heeb what do you think of the fed saying it s ready to act if trade conditions worsen a lot of people saw that as a signal that they could lower rates shelton i think the market is a little bit kabuki theater and over responds in both directions to comments the fed doesn t wear blinders and is watching developments economic and political all the time as it should that was kind of just an obvious statement but i think the market grasps at clippings and overreacts for better or worse heeb but what about the actual policy move to make that statement does that signal that tariffs are hurting the american economy or have the potential to shelton what we re going through on all of that has more to do with negotiating toward a better overall trading platform more of a level playing field i see that as necessary and especially with china that had been neglected for too long and i think in the end we ll end up in a good place advertisement heeb what is necessary the tariffs or the fed response shelton i think it s appropriate on trade to use the levers that you have to work with your trade partners especially in these bilateral agreements i think that we needed to confront china and and work out a better relationship that s more equitable with more access to their markets that s just one factor in the economic outlook that the fed takes into consideration heeb are there any conditions that would call for tightening monetary policy shelton i think just the classic ones the fed is now saying that they are willing to overshoot the two percent target because they were undershooting for so long i would think that at some point we would be using if we re doing a path to phase out of paying banks on excess reserves because i think that s going to be challenged that whole practice then the fed still has 3 6 trillion in its portfolio that it can interact but then that s going to these other questions of should the fed be trying to engineer an artificial interest rate i think that s when you cause distortions advertisement heeb you support the gold standard but i haven t seen a lot of details about how it would be implemented shelton first of all whenever you see that please please try to figure out what do people mean when they attribute that to me do they mean a gold standard where we only have 261 million ounces so i don t understand do people really think that i m saying that somehow about 300 or 350 billion or so i d have to calculate it out but not a big chunk is that what they re talking about or are they talking about where during like the classical international standard i mean the government didn t stand ready to convert all they did is look at what thomas jefferson wrote on the establishment of a money unit the united states you just declare what is your measurement what do we call the us dollar he did it as so many grains of silver or so many grains of gold and you just define it bretton woods was something completely different where only a foreign central bank had the right to convert dollars into gold i m not sure what people mean when they attribute that to me or what they think i m suggesting what i said is that it s a good way to look at the virtues of what you want your monetary system to provide in terms of a monetary integrity or price signal clarity or international system of sorts that sovereign countries can voluntarily agree to abide by what do you want and do you have a universal reference or benchmark so that other countries could voluntarily agree to abide by certain rules on currency relationships it doesn t have to be gold gold is the cliche but if someone wants to suggest something different i ve heard people say sand or water or oil i just haven t seen anything better than gold heeb you re not in favor of pegging a currency to the price of gold advertisement shelton when you say pegging what do you mean by that what are you asking me heeb when a currency is defined in terms of shelton i m sure i ve never said that the fed should have a price rule to ratchet up or down interest rates in accordance with the daily price of gold but i m sure that if anything i would have said a price rule i don t think is a good idea i ve never suggested that i m not badmouthing the gold standard i m saying look to see what you like about prior systems that have worked and see if we could develop a future system that would incorporate the virtues of things that worked in the past heeb but you haven t favored a system in which the value of a currency is defined in terms of the price of gold advertisement shelton i m just saying that it s way too easy to toss out the term when the government overspends you could say oh we should just have a gold standard because then you have some discipline because then there s kind of a fiscal price to pay you could lose gold and then that shrinks your money supply and then that puts the brakes on if you re overinflating or whatever you re doing wrong i mean there s lots of aspects to it but you really have to be careful about what you mean to just say oh you favor the gold standard i would just say if you re talking about the classical international gold standard like alan greenspan like robert mundell the nobel prize winner i recognize the virtues of when we had an international voluntary currency system that honored the sovereignty of countries and that was based on their own self discipline and not say like we have problems with the euro because if one country kind of blows it whether it s greece or italy or portugal it doesn t threaten the whole system those are those are things we should be talking about
the white house is said to be vetting judy shelton a former campaign adviser to president donald trump for a top policymaking position at the federal reserve the new york times and bloomberg reported in may that shelton is being vetted for the position and she told markets insider she has been contacted by the office of presidential personnel in an interview with markets insider shelton laid out what she would bring to a central bank whose policies she has long been critical of advertisement the conservative economist said she thought it would be superficial to answer yes or no to whether the central bank was independent said she wanted a zero percent inflation target and expressed support for the president and his policies shelton currently serves as the us director for the european bank for reconstruction and development this interview took place on june 6 2019 you can read the full interview transcript edited for brevity and clarity below you can click here for articles on the following points from the conversation full interview advertisement gina heeb where exactly are you in the run up to the i know you haven t formally been nominated but i have seen reports that you re being vetted and then i ve also seen reports that it s not a sure thing if you could speak to that judy shelton i really can t speak to it i met with people from the office of presidential personnel and so i assume i m being considered i m also reading that i m being considered what i appreciate is that i think that the whole issue is an interesting one and deserves a lot of attention at a time when the fed itself seems to be asking questions about our models working or are mechanisms delivering the best economic performance potential because it s not that the fed creates economic growth but i think it s an important part of having the conditions out there that make it possible to generate a productive economic growth they re all really important issues i also think because we do live in an economy where international trade is very important the central banks do affect exchange rates i think it s an it s an interesting time even from an intellectual framework point of view to say how do you have something that is coherent how do you integrate domestic and international monetary policy so that you have the appropriate level playing field for free trade i like that because my name is out there people are more interested pro or against but the point is we re talking about these things i m very pleased about that and we ll just have to see what happens if anything goes any further for me advertisement heeb could you tell me a little bit about your relationship with president trump shelton i was actually an adviser to ben carson during the primary just on issues that would come up on the federal reserve but he really wasn t asked enough about it during the debate i wasn t able to really have much of an impact i don t think and then when he went with donald trump i was very happy because one thing i really liked about what donald trump was bringing up as a candidate was the issue of currency manipulation here i am someone who thought that this had been ignored for decades and here was someone at the presidential candidate level who was willing to say that he believed in free trade but that currency manipulation was an unfair trade tactic and i thought finally we re going to address this i think early on maybe it was in july or august of 2016 i wrote something for the wall street journal on trump s contribution to sound money because to me again that s an entre into this whole issue of what is the importance of money and having monetary clarity to transmit price signals if you want to take a free market approach and for me that s all kind of what i would call the sound money thinking that interests me very much at right about that same time i had a note from steven mnuchin saying would you be willing to have your name as part of the trump economic advisory council i was pleased to be part of that group i ve known larry kudlow and respected him very much for a long time i ve known steven moore for a long time likewise their idea of productive economic growth and the necessary aspects of it i m aligned with them to a large extent i was happy they wanted to include me and then within a month of that i went out to one of the rallies and met trump as he was a candidate and he was traveling with mike pence i sat with him and his wife and attended the rally and met members of the team they were all there that day and then were sending memos back and forth to members of the economic team just with ideas advertisement and then i guess a few weeks before the election david malpass who was very much involved with the trump economic team asked if i would serve on the transition team i was thrilled to do that and then when trump won we jumped into action and i was the lead adviser for international affairs at the treasury and that was the landing team that we had during the transition that was a wonderful experience and i guess that was about three months because it actually included preparing papers and studies and recommendations for the incoming treasury secretary and kind of overseeing the area that david malpass was slated to become the undersecretary of international affairs so preparing positions in conjunction with david and then also briefing secretary mnuchin through his confirmation hearing and shortly after that but then i really wasn t looking for a position i loved the experience during transition but i wasn t seeking a position i just kind of said great thank you very much and i was looking forward to seeing things unfold it was several months later it was well into the summer of 2017 that david malpass at treasury asked if i would be interested in serving in this particular position and there s a lot at the european bank for reconstruction and development heeb right well it sounds like you ve had a busy few years and developed close relationships within the administration and with the president would those change if you were nominated to the fed shelton well how do you mean i mean i guess you don t give up friendships but you mean like would i take orders or something i don t know i think the people who are already there are especially aware of what are the appropriate boundaries and anyone who knows me knows i m pretty consistent in my own person i guess i don t know how else further to answer but i think that when you can work with people and you re like minded but obviously the fed is independent and i know everyone respects that i wouldn t see any conflicts at the same time i don t think that you put up artificial barriers or change your feelings of respect or friendship for people heeb what about larry kudlow i know you mentioned a close relationship with him would you guys discuss monetary policy advertisement shelton when i say close friends i ve just known him a really really long time we don t really get together socially or anything and i always took it as a professional task we would write memos he would just say what are your thoughts on this or that issue if it involved more international monetary issues i would write with great seriousness memos but i would say in more of a professional not even arm s length except that i know generally how he might feel about something and he probably knows generally how i feel the only thing he s ever said to me when we talked about whether i could throw my hat in the ring for this was i said something that while working in my current position i had really refrained from commenting i had been writing op eds i used to write more often for the wall street journal about exchange rate issues or monetary issues but i felt like since the treasury i didn t work for treasury but it involved a relationship with treasury i didn t know what was appropriate to say i don t really like feeling like i can t write things because i don t want to violate i think treasury respects the fed and vice versa and he said well one thing you would be free to say what you want if you were in line for the fed and i remember saying really don t governors have to be careful what they say in speeches and such and he says not that i know of he said i think people write what they think and i thought well that sounds liberating actually but i have no sense that i have any special in or i don t know if i m even on a short list to tell you the truth i just think he was talking generally that i agree to say what i think so that s always very appealing heeb do you worry that expressing support for fiscal policies could make people skeptical of the central bank s independence shelton i haven t really thought about that because i wouldn t be responding to i don t know why the fed is i don t know i haven t really thought about it i saw people trying to make something of if somebody wanted to meet for coffee and talk with me for me the easiest most convenient place was at the trump hotel and i saw people say oh oh she s trying to promote that i thought no it s a block or two from treasury and they leave you alone and you can have a cup of coffee and sit there and no one bothers you and there s not loud music that drives you out so anyway i don t know advertisement heeb i just came across a photo of you the other day at trump hotel i was going to ask if you frequent there shelton when i come into dc if i m in the us i basically live on an old farm a very old property and it s almost two hours away by train so for me it s easy to then get into dc and i don t have an office there i can t bring reporters into the treasury my office is back in london and so i have to meet at some hotel or coffee shop and that one happens to be very convenient because i m usually going to treasury or state or nsc or the visits that are involved with my work at ebrd after i met with james politi in london he said can i take your photo i thought well okay and then i saw people say oh she s promoting that i don t see any conflict whatsoever isn t it regular and maybe you know better than i do isn t it regular practice for the treasury secretary to meet with people at the fed to meet with chairman powell i believe so heeb that s definitely normal they usually issue a readout and as long as everything s transparent it s normal i m more so asking about these close relationships as opposed to a formal meeting because you already have these friendships within the administration shelton when i say close i don t know what people are thinking i mean i don t go out and play golf with anyone i don t i m kind of a hermit i m not very socially active i don t mean close i don t even mean picking up the phone or even emailing i don t even do that now really that was really during the campaign and just on maybe three or four issues related to the economic agendas going forward what do we think about this or what do we think about that just things that were circulated on the team it s just that i ve known larry kudlow since i think early 90 s i would say it s more of a long term respect for him as a person i just think he s great but we re not what i would call social friends only because i m not socially as i say we live on a farm and i m kind of a hermit advertisement heeb to sum it up you wouldn t allow these relationships close or not to influence your decisions as a fed board member shelton no heeb do you think that central bank independence in general has been challenged by the president he repeatedly comments on the job the fed is doing he pressures them to lower interest rates and even reportedly wanted to fire chairman jay powell shelton i would say that that s one of those things where people say oh the the independence of the federal reserve if you get on the federal reserve website it is an agency of the us government right away then you say okay but they re very independent i think some of the practices are i m not saying what i believe necessarily i m just saying let s look at the reality of sort of the sacrosanct idea that they re so independent the federal reserve purchases the debt issued by the government issued by another agency of government the treasury then the federal reserve as another independent federal agency of government purchases that debt collects the interest off that debt pays for its own and at one time was purchasing 60 percent of the debt being issued by the treasury during the crisis years then it takes the interest off that portfolio that the treasury is paying to the holder of the debt another agency of government and lives off that i mean takes its own administrative expenses out of that amount the interest on the government debt it s holding then it remits the rest of that back to the treasury and we call that revenues to the federal budget now that i think is a bit fiscally incestuous advertisement then i think okay so not so independent in a way and as you just mentioned to me it s not unusual at all for treasury officials to meet with the head of the fed i think it s healthier to be transparent i would rather have a president who says what he thinks about the policies out loud for everyone to hear instead of these little subtle meetings we re now learning about historically as to whether nixon said this or that to arthur burns or intimidated or put pressure on in these supposed behind the scenes attempts to intimidate i think paul volcker has referred to words from secretary baker i don t know that those took place but i can well imagine and i would much rather have someone if the goal is to be transparent then instead of people sort of doing the signaling that oh how dare they why not just be open about it and i think it s even sillier people who then say oh now the fed wanted to lower rates but now they can t because it will look like the president intimidated them i mean that was kindergarten to talk about these things i think everybody s professional and everyone should feel free to talk about things i don t think they re intimidated by what is said at the presidential level i think we should be happy that someone is savvy enough about the role of interest rates and the role of the federal reserve to have an opinion heeb so you re saying that the fed is not currently a completely independent institution am i getting that right shelton i m just saying that people are human and they absorb tons of information and i presume we choose people who are capable of executing their best independent judgment in the interest of the responsibility to which they have pledged their fealty and their capabilities to uphold i m not appalled at the notion that the president can have an opinion about financial markets or about monetary policy i think that the chairman of the fed is fully capable of handling it of taking into consideration whatever advice he deems appropriate from whatever sources he deems appropriate and he is his own person and intellectually secure and will do what he thinks is the best thing to do i think people harumph a lot about this without saying everyone s doing their best job let s give them credit heeb do you think the fed is currently a completely independent institution advertisement shelton i think i ve answered that heeb what was your answer sorry it wasn t clear to me shelton is the fed a completely independent institution i mean isn t that what you just asked me a moment ago heeb i wasn t clear on whether your answer was yes or no shelton well i think it would be a little bit superficial to say yes or no the fed itself calls itself an agency of government an independent agency but as i think i just walked you through the fed purchases the debt issued by treasury and takes the interest from that and then remits that back to the treasury as revenues to the federal budget i think at one point when it was really over a hundred billion that it was remitting under bernanke he even said with some pride that we are one of the larger revenue centers for the federal budget and i think they were about the sixth largest contributor to the federal budget that year so not independent fiscally just looking at the financial income statement for a consolidated government advertisement heeb but is it independent from political influences that s more so what i m asking shelton well i think that the federal reserve has to be aware of economic slash political developments at any given moment because there s a lot of interaction there and i think the fed has to take prudent consideration of what is happening politically and economically and i hope they don t have blinders on heeb but i mean for political motives or shelton hey gina i m assuming that you re just being a straight shooter with me as i m trying to be with you so if there s another answer you re looking for heeb no just a yes or no would be fine advertisement shelton well okay anything else heeb i was just seeing if you d be able to answer it in a yes or a no shelton well i really think i ve overkilled on that i see we ve almost done 30 minutes so give me your next legitimate question heeb i think that was a legitimate question so i m just going to say you didn t want to answer yes or no on that shelton wow well okay i m sorry i don t know why i thought this would be a good conversation could you give my answer which i think was more that it would be superficial to try to say yes or no to is the fed an independent agency and then sort of give my enlarged answer in terms of the intermingling with the relationship between treasury and the fed advertisement heeb i think we re saying the same thing in a different way you re saying you think it would be superficial to say yes or no and i was just saying that you weren t saying yes or no shelton that s a hot button issue it s the kind where people will say oh she doesn t believe in the independence of the federal reserve so then it will take a longer answer whereas i suppose it s easy to say no it s 100 percent independent and they should never even talk to each other that it should be more strict and i don t think they should be allowed to read newspapers you could say that but i don t think that s realistic i would say my most true answer in my opinion is that you choose professional people they rise to the position and they have integrity and they don t wear blinders but they always choose what they think is the best way to fulfill their responsibilities and i just think you give responsible people the benefit of the doubt that they are not unduly influenced that the primary goal of their service is to conduct it responsibly i don t think people are intimidated or they wouldn t be in that position heeb okay well we can move on here i recently read that you were against the fed s dual mandate there have been growing debates about how inflation should be measured even at these conferences in chicago this week what do you think the fed s mandate should be and what yardsticks should be used for measurement shelton on the dual mandate it s another one of those concepts that has taken on sacrosanct importance i wonder how much people really go back and read that legislation the humphrey hawkins legislation from 42 years ago and that was a time when i think there was a certain amount of hubris those are the phillips curve days the idea that government could fine tune economic performance and could chart it there was an overemphasis on econometrics in the quantitative approach to running the economy and controlling it that you had this perfect trade off between unemployment and inflation the mandate just said maximizing employment okay so i don t know if that s the fed s job or how you then define it we re certainly at minimal unemployment right now a 50 year low or 49 year low advertisement stable prices stable usually means no movement if that is the sacrosanct mandate then we get back into really interesting if you go back and look at the transcripts when janet yellen and alan greenspan were talking about why 2 percent versus 0 percent what is stable i mean if it s a value of a house and you have 2 percent inflation for 10 years 20 years that means the price changes what 20 to 40 percent during your ownership of your house is that still relevant is 2 percent right is it good to sort of incentivize people i think that was the argument that yellen made again the transcripts i really recommend they re fascinating to read because she convinced alan greenspan and he was probably more a zero change in prices guy a zero delta guy and she made a good case basically to say workers want to see a nominal increase in their wages it s very keynesian that ultimately money illusion even though you re not any wealthier if all prices go up two percent there s still an incentive if there are sticky wages downward nobody wants to have flat income or negative so you build in this little cushion that makes it look like you re getting ahead that s more economics as a social science and i think she got a lot of that from her husband it s very well known in that field so those are interesting arguments but to just say the fed s mandate is stable prices and not comment about why the 2 percent or some people are four percent or even six percent to give the fed more room to maneuver those are interesting questions not answered by that quote dual mandate and then to me it s actually a triple mandate that people seem to forget the third element is in the same sentence it was the maximum employment price stability and moderate long term interest rates what happened to that we have the 10 year now lower than the 3 month what happened to moderate long term interest rates that disappeared when the fed became much more activist following 2008 i don t understand why people call it the dual mandate and then they don t bring up that it was actually three things you could say from a saver s point of view that not being compensated for retirement when you re as trump used to say during the campaign people who have done all the right things to put money in savings accounts are getting creamed that was his word but i thought he was absolutely right about that maybe low rates are good for developers but they sure don t give adequate compensation to people who are saving to put away for retirement in a responsible way i wish the fed would have been more concerned about the third and for no reason less important aspect of the mandate it was a triple mandate heeb okay i have a few questions if we could just back up a little bit as far as maximum employment you said you don t know if that s the fed s job you would be against that as a congressionally mandated task for the fed advertisement shelton well what do they mean by that because what was the fed doing differently when we had high unemployment a few years before and then when the trump administration came in and we got some other things going like reducing the regulatory burden and i think a better environment from a tax point of view for business and entrepreneurship i think people are starting to see potential movement and getting an improved trade reform set of policies in place now we have low unemployment but the fed was the same fed during all of that and if people are saying the fed should maximize employment will you do that by lowering rates or raising rates i find people start arguing without knowing what they really want the fed to do are negative rates good for employment is that what people mean when they say the fed should maximize employment does that always mean they should lower the interest rate because i think some labor groups had thought that but maybe now they re reconsidering to me the only thing that really matters from a jobs point of view is getting productive economic growth you don t just want the fed to do things that are good for investors who arbitrage differential interest rates or who speculate on currencies you want to see what we re starting to get which is increased productivity which then justifies the increased wages those are things that i think have more to do with other policies that the government can be involved with including infrastructure i don t think the fed can create that i don t think just by raising or lowering interest rates you can you can create productive jobs so i would just leave it at that heeb so the mandate should be productivity growth shelton i do think stable money is very important i think you ll find many central banks that s their only mandate monetary stability you could say that and that s not very controversial advertisement but i just think that there are other factors including people s confidence about economic growth you could look at fed policies now on paying interest on excess reserves does that or does that not disincentivize banks to make loans it s the loans to small businesses or consumer loans or mortgages the kind of community bank loans that i think help to create jobs so the fed is a factor but there it might not be the rate of the interest it s whether banks decide that it s easier to leave the money sitting at the fed and collecting interest for doing nothing or to actively seek risky loans by definition the kind of loans that create more small businesses and lead to more employment i would say i want the fed s actions not to discourage employment just by raising or lowering rates if that s all the fed can do that s why i m looking at mechanisms for how they do it not just whether they re going up or down i think you had written something saying that i m in favor of zero interest rates or near zero i m not commenting i try to go out of my way to say i don t know what the interest rate should be i don t think anyone does i think that s the whole issue of you have a central bank thinking that it s smarter than the free market in terms of what the interest rates should be based on the supply of loanable funds and the demand for loanable funds i m not saying what it should be what i m talking about is a mechanism that rewards banks and pays them 2 35 percent interest for doing nothing i think that is not good for employment heeb would you instead use manipulating the balance sheet as opposed to these it sounds like you want to eliminate the interest rate on excess reserves shelton that s the primary way that they raise and lower the interest rate that was meant to be an emergency measure at the time everyone including ben bernanke thought that if you inject all this liquidity into the system in the wake of the meltdown in 2008 that that was an assumption that if you increase base money and we have the normal multiplier effect that you re looking at excessive inflation down the road and so bernanke wanted to move up the timetable for paying interest on excess reserves to lock up those reserves because then he said with all these people saying what about inflation down the line if you re going to have all of this quantitative easing he said i can stop inflation in 15 minutes that s because all you would have to do is keep raising it to the level where banks would say why should i make any loans i mean what if i could get 10 percent from the fed advertisement the point is that became a way to prevent the inflation that everyone expected when we didn t get the inflation that s when i think the fed should have been saying why is that the dog that s not barking why aren t we seeing an increase in the cpi because the goal of pumping the money in was to make it easy for companies with this low cost of capital to invest in expanded plant and equipment and then to hire people so then that would start helping that was the idea that you would be hiring these people and you d be paying them because now you had expanded production capabilities that their aggregate level of wages gave them increased purchasing power and that would have put pressure on the cpi and you would have seen the inflation so when we didn t see that after so many years i think we should have said it was a reasonable experiment maybe by the fed but where is that money going and maybe it s not doing what we thought instead of buying or investing in expansion maybe companies were buying back their own shares to a larger degree than anyone would have thought and maybe already wealthy investors are getting access to margin accounts at near zero rates where they can invest in the market and maybe governments had the opportunity to borrow big time at low rates and lock in low rates those were the unanticipated consequences where i think then the fed should have said that maybe the model isn t working the way we thought heeb you mentioned that no one knows what the interest rate should be shelton instead of saying no one knows i m just saying that having studied the soviet economy i think we had the experiment that was showing what works better central planning or market mechanisms and i m saying market mechanisms give you better outcomes in a sense by having a committee of people decide what the interest rate should be that s a closer model to central planning than having the free market find the interest rate that is appropriate for the cost of capital that s what we re pricing in the market the cost of capital and that s the interest rate i m just saying there are people who have funds they could lend and there are people who could use funds because they see productive investment opportunities and normally banks would be the financial intermediaries that charge the interest rate that allows them to connect the source to the use hopefully in the most productive way because they re good at judging risk and return and that s why we have banks heeb i m going back a few questions because i forgot to ask a follow up here you mentioned the two percent inflation target you said some people want four or six percent do you have a target advertisement shelton my sense would be genuine price stability is really i mean my ideal would be zero stable prices mean stable heeb so zero percent inflation shelton well yeah price stability means stability i m not saying the cpi measures everything i m not saying the pce measures everything what would you really want to do is the level of money and credit in an economy is calibrated to stable consistent price signals that are conveyed through time that would be the ideal heeb you said in a financial times interview the fed has a soviet style power over markets as a board member you would get just one vote and the framework would be largely the same as it is now so why do you want to be part of that shelton i don t think i want to answer that i think it would be presumptuous but i think it s good to have fresh thinking and to challenge it s hard to do i mean i will say that within the current structure i don t believe in just pulling the rug out from people and coming in and trying to blow it all up i think consistency and moving toward a better place i would want to be having the conversations asking the fed and i m very pleased to see the fed is already doing this going through self evaluation is the federal reserve functioning in a way that is setting up optimal conditions for productive economic growth advertisement i would start by looking just very generally we see around the world i think we re up to 11 trillion in securities that or have a negative interest rate and i think that situation has been largely engineered by central banks i think we have to say what is the role of central banks in a productive economy and are they helping or hurting i think it s legitimate to say are they too dominant or does it turn out that they only serve a small segment of the private sector and what is their interaction with governments and what is their impact on currency those are all the questions we should be talking about at a very basic level i m happy for the new open debate on all of these issues heeb what do you think of the fed saying it s ready to act if trade conditions worsen a lot of people saw that as a signal that they could lower rates shelton i think the market is a little bit kabuki theater and over responds in both directions to comments the fed doesn t wear blinders and is watching developments economic and political all the time as it should that was kind of just an obvious statement but i think the market grasps at clippings and overreacts for better or worse heeb but what about the actual policy move to make that statement does that signal that tariffs are hurting the american economy or have the potential to shelton what we re going through on all of that has more to do with negotiating toward a better overall trading platform more of a level playing field i see that as necessary and especially with china that had been neglected for too long and i think in the end we ll end up in a good place advertisement heeb what is necessary the tariffs or the fed response shelton i think it s appropriate on trade to use the levers that you have to work with your trade partners especially in these bilateral agreements i think that we needed to confront china and and work out a better relationship that s more equitable with more access to their markets that s just one factor in the economic outlook that the fed takes into consideration heeb are there any conditions that would call for tightening monetary policy shelton i think just the classic ones the fed is now saying that they are willing to overshoot the two percent target because they were undershooting for so long i would think that at some point we would be using if we re doing a path to phase out of paying banks on excess reserves because i think that s going to be challenged that whole practice then the fed still has 3 6 trillion in its portfolio that it can interact but then that s going to these other questions of should the fed be trying to engineer an artificial interest rate i think that s when you cause distortions heeb you support the gold standard but i haven t seen a lot of details about how it would be implemented advertisement shelton first of all whenever you see that please please try to figure out what do people mean when they attribute that to me do they mean a gold standard where we only have 261 million ounces so i don t understand do people really think that i m saying that somehow about 300 or 350 billion or so i d have to calculate it out but not a big chunk is that what they re talking about or are they talking about where during like the classical international standard i mean the government didn t stand ready to convert all they did is look at what thomas jefferson wrote on the establishment of a money unit the united states you just declare what is your measurement what do we call the us dollar he did it as so many grains of silver or so many grains of gold and you just define it bretton woods was something completely different where only a foreign central bank had the right to convert dollars into gold i m not sure what people mean when they attribute that to me or what they think i m suggesting what i said is that it s a good way to look at the virtues of what you want your monetary system to provide in terms of a monetary integrity or price signal clarity or international system of sorts that sovereign countries can voluntarily agree to abide by what do you want and do you have a universal reference or benchmark so that other countries could voluntarily agree to abide by certain rules on currency relationships it doesn t have to be gold gold is the cliche but if someone wants to suggest something different i ve heard people say sand or water or oil i just haven t seen anything better than gold heeb you re not in favor of pegging a currency to the price of gold shelton when you say pegging what do you mean by that what are you asking me heeb when a currency is defined in terms of advertisement shelton i m sure i ve never said that the fed should have a price rule to ratchet up or down interest rates in accordance with the daily price of gold but i m sure that if anything i would have said a price rule i don t think is a good idea i ve never suggested that i m not badmouthing the gold standard i m saying look to see what you like about prior systems that have worked and see if we could develop a future system that would incorporate the virtues of things that worked in the past heeb but you haven t favored a system in which the value of a currency is defined in terms of the price of gold shelton i m just saying that it s way too easy to toss out the term when the government overspends you could say oh we should just have a gold standard because then you have some discipline because then there s kind of a fiscal price to pay you could lose gold and then that shrinks your money supply and then that puts the brakes on if you re overinflating or whatever you re doing wrong i mean there s lots of aspects to it but you really have to be careful about what you mean to just say oh you favor the gold standard i would just say if you re talking about the classical international gold standard like alan greenspan like robert mundell the nobel prize winner i recognize the virtues of when we had an international voluntary currency system that honored the sovereignty of countries and that was based on their own self discipline and not say like we have problems with the euro because if one country kind of blows it whether it s greece or italy or portugal it doesn t threaten the whole system those are those are things we should be talking about advertisement see also
the white house is said to be vetting judy shelton a former campaign adviser to president donald trump for a top policymaking position at the federal reserve the new york times and bloomberg reported in may that shelton is being vetted for the position and she told markets insider she has been contacted by the office of presidential personnel in an interview with markets insider shelton laid out what she would bring to a central bank whose policies she has long been critical of advertisement the conservative economist said she thought it would be superficial to answer yes or no to whether the central bank was independent said she wanted a zero percent inflation target and expressed support for the president and his policies shelton currently serves as the us director for the european bank for reconstruction and development this interview took place on june 6 2019 you can read the full interview transcript edited for brevity and clarity below you can click here for articles on the following points from the conversation full interview advertisement gina heeb where exactly are you in the run up to the i know you haven t formally been nominated but i have seen reports that you re being vetted and then i ve also seen reports that it s not a sure thing if you could speak to that judy shelton i really can t speak to it i met with people from the office of presidential personnel and so i assume i m being considered i m also reading that i m being considered what i appreciate is that i think that the whole issue is an interesting one and deserves a lot of attention at a time when the fed itself seems to be asking questions about our models working or are mechanisms delivering the best economic performance potential because it s not that the fed creates economic growth but i think it s an important part of having the conditions out there that make it possible to generate a productive economic growth they re all really important issues i also think because we do live in an economy where international trade is very important the central banks do affect exchange rates i think it s an it s an interesting time even from an intellectual framework point of view to say how do you have something that is coherent how do you integrate domestic and international monetary policy so that you have the appropriate level playing field for free trade i like that because my name is out there people are more interested pro or against but the point is we re talking about these things i m very pleased about that and we ll just have to see what happens if anything goes any further for me advertisement heeb could you tell me a little bit about your relationship with president trump shelton i was actually an adviser to ben carson during the primary just on issues that would come up on the federal reserve but he really wasn t asked enough about it during the debate i wasn t able to really have much of an impact i don t think and then when he went with donald trump i was very happy because one thing i really liked about what donald trump was bringing up as a candidate was the issue of currency manipulation here i am someone who thought that this had been ignored for decades and here was someone at the presidential candidate level who was willing to say that he believed in free trade but that currency manipulation was an unfair trade tactic and i thought finally we re going to address this i think early on maybe it was in july or august of 2016 i wrote something for the wall street journal on trump s contribution to sound money because to me again that s an entre into this whole issue of what is the importance of money and having monetary clarity to transmit price signals if you want to take a free market approach and for me that s all kind of what i would call the sound money thinking that interests me very much at right about that same time i had a note from steven mnuchin saying would you be willing to have your name as part of the trump economic advisory council i was pleased to be part of that group i ve known larry kudlow and respected him very much for a long time i ve known steven moore for a long time likewise their idea of productive economic growth and the necessary aspects of it i m aligned with them to a large extent i was happy they wanted to include me and then within a month of that i went out to one of the rallies and met trump as he was a candidate and he was traveling with mike pence i sat with him and his wife and attended the rally and met members of the team they were all there that day and then were sending memos back and forth to members of the economic team just with ideas advertisement and then i guess a few weeks before the election david malpass who was very much involved with the trump economic team asked if i would serve on the transition team i was thrilled to do that and then when trump won we jumped into action and i was the lead adviser for international affairs at the treasury and that was the landing team that we had during the transition that was a wonderful experience and i guess that was about three months because it actually included preparing papers and studies and recommendations for the incoming treasury secretary and kind of overseeing the area that david malpass was slated to become the undersecretary of international affairs so preparing positions in conjunction with david and then also briefing secretary mnuchin through his confirmation hearing and shortly after that but then i really wasn t looking for a position i loved the experience during transition but i wasn t seeking a position i just kind of said great thank you very much and i was looking forward to seeing things unfold it was several months later it was well into the summer of 2017 that david malpass at treasury asked if i would be interested in serving in this particular position and there s a lot at the european bank for reconstruction and development heeb right well it sounds like you ve had a busy few years and developed close relationships within the administration and with the president would those change if you were nominated to the fed shelton well how do you mean i mean i guess you don t give up friendships but you mean like would i take orders or something i don t know i think the people who are already there are especially aware of what are the appropriate boundaries and anyone who knows me knows i m pretty consistent in my own person i guess i don t know how else further to answer but i think that when you can work with people and you re like minded but obviously the fed is independent and i know everyone respects that i wouldn t see any conflicts at the same time i don t think that you put up artificial barriers or change your feelings of respect or friendship for people heeb what about larry kudlow i know you mentioned a close relationship with him would you guys discuss monetary policy advertisement shelton when i say close friends i ve just known him a really really long time we don t really get together socially or anything and i always took it as a professional task we would write memos he would just say what are your thoughts on this or that issue if it involved more international monetary issues i would write with great seriousness memos but i would say in more of a professional not even arm s length except that i know generally how he might feel about something and he probably knows generally how i feel the only thing he s ever said to me when we talked about whether i could throw my hat in the ring for this was i said something that while working in my current position i had really refrained from commenting i had been writing op eds i used to write more often for the wall street journal about exchange rate issues or monetary issues but i felt like since the treasury i didn t work for treasury but it involved a relationship with treasury i didn t know what was appropriate to say i don t really like feeling like i can t write things because i don t want to violate i think treasury respects the fed and vice versa and he said well one thing you would be free to say what you want if you were in line for the fed and i remember saying really don t governors have to be careful what they say in speeches and such and he says not that i know of he said i think people write what they think and i thought well that sounds liberating actually but i have no sense that i have any special in or i don t know if i m even on a short list to tell you the truth i just think he was talking generally that i agree to say what i think so that s always very appealing heeb do you worry that expressing support for fiscal policies could make people skeptical of the central bank s independence shelton i haven t really thought about that because i wouldn t be responding to i don t know why the fed is i don t know i haven t really thought about it i saw people trying to make something of if somebody wanted to meet for coffee and talk with me for me the easiest most convenient place was at the trump hotel and i saw people say oh oh she s trying to promote that i thought no it s a block or two from treasury and they leave you alone and you can have a cup of coffee and sit there and no one bothers you and there s not loud music that drives you out so anyway i don t know advertisement heeb i just came across a photo of you the other day at trump hotel i was going to ask if you frequent there shelton when i come into dc if i m in the us i basically live on an old farm a very old property and it s almost two hours away by train so for me it s easy to then get into dc and i don t have an office there i can t bring reporters into the treasury my office is back in london and so i have to meet at some hotel or coffee shop and that one happens to be very convenient because i m usually going to treasury or state or nsc or the visits that are involved with my work at ebrd after i met with james politi in london he said can i take your photo i thought well okay and then i saw people say oh she s promoting that i don t see any conflict whatsoever isn t it regular and maybe you know better than i do isn t it regular practice for the treasury secretary to meet with people at the fed to meet with chairman powell i believe so heeb that s definitely normal they usually issue a readout and as long as everything s transparent it s normal i m more so asking about these close relationships as opposed to a formal meeting because you already have these friendships within the administration shelton when i say close i don t know what people are thinking i mean i don t go out and play golf with anyone i don t i m kind of a hermit i m not very socially active i don t mean close i don t even mean picking up the phone or even emailing i don t even do that now really that was really during the campaign and just on maybe three or four issues related to the economic agendas going forward what do we think about this or what do we think about that just things that were circulated on the team it s just that i ve known larry kudlow since i think early 90 s i would say it s more of a long term respect for him as a person i just think he s great but we re not what i would call social friends only because i m not socially as i say we live on a farm and i m kind of a hermit advertisement heeb to sum it up you wouldn t allow these relationships close or not to influence your decisions as a fed board member shelton no heeb do you think that central bank independence in general has been challenged by the president he repeatedly comments on the job the fed is doing he pressures them to lower interest rates and even reportedly wanted to fire chairman jay powell shelton i would say that that s one of those things where people say oh the the independence of the federal reserve if you get on the federal reserve website it is an agency of the us government right away then you say okay but they re very independent i think some of the practices are i m not saying what i believe necessarily i m just saying let s look at the reality of sort of the sacrosanct idea that they re so independent the federal reserve purchases the debt issued by the government issued by another agency of government the treasury then the federal reserve as another independent federal agency of government purchases that debt collects the interest off that debt pays for its own and at one time was purchasing 60 percent of the debt being issued by the treasury during the crisis years then it takes the interest off that portfolio that the treasury is paying to the holder of the debt another agency of government and lives off that i mean takes its own administrative expenses out of that amount the interest on the government debt it s holding then it remits the rest of that back to the treasury and we call that revenues to the federal budget now that i think is a bit fiscally incestuous advertisement then i think okay so not so independent in a way and as you just mentioned to me it s not unusual at all for treasury officials to meet with the head of the fed i think it s healthier to be transparent i would rather have a president who says what he thinks about the policies out loud for everyone to hear instead of these little subtle meetings we re now learning about historically as to whether nixon said this or that to arthur burns or intimidated or put pressure on in these supposed behind the scenes attempts to intimidate i think paul volcker has referred to words from secretary baker i don t know that those took place but i can well imagine and i would much rather have someone if the goal is to be transparent then instead of people sort of doing the signaling that oh how dare they why not just be open about it and i think it s even sillier people who then say oh now the fed wanted to lower rates but now they can t because it will look like the president intimidated them i mean that was kindergarten to talk about these things i think everybody s professional and everyone should feel free to talk about things i don t think they re intimidated by what is said at the presidential level i think we should be happy that someone is savvy enough about the role of interest rates and the role of the federal reserve to have an opinion heeb so you re saying that the fed is not currently a completely independent institution am i getting that right shelton i m just saying that people are human and they absorb tons of information and i presume we choose people who are capable of executing their best independent judgment in the interest of the responsibility to which they have pledged their fealty and their capabilities to uphold i m not appalled at the notion that the president can have an opinion about financial markets or about monetary policy i think that the chairman of the fed is fully capable of handling it of taking into consideration whatever advice he deems appropriate from whatever sources he deems appropriate and he is his own person and intellectually secure and will do what he thinks is the best thing to do i think people harumph a lot about this without saying everyone s doing their best job let s give them credit heeb do you think the fed is currently a completely independent institution advertisement shelton i think i ve answered that heeb what was your answer sorry it wasn t clear to me shelton is the fed a completely independent institution i mean isn t that what you just asked me a moment ago heeb i wasn t clear on whether your answer was yes or no shelton well i think it would be a little bit superficial to say yes or no the fed itself calls itself an agency of government an independent agency but as i think i just walked you through the fed purchases the debt issued by treasury and takes the interest from that and then remits that back to the treasury as revenues to the federal budget i think at one point when it was really over a hundred billion that it was remitting under bernanke he even said with some pride that we are one of the larger revenue centers for the federal budget and i think they were about the sixth largest contributor to the federal budget that year so not independent fiscally just looking at the financial income statement for a consolidated government advertisement heeb but is it independent from political influences that s more so what i m asking shelton well i think that the federal reserve has to be aware of economic slash political developments at any given moment because there s a lot of interaction there and i think the fed has to take prudent consideration of what is happening politically and economically and i hope they don t have blinders on heeb but i mean for political motives or shelton hey gina i m assuming that you re just being a straight shooter with me as i m trying to be with you so if there s another answer you re looking for heeb no just a yes or no would be fine advertisement shelton well okay anything else heeb i was just seeing if you d be able to answer it in a yes or a no shelton well i really think i ve overkilled on that i see we ve almost done 30 minutes so give me your next legitimate question heeb i think that was a legitimate question so i m just going to say you didn t want to answer yes or no on that shelton wow well okay i m sorry i don t know why i thought this would be a good conversation could you give my answer which i think was more that it would be superficial to try to say yes or no to is the fed an independent agency and then sort of give my enlarged answer in terms of the intermingling with the relationship between treasury and the fed advertisement heeb i think we re saying the same thing in a different way you re saying you think it would be superficial to say yes or no and i was just saying that you weren t saying yes or no shelton that s a hot button issue it s the kind where people will say oh she doesn t believe in the independence of the federal reserve so then it will take a longer answer whereas i suppose it s easy to say no it s 100 percent independent and they should never even talk to each other that it should be more strict and i don t think they should be allowed to read newspapers you could say that but i don t think that s realistic i would say my most true answer in my opinion is that you choose professional people they rise to the position and they have integrity and they don t wear blinders but they always choose what they think is the best way to fulfill their responsibilities and i just think you give responsible people the benefit of the doubt that they are not unduly influenced that the primary goal of their service is to conduct it responsibly i don t think people are intimidated or they wouldn t be in that position heeb okay well we can move on here i recently read that you were against the fed s dual mandate there have been growing debates about how inflation should be measured even at these conferences in chicago this week what do you think the fed s mandate should be and what yardsticks should be used for measurement shelton on the dual mandate it s another one of those concepts that has taken on sacrosanct importance i wonder how much people really go back and read that legislation the humphrey hawkins legislation from 42 years ago and that was a time when i think there was a certain amount of hubris those are the phillips curve days the idea that government could fine tune economic performance and could chart it there was an overemphasis on econometrics in the quantitative approach to running the economy and controlling it that you had this perfect trade off between unemployment and inflation the mandate just said maximizing employment okay so i don t know if that s the fed s job or how you then define it we re certainly at minimal unemployment right now a 50 year low or 49 year low advertisement stable prices stable usually means no movement if that is the sacrosanct mandate then we get back into really interesting if you go back and look at the transcripts when janet yellen and alan greenspan were talking about why 2 percent versus 0 percent what is stable i mean if it s a value of a house and you have 2 percent inflation for 10 years 20 years that means the price changes what 20 to 40 percent during your ownership of your house is that still relevant is 2 percent right is it good to sort of incentivize people i think that was the argument that yellen made again the transcripts i really recommend they re fascinating to read because she convinced alan greenspan and he was probably more a zero change in prices guy a zero delta guy and she made a good case basically to say workers want to see a nominal increase in their wages it s very keynesian that ultimately money illusion even though you re not any wealthier if all prices go up two percent there s still an incentive if there are sticky wages downward nobody wants to have flat income or negative so you build in this little cushion that makes it look like you re getting ahead that s more economics as a social science and i think she got a lot of that from her husband it s very well known in that field so those are interesting arguments but to just say the fed s mandate is stable prices and not comment about why the 2 percent or some people are four percent or even six percent to give the fed more room to maneuver those are interesting questions not answered by that quote dual mandate and then to me it s actually a triple mandate that people seem to forget the third element is in the same sentence it was the maximum employment price stability and moderate long term interest rates what happened to that we have the 10 year now lower than the 3 month what happened to moderate long term interest rates that disappeared when the fed became much more activist following 2008 i don t understand why people call it the dual mandate and then they don t bring up that it was actually three things you could say from a saver s point of view that not being compensated for retirement when you re as trump used to say during the campaign people who have done all the right things to put money in savings accounts are getting creamed that was his word but i thought he was absolutely right about that maybe low rates are good for developers but they sure don t give adequate compensation to people who are saving to put away for retirement in a responsible way i wish the fed would have been more concerned about the third and for no reason less important aspect of the mandate it was a triple mandate heeb okay i have a few questions if we could just back up a little bit as far as maximum employment you said you don t know if that s the fed s job you would be against that as a congressionally mandated task for the fed advertisement shelton well what do they mean by that because what was the fed doing differently when we had high unemployment a few years before and then when the trump administration came in and we got some other things going like reducing the regulatory burden and i think a better environment from a tax point of view for business and entrepreneurship i think people are starting to see potential movement and getting an improved trade reform set of policies in place now we have low unemployment but the fed was the same fed during all of that and if people are saying the fed should maximize employment will you do that by lowering rates or raising rates i find people start arguing without knowing what they really want the fed to do are negative rates good for employment is that what people mean when they say the fed should maximize employment does that always mean they should lower the interest rate because i think some labor groups had thought that but maybe now they re reconsidering to me the only thing that really matters from a jobs point of view is getting productive economic growth you don t just want the fed to do things that are good for investors who arbitrage differential interest rates or who speculate on currencies you want to see what we re starting to get which is increased productivity which then justifies the increased wages those are things that i think have more to do with other policies that the government can be involved with including infrastructure i don t think the fed can create that i don t think just by raising or lowering interest rates you can you can create productive jobs so i would just leave it at that heeb so the mandate should be productivity growth shelton i do think stable money is very important i think you ll find many central banks that s their only mandate monetary stability you could say that and that s not very controversial advertisement but i just think that there are other factors including people s confidence about economic growth you could look at fed policies now on paying interest on excess reserves does that or does that not disincentivize banks to make loans it s the loans to small businesses or consumer loans or mortgages the kind of community bank loans that i think help to create jobs so the fed is a factor but there it might not be the rate of the interest it s whether banks decide that it s easier to leave the money sitting at the fed and collecting interest for doing nothing or to actively seek risky loans by definition the kind of loans that create more small businesses and lead to more employment i would say i want the fed s actions not to discourage employment just by raising or lowering rates if that s all the fed can do that s why i m looking at mechanisms for how they do it not just whether they re going up or down i think you had written something saying that i m in favor of zero interest rates or near zero i m not commenting i try to go out of my way to say i don t know what the interest rate should be i don t think anyone does i think that s the whole issue of you have a central bank thinking that it s smarter than the free market in terms of what the interest rates should be based on the supply of loanable funds and the demand for loanable funds i m not saying what it should be what i m talking about is a mechanism that rewards banks and pays them 2 35 percent interest for doing nothing i think that is not good for employment heeb would you instead use manipulating the balance sheet as opposed to these it sounds like you want to eliminate the interest rate on excess reserves shelton that s the primary way that they raise and lower the interest rate that was meant to be an emergency measure at the time everyone including ben bernanke thought that if you inject all this liquidity into the system in the wake of the meltdown in 2008 that that was an assumption that if you increase base money and we have the normal multiplier effect that you re looking at excessive inflation down the road and so bernanke wanted to move up the timetable for paying interest on excess reserves to lock up those reserves because then he said with all these people saying what about inflation down the line if you re going to have all of this quantitative easing he said i can stop inflation in 15 minutes that s because all you would have to do is keep raising it to the level where banks would say why should i make any loans i mean what if i could get 10 percent from the fed advertisement the point is that became a way to prevent the inflation that everyone expected when we didn t get the inflation that s when i think the fed should have been saying why is that the dog that s not barking why aren t we seeing an increase in the cpi because the goal of pumping the money in was to make it easy for companies with this low cost of capital to invest in expanded plant and equipment and then to hire people so then that would start helping that was the idea that you would be hiring these people and you d be paying them because now you had expanded production capabilities that their aggregate level of wages gave them increased purchasing power and that would have put pressure on the cpi and you would have seen the inflation so when we didn t see that after so many years i think we should have said it was a reasonable experiment maybe by the fed but where is that money going and maybe it s not doing what we thought instead of buying or investing in expansion maybe companies were buying back their own shares to a larger degree than anyone would have thought and maybe already wealthy investors are getting access to margin accounts at near zero rates where they can invest in the market and maybe governments had the opportunity to borrow big time at low rates and lock in low rates those were the unanticipated consequences where i think then the fed should have said that maybe the model isn t working the way we thought heeb you mentioned that no one knows what the interest rate should be shelton instead of saying no one knows i m just saying that having studied the soviet economy i think we had the experiment that was showing what works better central planning or market mechanisms and i m saying market mechanisms give you better outcomes in a sense by having a committee of people decide what the interest rate should be that s a closer model to central planning than having the free market find the interest rate that is appropriate for the cost of capital that s what we re pricing in the market the cost of capital and that s the interest rate i m just saying there are people who have funds they could lend and there are people who could use funds because they see productive investment opportunities and normally banks would be the financial intermediaries that charge the interest rate that allows them to connect the source to the use hopefully in the most productive way because they re good at judging risk and return and that s why we have banks heeb i m going back a few questions because i forgot to ask a follow up here you mentioned the two percent inflation target you said some people want four or six percent do you have a target advertisement shelton my sense would be genuine price stability is really i mean my ideal would be zero stable prices mean stable heeb so zero percent inflation shelton well yeah price stability means stability i m not saying the cpi measures everything i m not saying the pce measures everything what would you really want to do is the level of money and credit in an economy is calibrated to stable consistent price signals that are conveyed through time that would be the ideal heeb you said in a financial times interview the fed has a soviet style power over markets as a board member you would get just one vote and the framework would be largely the same as it is now so why do you want to be part of that shelton i don t think i want to answer that i think it would be presumptuous but i think it s good to have fresh thinking and to challenge it s hard to do i mean i will say that within the current structure i don t believe in just pulling the rug out from people and coming in and trying to blow it all up i think consistency and moving toward a better place i would want to be having the conversations asking the fed and i m very pleased to see the fed is already doing this going through self evaluation is the federal reserve functioning in a way that is setting up optimal conditions for productive economic growth advertisement i would start by looking just very generally we see around the world i think we re up to 11 trillion in securities that or have a negative interest rate and i think that situation has been largely engineered by central banks i think we have to say what is the role of central banks in a productive economy and are they helping or hurting i think it s legitimate to say are they too dominant or does it turn out that they only serve a small segment of the private sector and what is their interaction with governments and what is their impact on currency those are all the questions we should be talking about at a very basic level i m happy for the new open debate on all of these issues heeb what do you think of the fed saying it s ready to act if trade conditions worsen a lot of people saw that as a signal that they could lower rates shelton i think the market is a little bit kabuki theater and over responds in both directions to comments the fed doesn t wear blinders and is watching developments economic and political all the time as it should that was kind of just an obvious statement but i think the market grasps at clippings and overreacts for better or worse heeb but what about the actual policy move to make that statement does that signal that tariffs are hurting the american economy or have the potential to shelton what we re going through on all of that has more to do with negotiating toward a better overall trading platform more of a level playing field i see that as necessary and especially with china that had been neglected for too long and i think in the end we ll end up in a good place advertisement heeb what is necessary the tariffs or the fed response shelton i think it s appropriate on trade to use the levers that you have to work with your trade partners especially in these bilateral agreements i think that we needed to confront china and and work out a better relationship that s more equitable with more access to their markets that s just one factor in the economic outlook that the fed takes into consideration heeb are there any conditions that would call for tightening monetary policy shelton i think just the classic ones the fed is now saying that they are willing to overshoot the two percent target because they were undershooting for so long i would think that at some point we would be using if we re doing a path to phase out of paying banks on excess reserves because i think that s going to be challenged that whole practice then the fed still has 3 6 trillion in its portfolio that it can interact but then that s going to these other questions of should the fed be trying to engineer an artificial interest rate i think that s when you cause distortions heeb you support the gold standard but i haven t seen a lot of details about how it would be implemented advertisement shelton first of all whenever you see that please please try to figure out what do people mean when they attribute that to me do they mean a gold standard where we only have 261 million ounces so i don t understand do people really think that i m saying that somehow about 300 or 350 billion or so i d have to calculate it out but not a big chunk is that what they re talking about or are they talking about where during like the classical international standard i mean the government didn t stand ready to convert all they did is look at what thomas jefferson wrote on the establishment of a money unit the united states you just declare what is your measurement what do we call the us dollar he did it as so many grains of silver or so many grains of gold and you just define it bretton woods was something completely different where only a foreign central bank had the right to convert dollars into gold i m not sure what people mean when they attribute that to me or what they think i m suggesting what i said is that it s a good way to look at the virtues of what you want your monetary system to provide in terms of a monetary integrity or price signal clarity or international system of sorts that sovereign countries can voluntarily agree to abide by what do you want and do you have a universal reference or benchmark so that other countries could voluntarily agree to abide by certain rules on currency relationships it doesn t have to be gold gold is the cliche but if someone wants to suggest something different i ve heard people say sand or water or oil i just haven t seen anything better than gold heeb you re not in favor of pegging a currency to the price of gold shelton when you say pegging what do you mean by that what are you asking me heeb when a currency is defined in terms of advertisement shelton i m sure i ve never said that the fed should have a price rule to ratchet up or down interest rates in accordance with the daily price of gold but i m sure that if anything i would have said a price rule i don t think is a good idea i ve never suggested that i m not badmouthing the gold standard i m saying look to see what you like about prior systems that have worked and see if we could develop a future system that would incorporate the virtues of things that worked in the past heeb but you haven t favored a system in which the value of a currency is defined in terms of the price of gold shelton i m just saying that it s way too easy to toss out the term when the government overspends you could say oh we should just have a gold standard because then you have some discipline because then there s kind of a fiscal price to pay you could lose gold and then that shrinks your money supply and then that puts the brakes on if you re overinflating or whatever you re doing wrong i mean there s lots of aspects to it but you really have to be careful about what you mean to just say oh you favor the gold standard i would just say if you re talking about the classical international gold standard like alan greenspan like robert mundell the nobel prize winner i recognize the virtues of when we had an international voluntary currency system that honored the sovereignty of countries and that was based on their own self discipline and not say like we have problems with the euro because if one country kind of blows it whether it s greece or italy or portugal it doesn t threaten the whole system those are those are things we should be talking about advertisement see also

here spiked higher this week the chart below shows the difference the spread between what it costs the us government to borrow money over ten years and what it costs over two once this number turns negative the yield curve has inverted which almost always signals a recession although perhaps not for up to two years the curve between the three month and the ten year is now inverted but with the federal reserve america s central bank this week sounding much more likely to cut short term interest rates the rate on the two year slid faster than the rate on the ten year thus the yield curve between them steepened let s see how long it lasts though the gap between the yield on the ten year us treasury and that on the two year going back three months gold measured in dollar terms had a good week investors are getting nervous and they also like the idea that the fed might cut rates a dovish fed combined with positive inflation is good news for gold it means monetary policy is

although there was a tiny bit of relief for the us and japan as the fed hinted that the powell put might be around the corner but the yield on the german bund kept sliding to fresh record lows as

average fell to 215 000 while weekly claims came in at 218 000 flat on last week which was revised higher from 215 000 us stocks typically don t peak until after this four week moving average has hit a low for the cycle and a recession tends to follow about a year later although of course this is from a tiny sample size so maybe we ve already peaked but maybe we ll see another trough still too early to call us jobless claims four week moving average since january 2016 the oil price as measured by brent crude the international european benchmark continued to slide although it benefited towards the end of the week from the more risk on mood brent crude oil three months internet giant amazon again moved in line with the wider market bouncing as the fed spoke soothingly to investors

thirty years have passed since heavily armed chinese troops backed by tanks moved through the suburbs of beijing on the night of june 3 4 1989 killing hundreds probably thousands of unarmed civilians the military forces overwhelmed makeshift barricades with brute force as they made their way to tiananmen square the site of weeks of mass protests by students and workers those barbaric events which demonstrated the willingness of the stalinist chinese communist party ccp regime to do anything to stay in power have gone down in history as the tiananmen square massacre yet most of the deaths during that murderous assault were of workers who courageously tried to halt the progress of troops to central beijing estimates vary but up to 7 000 were killed and 20 000 wounded moreover in the reign of terror that followed throughout china it was the workers who received the harshest penalties including lengthy jail terms and death sentences around 40 000 people were arrested just in june and july mostly members of workers autonomous federations that had sprung up in the course of the protests protesters in tiananmen square what is commonly depicted as the crushing of student protesters was in fact a wave of repression directed overwhelmingly against a mass movement of the working class what had begun in april as student protests calling for democratic reforms had swelled into the millions as workers joined the demonstrations by mid may making their own class demands the beijing workers autonomous federation was established on april 20 with a handful of workers and rapidly expanded to become a major organising centre by mid may on may 17 up to two million people marched through the centre of beijing the majority being workers and their families under the banners of their work units or enterprises reflecting the impact of events in beijing workers autonomous federations were established in a host of major cities including changsha shaoyang xiangtan hengyang and yueyang while moderate student leaders were intent on pressing the ccp bureaucracy for concessions on democratic rights workers were animated by concerns over deteriorating living standards soaring inflation and a wave of sackings and closures the regime s embrace of the capitalist market since the 1970s had led to widening social inequality and rampant bureaucratic corruption and profiteering workers were bitterly hostile to the accumulation of privileges and wealth by the top ccp leaders such as deng xiaoping li peng zhao ziyang jiang zemin chen yun and their family members and were contemptuous of their claims to be communist and socialist a statement by workers issued on may 25 expressed the rebellious currents in the working class our nation was created by the struggle and labour of we workers and all other mental and manual labourers we are the rightful masters of this nation we must be heard in national affairs we must not allow this small band of degenerate scum of the nation and the working class to usurp our name and suppress the students murder democracy and trample human rights premier zhao ziyang had been sympathetic to the demands of student leaders and had counselled making small concessions to calls for basic democratic rights however no compromise was possible with the working class whose unrest threatened the very existence of the regime as the protest movement rapidly grew in size and confidence paramount leader deng xiaoping removed his ally zhao as premier installed hardline li peng in his place and ordered the military to violently suppress the protests in beijing and nationally the crisis of stalinism the resort to such extreme measures was bound up with the profound crisis of stalinism not only in china but internationally in response to deepening economic and social crises a turn was underway in china eastern europe and the soviet union toward the dismantling of centralised bureaucratic planning mechanisms encouragement of private enterprise and establishment of market mechanisms after assuming the leadership of the communist party of the soviet union in 1985 mikhail gorbachev introduced his keynote policies of perestroika restructuring and glasnost openness and transparency that laid the framework for greater autonomy for enterprises outside the central planning mechanisms and under the guise of democratic reform sought to establish a base of social support for the regime among the petty bourgeoisie gorbachev s pro market restructuring also encouraged the stalinist regimes in eastern europe in their plans for capitalist restoration making desperate bids to resolve their mounting economic and political crises these processes dramatically accelerated as gorbachev signaled that the soviet union would not intervene militarily to prop up its soviet bloc allies as it had done in hungary in 1956 to crush the workers uprising and in czechoslovakia in 1968 to end liberal reforms in december 1987 he announced the withdrawal of 500 000 soviet troops from eastern europe in a very short period of time during 1989 90 the stalinist bureaucracies in one eastern european country after another moved to restore capitalism dismantling what remained of nationalised property relations and centralised planning in poland talks between the government and opposition solidarity leaders resulted in a deal in april 1989 to hold limited elections this paved the way for the installation in august of solidarity leader tadeusz mazowiecki as prime minister he unleashed sweeping pro market restructuring similar negotiations in hungary where the processes of pro market restructuring were already advanced led to a new constitution in august 1989 multi party elections in may 1990 resulted in a government that junked what remained of centralised planning and carried out wholesale privatisation amid a mounting economic and political crisis gorbachev visited berlin in october 1989 to urge the east german government to accelerate pro market reforms erich honecker resigned as leader two weeks later on november 9 the government announced the end of all border restrictions and berlin citizens tore down the hated berlin wall before the end of the month west german chancellor helmut kohl unveiled a plan to integrate east germany with capitalist west germany a process that was completed by october 1990 the collapse of the stalinist regimes in czechoslovakia romania and bulgaria quickly followed by the end of 1990 governments throughout eastern europe were giving full rein to the plunder of state owned property an influx of foreign capital and the dismantling of social services leading to a precipitous deterioration in living standards gorbachev s policies in the soviet union gave rise to intense pressures within the stalinist bureaucracy and the emerging layer of entrepreneurs for a far speedier dismantling of all fetters on private ownership and market relations this found expression in the installation of boris yeltsin in july 1991 and the implementation of pro market shock therapy in december 1991 the soviet union was formally dissolved the break up of the soviet union and collapse of the stalinist states in eastern europe led to an orgy of triumphalism in the capitalist media proclaiming the end of socialism pundits politicians and academics who had foreseen nothing and could explain nothing exulted over the triumph of the market even going so far as to pronounce the end of history in other words capitalism supposedly represented the highest and final stage of human development a new period of peace prosperity and democracy would dawn they all declared the international committee of the fourth international icfi based on the analysis made by leon trotsky of stalinism had rejected the universal adulation of gorbachev and warned that his policies were rapidly leading to the dismantling of the gains of the first workers state its perspectives resolution entitled the world capitalist crisis and the tasks of the fourth international published in august 1988 made clear that the breakdown of the soviet union was not a product of socialism but rather of stalinism and its reactionary autarchic conception of socialism in one country the very real crisis of the soviet economy is rooted in its enforced isolation from the resources of the world market and the international division of labour there are only two ways this crisis can be tackled the way proposed by gorbachev involves the dismantling of state industry the renunciation of the planning principle and the abandonment of the state monopoly on foreign trade i e the reintegration of the soviet union into the structure of world capitalism the alternative to this reactionary solution requires the smashing of imperialism s domination over the world economy by linking up the soviet and international working class in a revolutionary offensive aimed at extending the planned economy into the european north american and asian citadels of capitalism in the aftermath of the dissolution of the soviet union the icfi identified the root cause of the crisis of stalinism in the processes of the globalisation of production that had been underway since the late 1970s which had undermined all programs based on national economic regulation while the crisis of stalinism was the most immediate and acute expression these same processes lay behind the international embrace of pro market restructuring by social democratic and labour parties and trade unions and their abandonment of any defence of the social rights of the working class capitalist restoration in china the events in eastern europe and the soviet union had a profound impact in china where processes of capitalist restoration had been underway since the 1970s the ccp s decision in june 1989 to use the military to brutally suppress the working class was in no small measure conditioned by its longstanding fear of a repetition in china of the mass strike movement in poland in 1980 81 that led to the formation of the solidarity trade union china specialist maurice meisner explained that the involvement of masses of workers in the protests in tiananmen square on may 17 did much to rekindle the polish fear among party leaders their decade old obsession about the rise of a solidarity type alliance between workers and intellectuals in opposition to the communist state and that fear in turn contributed to their fateful decision to impose martial law while deng xiaoping recognised the affinity of gorbachev s perestroika with the policies that he had already enacted he did not embrace the political liberalisation of glasnost fearing it would undermine the foundations of the ccp regime when gorbachev visited beijing in mid may 1989 to cement closer sino soviet ties the chinese leadership kept him closeted from public view anxious that his presence would give further impetus to the protests in tiananmen square the rapid collapse of the stalinist regimes in eastern europe only heightened the determination of the ccp bureaucracy to suppress any opposition the roots of the crisis in china lay in the outcome of the 1949 chinese revolution the monumental events that brought the chinese communist party to power ended more than a century of imperialist oppression that had mired the country of more than 500 million in squalor and backwardness it expressed the aspirations of the vast majority of the population for economic security basic democratic and social rights and a decent standard of living decades of political upheaval and a war against japanese imperialism from 1937 to 1945 had ravaged the country and left an estimated 14 million chinese soldiers and civilians dead like the soviet bureaucracy however the new ccp apparatus was based on the reactionary nationalist program of socialism in one country which was a repudiation of socialist internationalism and leon trotsky s theory of permanent revolution which underpinned the october revolution in russia in 1917 as a result the course of the revolution and the subsequent evolution of the people s republic of china prc proclaimed by mao zedong in 1949 was distorted and deformed by stalinism which dominated the ccp in the wake of stalin s betrayal of the second chinese revolution of 1925 27 stalin subordinated the very young ccp to the bourgeois nationalist kuomintang resulting in crushing blows to the chinese communists and working class in april 1927 and again in may 1927 ccp leaders and members who supported trotsky s analysis of the tragedy were expelled in the wake of the 1949 chinese revolution the pragmatic nationalist ideology of maoism led china rapidly into a blind alley mao s perspective of a new democracy sought to maintain a bloc with the national bourgeoisie but the ccp government was driven under conditions of the korean war and the internal sabotage by bourgeois and petty bourgeois elements to go further than intended by 1956 virtually every aspect of the economy was nationalised and subject to bureaucratic planning along the lines of the soviet union but the working class had no say through its own democratic organs the organic hostility of the maoist regime to the working class was expressed in its repression of chinese trotskyists all of whom were jailed in 1952 amid the rising resistance by workers as with the eastern european states the fourth international characterised china as a deformed workers state a highly conditional formula that placed the emphasis on the deformed bureaucratic character of the regime the national autarky of socialism in one country generated worsening economic and social turmoil and crises for which the ccp bureaucracy had no solution leading to bitter internal factional warfare mao s fanciful scheme for a peasant socialist society which underpinned his great leap forward ended in economic catastrophe and mass starvation his factional opponents led by liu shaoqi followed the soviet model of bureaucratic planning with its emphasis on heavy industry but this provided no alternative the economic crisis was greatly worsened by the 1961 63 split with the soviet union and the withdrawal of soviet aid and advisers as the two stalinist regimes advanced their conflicting national interests in a last desperate bid to oust his rivals mao unleashed the cultural revolution in 1966 which rapidly span out of his control leading to confused and convulsive social struggles that threatened the very existence of the regime mao turned to the military to suppress workers who had taken literally his edict to bombard the headquarters resulting in mass strikes in shanghai and the formation of an independent shanghai people s commune in 1967 incapable of resolving the immense economic and social problems wracking the country and facing a military confrontation with the soviet union the ccp bureaucracy forged an anti soviet alliance with us imperialism that laid the basis for china s integration into global capitalism while deng xiaoping is generally credited with initiating market reforms mao s rapprochement with us president richard nixon in 1972 was the essential political and diplomatic pre condition for foreign investment and increased trade with the west the process of opening and reform went hand in hand with the imposition of strict discipline and emphasis on boosting production in workplaces maurice meissner noted factory managers dismissed during the cultural revolution were restored to their former posts accompanied by calls to strengthen managerial authority labour discipline and factory rules and regulations and to struggle against anarchism and ultra leftism there were dramatic increases in foreign trade and in imports of foreign technology veteran party leaders attacked during the cultural revolution were rehabilitated at an increasingly rapid pace by 1973 it has been noted the pre cultural revolution cadres were running the government ministries from 1969 to 1975 the value of foreign trade increased from us4 billion to 14 billion per annum from the end of 1972 until mid 1975 china imported whole industrial plants valued at 2 8 billion mainly from japan and western europe deng xiaoping who had been ostracised during the cultural revolution as the no 2 capitalist roader was rehabilitated appointed a vice premier of the state council under zhou enlai deng led the chinese delegation to a special session of the un in 1974 where he declared that the socialist bloc no longer existed and china was part of the third world in the factional power struggle that followed mao s death in 1976 deng emerged as the dominant figure in the stalinist bureaucracy he embraced us imperialism ever more closely formalising diplomatic relations in 1979 launching a border war against neighbouring vietnam and defending us allies such as the chilean dictator augusto pinochet from 1978 deng greatly accelerated the reform and opening pro market reforms four special economic zones sezs were established in 1979 in shenzhen zhuhai shantou and xiamen where foreign entrepreneurs and joint ventures produced goods for export and enjoyed tax breaks and other concessions a similar system was later implemented in key port cities such as shanghai in the countryside the collectivised communes were dismantled and restrictions removed on the operation of private enterprises prices for agricultural produce were lifted in the cities moves were made to transform thousands of state owned enterprises into profit making corporations private enterprises were permitted the market was increasingly allowed to determine prices for consumer goods and a labour market was initiated allowing the hiring and firing of workers the pro market reforms led to the rapid rise of social inequality millions of former peasants were left landless and forced to seek employment in the cities in the sezs where the capitalist market was given free rein corruption and criminal activity was rampant including smuggling bribery and the theft of state owned property the sons and daughters of the top party leaders took full advantage of their political connections to establish their own business empires with the lifting of price restrictions inflation rocketed to 18 5 percent in 1988 to which the regime responded by drastically reducing credit and re imposing import restrictions hundreds of thousands of workers lost their jobs as private enterprises reduced their workforces or closed down altogether unemployment the loss of job security as well as skyrocketing prices combined with disgust at the corruption and enrichment of ccp bureaucrats fueled the social unrest that erupted in the mass protests by workers the following year capitalist restoration following tiananmen square in the aftermath of the bloody crackdown in tiananmen square and the police dragnet throughout the country the factional battle inside the ccp leadership sharpened in the next three years over deng s program of capitalist restoration in ordering the troops against workers and students deng had removed his chief ally in pro market restructuring zhao ziyang as premier former shanghai party leader jiang zemin was installed as a compromise choice to the top post of ccp secretary general the initiative shifted to the so called hardliners li peng and chen yun who in criticising zhao were also criticising deng s policies however in advocating restrictions on market relations li and chen based their policies on the status quo ante and the nationalist perspective of socialism in one country which had already proven to be a dead end they were looking toward the soviet union even as the deformed workers states in eastern europe were collapsing and gorbachev s policies were undermining centralised planning and nationalised property relations their so called soviet faction represented sections of the chinese bureaucracy whose power and privileges resided in their control of key sections of state owned industry and the central apparatus in beijing at the fifth plenum in november 1989 li delivered the main report based on the recommendations of a revived state planning commission the adopted plan called for cutting inflation to 10 percent in 1990 and economic growth to 5 percent by maintaining tight controls on credit and balancing the national budget rural industries would not be allowed to compete with state owned enterprises while keeping the sezs and open door policy in place the new restrictions hit rural and provincial industries particularly in the south of the country while deng no longer held any official party or state position he still retained considerable political clout especially in the southern provinces where the new profit making industries were concentrated deng had sided with the hardliners in opposing any political liberalisation and above all supported the 1989 military crackdown but he was adamant that the restrictions on private enterprises and foreign investment had to be completely dismantled the snowballing crisis in the soviet union brought matters to a head an attempted stalinist putsch in august 1991 to oust gorbachev and yeltsin and wind back their program of pro market restructuring ended in dismal failure china scholar michael marti explained this one event changed the thinking about the political equation within the chinese leadership including that of deng xiaoping the failure of the soviet red army to support the communist party of the soviet union in its bid to regain control threw the ccp into a panic the chinese leadership feared that a precedent had been established the factional battle lines were drawn while the soviet faction began to call into question the entire agenda of pro market reforms including the establishment of the sezs deng insisted that the levels of economic growth were too low to maintain employment and social stability if the economy cannot be boosted over a long time he told a meeting of party elders as far back as late 1989 it will lose people s support at home and will be oppressed and bullied by other nations the continuation of this situation will lead to the collapse of the communist party deng was also concerned that the crisis in the soviet union following the collapse of stalinism in eastern europe would greatly change geo political relations not only had deng s strategy sought to balance between the us and the soviet union but his economic policies depended on a large influx of foreign investment which could potentially shift to exploiting new opportunities opening up in the former soviet republics along with provincial leaders in the southern provinces deng counted on the support of people s liberation army pla the generals had been shocked by the way in which us imperialism and its allies had deployed hi tech weaponry in the 1990 91 gulf war to rapidly destroy the iraqi military their conclusion was that china had to invest heavily in modernising the pla and only deng s policies could transform the economy and produce the growth needed to supply that investment deng set out on his southern tour in january february 1992 just 20 days after the formal liquidation of the soviet union in december 1991 accompanied by top generals the state security chief qiao shi and party elder bo yibo as he visited the sezs and southern cities he declared that there would be no reversal of economic policies in the face of the soviet collapse dismissing concerns about growing social inequality he is said to have declared let some people get rich first in a showdown with chen yun in shanghai deng reportedly shouted any leader who cannot boost the economy should leave office openly backing capitalist restoration he declared we should absorb more foreign capital and more foreign advanced experiences and technologies and set up more foreign invested enterprises do not fear when others say we are practicing capitalism capitalism is nothing fearsome deng prevailed opening the door for wholesale capitalist restoration that transformed the whole country into a giant free trade zone for the exploitation of cheap chinese labour the crocodile tears shed by western politicians over the tiananmen square massacre were rapidly cast aside as foreign investors recognised that the police state regime in beijing was willing to use any method no matter how brutal to discipline the working class in 1993 the ccp proclaimed that its objective was a socialist market economy giving a threadbare socialist disguise to its embrace of capitalism in 1994 the ccp formally established a labour market by legitimising the sale and purchase of labour power state owned enterprises were corporatised into companies run for profit the unprofitable ones were restructured or shut down the better equipped in sectors not designated as strategic were sold off or converted into subsidiaries of foreign transnationals a small number were preserved as state owned national flagships between 1996 and 2005 the number of employees in state and collective owned enterprises halved from 144 million to 73 million workers along with guaranteed life time employment the iron rice bowl of cradle to grave services was also dismantled essential services that had previously been provided by state owned enterprises childcare education health care and pensions were now left to individual workers chinese capitalism today the restoration of capitalism in china over the past 30 years has only exacerbated the underlying social tensions within chinese society and compounded the political and geo political dilemmas confronting the ccp apparatus the extraordinary economic expansion of china to become the world s second largest economy has rested in the first place on the immense gains of the 1949 revolution that unified china for the first time in decades created an educated and skilled workforce and developed basic industries and essential infrastructure the flood of foreign investment into the country transformed china into the sweatshop of the world and produced a massive 11 fold increase in the economy between 1992 and 2010 this rapid growth however did not reflect an inherent strength of the chinese economy but rather its role in the world economy dependent on foreign investment and technology the imperialist powers above all the united states were more than willing to exploit cheap chinese labour as long as china s economic expansion did not challenge their own established geo political interests however the vast quantity of raw materials and energy that chinese industries require from around the world have increasingly brought it into conflict with the us and other major powers in asia africa the middle east and internationally moreover as china has sought to create its own hi tech national champions such as huawei and zte the us under the trump administration has declared economic war on beijing not just in matters of trade it has openly opposed chinese plans to develop and expand hi tech industries and to more closely link eurasia to china through massive infrastructure projects under beijing s belt and road initiative the delusion promoted by ccp leaders that china could through a peaceful rise become a world power on a parity with the us has been shattered china s expansion has brought it into conflict with the global imperialist order dominated by the united states under obama and now trump the us has begun using all means at its disposal to ensure its continued global hegemony trump s economic war goes hand in hand with a military build up in the indo pacific escalating naval provocations in the south china sea under the guise of freedom of navigation operations and more open preparations for a war between the two nuclear armed powers the ccp leadership has no answer to the mounting danger of war other than desperately seeking an accommodation with imperialism while engaging in a frenetic arms race that can only end in catastrophe for the working class in china and internationally capitalist restoration far from strengthening china s capacity to counter the us has greatly weakened it the regime is organically incapable of making any appeal to the international working class as that would inevitably lead to social struggles by the working class at home having abandoned even its previous nominal commitment to socialism and internationalism the ccp has increasing relied on whipping up chinese nationalism to try to create a social base in layers of the middle class there is nothing progressive about chinese chauvinism and patriotism which divides chinese workers from their class brothers and sisters internationally and within china from non han chinese minorities its repressive measures against uighurs tibetans and other ethnic groups have provided an opening that the us is seeking to exploit under the bogus banner of human rights washington is promoting separatist groups as part of its ambition to fracture and subordinate china to its interests thirty years after the tiananmen square massacre the ccp leadership is terrified of a renewal of working class opposition the first stirrings of which have been seen in the more numerous reports of workers strikes and protests and significantly over the past year in a turn by a layer of university students to assist workers in their struggles since 1989 the working class in china has vastly expanded to an estimated 400 million and as a proportion of the population one indicator is the growth of the country s urban population from just 26 4 percent of the total in 1990 to 58 5 percent in 2017 the ccp leadership boasts of having lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty using the un s very austere measures of poverty such benchmarks ignore the many factors that are fueling discontent among workers including the common practice of late or unpaid wages unhealthy and dangerous factory conditions harsh corporate disciplinary practices and the lack of basic social rights for tens of millions of internal migrants in the cities all of these oppressive conditions are monitored and policed by the all china federation of trade unions which functions as an arm of the ccp bureaucracy in workplaces capitalist restoration has produced a dramatic rise in social inequality from one of the most equal societies in the world china has become one of the most unequal countries it is home to more dollar billionaires than any other country except the united states while chinese workers struggle to survive on the minimum wage of 370 a month the wealthiest individual tencent chairman pony ma has a personal fortune of almost 40 billion these super rich oligarchs who in many cases have built their fortunes through naked corruption and the looting of state owned property are represented in the chinese communist party and sit on powerful advisory bodies the gulf between the super rich and the vast majority of the workers and the poor is generating huge social tensions that sooner rather than later will explode on a scale that will eclipse the rebellion by workers and students 30 years ago the lesson drawn by the stalinist leadership from the 1989 events was that it had to suppress through all available means any expression of opposition that could become the focus of a broader movement against the regime incapable of meeting the pressing social needs of the majority of the population the ccp has vastly expanded its police state apparatus now spending more each year on its internal security forces than it does on external defence the working class must also draw the necessary political lessons from the defeat of that movement in 1989 which was rapidly assuming revolutionary dimensions what was lacking was not determination audacity and courage nor numbers which were rapidly swelling across china but the essential problem facing the international working class in the 20th century the absence of revolutionary leadership james cogan summed up the issue in his analysis ten years since the tiananmen square massacre stating inexperienced politically and lacking a political perspective outside of opposition to the existing regime the workers leaders advanced no alternative to and deferred to the student bodies the workers of china knew in their life experience what they were against stalinism and capitalism but they were not able to articulate any perspective for an alternative social order decades of domination by stalinism and the active suppression of genuine marxism in china meant there was no revolutionary socialist that is trotskyist tendency in the working class no organisation within the country could spontaneously advance the program that was implicit in the actions and sentiments of the chinese working class a political revolution to overthrow the stalinist regime and introduce major reforms into the economy for the benefit of the working class the essential political task of building a trotskyist leadership in the chinese working class as a section of the international committee of the fourth international remains none of the oppositional tendencies that emerged out of the 1989 protests offer a viable political perspective for the working class advocates of independent trade unions such as han dongfang who was prominent in the beijing workers autonomous federation in 1989 have underscored the political bankruptcy of syndicalism by lurching to the right and into the arms of us trade union apparatus in other words of us imperialism a layer of youth intellectuals and workers have turned to maoism and its banal revolutionary slogans for answers capitalist restoration in china however was not a break from maoism it flowed organically out of the dead end of socialism in one country maoism could aptly be termed stalinism with chinese characteristics with its hostility to the working class its emphasis on subjective will and above all its putrid nationalism it is diametrically opposed to genuine marxism that is the perspective of socialist internationalism which alone was upheld by the trotskyist movement including the chinese trotskyists the establishment of a genuinely revolutionary party in china as part of the icfi requires the assimilation of the essential strategic experiences of the international working class of which the chinese revolutions of the 20th century are a critical component the ccp leaders are petrified that workers and youth will begin to work over the lessons of history they attempt to censor and black out any knowledge and discussion of the events of 1989 and continue to perpetrate the lies of stalinism about the course of the 20th century the crucial political lessons of the protracted struggle of trotskyism against stalinism are embedded in the program perspective and documents of the international committee of the fourth international workers and youth should make a serious study of the political issues involved beginning with the documents of the icfi on the tiananmen square massacre republished this week on the world socialist web site

by jesse colombo the financial world has been buzzing nervously about the rapidly rising risk of a recession as warning signs mount though many mainstream economists and commentators are finally starting to concede that a recession in the next year or two is likely almost all of them downplay the likely severity of the coming recession by saying but it will be short lived and we re due for a healthy slowdown after a ten year expansion economists were saying the same thing in 2006 and 2007 too my view however is that virtually everyone is underestimating the tremendous economic risks that have built up globally during the past decade of extremely stimulative monetary policies i believe that these unknown risks are going to rear their ugly heads with a vengeance in the coming recession and that heavily indebted governments will have far less firepower with which to rescue their economies like they did during the 2008 to 2009 global financial crisis according to the new york fed s very accurate yield curve based recession probability model there is a 27 probability of a u s recession in the next 12 months the last time that recession odds were the same as they are now was in early 2007 which was shortly before the great recession officially started in december 2007 talk about too close for comfort the new york fed s recession probability model is based on the 10 year and 3 month treasury yield spread which is the difference between 10 year and 3 month treasury rates in normal economic environments the 10 year treasury yield is higher than the 3 month treasury yield right before a recession however this spread inverts as the 3 month treasury yield actually becomes higher than the 10 year treasury rate this is known as an inverted yield curve as the chart below shows inverted yield curves have preceded all modern recessions the 10 year and 3 month treasury spread inverted in may which started the recession countdown clock the coming recession is likely to be far more severe than the majority of economists expect because global interest rates have been held at record low levels for a record period of time since the great recession which has completely distorted the global economy and created many dangerous bubbles that most people have no clue even exist and that includes most professional economists bubbles form during periods of relatively low interest rates and burst when rates rise that s why most modern financial crises and recessions have occurred as the chart below shows the dot com and housing bubbles both formed during low interest rate periods and burst when rates started to rise make no mistake numerous bubbles have formed during the low interest rate period of the past decade and there is no way of escaping their ultimate popping these bubbles are forming in global debt china hong kong singapore emerging markets canada australia new zealand european real estate the art market u s stocks u s household wealth corporate debt leveraged loans u s student loans u s auto loans tech startups shale energy global skyscraper construction u s commercial real estate the u s restaurant industry u s healthcare and u s housing once again there are likely even morebubbles than i listed we just won t know until they all burst as warren buffett once said only when the tide goes out do you discover who s been swimming naked i believe that the current bubble situation when looked at globally is even worse than it was before the 2008 global financial crisis that s why the coming crisis is actually likely to be far worse than 2008 how s that for an unpopular opinion the global bubbles that have formed in the past decade have been exacerbated by an unconventional central bank policy called quantitative easing or qe qe basically entails creating new money for the purpose of pumping liquidity into the financial system and boosting asset prices the chart below shows how the u s federal reserve s balance sheet grew with each qe program in the past decade the fed s balance sheet grows as it buys assets like bonds to pump more money into the financial system of course the fed wasn t the only central bank that conducted qe programs in the past decade most major central banks did as well which created a tremendous ocean of liquidity that helped to inflate the numerous bubbles around the world as a result of the fed s ultra low interest rates and qe programs the u s stock market as measured by the s p 500 surged 300 higher in the past decade the fed s aggressive inflation of the u s stock market caused stocks to rise at a faster rate than their underlying earnings which means that the market is extremely overvalued right now whenever the market becomes extremely overvalued it s just a matter of time before the market falls to a more reasonable valuation again as the chart below shows the u s stock market is nearly as overvalued as it was in 1929 right before the stock market crash that led to the great depression we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the fed s aggressive inflation of u s stocks bonds and housing prices has created a massive bubble in household wealth u s household wealth is extremely inflated relative to the gdp since 1952 household wealth has averaged 384 of the gdp so the current bubble s 535 figure is in rarefied territory the dot com bubble peaked with household wealth hitting 450 of gdp while household wealth reached 486 of gdp during the housing bubble unfortunately the coming household wealth crash will be proportional to the run up which is why everyone should be terrified of the coming recession not only have more bubbles inflated around the world than in the mid 2000s but governments are far more indebted now government debt is now at 80 of global gdp which means that they have much less firepower with which to rescue their economies in the coming crisis in the case of the u s federal debt as a percent of gdp has never been so high before a recession it s currently at 100 of the gdp vs 62 before the great recession so we are truly in unprecedented times though interest rates have been at ultra low levels for the past decade the sheer amount of u s federal debt over 22 trillion is the reason why interest payments have spiked over the past couple years to make matters worse this debt will eventually need to be refinanced at higher interest rates which means that interest payments will rise even more another recession combined with another ramp up of federal debt and ensuing debt downgrades will cause these payments to rise even more this is how sovereign debt crises happen though the great recession was essentially caused by a debt crisis both public and private u s debt have continued to grow since then the so called u s economic recovery didn t occur in spite of the post great recession debt growth it occurred because of that very debt growth what most people don t understand is that debt creates temporary economic growth by borrowing from the future we re making the same mistakes that we made before 2008 yet expecting different results unfortunately the outcome will be the same as in 2008 if not worse due to the even higher debt load we now have the world has been on an unprecedented debt binge in the past several decades global debt is up by 150 trillion since 2003 and 70 trillion since 2008 as bad as the 2008 crisis was we now have an addition 70 trillion worth of debt to contend with in the coming crisis in virtually every major economy debt has grown at a much faster rate than the underlying gdp in the past several decades as a result of debt growing faster than the underlying economies themselves global debt as a percent of gdp has increased quite substantially in the last several decades the global economy is now saturated with debt which will make it much harder to grow out of the coming recession by taking on even more debt like we did in the past in particular china has binged harder on debt than any other country since the great recession china s gigantic debt mania of the past decade greatly helped to boost its economic growth which made it one of the most important global engines of economic growth in turn essentially china s debt bubble helped to carry the global economy for the last ten years unfortunately china is nearly tapped out and is heading for a bust of its own which will drag down the entire global economy with it there will be no new chinas to binge on debt and carry the global economy after the next global financial crisis no other country has the capacity to throw such a wild debt party to summarize the vast majority of economists and commentators are assuming that the coming recession will be a garden variety recession a mere ebb of the business cycle they re expecting a walk in the park relative to the massive debt and bubble tsunami that i see on the horizon remember this is the exact same crowd who downplayed or completely missed the warning signs of the u s housing bubble and global financial crisis as well apparently this group still has not learned their lesson so they will be taught it once again and we re all going to suffer as a result of their ignorance if you are not terrified by the thought of the coming recession you have no clue about the tremendous risks that have built up in the past decade the risk of a full blown global depression cannot be discounted
u s chamber of commerce threatens to sue president trump over mexican tariffs posted by sundance june 7 2019 the majority of financial media punditry claim orangeman tariffs bad truly it s the stupidest and most disingenuous oft spoken claim with zero foundation in reality chinese tariffs have been in place since july 2017 no measurable inflation on chinese goods steel and aluminum tariffs in place since 2017 again no measurable inflation on core product or finished consumer goods auto tariffs on china now absorbed by gm soft wood tariffs countervailing duties against canadian dumping same result the supply chain results completely refute u s coc tom donohue s doomsayer promised economic proclamations if tariffs are so destructive why was is everyone except the u s using them to protect their industry segments and economies the truth is the financial class and professional multinational lobbyists don t want people to realize the modern trade system was designed to reduce american wealth it s a feature not a flaw the collapse of u s manufacturing did not happen accidentally the rust belt was not created accidentally nafta was not designed accidentally the back door to the u s market was not created accidentally middle class jobs were not lost accidentally wages did not stagnate accidentally all of these results were brought about by specific design who or what was in charge of the plan at the heart of trade agreements over the past 30 years you will find the u s chamber of commerce yes a wall street multinational corporate lobbying group actually wrote three decades of trade agreement language a team of business experts from within the u s coc wrote the terms and conditions of actual trade agreements for reagan reagan bush clinton clinton bush bush and obama obama add it up that s 30 years now look back to when the rust started not coincidentally that s 30 years ago all that stopped with donald trump trillions of dollars of exfiltration stopped by donald trump tens of trillions do you think those big club people are absolutely apoplectic they are well beyond apoplectic they are now batshit crazy angry about it well beyond beyond losing trillions in wealth to main street you know what really drives their anger the big club cannot openly confront president trump on the specifics because his results at reversing their scheme is clear evidence they were the engineers behind the intentional loss of american wealth and standard of living in the first place so they are left shouting at trees tariffs bad tariffs are taxes on american consumers etc etc etc blah blah blah and each day that goes by as empirical evidence that is completely counter to their predictions continues their shouts and protestations look sillier and stupider and yes even more silly watch every element of global economic trade is controlled and exploited by massive institutions multinational banks and multinational corporations institutions like the world trade organization wto world bank and international monetary fund imf control trillions of dollars in economic activity underneath that economic activity there are people who hold the reigns of power over the outcomes these individuals and groups are the stakeholders in direct opposition to principles of america first national economics the modern financial constructs of these entities have been established over the course of the past three decades when you understand how they manipulate the economic system of individual nations you begin to understand why they are so fundamentally opposed to president trump in the western world separate from communist control perspectives ie china global markets are a modern myth nothing more than a talking point meant to keep people satiated with sound bites they might find familiar but the truth is global markets have been destroyed over the past three decades by multinational corporations who control the products formerly contained within global markets the same is true for commodities markets the multinational trade and economic system run by corporations and multinational banks now controls the product outputs of independent nations the free market economic system has been usurped by entities who create what is best described as controlled markets u s president trump smartly understands what has taken place additionally trump uses economic leverage as part of a broader national security policy to understand who opposes president trump specifically because of the economic leverage he creates it becomes important to understand the objectives of the global and financial elite who run and operate the institutions the big club understanding how trillions of trade dollars influence geopolitical policy we begin to understand the three decade global financial construct they seek to protect that is global financial exploitation of national markets four basic elements multinational corporations purchase controlling interests in various national outputs harvests an raw materials and ancillary industries of developed industrial western nations example the multinational corporations making the purchases are underwritten by massive global financial institutions multinational banks note in china it is the communist government underwriting the purchase the multinational banks and the multinational corporations then utilize lobbying interests to manipulate the internal political policy of the targeted nation state s report this ad with control over the targeted national industry or interest the multinationals then leverage export of the national asset exfiltration through trade agreements structured to the benefit of lesser developed nation states where they have previously established a proactive financial footprint against the backdrop of president trump confronting china and against the backdrop of nafta renegotiated and against the necessary need to support the key u s steel industry revisiting the economic influences within the modern import export dynamic will help conceptualize the issues at the heart of the matter there are a myriad of interests within each trade sector that make specific explanation very challenging however here s the basic outline for three decades economic globalism has advanced quickly everyone accepts this statement yet few actually stop to ask who and what are behind this and why influential people with vested financial interests in the process have sold a narrative that global manufacturing global sourcing and global production was the inherent way of the future the same voices claimed the american economy was consigned to become a service driven economy what was always missed in these discussions is that advocates selling this global economy message have a vested financial and ideological interest in convincing the information consumer it is all just a natural outcome of economic progress it s not it s not natural at all it is a process that is entirely controlled promoted and utilized by large conglomerates lobbyists purchased politicians and massive financial corporations again i ll try to retain the larger altitude perspective without falling into the traps of the esoteric weeds i freely admit this is tough to explain and i may not be successful bulletpoint 1 multinational corporations purchase controlling interests in various national elements of developed industrial western nations this is perhaps the most challenging to understand in essence thanks specifically to the way the world trade organization wto was established in 1995 national companies expanded their influence into multiple nations across a myriad of industries and economic sectors energy agriculture raw earth minerals etc this is the basic underpinning of national companies becoming multinational corporations think of these multinational corporations as global entities now powerful enough to reach into multiple nations simultaneously and purchase controlling interests in a single economic commodity a historic reference point might be the original multinational enterprise energy via oil production exxon mobil bp etc however in the modern global world it s not just oil the resource and product procurement extends to virtually every possible commodity and industry from the very visible wheat corn to the obscure small minerals and even flowers bulletpoint 2 the multinational corporations making the purchases are underwritten by massive global financial institutions multinational banks during the past several decades national companies merged the largest lemon producer company in brazil merges with the largest lemon company in mexico merges with the largest lemon company in argentina merges with the largest lemon company in the u s etc etc national companies formerly of one nation become continental companies with control over an entire continent of nations or it could be over several continents or even the entire world market of lemon widget production these are now multinational corporations they hold interests in specific segments this example lemons across a broad variety of individual nations national laws on monopoly building are not the same in all nations most are not as structured as the u s a or other more developed nations with more laws during the acquisition phase when encountering a highly developed nation with monopoly laws the process of an umbrella corporation might be needed to purchase the targeted interests within a specific nation the example of monsantoapplies here bulletpoint 3 the multinational banks and the multinational corporations then utilize lobbying interests to manipulate the internal political policy of the targeted nation state s in underdeveloped countries the process of buying a political outcome is called bribery within the united states we call it lobbying the process is exactly the same with control of the majority of actual lemons the multinational corporation now holds a different set of financial values than a local farmer or national market this is why commodities exchanges are essentially dead in the aggregate the mercantile exchange is no longer a free or supply based market it is now a controlled market exploited by mega sized multinational corporations instead of the traditional supply demand equation determining prices the corporations look to see what nations can afford what prices the supply of the controlled product is then distributed to the country according to their ability to afford the price this is essentially the bastardized and politicized function of the world trade organization wto this is also how the corporations controlling wto policy maximize profits back to the lemons a corporation might hold the rights to the majority of the lemon production in brazil argentina and california florida the price the u s consumer pays for the lemons is directed by the amount of inventory distribution the controlling corporation allows in the u s if the u s lemon harvest is abundant the controlling interests will export the product to keep the u s consumer spending at peak or optimal price a u s customer might pay 2 for a lemon a mexican customer might pay 50 and a canadian 1 25 the bottom line issue is the national supply in this example harvest yield is not driving the national price because the supply is now controlled by massive multinational corporations the mistake people often make is calling this a global commodity process in the modern era this global commodity phrase is particularly nonsense a true global commodity is a process of individual nations harvesting creating a similar product and bringing that product to a global market individual nations each independently engaged in creating a similar product under modern globalism this process no longer takes place it s a complete fraud massive multinational corporations control the majority of production inside each nation and therefore control the global product market and price it is a controlled system example part of the lobbying in the food industry is to advocate for the expansion of u s taxpayer benefits to underwrite the costs of the domestic food products they control by lobbying dc these multinational corporations get congress and policy makers to expand the basis of who can use ebt and snap benefits state reimbursement rates expanding the federal subsidy for food purchases is part of the corporate profit dynamic with increased taxpayer subsidies the food price controllers can charge more domestically and export more of the product internationally taxes via subsidies go into their profit margins the corporations then use a portion of those enhanced profits in contributions to the politicians it s a circle of money in highly developed nations this multinational corporate process requires the corporation to purchase the domestic political process as above with individual nations allowing the exploitation in varying degrees as such the corporate lobbyists pay hundreds of millions to politicians for changes in policies and regulations one sector one product or one industry at a time these are specialized lobbyists example the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius cfius is an inter agency committee authorized to review transactions that could result in control of a u s business by a foreign person covered transactions in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the united states cfius operates pursuant to section 721 of the defense production act of 1950 as amended by the foreign investment and national security act of 2007 finsa section 721 and as implemented by executive order 11858 as amended and regulations at 31 c f r part 800 the cfius process has been the subject of significant reforms over the past several years these include numerous improvements in internal cfius procedures enactment of finsa in july 2007 amendment of executive order 11858 in january 2008 revision of the cfius regulations in november 2008 and publication of guidance on cfius s national security considerations in december 2008 more bulletpoint 4 with control over the targeted national industry or interest the multinationals then leverage export of the national asset exfiltration through trade agreements structured to the benefit of lesser developed nation states where they have previously established a proactive financial footprint the process of charging the u s consumer more for a product that under normal national market conditions would cost less is a process called exfiltration of wealth this is the basic premise the cornerstone behind the catch phrase globalism it is never discussed to control the market price some contracted product may even be secured and shipped with the intent to allow it to sit idle or rot it s all about controlling the price and maximizing the profit equation to gain the same 1 profit a widget multinational might have to sell 20 widgets in el salvador 25 each or two widgets in the u s 2 50 each think of the process like the historic reference of opec organization of petroleum exporting countries only in the modern era massive corporations are playing the role of opec and it s not oil being controlled thanks to the wto it s almost everything again this is highlighted in the example of taxpayers subsidizing the food sector ebt snap etc the multinational corporations can charge domestic u s consumers more ex more beef is exported red meat prices remain high at the grocery store but subsidized u s consumers can better afford the high prices of course if you are not receiving food payment assistance middle class you can t eat the steaks because you can t afford them not accidentally it s the same scheme in the obamacare healthcare system agriculturally multinational corporate monsanto says all your harvests are belong to us contract with us or you lose because we can control the market price of your end product downside is that once you sign that contract you agree to terms that are entirely created by the financial interests of the larger corporation not your farm the multinational agriculture lobby is massive we willingly feed the world as part of the system but you as a grocery customer pay more per unit at the grocery store because domestic supply no longer determines domestic price within the agriculture community the feed the world production export factor also drives the need for labor labor is a cost the multinational corps have a vested interest in low labor costs ergo open border policies ie willingly purchased republicans not supporting border wall etc this corrupt economic manipulation exploitation applies over multiple sectors and even in the sub sector of an industry like steel china india purchases the raw material coking coal then sells the finished good rolled steel back to the global market at a discount or it could be rubber or concrete or plastic or frozen chicken parts etc the america first trump trade doctrine upsets the entire construct of this multinational export control dynamic team trump focus exclusively on bilateral trade deals with specific trade agreements targeted toward individual nations not national corporations america first is also specific policy at a granular product level looking out for the national interests of the united states u s workers u s companies and u s consumers under president trump s trade positions balanced and fair trade with strong regulatory control over national assets exfiltration of u s national wealth is essentially stopped this puts many current multinational corporations globalists who previously took a stake hold in the u s economy with intention to export the wealth in a position of holding contracted interest of an asset they can no longer exploit perhaps now we understand better how massive multi billion multinational corporations and institutions are aligned against president trump a year ago tariffs are the greatest either a country which has treated the united states unfairly on trade negotiates a fair deal or it gets hit with tariffs it s as simple as that and everybody s talking remember we are the piggy bank that s being robbed all will be great

transactions that could result in control of a u s business by a foreign person covered transactions in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the united states cfius operates pursuant to section 721 of the defense production act of 1950 as amended by the foreign investment and national security act of 2007 finsa section 721 and as implemented by executive order 11858 as amended and regulations at 31 c f r part 800 the cfius process has been the subject of significant reforms over the past several years these include numerous improvements in internal cfius procedures enactment of finsa in july 2007 amendment of executive order 11858 in january 2008 revision of the cfius regulations in november 2008 and publication of guidance on cfius s national security considerations in december 2008 more every element of global economic trade is controlled and exploited by massive institutions multinational banks and multinational corporations institutions like the world trade organization wto world bank and international monetary fund imf control trillions of dollars in economic activity underneath that economic activity there are people who hold the reigns of power over the outcomes these individuals and groups are the stakeholders in direct opposition to principles of america first national economics the modern financial constructs of these entities have been established over the course of the past three decades when you understand how they manipulate the economic system of individual nations you begin to understand why they are so fundamentally opposed to president trump in the western world separate from communist control perspectives ie china global markets are a modern myth nothing more than a talking point meant to keep people satiated with sound bites they might find familiar but the truth is global markets have been destroyed over the past three decades by multinational corporations who control the products formerly contained within global markets the same is true for commodities markets the multinational trade and economic system run by corporations and multinational banks now controls the product outputs of independent nations the free market economic system has been usurped by entities who create what is best described as u s president trump smartly understands what has taken place additionally trump uses economic leverage as part of a broader national security policy to understand who opposes president trump specifically because of the economic leverage he creates it becomes important to understand the objectives of the global and financial elite who run and operate the institutions the big club understanding how trillions of trade dollars influence geopolitical policy we begin to understand the three decade global financial construct they seek to protect that is multinational corporations purchase controlling interests in various national outputs harvests an raw materials and ancillary industries of developed industrial western nations example the multinational corporations making the purchases are underwritten by massive global financial institutions multinational banks note in china it is the communist government underwriting the purchase the multinational banks and the multinational corporations then utilize lobbying interests to manipulate the internal political policy of the targeted nation state s with control over the targeted national industry or interest the multinationals then leverage export of the national asset exfiltration through trade agreements structured to the benefit of lesser developed nation states where they have previously established a proactive financial footprint against the backdrop of president trump confronting china and against the backdrop of nafta renegotiated and against the necessary need to support the key u s steel industry revisiting the economic influences within the modern import export dynamic will help conceptualize the issues at the heart of the matter there are a myriad of interests within each trade sector that make specific explanation very challenging however here s the basic outline for three decades economic globalism has advanced quickly everyone accepts this statement yet few actually stop to ask who and what are behind this and why influential people with vested financial interests in the process have sold a narrative that global manufacturing global sourcing and global production was the inherent way of the future the same voices claimed the american economy was consigned to become a service driven economy what was always missed in these discussions is that advocates selling this global economy message have a vested financial and ideological interest in convincing the information consumer it is all just a natural outcome of economic progress it s not it s not natural at all it is a process that is entirely controlled promoted and utilized by large conglomerates lobbyists purchased politicians and massive financial corporations again i ll try to retain the larger altitude perspective without falling into the traps of the esoteric weeds i freely admit this is tough to explain and i may not be successful this is perhaps the most challenging to understand in essence thanks specifically to the way the world trade organization wto was established in 1995 national companies expanded their influence into multiple nations across a myriad of industries and economic sectors energy agriculture raw earth minerals etc this is the basic underpinning of national companies becoming multinational corporations think of these multinational corporations as global entities now powerful enough to reach into multiple nations simultaneously and purchase controlling interests in a single economic commodity a historic reference point might be the original multinational enterprise energy via oil production exxon mobil bp etc however in the modern global world it s not just oil the resource and product procurement extends to virtually every possible commodity and industry from the very visible wheat corn to the obscure small minerals and even flowers during the past several decades national companies merged the largest lemon producer company in brazil merges with the largest lemon company in mexico merges with the largest lemon company in argentina merges with the largest lemon company in the u s etc etc national companies formerly of one nation become continental companies with control over an entire continent of nations or it could be over several continents or even the entire world market of lemon widget production these are now multinational corporations they hold interests in specific segments this example lemons across a broad variety of individual nations national laws on monopoly building are not the same in all nations most are not as structured as the u s a or other more developed nations with more laws during the acquisition phase when encountering a highly developed nation with monopoly laws the process of an umbrella corporation might be needed to purchase the targeted interests within a specific nation the example of monsanto applies here in underdeveloped countries the process of buying a political outcome is called bribery within the united states we call it lobbying the process is exactly the same with control of the majority of actual lemons the multinational corporation now holds a different set of financial values than a local farmer or national market this is why commodities exchanges are essentially dead in the aggregate the mercantile exchange is no longer a free or supply based market it is now a controlled market exploited by mega sized multinational corporations instead of the traditional supply demand equation determining prices the corporations look to see what nations can afford what prices the supply of the controlled product is then distributed to the country according to their ability to afford the price this is essentially the bastardized and politicized function of the world trade organization wto this is also how the corporations controlling wto policy maximize profits back to the lemons a corporation might hold the rights to the majority of the lemon production in brazil argentina and california florida the price the u s consumer pays for the lemons is directed by the amount of inventory distribution the controlling corporation allows in the u s if the u s lemon harvest is abundant the controlling interests will export the product to keep the u s consumer spending at peak or optimal price a u s customer might pay 2 for a lemon a mexican customer might pay 50 and a canadian 1 25 the bottom line issue is the national supply in this example harvest yield is not driving the national price because the supply is now controlled by massive multinational corporations the mistake people often make is calling this a global commodity process in the modern era this global commodity phrase is particularly nonsense a true global commodity is a process of individual nations harvesting creating a similar product and bringing that product to a global market individual nations each independently engaged in creating a similar product under modern globalism this process no longer takes place it s a complete fraud massive multinational corporations control the majority of production inside each nation and therefore control the global product market and price it is a controlled system part of the lobbying in the food industry is to advocate for the expansion of u s taxpayer benefits to underwrite the costs of the domestic food products they control by lobbying dc these multinational corporations get congress and policy makers to expand the basis of who can use ebt and snap benefits state reimbursement rates expanding the federal subsidy for food purchases is part of the corporate profit dynamic with increased taxpayer subsidies the food price controllers can charge more domestically and export more of the product internationally taxes via subsidies go into their profit margins the corporations then use a portion of those enhanced profits in contributions to the politicians it s a circle of money in highly developed nations this multinational corporate process requires the corporation to purchase the domestic political process as above with individual nations allowing the exploitation in varying degrees as such the corporate lobbyists pay hundreds of millions to politicians for changes in policies and regulations one sector one product or one industry at a time these are specialized lobbyists example the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius bulletpoint 4 with control over the targeted national industry or interest the multinationals then leverage export of the national asset exfiltration through trade agreements structured to the benefit of lesser developed nation states where they have previously established a proactive financial footprint the process of charging the u s consumer more for a product that under normal national market conditions would cost less is a process called exfiltration of wealth this is the basic premise the cornerstone behind the catch phrase globalism it is never discussed to control the market price some contracted product may even be secured and shipped with the intent to allow it to sit idle or rot it s all about controlling the price and maximizing the profit equation to gain the same 1 profit a widget multinational might have to sell 20 widgets in el salvador 25 each or two widgets in the u s 2 50 each think of the process like the historic reference of opec organization of petroleum exporting countries only in the modern era massive corporations are playing the role of opec and it s not oil being controlled thanks to the wto it s almost everything again this is highlighted in the example of taxpayers subsidizing the food sector ebt snap etc the multinational corporations can charge domestic u s consumers more ex more beef is exported red meat prices remain high at the grocery store but subsidized u s consumers can better afford the high prices of course if you are not receiving food payment assistance middle class you can t eat the steaks because you can t afford them not accidentally it s the same scheme in the obamacare healthcare system agriculturally multinational corporate monsanto says all your harvests are belong to us contract with us or you lose because we can control the market price of your end product downside is that once you sign that contract you agree to terms that are entirely created by the financial interests of the larger corporation not your farm the multinational agriculture lobby is massive we willingly feed the world as part of the system but you as a grocery customer pay more per unit at the grocery store because domestic supply no longer determines domestic price within the agriculture community the feed the world production export factor also drives the need for labor labor is a cost the multinational corps have a vested interest in low labor costs ergo open border policies ie willingly purchased republicans not supporting border wall etc this corrupt economic manipulation exploitation applies over multiple sectors and even in the sub sector of an industry like steel china india purchases the raw material coking coal then sells the finished good rolled steel back to the global market at a discount or it could be rubber or concrete or plastic or frozen chicken parts etc the america first trump trade doctrine upsets the entire construct of this multinational export control dynamic team trump focus exclusively on bilateral trade deals with specific trade agreements targeted toward individual nations not national corporations america first is also specific policy at a granular product level looking out for the national interests of the united states u s workers u s companies and u s consumers under president trump s trade positions balanced and fair trade with strong regulatory control over national assets exfiltration of u s national wealth is essentially stopped this puts many current multinational corporations globalists who previously took a stake hold in the u s economy with intention to export the wealth in a position of holding contracted interest of an asset they can no longer exploit perhaps now we understand better how massive multi billion multinational corporations and institutions are aligned against president trump a year ago tariffs are the greatest either a country which has treated the united states unfairly on trade negotiates a fair deal or it gets hit with tariffs it s as simple as that and everybody s talking remember we are the piggy bank that s being robbed all will be great donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 24 2018
the majority of financial media punditry claim orangeman tariffs bad truly it s the stupidest and most disingenuous oft spoken claim with zero foundation in reality chinese tariffs have been in place since july 2017 no measurable inflation on chinese goods steel and aluminum tariffs in place since 2017 again no measurable inflation on core product or finished consumer goods auto tariffs on china now absorbed by gm soft wood tariffs countervailing duties against canadian dumping same result the supply chain results completely refute u s coc tom donohue s doomsayer promised economic proclamations if tariffs are so destructive why was is everyone except the u s using them to protect their industry segments and economies the truth is the financial class and professional multinational lobbyists don t want people to realize the modern trade system was designed to reduce american wealth it s a feature not a flaw the collapse of u s manufacturing did not happen accidentally the rust belt was not created accidentally nafta was not designed accidentally the back door to the u s market was not created accidentally middle class jobs were not lost accidentally wages did not stagnate accidentally all of these results were brought about by specific design who or what was in charge of the plan at the heart of trade agreements over the past 30 years you will find the u s chamber of commerce yes a wall street multinational corporate lobbying group actually wrote three decades of trade agreement language a team of business experts from within the u s coc wrote the terms and conditions of actual trade agreements for reagan reagan bush clinton clinton bush bush and obama obama add it up that s 30 years now look back to when the rust started not coincidentally that s 30 years ago all that stopped with donald trump trillions of dollars of exfiltration stopped by donald trump tens of trillions do you think those big club people are absolutely apoplectic they are well beyond apoplectic they are now batshit crazy angry about it well beyond beyond losing trillions in wealth to main street you know what really drives their anger the big club cannot openly confront president trump on the specifics because his results at reversing their scheme is clear evidence they were the engineers behind the intentional loss of american wealth and standard of living in the first place so they are left shouting at trees tariffs bad tariffs are taxes on american consumers etc etc etc blah blah blah and each day that goes by as empirical evidence

u s review growing hints of a slowdown in the midst of rising prospects of a prolonged and more pronounced trade war data this week seemed to lend some credence to the idea that the domestic economy is beginning to succumb more materially to all the uncertainty nonfarm employers added just 75 000 jobs in may while average hourly earnings also missed expectations up 3 1 over the year the slowest rise since september the ism manufacturing survey fell 0 7 points to a 31 month low of 52 1 while the non manufacturing survey rose 1 4 to 56 9 offering some evidence of the ongoing divergence between the manufacturing and the much larger service sector growing hints of a slowdown in the midst of rising prospects of a prolonged and more pronounced trade war data this week seemed to lend some credence to the idea that the domestic economy is beginning to succumb more materially to all the uncertainty nonfarm employers added just 75 000 jobs in may missing even the lowest forecast while downward revisions shaved off a further 75 000 from prior months reported gains average hourly earnings also missed expectations up 0 2 on the month and 3 1 over the year the slowest rise since september the bond market reaction was swift yields on both the two year and 10 year immediately fell more than six bps likely out of a belief that the growing hint of labor market weakness may force the fed s hand and induce a rate cut indeed the market has come to view a cut this year as a foregone conclusion futures markets have priced in around 75 bps of easing this year a more defiant stance from the trump administration towards china and the threat of a new volley of tariffs directed against mexico are likely driving the pessimism and risk off attitude despite high level negotiations regarding the u s mexico border situation this week 5 tariffs on all imports from mexico are slated to go into effect monday and could rise as high as 25 by october this latest escalation more than doubles the total value of goods subject to tariffs to around 700 billion and perhaps more worryingly brings into stark view the willingness of the administration to use tariffs as leverage for political or diplomatic concessions dropping even the pretense of an economic rationale see topic of the week for more detail the question for the fed then is whether markets are overreacting to trade uncertainty by expecting three cuts in a 3 6 unemployment rate economy noted dove james bullard kicked off the fedspeak on monday stating that a cut may be warranted soon and noted that even if growth does not succumb to trade tensions significantly lower rates would help bring inflation up to target more quickly chair jay powell took the baton on tuesday saying we are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the u s economic outlook and as always we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion markets took these comments and ran with them as the s p 500 surged 2 1 on the day and remained buoyant the rest of the week we would suggest a more leveled view as his comments are not anything new per se expectations of a powell put may be a bit premature if we resist reading into his comments too deeply and in light of robert kaplan s call for patience amidst trade threats that could be reversed as quickly as the president can tweet john williams similarly suggested staying on the path of data dependence to that end the ism manufacturing survey fell 0 7 points to a 31 month low of 52 1 while the non manufacturing survey rose 1 4 to 56 9 offering some evidence that the divergence between the manufacturing and the much larger service sector is persisting in other words the slowdown in the trade and global growth exposed manufacturing sector has yet to spill over into the broader economy in a major way still the majority of economic data lags the cyclical parts of the economy are already slowing and the uncertainty over the entire economy is already here u s outlook consumer price index wednesday for the second consecutive month higher energy prices led to another solid monthly gain in the consumer price index cpi in april 0 3 outside of energy price gains were more modest with the core cpi rising 0 1 on the month the primary driver of weakness in the core cpi has been apparel price declines as a result of a source data change in the collection sample 0 8 and 1 9 in april and march respectively apparel which constitutes roughly 4 of the core cpi has had an outsized impact on core inflation in recent months despite its relatively small weighting the influence of this data source change should begin to dissipate looking to may we project headline cpi to rise a more moderate 0 2 as energy price gains eased considerably last month excluding food and energy the core cpi should register a trend like 0 2 increase we see little change to the overall trend in inflation as fed officials prepare to meet later this month previous 0 3 wells fargo 0 2 consensus 0 1 month over month retail sales friday retail sales have experienced a volatile monthly performance so far this year in april headline sales unexpectedly slipped 0 2 on the month following an exceptionally strong 1 7 gain in march we expect a rebounding performance in may with headline retail sales increasing 0 7 excluding vehicles 0 4 motor vehicle sales increased 5 5 last month and should accompany an otherwise broad based increase across the retail sectors looking ahead we remain constructive on the consumer and their contribution to overall economic growth fundamentals for sustained solid consumer spending remain sound including healthy hiring gains low unemployment and firming wages assuming the labor market remains healthy as we expect consumer spending growth should be solid in the quarters ahead previous 0 5 wells fargo 0 7 consensus 0 7 month over month industrial production friday reflecting the ongoing and now escalating trade policy concerns industrial production has fallen for the third time over the past four months manufacturing output contracted 0 5 in april as production of motor vehicles parts fell by the most in three months while machinery output shrank by the most since 2014 we look for a 0 1 decline in may total industrial production given there has been little relief in the factory sector data since last month the headline ism manufacturing fell moderately in may though new orders showed some modest improvement on the month looking ahead the manufacturing sector will continue to face the same issues seen over the past few months namely dealing with the challenges in trade due to the strong dollar and the need to slow inventory accumulation previous 0 5 wells fargo 0 1 consensus 0 2 month over month global review ecb hints at easing for ailing eurozone economy the european central bank announced policy this week acknowledging that policymakers discussed rate cuts and restarting its asset purchase program those discussions come amid continued weakness in eurozone economic data including inflation well below target and ongoing concerns in germany s industrial sector the race for u k prime minister is under way while pmis released this week signaled u k economic sentiment is anything but inspiring meanwhile canada had another banner jobs report in may ecb hints at easing for ailing eurozone economy it was a busy week for europe the european central bank ecb as expected held its policy rates steady as part of the announcement it provided the terms of its tltro program of longer term loans for banks which were generally less favorable for banks than some had expected the recent strength in bank lending in the eurozone probably gave the ecb some leeway to be stingier with the lending terms although those terms will still be fairly favorable as they allow for long term loans to potentially be disbursed to commercial banks at negative interest rates meanwhile the central bank said rates would remain at present levels at least through the first half of 2020 whereas previously it had noted that rates would remain on hold at least through the end of 2019 ecb president draghi noted that some policymakers had discussed rate cuts and that there was scope for renewed purchases under its quantitative easing qe program those discussions come amidst ongoing economic weakness in the eurozone highlighted by some key data releases this week eurozone cpi inflation slowed more than expected to 1 2 yearover year while core cpi inflation slipped to 0 8 meanwhile german industrial output unexpectedly fell 1 9 on a sequential basis in april despite ongoing economic weakness in the eurozone we are not yet convinced the ecb will restart qe or cut rates anytime soon however with the change in forward guidance we now see substantial risks that the ecb will not raise rates in q1 2020 as we currently expect last but not least italian political concerns escalated this week after the european commission recommended a formal procedure to rein in italy s budget deficit and debt to gdp ratio which it views as in violation of the e u budget rules to sum up ecb policy is likely to remain accommodative for some time amid a soft domestic growth and inflation backdrop and ongoing political concerns in the region elsewhere the race to replace u k prime minister theresa may kicked into gear this week as the field of candidates narrowed slightly and candidates began formalizing their stances on brexit and other issues reports indicate the conservative party is seeking to conclude the leadership race by july 26 u k domestic economic data this week were mixed but pointed to weak economic sentiment the may manufacturing pmi fell to 49 4 the lowest since july 2016 while the services pmi rose to a still low 51 0 the u k manufacturing sector is likely reaping the impact of overbuilt inventories earlier this year although the services sector has probably been more resilient than sentiment figures currently suggest finally there was some focus on canadian labor market figures which were generally stronger than expected employment rose 27 700 in may with all the gains in full time jobs following the largest increase on record in april 106 500 the other details of the report were also constructive as wage growth remained solid at 2 6 year over year while the unemployment rate fell to 5 4 global outlook u k labor market report monday the u k economy has been surprisingly resilient in the face of brexit uncertainty as real gdp grew 0 5 in q1 not annualized on solid domestic demand growth that solid domestic economic picture is also reflected in the labor market where wage growth remains solid the unemployment rate is at a multi decade low and employment growth is strong in our view the most important metric to watch in next week s labor market report is wage growth which has tapered off a bit recently but generally remains near the highest levels of the cycle unit labor costs which adjust wage growth for the productivity of workers has picked up meaningfully suggesting the rise in wages is not entirely reflective of increases in productivity we suspect the bank of england is watching these developments closely and while brexit uncertainty probably means no rate hikes are coming soon rising cost pressures could eventually force the central bank s hand previous 3 2 consensus 3 0 year over year 3 mma eurozone industrial output thursday the eurozone s economic woes seemingly have yet to meaningfully abate but next week s reading on industrial output from the bloc will offer some insight into whether that story has changed the industrial sector has languished particularly in germany as weaker global trade has dinged the export sensitive economy output in the industrial sector has recovered a bit in recent months but germany s industrial output reading this week shows that the recovery may have stalled the recent increase in trade tensions only adds to the downside risks for output particularly if tensions linger or worsen in the months ahead on the bright side retail sales have picked up recently as inflation remains low and ultimately we remain of the view that the eurozone will dodge a full scale recession still our full year 2019 forecast for eurozone gdp growth is just 1 1 hardly an inspiring outlook previous 0 3 consensus 0 4 month over month china economic activity friday china releases industrial output and retail sales figures for may next week and these numbers will provide our first look at whether the recent escalation in u s china trade tensions has had any discernible impact on chinese activity the manufacturing pmi fell further into contractionary territory last week 49 4 which may bode poorly for industrial output although the non manufacturing pmi continues to be more resilient and remains comfortably above 50 next week will also feature the release of chinese trade data for may which will also encapsulate the period since the united states raised tariffs on us 200b in goods ironically the tariffs could pose upside risks for chinese exports to the united states if firms in china rushed to send off shipments before the tariffs took effect finally there could be a relatively swift reaction from chinese authorities including pledges to ease monetary or fiscal policy if any of next week s data releases are particularly underwhelming previous 5 4 industrial prod 7 2 retail sales consensus 5 4 8 0 both year over year point of view interest rate watch the bond market looks prescient the may employment data drive home many of the points we made in this column last week namely that the inversion of the yield curve is for real this time with both the 2 year and 10 year treasury yields below the federal funds rate the bond market has put the fed on notice that their near term and longer term forecasts for u s economic growth are too optimistic this morning s weaker employment report which showed nonfarm payrolls adding around 100 000 fewer jobs than the consensus estimate and downward revisions to the prior two months data reinforced that message and very likely removed any lingering doubts that the economy has slowed the financial markets are now pricing in two or three quarter point cuts in the federal funds rate this year that is probably too much part of this morning s smaller job gain was simply a payback for the exceptionally strong april data the devastating flooding in the midwest appears to have bolstered hiring in heavy engineering possibly to shore up levees hiring also rose sharply in social services particularly areas providing disaster assistance seasonal adjustment likely magnified the impact last month and the may data saw some mean reversion the relatively late may survey period also meant a large number of teachers both in government and the private sector fell off of payrolls this past month the bottom line is job growth has moderated but perhaps not as much as the may data suggest bond yields retreated following the jobs data the financial markets are concerned about the implications of a widening trade war and the possible near term distortions from even a short period of tariffs on imports from mexico if a deal can be reached with mexico before tariffs are put in place yields will likely rise as that would likely keep the fed on hold for a few more weeks policymakers also need to determine how much damage tariffs on chinese imports and the threat of tariffs on mexico has already done to the economy risk aversion has undoubtedly increased which raises the hurdle rate for every additional investment dollar and new hire credit market insights italy s credit vulnerability on wednesday the european commission released a report that recommended disciplinary proceedings against italy over its failure to follow european union eu debt rules the commission concluded that an excessive debt procedure edp is warranted and the report marked the first step in the edp next the analysis will be submitted to eu members to discuss their opinions on the commission s proposal over italy s budget if eu members are unsatisfied with italy s ability to reduce its debt based on the recommendations the country may face fines up to roughly 3 5b 0 2 of gdp according to eu rules article 126 2 tfeu states that in order to be in compliance with budgetary discipline no country should have a government deficit larger than 3 of or government debt exceeding 60 of gdp according to the report italy did not comply with the debt reduction benchmark last year in 2018 italy s gross debt rose to 132 2 of gdp above the 60 reference value however its deficit remained within the 3 limit the commission forecasts italy s debt to gdp will reach even higher levels in 2019 133 7 and 2020 135 2 while in 2020 the general government deficit is projected to exceed the reference value italy s mounting public debt has left its economy vulnerable in the second half of 2018 italy s nominal gdp growth dipped below 2 hindering its ability to reduce its public debt at a faster rate topic of the week the latest front in the trade war mexico what s happening u s and mexico officials have yet to reach a deal on illegal immigration unless negotiators make major progress tariffs on goods coming into the united states from mexico will be subject to a 5 tariff starting this monday june 10 there is a built in escalation of five percentage points each month until the tariff rate hits 25 on october 1 why it matters tariffs on mexican goods would mark the biggest escalation yet in the ongoing trade war the dollar value of goods currently subject to tariffs totals about 300 billion the proposed tariffs on mexico would affect an additional 346 billion of goods coming into the united states this is more than just a new front it is a more than doubling of the trade war in one shot mexico is the second largest market for both u s imports and exports last year the share of total u s exports to mexico was just 15 9 a big number but it pales in comparison to the 79 5 share of mexican exports destined for the united states exports to mexico comprise only 1 2 in terms of value added in the u s economy so at least in terms of the bilateral trade relationship mexico has more to lose than the united states the auto industry accounts for more than a third of u s imports from mexico this large share and the interconnectivity of north american supply chains suggest the auto industry is at heightened risk from tariffs our takeaway by itself a trade war with mexico would not plunge the u s economy into recession but coupled with the other tariffs it is likely to weigh on u s growth while we suspect there is not much support for these policies on either side of the aisle that may not prevent the tariffs from going into effect next week or escalating in subsequent weeks should these measures go into effect the economic pain they will cause particularly in the auto sector will likely make this a politically untenable plan in the longer run
the caribbean s long term outlook hinges on diversifying out of tourism and commodities and turning climate change challenges into growth opportunities sargassum seaweed being removed from a yucatan beach when the first ever wave of sargassum seaweed washed up on the coasts of the caribbean in 2011 people took it in stride but the sargassum returned in larger volumes and affected more beaches year after year it is almost definitely a combination of climate change and ocean enrichment with nutrients says hazel oxenford a professor in fisheries biology and management at the university of the west indies we are talking about nutrients from deforestation urbanization general continued land use and destruction of natural vegetation the foul smelling decomposing piles of seaweed do not appeal to tourists pictures of fetid beaches have appeared on social media tamping down demand for flights hotels and restaurants johanan dujon of st lucia saw an opportunity outside the tourist industry he began harvesting the seaweed and turned it into an organic fertilizer founding algas organics in 2014 i started this company with a vision to convert what many people saw as an environmental and economic threat into the world s most innovative fertilizer company he explains algas organics has processed more than 3 million pounds of sargassum since starting production in 2015 simultaneously cleaning beaches and supporting local agriculture with an organic fertilizer the nations of the caribbean have widely different sizes histories languages and levels of economic development but they all share the same ocean and thus are suffering similar dramatic impacts from climate change creeping problems such as gassy seaweed are the least of it as the 2017 hurricane season illustrated powerful hurricanes which will become more likely given warmer ocean water can have a substantial impact on regional growth prospects particularly given the generally volatile nature of tourism flows in addition to risks such as greater flooding and changes in precipitation patterns says andrew trahan country risk analyst at fitch solutions these downside risks will likely far outweigh the cost of adaptation over the long term since hurricane maria wiped out puerto rico s power grid for example public private and philanthropic funds have invested in renewable energy batteries and so called microgrid infrastructure to build the island s resilience the efficacy of those measures was not fully tested by the milder 2018 hurricane season trahan notes and it is not just the unpredictable weather but also the economic and political impact of larger neighbors such as the us that make the caribbean economies volatile and generally underperforming and with volatile economies caribbean countries are highly susceptible to shocks they can have a drought or a hurricane and the forecast can change by 0 5 percentage points which is more relevant when growth is weak to start with says juan pedro schmid a lead economist at the inter american development bank idb world bank ceo kristalina georgieva in a blog post late in 2018 estimated the impact of hurricanes on small island economies at 1 6 of gdp add in other types of disasters and the losses come to roughly 2 5 of gdp the region s long term economic destiny is based on these countries ability to prepare for more severe weather challenges and perhaps even turn these extremes into growth opportunities idb lab the innovation laboratory of the idb group last year launched its blue tech challenge to address these issues by identifying companies with business models that the bank says use cutting edge technologies to contribute to the sustainable management of oceans marine ecosystems and coastal resources in march algas organics seeking to develop export capacity was one of five companies chosen to receive funding out of 50 applicants we recognize that invasive sargassum seaweed is posing a real problem for the tourism sector and we received several applications through the blue tech challenge addressing this issue says dora moscoso from idb lab we selected algas organics because its technology had already been tested and it was seeking resources to expand and scale up its model other winning proposals aim to help clean the oceans or improve fishing practices the blue tech challenge is just one example of attempts to free the region s economy from its two traditional mainstay industries tourism and commodities tourism is not the most dynamic industry says the idb s schmid and there is a lot of all inclusive tourism that has little spillover to the general economy for the bahamas jamaica and barbados it s almost a puzzle says schmid all three countries had the weakest growth for a long time they suffer frequent external shocks including in terms of weather and they depend strongly on the us and canadian economies yet jamaica can be called a success story debt to gdp has fallen macroeconomic stability is entrenched costs of borrowing are down inflation is down employment and job creation are at historical peaks foreign exchange reserves are rising quickly the business environment is improving and the economy has had 15 consecutive quarters of growth says marla dukharan chief economist at barbados based fintech bitt she also offers praise for grenada which reduced its debt to gdp ratio from 108 in 2013 to 63 by the end of 2018 grenada just finished its sixth year of consistent and robust growth she says the cayman islands too are demonstrating resilience in the first three quarters of 2018 the economy grew 3 6 ahead of same period the prior year and is delivering fiscal surpluses their offshore economic zone cayman enterprise city has made significant advances towards becoming a hub for technology aviation maritime commodities and derivatives businesses says dukharan health city cayman islands offers a myriad of medical specialties many of which are not available anywhere else within the region at the same time she notes tourism as measured by cruise ship arrivals and stayovers grew 11 over the prior year the caymans also have a robust business as a friendly tax jurisdiction the number of new company registrations grew 34 5 year over year in the first nine months of 2018 dukharan adds fitch solutions sees economic growth in the caribbean recovering to 3 9 in 2019 and 4 in 2020 up from 0 7 growth in 2018 the last an aberrant figure trahan points out due to the fiscal year reporting of puerto rico the region s largest economy because 2018 figures include part of 2017 with its hurricane aftereffects the imf has been focusing on the caribbean following debt reduction in several countries and suggesting financial tools aimed at reducing the risk of weather related events alejandro werner and krishna srinivasan director and deputy director respectively of the western hemisphere department at the imf have supported the introduction of climate resilient debt instruments as well as the caribbean catastrophe risk insurance facility a multicountry risk pool for government intervention during natural disasters they suggest that debt contracts include hurricane linked clauses to allow an extension of maturity in the event of a natural disaster as well as the introduction of insurance to cover specific amounts of debt service payments following catastrophic disasters
dollar weakness was the main theme over the whole week it started with worries over trump s tariff threats to mexico then fed officials came out acknowledging the risks from trump s tariff policies and signaled their openness to rate cuts should trade tensions worsen selling reached its peak after poor non farm payroll report which gives a nod to monetary easing however the situation had an about turn after market when trump declared that the tariffs on mexico would be indefinitely suspended as a so called agreement was made so the question is are fed officials now less worried or are they more worried by such high level of uncertainty anyway a whole new world is possibly lying ahead for the greenback this week over the week dollar was undoubtedly the weakest one yen followed as the second weakest major treasury yields dropped with german 10 year bund hitting new record low but yen chose to follow surging stocks on fed cut speculations sterling was the third weakest saying farewell to uk prime minister theresa may new zealand dollar was the strongest one canadian dollar was initially pressured by free falling oil prices but then rebounded on stellar job report to close as second strongest boc is few of those who s less likely to cut rates euro was the third strongest after less dovish than expected ecb announcement aussie was mixed only after rba rate cut speculations on fed rate cut intensified drastically market speculations on fed rate cuts intensified drastically last week a key reason behind was fed officials acknowledgement of risks from trade tensions and their openness to rate cuts another factor was the poor non farm payroll report which showed only 75k growth in may added to worries of slowdown in the economy fed funds futures are now pricing 85 2 chance of rate cut by july meeting that compares to 53 1 chance a week ago and just 14 4 a month ago by december meeting it s now at 86 4 chance that fed will cut twice to 1 75 2 00 a month ago there was 84 8 chance that federal funds rate would be at 2 00 2 50 that is at most one cut fed officials signaled openness to insurance rate cut but is that necessary however to us the markets were overly dovish on fed st louis fed president james bullard was the only one calling for a rate cut to provide insurance for sharper than expected slowdown as global trade uncertainties have become more severe chair jerome powell vice chair richard clarida and governor lael brainard just indicated they were ready to act on the implications of the developments in trade tensions chicago fed president charles evans maintained that our current setting has been appropriate the most thoughtful one was dallas fed president robert kaplan s he noted i want to take a little bit more time and be patient here because some of these recent events could be reversed worth being cognizant of the fact that these recent tensions have just elevated in the last five six weeks and in the next five six weeks a number of them could be alleviated kaplan was right that in just a matter of days threats of tariffs on mexico vanished with the experience of the the market volatility after trump s suddenly announcement of the tariffs on mexico would he still go ahead with tariffs on all untaxed usd 300b chinese imports if not then there is is probably no more urgency for fed to have those insurance cuts business confidence and investment will come back to the us if policies are not that erratic dollar index confirmed medium term topping but not reversal yet dollar index s strong break of 97 20 support now serves as an important sign of medium term topping at 98 37 on bearish divergence condition in daily macd some support could be seen from 55 week ema now at 96 10 to bring recovery but risk will stay on the downside as long as 55 day ema now at 97 38 holds dollar index could gyrate towards 38 2 retracement of 88 25 to 98 37 at 94 50 we d look at the structure of the fall to assess whether it s just a correction or a change in trend at a later stage 10 year yield pressing key support level recovery due 10 year yield extended recent down trend last week and breached 61 8 retracement of 1 336 to 3 248 at 2 066 before closing at 2 084 we d maintain that 2 034 066 is an important support zone that should hold at least on first attempt a recovery is likely due that could help dollar stabilizing however break of 2 356 support turned resistance is needed to indicate bottoming otherwise further decline would remain in favor the next fall could send tnx through 2 0 psychological level dow looks on track to new high but after edging lower to 24680 57 last week dow staged a very strong rebound to close at 25983 94 above 55 day ema the development seriously dampened our original bearish view that fall from 26695 96 is the third leg of consolidation pattern from 25951 81 strong support was seen from 38 2 retracement of 21712 53 to 26695 96 at 24792 28 as well as 55 week ema now at 25177 00 both are rather bullish signal and suggest that rise from 21712 53 is not completed yet if that s the case then rise from 21712 53 should indeed be resuming the long term up trend that is 26951 81 historical high should be taken out rather decisively soon but then the current rally in stocks appeared to be fueled by expectation of fed rate cuts on slowdown in the economy a rate cut while stocks are making new record high doesn t make much sense to us and without the rate cut the reason for the current rally on economic slowdown is non existent the situation is rather contradictory and thus we ll refrain from taking a view on us stocks for the moment ecb said rates to stay low till h1 2020 still confidence on baseline outlook ecb left interest rates unchanged as widely expected that is main refinancing marginal lending and deposit rates are kept at 0 00 0 25 and 0 40 respectively the forward guidance was changed as the central bank said interest rates are going to stay at currently level for longer at least through the first half of 2020 rather than end of 2019 the post meeting press conference was not too dovish at all in short it just reflected as president mario draghi described confidence in the present baseline but also clear acknowledgement of risks growth outlook for 2019 was revised up but slightly down for 2020 and 21 inflation outlook for 2019 was revised up down for 2020 overall ecb remains patient and would take more time to see how this year s slowdown plays out before committing to a move the less dovish than expected meeting lifted euro against dollar and yen clearly however there was no post ecb upside breakout in eur gbp eur cad eur chf and not even eur aud suggested readings rba delivered rate cut more on the table rba cut cash rate by 25bps to 1 25 as widely expected the objective of the cut is to assist with faster progress in reducing unemployment and thus achieve more assured progress towards the inflation target more importantly rba leaves the option open for more rate cut it will continue to monitor developments in the labour market closely and adjust monetary policy for the objectives later governor philip lowe used to speech to confirm that more rate cuts are on the table he said it is possible that the current policy settings will be enough that we just need to be patient but it is also possible that the current policy settings will leave us short given this the possibility of lower interest rates remains on the table aussie ended the week mixed only the rate cut and dovish path ahead should be rather well priced in for now aussie is supported as other global central banks possibly except boc don t appear to be in a much better position than rba suggested readings on rba usd cad weekly outlook usd cad s sharp decline last week suggests that choppy rise from 1 3068 has completed at 1 3564 already initial bias remains on the downside for 1 3052 68 cluster support on the upside break of 1 3363 support turned resistance is needed to indicate short term bottoming otherwise outlook will remain bearish in case of recovery in the bigger picture the strong break of medium term channel support now argues that up trend from 1 2061 2017 low has completed at 1 3664 2018 high just ahead of 61 8 retracement of 1 4689 2016 high to 1 2061 at 1 3685 and 1 3793 resistance decisive break of 1 3068 cluster support 38 2 retracement of 1 2061 to 1 3664 at 1 3052 will confirm and pave the way to 61 8 retracement at 1 2673 next for now risk will remain on the downside as long as 1 3564 resistance holds even in case of strong rebound in the longer term picture outlook remains unchanged that price actions from 1 4689 2016 high are forming a corrective pattern rejection by 1 3793 resistance would raise the chance of lengthier extension with risk of dropping through 1 2061 low before completion
here are the answers with discussion for this weekend s quiz the information provided should help you work out why you missed a question or three if you haven t already done the quiz from yesterday then have a go at it before you read the answers i hope this helps you develop an understanding of modern monetary theory mmt and its application to macroeconomic thinking comments as usual welcome especially if i have made an error question 1 the only way that you can have unbalanced external accounts across nations some countries with surpluses and other deficits is because the surplus countries desire to hold financial assets denominated in the currency of the deficit countries the answer is true i note our anonymous friend has already declared that there is no way it s true okay i am not god but in this case i don t really need to draw on any divine powers anyway to defend the conclusion that it is true many economists do not fully understand how to interpret the balance of payments in a fiat monetary system for example most will associate the rise in the current account deficit exports less than imports plus net invisibles with an outflow of capital they then argue that the only way australia if we use it as an example can counter this is if australian financial institutions borrow from abroad they then assume that this is a problem because it means allegedly that australia is living beyond its means it it true that the higher the level of australian foreign debt the more its economy becomes linked to changing conditions in international credit markets but the way this situation is usually constructed is dubious first exports are a cost a nation has to give something real to foreigners that it we could use domestically so there is an opportunity cost involved in exports second imports are a benefit they represent foreigners giving a nation something real that they could use themselves but which the local economy will benefit from having the opportunity cost is all theirs so on balance if a nation can persuade foreigners to send more ships filled with things than it has to send in return net export deficit then that is a net benefit to the local economy i am abstracting from all the arguments valid mostly that says we cannot measure welfare in a material way i know all the arguments that support that position and largely agree with them so how can we have a situation where foreigners are giving up more real things than they get from the local economy in a macroeconomic sense the answer lies in the fact that the local nation s current account deficit finances the desire of foreigners to accumulate net financial claims denominated in auds think about that carefully the standard conception is exactly the opposite that the foreigners finance the local economy s profligate spending patterns in fact the local trade deficit allows the foreigners to accumulate these financial assets claims on the local economy the local economy gains in real terms more goods and services coming in than leave and foreigners achieve their desired financial portfolio so in general that seems like a good outcome for all the problem is that if the foreigners change their desire to accumulate financial assets in the local currency then they will become unwilling to allow the real terms of trade ships going and coming with real things to remain in the local nation s favour then the local econmy has to adjust its export and import behaviour accordingly if this transition is sudden then some disruptions can occur in general these adjustments are not sudden this bi lateral example extends to multi lateral situations which become more complicated in terms of who is holding what but the underlying principle is the same a net exporting nation must be desiring to accumulate financial assets denominated in the currencies of the nations it runs surpluses with it may then trade these assets for other claims not necessarily in the original currency but that doesn t alter the basic motivation the following blog posts may be of further interest to you question 2 like anything in abundance it is true that when there is more money in the economy its value declines the answer is false there are situations rare where this proposition might be true but in general the proposition is false the question requires you to a understand the difference between bank reserves and the money supply and b understand the quantity theory of money the mainstream macroeconomics text book argument that increasing the money supply will cause inflation is based on the quatity theory of money first expanding bank reserves will put more base money into the economy but not increase the aggregates that drive the alleged causality in the quantity theory of money that is the various estimates of the money supply second even if the money supply is increasing the economy may still adjust to that via output and income increases up to full capacity over time as investment expands the productive capacity of the economy aggregate demand growth can support the utilisation of that increased capacity without there being inflation in this situation an increasing money supply which is really not a very useful aggregate at all which signals expanding credit will not be inflationary so the maybe relates to the situation that might arise if nominal demand kept increasing beyond the capacity of the real economy to absorb it via increased production then you would get inflation and the value of the dollar would start to decline the quantity theory of money which in symbols is mv pq but means that the money stock times the turnover per period v is equal to the price level p times real output q the mainstream assume that v is fixed despite empirically it moving all over the place and q is always at full employment as a result of market adjustments in applying this theory the mainstream deny the existence of unemployment the more reasonable mainstream economists admit that short run deviations in the predictions of the quantity theory of money can occur but in the long run all the frictions causing unemployment will disappear and the theory will apply in general the monetarists the most recent group to revive the quantity theory of money claim that with v and q fixed then changes in m cause changes in p which is the basic monetarist claim that expanding the money supply is inflationary they say that excess monetary growth creates a situation where too much money is chasing too few goods and the only adjustment that is possible is nominal that is inflation one of the contributions of keynes was to show the quantity theory of money could not be correct he observed price level changes independent of monetary supply movements and vice versa which changed his own perception of the way the monetary system operated further with high rates of capacity and labour underutilisation at various times including now one can hardly seriously maintain the view that q is fixed there is always scope for real adjustments that is increasing output to match nominal growth in aggregate demand so if increased credit became available and borrowers used the deposits that were created by the loans to purchase goods and services it is likely that firms with excess capacity will react to the increased nominal demand by increasing output the mainstream have related the current non standard monetary policy efforts the so called quantitative easing to the quantity theory of money and predicted hyperinflation will arise so it is the modern belief in the quantity theory of money is behind the hysteria about the level of bank reserves at present it has to be inflationary they say because there is all this money lying around and it will flood the economy textbook like that of mankiw mislead their students into thinking that there is a direct relationship between the monetary base and the money supply they claim that the central bank controls the money supply by buying and selling government bonds in open market operations and that the private banks then create multiples of the base via credit creation students are familiar with the pages of textbook space wasted on explaining the erroneous concept of the money multiplier where a banks are alleged to loan out some of its reserves and create money as i have indicated several times the depiction of the fractional reserve money multiplier process in textbooks like mankiw exemplifies the mainstream misunderstanding of banking operations please read my blog money multiplier and other myths for more discussion on this point the idea that the monetary base the sum of bank reserves and currency leads to a change in the money supply via some multiple is not a valid representation of the way the monetary system operates even though it appears in all mainstream macroeconomics textbooks and is relentlessly rammed down the throats of unsuspecting economic students the money multiplier myth leads students to think that as the central bank can control the monetary base then it can control the money supply further given that inflation is allegedly the result of the money supply growing too fast then the blame is sheeted home to the government the central bank in this case the reality is that the central bank does not have the capacity to control the money supply we have regularly traversed this point in the world we live in bank loans create deposits and are made without reference to the reserve positions of the banks the bank then ensures its reserve positions are legally compliant as a separate process knowing that it can always get the reserves from the central bank the only way that the central bank can influence credit creation in this setting is via the price of the reserves it provides on demand to the commercial banks so when we talk about quantitative easing we must first understand that it requires the short term interest rate to be at zero or close to it otherwise the central bank would not be able to maintain control of a positive interest rate target because the excess reserves would invoke a competitive process in the interbank market which would effectively drive the interest rate down quantitative easing then involves the central bank buying assets from the private sector government bonds and high quality corporate debt so what the central bank is doing is swapping financial assets with the banks they sell their financial assets and receive back in return extra reserves so the central bank is buying one type of financial asset private holdings of bonds company paper and exchanging it for another reserve balances at the central bank the net financial assets in the private sector are in fact unchanged although the portfolio composition of those assets is altered maturity substitution which changes yields and returns in terms of changing portfolio compositions quantitative easing increases central bank demand for long maturity assets held in the private sector which reduces interest rates at the longer end of the yield curve these are traditionally thought of as the investment rates this might increase aggregate demand given the cost of investment funds is likely to drop but on the other hand the lower rates reduce the interest income of savers who will reduce consumption demand accordingly how these opposing effects balance out is unclear but the evidence suggests there is not very much impact at all for the monetary aggregates outside of base money to increase the banks would then have to increase their lending and create deposits this is at the heart of the mainstream belief is that quantitative easing will stimulate the economy sufficiently to put a brake on the downward spiral of lost production and the increasing unemployment the recent experience and that of japan in 2001 showed that quantitative easing does not succeed in doing this this should come as no surprise at all if you understand modern monetary theory mmt the mainstream view is based on the erroneous belief that the banks need reserves before they can lend and that quantitative easing provides those reserves that is a major misrepresentation of the way the banking system actually operates but the mainstream position asserts wrongly that banks only lend if they have prior reserves the illusion is that a bank is an institution that accepts deposits to build up reserves and then on lends them at a margin to make money the conceptualisation suggests that if it doesn t have adequate reserves then it cannot lend so the presupposition is that by adding to bank reserves quantitative easing will help lending but banks do not operate like this bank lending is not reserve constrained banks lend to any credit worthy customer they can find and then worry about their reserve positions afterwards if they are short of reserves their reserve accounts have to be in positive balance each day and in some countries central banks require certain ratios to be maintained then they borrow from each other in the interbank market or ultimately they will borrow from the central bank through the so called discount window they are reluctant to use the latter facility because it carries a penalty higher interest cost the point is that building bank reserves will not increase the bank s capacity to lend loans create deposits which generate reserves the reason that the commercial banks are currently not lending much is because they are not convinced there are credit worthy customers on their doorstep in the current climate the assessment of what is credit worthy has become very strict compared to the lax days as the top of the boom approached those that claim that quantitative easing will expose the economy to uncontrollable inflation are just harking back to the old and flawed quantity theory of money this theory has no application in a modern monetary economy and proponents of it have to explain why economies with huge excess capacity to produce idle capital and high proportions of unused labour cannot expand production when the orders for goods and services increase should quantitative easing actually stimulate spending then the depressed economies will likely respond by increasing output not prices so the fact that large scale quantitative easing conducted by central banks in japan in 2001 and now in the uk and the usa has not caused inflation does not provide a strong refutation of the mainstream quantity theory of money because it has not impacted on the monetary aggregates the fact that is hasn t is not surprising if you understand how the monetary system operates but it has certainly bedazzled the easily dazzled mainstream economists the following blog posts may be of further interest to you question 3 the imposition of a fiscal rule at the national government level that the fiscal account has to be in balance at all times would eliminate fiscal balance swings driven by the automatic stabilisers the answer is false the final fiscal outcome is the difference between total federal revenue and total federal outlays so if total revenue is greater than outlays the fiscal outcome is in surplus and vice versa it is a simple matter of accounting with no theory involved however the fiscal balance is used by all and sundry to indicate the fiscal stance of the government so if the fiscal outcome is in surplus it is often concluded that the fiscal impact of government is contractionary withdrawing net spending and if the fiscal outcome is in deficit we say the fiscal impact expansionary adding net spending further a rising deficit falling surplus is often considered to be reflecting an expansionary policy stance and vice versa what we know is that a rising deficit may in fact indicate a contractionary fiscal stance which in turn creates such income losses that the automatic stabilisers start driving the fiscal outcome back towards or into deficit so the complication is that we cannot conclude that changes in the fiscal impact reflect discretionary policy changes the reason for this uncertainty clearly relates to the operation of the automatic stabilisers to see this the most simple model of the fiscal balance we might think of can be written as fiscal balance revenue spending tax revenue other revenue welfare payments other spending we know that tax revenue and welfare payments move inversely with respect to each other with the latter rising when gdp growth falls and the former rises with gdp growth these components of the fiscal balance are the so called automatic stabilisers in other words without any discretionary policy changes the fiscal balance will vary over the course of the business cycle when the economy is weak tax revenue falls and welfare payments rise and so the fiscal balance moves towards deficit or an increasing deficit when the economy is stronger tax revenue rises and welfare payments fall and the fiscal balance becomes increasingly positive automatic stabilisers attenuate the amplitude in the economic cycle by expanding the fiscal stance in a recession and contracting it in a boom so just because the fiscal outcome goes into deficit doesn t allow us to conclude that the government has suddenly become of an expansionary mind in other words the presence of automatic stabilisers make it hard to discern whether the fiscal policy stance chosen by the government is contractionary or expansionary at any particular point in time the first point to always be clear about then is that the fiscal balance is not determined by the government its discretionary policy stance certainly is an influence but the final outcome will reflect non government spending decisions in other words the concept of a fiscal rule where the government can set a desired balance in the case of the question zero and achieve that at all times is fraught it is likely that in attempting to achieve a balanced fiscal outcome the government will set its discretionary policy settings counter to the best interests of the economy either too contractionary or too expansionary if there was a balanced fiscal rule and private spending fell dramatically then the automatic stabilisers would push the fiscal outcome into the direction of deficit the final outcome would depend on net exports and whether the private sector was saving overall or not assume that net exports were in deficit typical case and private saving overall was positive then private spending declines in this case the actual fiscal outcome would be a deficit equal to the sum of the other two balances then in attempting to apply the fiscal rule the discretionary component of the fiscal stance would have to contract this contraction would further reduce aggregate demand and the automatic stabilisers loss of tax revenue and increased welfare payments would be working against the discretionary policy choice in that case the application of the fiscal rule would be undermining production and employment and probably not succeeding in getting the fiscal outcome into balance but every time a discretionary policy change was made the impact on aggregate demand and hence production would then trigger the automatic stabilisers via the income changes to work in the opposite direction to the discretionary policy shift you might like to read these blog posts for further information that is enough for today c

big mood photo pacific press lightrocket via getty images the american public is in the mood for big government according to the distinguished political scientist james stimson s public policy mood estimate a widely respected tool for measuring shifts in ideological opinion across time the u s electorate is more sympathetic to left wing economic policy today than at anytime in the past 68 years which is as far back as stimson s data goes tracking ideological change across decades is inherently difficult since some policy questions fall out of surveys as time passes while others enter them and what qualifies as the liberal or conservative position on a given issue can also evolve over time this is most conspicuously apparent on social and cultural policy where barack obama s 2008 position on gay marriage would put to the right of some congressional republicans in 2019 but stimson s index confines itself to the role of government in the economy or as he puts it the new deal and great society agendas and on this dimension of public opinion the arc of history has most definitely not bent in a consistently liberal direction in fact before the american public s mood hit a new peak for economic liberalism in 2018 the high point for such attitudes had been 1961 to the extent that there is a consistent pattern in the evolution of americans ideological attitudes in stimson s data it is a thermostatic one when a republican is in office or the bent of federal economic policy moves right public opinion tends to move left while democratic presidents or liberal policy initiatives tend to provoke the opposite reaction that said the public s newfound enthusiasm for left wing economic policy probably isn t purely a product of fickle swing voters reflexively changing their stripes while donald trump did make cutting social spending for the poor and slashing taxes on the rich his top legislative priorities upon taking office appeals to small government conservatism have never featured all that prominently in his rhetoric in fact the president insisted that his tax cuts would not benefit the wealthy and that his push for obamacare repeal would result in universal coverage at affordable prices as opposed to deficit reduction or some other objective consistent with the actual substance of his party s policy and trump isn t the only member of his party who has ceased to forthrightly argue for conservative economic priorities many republican candidates campaigned on their support for preserving subsidized health insurance for americans with preexisting conditions last fall even as they actively worked to undermine such protections in congress and the courts this mendacious messaging was likely a response to public opinion while voters views vary across time giving rich people tax breaks and throwing sick people off their health insurance have never been popular ideas in american politics but the fact that many leading republicans have ceased to advocate for fiscal conservatism while the party s standard bearer has at least rhetorically championed an active role for government in shaping economic outcomes might have played a part in pushing stimson s mood index left many partisan voters do not have strong intrinsic preferences on many economic issues which can often appear more technical than moral thus they will often take their ideological cues from partisan elites with a growing number of conservative commentators and republican politicians making populist noises on economic policy however disingenuous it wouldn t be surprising to see gop voters views start trending more liberal and considering that democratic elites have also shifted left in their economic messaging over the past two years it s possible that elite signaling accounts for much of the trend stimson documents regardless the liberal turn in the public s mood last year may ultimately prove less consequential than the leftward drift in the economic thinking of america s elite policy wonks over the past decade as we ve seen public opinion is fickle and exercises only limited influence on policy outcomes but changes in the conventional wisdom among elite policymakers are often durable and have the power to redefine the terms of the left versus right debate and economic events since the 2008 financial crisis have made it quite difficult for all but the most hackish apologists for upward redistribution to avoid revising their views in a leftward direction for example in the immediate aftermath of the crash many respectable thinkers on the center and right believed in the concept of expansionary austerity the notion that slashing deficits could spur higher growth even in a context of relatively low demand european countries structured their response to the crisis around this theory the united states by contrast pursued a conventionally liberal in the new deal sense keynesian response to the crisis running up its short term deficit for the sake of stimulating demand thus the western world effectively conducted a natural experiment testing the expansionary austerity hypothesis an experiment that utterly discredited fiscal conservatives countries that prioritized deficit reduction saw employment and growth fall off a cliff while the u s economy embarked on a historically long expansion albeit one that could have been even more robust had the austerians not intimidated the obama administration into proposing a smaller stimulus than its economics thought warranted and if this empirical embarrassment weren t enough one of the major papers undergirding the expansionary austerity theory proved to be incorrect on its own theoretical terms the research s key findings were premised on an excel formula error these events damaged the credibility of deficit hawks and the fact that the united states proceeded to carry on pushing up its debt to record levels while retaining the ability to borrow money at rock bottom interest rates and experiencing an undesirably low rate of inflation further eroded the standing of those who preached the supreme importance of fiscal rectitude even in the face of high unemployment and low demand another related pillar of pre crisis conservative economic orthodoxy was that policy makers must not allow the unemployment rate to fall too low or workers bargaining power to rise to high or else workers would be able to extract wages in excess of their own productivity which would lead to price increases which would produce further demands for excessive wages thereby setting off an inflationary spiral that would discourage investment and shrink the economy s productive capacity this fear of runaway inflation led conservative economist marvin goodfriend to warn that if the federal reserve allowed the unemployment rate to dip beneath 7 percent it would likely give rise to a rising inflation rate in the next few years which would just be disastrous for the economy of course the unemployment rate in the u s is now 3 6 percent and both inflation and wage growth are lower than the fed would like them to be in this context the case for suppressing full employment or the bargaining power of workers by discouraging unionization is exceptionally weak especially since america s top corporations could afford to be paying their workers much more without raising prices or reducing investment in fact these firms are simply sitting on trillions of dollars in cash unable or unwilling to find productive investments for their capital the conservative economists solution to that problem of course was to incentivize investment by cutting corporate tax rates but that resulted in one more natural experiment that contradicted conservative orthodoxy don t take my word for it take marco rubio s in his office s recent report on the decline of business investment in the united states the florida senator admits that while the trump tax cuts were often expressly advocated for as a means of on shoring corporate residence and increasing capital investment the legislation has shown little sign of reversing the historical decline in such investment anyhow this is far from a comprehensive catalogue of how post financial crisis trends have undermined conservative economic arguments the week s ryan cooper ably dissects a couple others here while the economist j w mason offers a guided tour of his profession s decade of embarrassments here the point is that economists who favor increasing worker power promoting full employment stimulating demand and having the public sector play a more active role in channeling investment now have a lot more empirical ammunition at their disposal than they did a decade ago while those who champion fiscal austerity a hawkish posture on inflation and supply side tax cuts as a panacea for increasing productive investment have far fewer arrows in their quiver and it shows the democratic party s leading economic thinkers have ceased worrying about deficits and grown far friendlier to organized labor and comfortable with sweeping state interventions in the economy to mitigate inequality and facilitate socially beneficial investment and while the republican party s finest hacks have carried on supplying the same rationalizations for plutocracy they always have other gop policy wonks like those working in rubio s office and center right think tanks like the niskanen center have been gravitating away from supply side dogma and toward the formerly liberal terrain of industrial policy when the next democratic president takes office there s a decent chance that the public s policy mood will shift back to the right but barring some radical change in macroeconomic reality the boundaries of america s economic debate will still almost certainly still lie to the left of where they ve been for most of the past four decades

country new teachers can t afford the median rent almost anywhere in the u s the analysis shows a point often made during recent teacher strikes across the country but that s not the full story it s not just pay no matter where they work or what they earn teachers feel disrespect despite widespread demand for higher salaries teachers in some regions are actually making ends meet especially as they approach the middle of their careers in other areas mid career teachers are right to say they can t afford to live on their salaries without picking up side hustles or commuting long distances

median rent or mortgage that s in line with experts recommendations for budgeting in today s era of teacher strikes and walkouts the analysis answers a key question can educators in this area afford to live on their take home pay often that answer was no because housing costs exceeded 30 of teachers salaries after taxes the reasons why varied depending on the community starting teacher salaries were low or teachers pay didn t increase much over time or housing was comparably expensive compounding teachers financial troubles are other costs the analysis could not include like student debt

story caps a school year focus on the pressures facing american teachers to perform the analysis usa today relied on data from two sources salary figures came from employers who reported to the bureau of labor statistics occupational employment statistics program as released in may 2017 because elementary teachers are the most prevalent the analysis focused on elementary pay in the 10th median and 90th percentile in each metro the survey includes public and private schools other analyses of teacher salaries tend to use a single measure of pay usually starting teacher salaries or median pay both of which oversimplify the issue usa today s spectrum of pay approach based on percentiles was designed to account for the fact that most teachers make more money as they gain years of experience similarly examining pay in metro areas instead of states allowed reporters to differentiate between high and low cost areas even within the same state to further account for real life factors usa today applied the federal tax rate for single filers to each salary figure to estimate elementary teachers take home pay in each metro next the analysis aimed to show whether teachers could afford to live on their take home pay their pay was compared with the proprietary zillow rental index from the real estate website that measure starts with median rents in each metro and applies a three month moving average while accounting for outlier figures the analysis focused on rent prices because mortgage payments can vary dramatically based on local taxes interest rates and insurance rates rental prices were most inclusive of the additional costs that factor into housing the 291 metros analyzed were those for which data existed in both the federal salary and zillow data sets

the government said u s job growth slowed sharply in may and wages rose less than expected raising fears that a loss of momentum in economic activity could be spreading to the labor market which could put pressure on the federal reserve to cut interest rates this year the broad cool off in hiring reported by the labor department on friday was even before a recent escalation in trade tensions between the united states and two of its major trading partners china and mexico analysts have warned the trade fights could undermine the economy which will celebrate 10 years of expansion next month the longest on record adding a sting to the closely watched employment report the economy created far fewer jobs in march and april than previously reported the economy thus far has been largely resilient to the trade war with china president donald trump in early may slapped additional tariffs of up to 25 on 200 billion of chinese goods which prompted retaliation by beijing last week trump said he would impose a tariff on all goods from mexico in a bid to force authorities in that country to stop immigrants from central america from crossing the border into the united states talks are ongoing to prevent the duties from kicking in at 5 on june 10 fed chairman jerome powell said on tuesday the central bank was closely monitoring the implications of the trade tensions on the economy

payrolls processing firm adp showing the smallest gain in private payrolls in nine years last month another report this week showed a drop in online ads by businesses looking for help last month s slowdown in job gains however probably understates the health of the labor market as measures such as weekly applications for unemployment benefits and the institute for supply management s services

listen to this article a sense to look after one another is what us ambassador virginia palmer will take back home with her from malawi she is concluding her tenure of office in malawi after almost four years she talks to weekend nation deputy editor moses michael phiri in this special interview as you leave office what are the enduring moments you take from here palmer i have lots of happy memories of malawi my most enduring memories are of malawi s wonderful people postani who walks 12 kilometers every day to attend an online university programme jacques who lives in dzaleka refugee camp and works to improve the lives of both refugees in the camp and malawians in surrounding communities memory who campaigns for girls rights chikondi who ran a project teaching families the importance of good sanitation and is now studying to be a clinical officer i could go on and all of these malawians are under 30 malawi s future is certainly bright when i reflect back over the embassy s work of the last four and a half years i think i am proudest of the work the united states has helped malawi do to empower adolescent girls and young women the fulcrum of all of malawi s development goals with us support malawi was the first country in africa to launch a comprehensive agyw strategy i m so happy that we will use pepfar and other us government fundings to build up to 200 high schools in malawi this will keep kids particularly girls in school the government of malawi s waiving of secondary school tuition fees will be incredibly helpful to this effort i believe malawi s example will demonstrate that keeping girls in school will reduce their lifetime risk of hiv and serve as an important example for the rest of africa many of these students will develop the tools needed to succeed in secondary school through us support for malawi s national reading programme which as first lady melania trump witnessed first hand last october for the first time put english and chichewa textbooks in the hands of every grade standard 1 4 student nationwide i m also very proud that through the relentless efforts of american and malawian health professionals malawi is now on the cusp of controlling the hiv aids epidemic together we have saved hundreds of thousands of lives prevented tens of thousands of hiv infections and transformed the aids response from death and despair to life and hope looking forward with us support malawi has implemented innovative programs to ensure that malawians know their status obtain treatment and suppress the virus finally i m proud that the united states helped provide food to malawi after the 2015 floods the 2016 el nino drought and after the terrible floods this year implementing malawi s resilience strategy the only such whole of government strategy in the region is critical as are agricultural reforms like a seed act and a fertiliser act to break this cycle of food insecurity the us uk and other western countries have stressed so much financial prudence are you impressed with the efforts malawi government has made in improving the public finance management system described once by your colleagues as a leaking bucket the government of malawi has made impressive strides to improve public finance management since the cashgate scandal through implementing reforms and adopting judicious macro economic policies the government has tamed inflation reduced interest rates stabilised the exchange rate and controlled external debt at the same time i think all would agree that more work is needed building on the public expenditure and financial accountability assessments i encourage the government to implement much need pfm reforms including passing and implementing the draft revised pfm act at the same time the pfm bill s strong enforcement language should not undermine the freedoms of ngos which play a critical role in ensuring accountability to strengthen accountability processes such as audits the government must gazette the newly amended public audit act of 2018 empower the national audit office and address weaknesses highlighted in completed audits finally i strongly urge the government to revamp its public procurement process to ensure transparency and fairness too often we read about secretive and irregular procurements that feed corruption and take needed resources from malawi s development the us plays a major role in the health sector where some corruption issues such as drug pilferage emerged what have been the achievements in this sector since 2003 the u s government has invested over 1 billion in malawi s efforts to combat the hiv epidemic over 300 million to tackle malaria over 100 million to combat tb and over 200 million to improve laboratory capacity and combat other infectious diseases we have also contributed a third of the 1 billion malawi has received from the global fund for hiv tb and malaria through this investment by the end of 2018 the us government has helped reach over 805 000 malawians with life saving hiv treatment while life expectancy in malawi has increased from about 45 years in 2000 at the height of the hiv epidemic to 65 today u s investments in maternal and child health family planning malaria water and sanitation and nutrition have contributed to steady declines in child illness and death as well as a marked decrease in stunting however theft and pilferage limit malawi s health gains deprive malawians of life saving medicines and steal funds from us and malawian taxpayers i appreciate ministry of health efforts to bring thieves to justice from 2016 to march 2019 the government of malawi identified 233 cases for prosecution and obtained 167 convictions i urge all malawian citizens to join forces with their nation s health and law enforcement authorities to stop drug theft and fully implement the amended pharmacy and medicines regulation act what memories do you take from malawi i love my job so my personal and professional memories are sort of combined i was very moved when we visited mitawa village eight years ago mitawa was one of the poorest villages in the area we provided food for work assistance to help the village improve its water management now their borehole has water all year round fields are irrigated and there are aquaculture ponds and even solar electricity when villages along the valley needed food assistance after the 2016 drought mitawa was able to feed itself when i visited the village three years after our programme had ended the village headman didn t ask for additional assistance he said thank you for what you have taught us please teach someone else i also loved watching the largest wildlife relocation in history from liwonde and majete to nkhotakhota i got to go in the helicopter and even touch the elephants after they were darted i was filled with admiration for malawi s rangers and the work that african parks and wildlife have done protect this precious resource i m happy that the united states is assisting malawi s wildlife and environmental conservation efforts i have many happy memories of lake malawi another treasure that must be protected but i remember the first time i visited the lake after some great snorkeling to see malawi s famous cichlids i returned to sit on the porch of the house we rented only then did i notice a sign that said beware of crocodiles do not swim at night if you are taken by a croc try and grab its leg i was glad that i saw it after a wonderful day of swimming and man i have lots of happy memories of wonderful dances in villages across malawi what will be your rating on malawi s fight against corruption is there optimism the african union estimates that africa has lost hundreds of billions of dollars to corruption hundreds of billions that was not invested in education infrastructure or security bribes and corruption keep people in poverty they encourage inequality and they undercut citizens faith in their own government legitimate investment stays away malawi cannot afford this i believe that public sector reform programme will be one of president mutharika s legacies and hope that he will reinvigorate public sector reform efforts which languished after a robust start in 2015 the payroll needs to be cleaned and poor performers and thieves who misuse public funds must be sacked so malawi s talented civil service can provide the services malawians need and demand passage of the draft public service bill prepared earlier this year and full implementation of the access to information and public procurement laws are crucial accountability institutions like the anti corruption bureau must be fully funded and fully staffed accountability is essential for example we cannot fund ministry of health programs directly because we continue to wait for final resolution on the disciplining of ministry of health officials found in 2015 to have misappropriated us government funds i am confident that malawians are eager to see the companies and individuals identified in the 87 case files which the national audit office to the acb months ago prosecuted to the full extent of the law one of the landmarks during your term was the implementation of the mcc compact are you so far satisfied with how malawi took the challenge i m very proud of the work malawi and the united states did to make malawi s millennium challenge compact mcc one of the most successful mcc compacts in the world it s very important that the compact s reforms including governance improvements at electricity supply corporation of malawi are continued so that escom remains financially viable the compact laid an important foundation for greater private sector investment in power generation which will electrify the malawian economy encouraging investment and job creation in manufacturing and agriculture i hope malawi will someday soon be able to sell power to the southern african power grid critically the success of malawi s compact and malawi s high scores on the mcc scorecard which includes things like macro economic stability fighting corruption and free press and civil society and is reassessed every year meant that malawi is eligible for a second compact over the next two years we will work with the malawian government and stakeholders to identify constraints on economic growth and develop a new compact to unlock them q you are leaving at a time malawians have voted in peter mutharika again what is your parting word to this new government a this is a critical time for malawi and an opportunity for a second mutharika administration i hope the government will both stay the course and do more and with greater urgency with scarce resources only expenditures that contribute to development should be funded and mlendo ndiye amadza ndikalumo kakuthwa we cannot be satisfied with beautifully crafted laws and policy full and speedy implementation is critical lastly who will take over from you and where is he she coming from my friend ambassador robert scott will arrive from washington d c in july as the new us ambassador ambassador scott has extensive regional experience having served as deputy chief of mission in tanzania and zimbabwe

alexandria united states in a recent project syndicate commentary james k galbraith of the university of texas at austin defends modern monetary theory mmt and corrects some misunderstandings about the relationships among mmt federal deficits and central bank independence but galbraith does not explore what is perhaps the most important issue of all the political conditions needed to implement mmt effectively mmt owes its newfound relevance to the fact that deflation rather than inflation is becoming central banks main concern for a high debt high deficit economy like the united states deflation is an especially serious threat because it delays consumption and increases debtor anxiety consumers forego major purchases on the assumption that future prices will be lower homeowners with mortgages cut back their spending when they see home prices falling and the equity in their homes declining these cutbacks worry the federal reserve fed because they add to deflationary pressures and could trigger deeper spending cuts stock market declines and widespread deleveraging the fed s inability so far to reach its 2 per cent target for annual inflation suggests that it lacks the means to overcome persistent disinflationary forces in the economy these forces include increased us market concentration which diminishes aggregate demand by weakening employee bargaining power and increasing income inequality population aging inadequate investment in infrastructure and climate change abatement and technology driven labour displacement making matters worse us political gridlock assures continued commitment to economically exhausted strategies such as tax cuts for the rich at the expense of investing in education and other sources of long term growth these conditions cry out for significant changes in us government spending and tax policies mmt is seen as a way to accomplish the needed changes it holds that a government can spend as much as it wants if it borrows in its own currency and its central bank can buy as much of the government s debt as necessary as long as doing so does not generate unacceptably high inflation both tax cut advocates and supporters of public investment find little not to like mmt has been roundly criticised by economists across the political spectrum from kenneth rogoff and lawrence h summers of harvard university to paul krugman of the city university of new york all contend that it is a political argument masquerading as economic theory but galbraith and ray dalio of bridgewater associates see mmt differently dalio argues that mmt is real and more to the point it is an inevitable policy step in historically recurring debt cycle downturns in his book principles for navigating big debt crises dalio documents the steps that central banks have historically taken when faced with a booming economy that suddenly crumples under the weight of debt the first step monetary policy one mp1 is to cut overnight official rates to stimulate credit and investment expansion the second mp2 is to buy government debt quantitative easing to support asset prices and prevent uncontrollable waves of deleveraging if mp1 and mp2 are insufficient to halt a downturn central banks take step three mmt which dalio calls mp3 and proceed to finance the spending priorities that political leaders deem most essential the priorities can range from financing major national projects to helicopter money transfers directly to consumers achieving political agreement on what to finance and how is essential for implementing mp3 effectively in a financial meltdown or other national emergency political unity and prompt action are essential unity requires a strong consensus on what should be financed speed requires the existence of a trusted institution to direct the spending in the early 1940s when the us entered world war ii and winning the war became the government s top priority the fed entered full mp3 mode it not only set short and long term rates for treasury bonds but also bought as much government debt as necessary to finance the war effort mp3 was possible because the war united the country politically and gave the roosevelt administration near authoritarian rule over the economy the core weakness of mp3 mmt advocacy is the absence of an explanation of how to achieve political unity on what to finance and how this absence is inexcusable total us debt as a share of gdp is approaching levels associated with past financial meltdowns and that does not even account for the hidden debts associated with infrastructure maintenance rising sea levels and unfunded pensions for the reasons dalio lays out a us debt crisis requiring some form of mp3 is all but inevitable the crucial question that any effort to achieve political unity must answer is what constitutes justifiable spending alexander hamilton america s first secretary of the treasury offered an answer in 1781 a national debt he wrote if it is not excessive will be to us a national blessing a government s debt is excessive if it cannot be repaid because its proceeds were spent in ways that did not increase national wealth enough to do so debt resulting from tax cuts that are spent on mega yachts would almost certainly be excessive debt incurred to improve educational outcomes maintain essential infrastructure or address climate change would probably not be accordingly it will be easier to achieve political unity if mp3 proceeds are spent on priorities such as education infrastructure or climate the political test for justifying mp3 financed government spending is clear will future generations judge that the borrowing was not excessive most americans born well after world war ii would say that the debt incurred to win that war was justified as was the debt that financed the construction of the interstate highway system which literally paved the way for stronger growth as the 1930s and 1940s show mp3 is a natural component of government responses to major debt downturns and the political crises they trigger we know much more about what contributes to economic growth and sustainability than we did in the first half of the 20th century to speed recovery from the next downturn we need to identify now the types of spending that will contribute most to sustainable recovery and that in hindsight will be viewed as most justified by future americans we need also to design the institutions that will direct the spending these are the keys to building the political unity that mmt requires to know what to finance and how future americans can show us the way we need only put ourselves in their shoes robert h dugger is managing partner at hanover provident capital llc copyright project syndicate 2019 www project

but over the past month trump has made a higher stakes gamble on the economy s durability he s more than doubled tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports he s preparing to tax an additional 300 billion in goods from china extending his import taxes to everything beijing sells to the united states article content and in a move that alarmed some of his own advisers and caught investors by surprise trump said he would impose a 5 tax on mexican imports starting monday a tax that would reach 25 by oct 1 if the mexican government fails to stop a flow of central american migrants into the united states combined the actions mark a broad escalation of trump s trade wars the new tariffs on chinese and mexican imports amount to potentially 190 billion a year in new taxes paid by u s importers and typically passed on to consumers for american households this means higher prices on fruits and vegetables autos electronic components and other necessities what s more exporters especially farmers can expect to suffer retaliation when china and mexico hit back with tariffs or other sanctions on exports from the united states advertisement 3 story continues below this

states could tumble into recession for the first time since 2009 the federal reserve has taken notice chairman jerome powell made clear this week that the fed is prepared intervene likely by lowering

role trade punches above its weight in american political discourse consider the revamped version of the politically contentious north american free trade agreement that the u s negotiated last year with canada and mexico one of trump s policy achievements trump said the new pact the u s mexico canada agreement would create jobs and restore america s status as a manufacturing powerhouse by drawing factories back to the u s from low wage mexico but the independent u s international trade commission analyzed the new agreement and concluded that it would boost the economy by just 68 billion and add 176 000 jobs over six years negligible gains in a 21 trillion economy and a job market exceeding 150 million people likewise said jason furman who served as chairman of president

start to actually see the trade war in jobs gdp and other aspects of the economy furman who is now at the harvard kennedy school said he doubts the new tariffs would tip the united states economy into recession but they would certainly help push it in that direction for months businesses and investors have largely convinced themselves that trump would deploy his tariffs only temporarily as leverage to pry concessions from china mexico and others and just over a month ago it looked as if the u s and china were nearing a resolution in their conflict over beijing s aggressive push to overtake american technological dominance but negotiations collapsed and trump ramped up tariffs after the u s side accused beijing of reneging on commitments made earlier in the negotiations even more unsettling was trump s sudden decision to tax mexican imports this came less than two weeks after he d lifted tariffs on mexican and canadian steel and aluminum which had seemed an effort to ease

on may 30 u s president donald trump threatened to impose a 5 percent tariff on all goods from mexico starting june 10 unless the country takes substantial steps to stem the flow of migrants crossing the u s border according to trump s statement that tariff would continue to rise by 5 percentage points on the first day of each following month until eventually capping off at 25 percent in october where it would remain until washington deems enough has been done to counter northbound migration flows from central america the big picture u s president donald trump has made immigration a clear priority as he gears up for his re election in 2020 after shutting down the government in december in a bid to fund his u s mexico border wall trump is now threatening an unprecedented tariff hike on mexican imports in the hopes of getting mexico city to stem the increasing number of central american migrants showing up at washington s southern doorstep however combined with the president s ongoing disputes with other key u s trade partners a full blown trade war with mexico could be the final straw that pushes the united states into a recession what s the likelihood trump will follow through other than fewer migrants flowing through it remains unclear what other criteria the united states would be use to judge mexico following trump s announcement a white house official only noted that the criteria would be ad hoc given this ambiguity it s possible that trump could back down from the full threat using it instead as leverage to reach a modest agreement with mexico that he could then declare as a victory on the other hand the president has also shown that he is willing to tolerate significant collateral damage in order to implement his immigration policy as evidenced by the 35 day government shutdown earlier this year trump made a similar threat in april in which he gave mexico one year to halt migration flows before imposing tariffs on its exports but now he s significantly turned up the heat with a new june 10 deadline a nearly impossible timeline for mexico to fully implement any kind of plan there are rumors trump made the threat in haste after hearing a report about an increase in migrants crossing the u s mexico border thus it is possible that trump is willing to make a quick withdrawal from the threat if mexico can make modest concessions what s behind trump s threat securing the u s mexico border was a key pillar of trump s 2016 campaign platform that ultimately ushered him to victory but over the past two years migrant crossings into the united states largely from central america have risen to decade high levels in april alone customs and border protection officers arrested nearly 100 000 migrants crossing illegally most of whom had families requesting asylum in addition to threatening trump s campaign promise of a security crackdown on the southern border this sudden influx of migrants has also strained the u s border security forces ability to process and hold people awaiting removal or a hearing on asylum and while the mexican army and police forces are involved in operations to detain or deter migrant flows the number of crossing points and corrupt security officers have hindered mexico s ability to meaningfully stem the movement of people does trump have the power to impose such tariffs the short answer is possibly though it d be an unprecedented move and could be challenged by the courts the international emergency economic powers act ieepa gives the u s president significant power to regulate aspects of global commerce in the event of a national emergency that is either wholly or partially international and the white house has already declared a national emergency on its border with mexico in an effort to redistribute the 6 7 billion in government funds towards trump s wall and border security however the ieepa does not explicitly authorize the president to implement tariffs as a way to deal with a national emergency instead it affords the power to regulate certain commercial activities with the country in question through foreign exchange transactions or the transfer of payments between banking institutions the ieepa has also never been used to implement tariffs against another country in fact the law was initially passed in 1977 as a way to limit some of the powers congress previously delegated to the president in times of emergency it can certainly be argued that using the ieepa to implement tariffs is an expansive interpretation of the law however the u s judicial system does tend to defer to the president on issues of national security congress also still has the power to reverse national emergencies and block tariffs though doing so would require a joint resolution signed into law something that would demand significant bipartisan backing and despite trump s previous trade wars irking many members of his party republicans have yet to overturn a single tariff trump has implemented the extent to which the federal law can be used to implement tariffs has not been determined by u s federal courts and would thus set an important precedent for u s foreign policy how will this affect usmca approval trump s tariff threats certainly risk sticking a pin in the process to approve the united states mexico canada agreement usmca on both sides mexico had submitted the agreement to its legislature for ratification on may 30 but trump s threat announced just hours later now risks making the usmca a sideshow even if president trump fully removed the north american free trade agreement to allow mexico and the united states to instead deal on world trade organization terms the average tariff that mexican exporters would face would be less than five percent which is where trump s threatened move starts and the full 25 percent tariff would be more than seven times higher such a sizable tax hike would likely force mexico city to consider delaying a full passing of usmca until after this particular issue is resolved just as it did earlier this year when it stalled the process until the united states removed steel and aluminum tariffs on mexican products meanwhile in washington the senate had been blocking the agreement over the steel and aluminum tariffs as well and will likely try to do the same should trump follow through on imposing these new tariffs that said it s also possible trump could use the threat of a trade war with mexico as leverage against congress to get usmca approved how might mexico respond to the threat countries typically retaliate when a trade partner tacks on higher tariffs hence the name trade war but for mexico a full retaliation will be difficult due to its sputtering economy which has not seen positive gross domestic product gdp growth for three of the last four quarters trump s announcement unsurprisingly has already jarred global markets with the mexican peso falling 3 percent the tariffs risk pushing mexico into an even deeper recession and if mexico responds by upping its own tariffs on u s goods that would only make matters worse limiting the extent to which mexico is willing or able to match the united states tit for tat in a potential trade war instead mexico could try a more targeted approach to minimize the blowback on its economy such as imposing taxes on only agricultural goods still the safest option may indeed be to appease trump in some capacity and allow him to declare a victory of some sort in exchange for no tariffs at all and indeed mexico appears to already be taking such a route with president andres manuel lopez obrador sending an emergency delegation to washington on may 31 what would be the economic toll for both countries the extent to which president trump s threats hit the u s economy would depend on the level of mexican retaliation and whether or not the tariffs end up reaching the 25 percent cap in october compared with the other global tariff disputes trump has waged so far a trade war between the united states and mexico would undoubtedly be the most damaging one yet roughly two thirds of u s imports from mexico are through intracompany trade meaning goods can cross the border several times before becoming a finished product this highlights the high degree of economic interconnectivity between the two countries in the worst case scenario both mexico and the united states could both slap each other with 25 percent tariffs should such tariffs last for months u s economic growth in the short term could be hit by more than 1 percent of gdp and mexico s could go well beyond 10 percent but this extreme case is highly unlikely because it would almost certainly be met with backlash in washington even a modest scenario of just 5 percent tariffs with comparable retaliation from mexico could result in a roughly 25 percent drop in u s gdp and an up to 5 percent drop in mexico s gdp what are the implications for trump s other trade wars trump is threatening to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on a total of roughly 1 trillion in u s imports from mexico when adding up the potential impacts of trump s threatened tariffs on almost all imports from mexico and china as well as japanese and european cars he risks sending the united states into a recession thus damaging his re election hopes in 2020
us border officers apprehended more than 132 000 people crossing from mexico in may the highest monthly level since 2006 and trump who has railed against what he describes as an invasion had threatened to impose levies rising to 25 per cent unless mexico addressed the problem mexico made concessions during the talks offering to send 6000 troops to its southern border with guatemala but has also said it wants to see a long term solution that would involve economic development aid marc short chief of staff to us vice president mike pence said earlier on friday that the united states was moving ahead with a legal notification of the tariffs on mexican goods you should anticipate that happening today he said at the white house trump who has railed against what he describes as a surge of migrants across the us mexico border has warned that the initial tariffs on mexico will be incrementally increased each month up to 25 per cent if a migration deal fails to materialise andres manuel lopez obrador was optimistic a resolution would be reached bloomberg mexico scrambled to avoid such a scenario advertisement it s a good sign that talks have not broken down mexican president andres manuel lopez obrador told reporters in mexico city earlier in the day there is dialogue and an agreement can be reached i m optimistic we can achieve that lopez obrador however said it was a mistake for the united states to link migration with trade mexico had prepared a list of possible retaliatory tariffs targeting us products from agricultural and industrial states regarded as trump s electoral base a tactic china has also used with an eye toward the president s 2020 re election bid the united states slapped up to 25 per cent tariffs on us200 billion in chinese imports last month prompting beijing to levy its own tariffs on a revised target list of us60 billion in american goods us officials officially granted chinese exporters two more weeks to get their products into the united states before the higher tariffs were applied according to a us government notice posted online on friday advertisement trump said on thursday he would decide later this month whether to carry out his threat to hit beijing with tariffs on an additional list of us300 billion in chinese goods the looming us tariffs had caused businesses in mexico to scramble to get their products into the united states it s very chaotic we might be able to put up with 5 per cent for a little bit 10 per cent maybe said guillermo valencia president of valencia international a customs broker in nogales arizona there are very few businesses that can take a 25 per cent increase in costs and stay alive economists say the trade disputes could damage key supply lines and pinch consumers at a time when the global economic expansion that followed the 2008 financial crisis has started to sour and the risk of recession has risen trump s tariff threat against mexico also has cast a cloud over the united states mexico canada agreement a trade deal that was meant to replace the north american free trade agreement the three countries have not yet ratified usmca credit ratings agency fitch downgraded mexico s sovereign debt rating on wednesday citing the trade tensions among other risks while moody s lowered its outlook to negative advertisement even the united states one of the more solid performers on the economic stage would not be immune to the downdraft the us labor department reported on friday that job growth slowed sharply in may and wages rose less than expected raising fears that a loss of momentum in economic activity could be spreading to the american labour market trump s protectionist approach has angered key us trading partners and prompted rebukes from foreign leaders speaking at an economic forum in st petersburg russian president vladimir putin accused the united states on friday of unbridled economic egoism and said washington s tactics would lead to trade wars and maybe not just trade wars chinese president xi jinping speaking at the same event called on world powers to protect the global multilateral trade system reuters
risks from the us china trade war and an expected turn in global monetary policy will feature high on the agenda as finance and central banking chiefs from the group of 20 gather this weekend in fukuoka japan the meeting takes place as the world s two biggest economies ramp up tariffs against each other hurting the global economy and leaving policy makers struggling to shore up growth the g 20 officials are also set to tackle issues ranging from enhancing financial sector security and imposing tax on international transactions while an official communique is due at the end interesting developments often occur at one on one meetings the most anticipated is the one planned between us treasury secretary steven mnuchin and china s central bank chief yi gang whether the two countries can get beyond their current impasse will be keenly watched here are the big themes to look out for trade war drama it s not just china in president donald trump s tariff cross hairs tariffs on mexico are set to take effect next week unless a dramatic last moment agreement is reached and then there s the prospect of levies on imported cars which would hammer japanese korean and european automakers so watch out for plenty of commentary around protectionism finance chiefs will bemoan the spillovers from the trade war into the global economy but some will hold back from directly criticizing trump s tariffs given the heavy presence of the us in g 20 discussions japanese officials have said a statement against protectionism probably won t make it into the communique according to a local newspaper report dos and don ts be on the lookout for officials to frame trade policy recommendations around dos and don ts among the don ts statements to ensure no economy manipulates its currency

alexandria united states in a recent project syndicate commentary james k galbraith of the university of texas at austin defends modern monetary theory mmt and corrects some misunderstandings about the relationships among mmt federal deficits and central bank independence but galbraith does not explore what is perhaps the most important issue of all the political conditions needed to implement mmt effectively mmt owes its newfound relevance to the fact that deflation rather than inflation is becoming central banks main concern for a high debt high deficit economy like the united states deflation is an especially serious threat because it delays consumption and increases debtor anxiety consumers forego major purchases on the assumption that future prices will be lower homeowners with mortgages cut back their spending when they see home prices falling and the equity in their homes declining these cutbacks worry the federal reserve fed because they add to deflationary pressures and could trigger deeper spending cuts stock market declines and widespread deleveraging the fed s inability so far to reach its 2 per cent target for annual inflation suggests that it lacks the means to overcome persistent disinflationary forces in the economy these forces include increased us market concentration which diminishes aggregate demand by weakening employee bargaining power and increasing income inequality population aging inadequate investment in infrastructure and climate change abatement and technology driven labour displacement making matters worse us political gridlock assures continued commitment to economically exhausted strategies such as tax cuts for the rich at the expense of investing in education and other sources of long term growth these conditions cry out for significant changes in us government spending and tax policies mmt is seen as a way to accomplish the needed changes it holds that a government can spend as much as it wants if it borrows in its own currency and its central bank can buy as much of the government s debt as necessary as long as doing so does not generate unacceptably high inflation both tax cut advocates and supporters of public investment find little not to like mmt has been roundly criticised by economists across the political spectrum from kenneth rogoff and lawrence h summers of harvard university to paul krugman of the city university of new york all contend that it is a political argument masquerading as economic theory but galbraith and ray dalio of bridgewater associates see mmt differently dalio argues that mmt is real and more to the point it is an inevitable policy step in historically recurring debt cycle downturns in his book principles for navigating big debt crises dalio documents the steps that central banks have historically taken when faced with a booming economy that suddenly crumples under the weight of debt the first step monetary policy one mp1 is to cut overnight official rates to stimulate credit and investment expansion the second mp2 is to buy government debt quantitative easing to support asset prices and prevent uncontrollable waves of deleveraging if mp1 and mp2 are insufficient to halt a downturn central banks take step three mmt which dalio calls mp3 and proceed to finance the spending priorities that political leaders deem most essential the priorities can range from financing major national projects to helicopter money transfers directly to consumers achieving political agreement on what to finance and how is essential for implementing mp3 effectively in a financial meltdown or other national emergency political unity and prompt action are essential unity requires a strong consensus on what should be financed speed requires the existence of a trusted institution to direct the spending in the early 1940s when the us entered world war ii and winning the war became the government s top priority the fed entered full mp3 mode it not only set short and long term rates for treasury bonds but also bought as much government debt as necessary to finance the war effort mp3 was possible because the war united the country politically and gave the roosevelt administration near authoritarian rule over the economy the core weakness of mp3 mmt advocacy is the absence of an explanation of how to achieve political unity on what to finance and how this absence is inexcusable total us debt as a share of gdp is approaching levels associated with past financial meltdowns and that does not even account for the hidden debts associated with infrastructure maintenance rising sea levels and unfunded pensions for the reasons dalio lays out a us debt crisis requiring some form of mp3 is all but inevitable the crucial question that any effort to achieve political unity must answer is what constitutes justifiable spending alexander hamilton america s first secretary of the treasury offered an answer in 1781 a national debt he wrote if it is not excessive will be to us a national blessing a government s debt is excessive if it cannot be repaid because its proceeds were spent in ways that did not increase national wealth enough to do so debt resulting from tax cuts that are spent on mega yachts would almost certainly be excessive debt incurred to improve educational outcomes maintain essential infrastructure or address climate change would probably not be accordingly it will be easier to achieve political unity if mp3 proceeds are spent on priorities such as education infrastructure or climate the political test for justifying mp3 financed government spending is clear will future generations judge that the borrowing was not excessive most americans born well after world war ii would say that the debt incurred to win that war was justified as was the debt that financed the construction of the interstate highway system which literally paved the way for stronger growth as the 1930s and 1940s show mp3 is a natural component of government responses to major debt downturns and the political crises they trigger we know much more about what contributes to economic growth and sustainability than we did in the first half of the 20th century to speed recovery from the next downturn we need to identify now the types of spending that will contribute most to sustainable recovery and that in hindsight will be viewed as most justified by future americans we need also to design the institutions that will direct the spending these are the keys to building the political unity that mmt requires to know what to finance and how future americans can show us the way we need only put ourselves in their shoes robert h dugger is managing partner at hanover provident capital llc copyright project syndicate 2019 www project

canadian lumber is hitting the construction industry trump responds to china s retaliatory tariffs this is a very positive step i love the position we re in while the latest data is cautionary economists caution against reading too much into any one jobs report kevin hassett mr trump s chief economist said much of the slowdown in hiring in construction can be explained by the torrential rains and flooding that pounded parts of the country we think half the story is weather mr hassett said manufacturing did slow over the last few months but attributing that to trade right now is tricky because mexico just started and the china negotiations did only hit a roadblock in may mr hassett is still predicting growth will be about 3 per cent this year as mr trump s tax cuts and deregulation continue to play out he also argues that markets and the economy could enjoy an upswing once trade deals are finalised the economy has been much stronger than markets expected time after time mr hassett said there was widespread expectation among economists outside the white house that growth and hiring would slow this year after a strong 2018 that was boosted by the tax cuts and additional government spending for many the debate is whether it will be a gentle or more violent fall this looks like an economy that is slowing down which doesn t mean that we re necessarily entering a recession it does mean that we likely will not have the strength that we had in past years ms gimbel said the us economy has also been expanding for 10 years a record and companies typically run out of people to hire at this stage of the business cycle so some of the waning employment growth was anticipated may marked the 104th straight month of job gains for the nation a record streak that has helped many americans including those with disabilities or criminal histories to find jobs many business leaders say finding workers is their top struggle but they are not raising wages as fast as they were earlier this year the average hourly wage grew 3 1 per cent in the past year above the cost of living but well below the 4 per cent growth experienced during the economic boom of the late 1990s workers and economists had hoped to see stronger wage gains this summer as unemployment remained low but wage gains appear to be stalling annual wage growth hit 3 4 per cent in february but has since pulled back slightly raising concerns that this might be as good as it gets for workers this time around job experts advise workers to ask for raises or look to change jobs soon before the economy shows more signs of weakening and that people should focus on getting their personal finances in order now the weaker than expected may employment report serves as a reminder that the sun doesn t shine on the economy forever said mark hamrick senior economic analyst at bankrate it underscores the need to save for emergencies and to pay down debt in preparation for the inevitable economic downturn or turbulence the washington post

deregulation continue to play out he also argues that markets and the economy could enjoy an upswing once trade deals are finalised the economy has been much stronger than markets expected time after time mr hassett said there was widespread expectation among economists outside the white house that growth and hiring would slow this year after a strong 2018 that was boosted by the tax cuts and additional government spending for many the debate is whether it will be a gentle or more violent fall this looks like an economy that is slowing down which doesn t mean that we re necessarily entering a recession it does mean that we likely will not have the strength that we had in past years ms gimbel said the us economy has also been expanding for 10 years a record and companies typically run out of people to hire at this stage of the business cycle so some of the waning employment growth was anticipated may marked the 104th straight month of job gains for the nation a record streak that has helped many americans including those with disabilities or criminal histories to find jobs many business leaders say finding workers is their top struggle but they are not raising wages as fast as they were earlier this year the average hourly wage grew 3 1 per cent in the past year above the cost of living but well below the 4 per cent growth experienced during the economic boom of the late 1990s workers and economists had hoped to see stronger wage gains this summer as unemployment remained low but wage gains appear to be stalling annual wage growth hit 3 4 per cent in february but has since pulled back slightly raising concerns that this might be as good as it gets for workers this time around job experts advise workers to ask for raises or look to change jobs soon before the economy shows more signs of weakening and that people should focus on getting their personal finances in order now the weaker than expected may employment report serves as a reminder that the sun doesn t shine on the economy forever said mark hamrick senior economic analyst at bankrate it underscores the need to save for emergencies and to pay down debt in preparation for the inevitable economic downturn or turbulence the washington post

six months after mexican president andr√©s manuel l√≥pez obrador amlo assumed the presidency jacobin magazine affiliated with the democratic socialists of america has stepped up its efforts to provide amlo with a left cover by painting him as a progressive and even a socialist jacobin has intervened to promote amlo at a moment when the intensification of the class struggle the mass roundup and deportation of immigrants and the mexican government s subservience to the fascistic trump administration have all exposed his administration as an enemy of the working class in the eyes of millions of workers in mexico and across central america the may 26 article by jacobin titled amlo can t do this alone alleges that amlo is a great progressive but that despite his best efforts he is under siege from organized crime opposition politicians domestic and foreign finance capital and even the leadership of his own party the movement for national regeneration morena both mexican and international elites want to scuttle amlo s progressive agenda the article begins according to jacobin amlo possesses energy charisma and frenetic activity and is seeking to storm the castle however he is supposedly fighting against a formidable array of forces and a party that is being infiltrated by opportunists in the face of such a sweeping endorsement of amlo s credentials what has been the real record of his administration almost a year after his election and sixth months after the beginning of his administration his government has only deepened and intensified its attacks on the working class in many cases going further than the openly right wing parties that have ruled mexico for 89 years acting as a subservient stooge of the trump administration amlo has escalated the assault on immigrants while cynically claiming to protect their human rights in december his government agreed to violate international law to enact the so called remain in mexico policy this has forced asylum seekers to stay on shantytown tents and makeshift facilities on the mexican side of the border while their cases process in us courts deportations from mexico to central america have tripled under amlo he has deported 80 000 workers back to their home countries humanitarian visas have plummeted from 11 000 in january to 1 500 in march and almost zero since after the trump administration s threat of imposing a five percent tariff on mexican goods amlo has stated that he wants to be a friend of president trump and pledged cooperation this can only mean agreeing to carry out ever more ruthless attacks on mostly central american women and children to please trump s fascistic base if in jacobin s fantasy being a progressive means attacking immigrants then the magazine s claim that amlo is a consummate master of mass organizing also translates to repressing the class struggle in the service of capitalist property relations and us imperialism amlo s public comments on the massive wildcat strikes which swept through the northern border city of matamoros earlier this year urged workers to consider the companies situation and find balance amlo s administration actively intervened to shut down the strikes from declaring them illegal in federal courts to dispatching troops to assault workers on the picket line amlo similarly denounced striking teachers in mexico s impoverished south as right wing and demanded they go back to work and accept his cuts to education the resurgence of the class struggle takes place under conditions of historic levels of social inequality a recent united nations report revealed that mexican society features development indices of switzerland in the richest areas of the country and burundi in the most destitute under these urgent conditions what has amlo s progressive agenda offered the working class of the two examples cited by the article a railway train in the yucatan peninsula is in fact deeply opposed by the local indigenous population for causing deforestation to the region s second largest rainforest ecosystem outside of the amazon amlo s self described austerity budgets are so ruthless that they have even won the praise of the international monetary fund imf which specializes in giving out loans in exchange for massive cuts in social programs and privatizations on may 29 imf chief christine legarde spoke before members of the mexican congress and praised amlo s prudent fiscal policy that would ensure that inflation stays low the message is clear there will be no increases in social spending or significant moves to increase wages jacobin does make one true statement regarding the character of the amlo administration in the article the magazine is compelled to admit that the mexican government is subordinated to the global economy and the whims of domestic and foreign finance capital democracy cannot be allowed in mexico if the result is a government that bucks international economic nostrums however mildly writes jacobin and if it persists in attempting to do so mechanisms such as free trade agreements and financial markets must be activated to slap down any of that supreme self confidence it dares to have if this statement is true why support amlo and his nationalist program ultimately the subservience of the mexican economy to wall street is precisely why amlo will always be a puppet of the dominant economic powers in washington in the era of globalization where plants and investments can move to any corner of the world the framework for a national reformist program has been completely undermined this is especially true in a historically oppressed country such as mexico the entire experience of the 20th century attests to the fact that whatever their tactical differences the ruling elite will make accommodations between themselves and the imperialist powers many times over to guarantee their own interests rather than to risk mobilizing the working class the article itself admits that amlo has not called for a single mobilization since taking office so much for amlo the consummate master of mass organizing jacobin and the dsa support a politician that opposes the class struggle and seeks to strike a deal with trump at the expense of defenseless immigrant workers from areas devastated by over a century of exploitation by us imperialism real socialists seek to mobilize the working class and fight for its political independence from all sections of the ruling class on the basis of the fight for the unity of the working classes of the us mexico and central america as the wsws recently wrote jacobin does not speak for the working class but for liberal investors well paid tenured academics and other layers of the upper middle class affluencia who sincerely believe that some of the money sloshing around at the apex of capitalist society should be distributed more equitably among those who fall within the 90 to 99 percent income bracket in contrast socialists call for the establishment of the united socialist states of the americas

by patrick watson the logic of donald trump s multi front trade war if there is any is increasingly obscure the tangled mix of policies isn t accomplishing its stated goals and seems unlikely to ever do so meanwhile it hurts the americans it should supposedly help regardless it s happening and it has consequences none of them good the president s latest move to impose escalating tariffs on imports from mexico is the trade equivalent of going nuclear judging by his tweets trump thinks it will solve multiple problems trade drugs immigration and crime that s doubtful at best and as with real nuclear weapons the blast wave isn t going to discriminate it will hit everyone if you think the trade war hasn t affected you yet brace yourself you re about to feel it tariffs will raise prices a tariff is a form of sales tax on imported goods the importer has to give the government cash then it recovers it by charging more accepting lower profit margins or some combination of both so far president trump s tariffs are showing up as higher inflation it s not obvious in the broad inflation measures like the consumer price index because only a few goods have been affected but in those segments the impact is clear goldman sachs recently compared price changes in nine tariff impacted cpi categories vs those that weren t since the first tariffs in 2018 an index of those categories rose more than 3 meanwhile all the other core goods categories showed a slight decline this impact is about to spread the president is raising tariffs on almost all chinese goods and is threatening the same for mexico again we won t necessarily see this in retail prices right away but if we don t it will be only because merchants have stockpiled inventory or decided to absorb the cost out of their profits if it s the latter it s still not good companies with shrinking profit margins usually try to recover them somehow like laying off workers or postponing expansion plans still consumers will certainly notice if the latest tariff increases persist more than a few months top retailers depend on chinese and mexican goods those prices will probably rise this might actually stimulate some activity as people try to avoid tariffs or find substitute goods but mostly we will see it as higher prices and lower disposable incomes but that will only be the beginning trump s plan won t work out remember when politicians actually worried about government debt i know it s been awhile we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us we used to think high debt would cause inflation that hasn t happened for reasons john mauldin explained recently in why debt won t spark inflation essentially debt fueled fiscal stimulus fades quickly to be replaced by weaker business conditions demand falls enough to keep consumer prices and interest rates from rising much if at all tariffs are similar in some ways president trump at least thinks he can make companies move production to the us and hire american workers so stimulating growth that may happen a little bit here and there but it won t be much the business leaders who make those decisions know full well that trump s unilateral tariffs may disappear when he leaves office or maybe sooner if he changes his mind few businesses are going to make major capital investments based on a whim that could change tomorrow so initially we will just get the higher prices then it will be too late in the near future us manufacturers will reduce output because the imported parts on which they depend are too expensive and no alternate sources exist in the us laid off manufacturing workers will tighten their belts and reduce spending hitting the retail sector and possibly making some stores close those workers will lose their jobs too then the same will happen in the farm states as mexico and china shift their once large grain and meat purchases elsewhere by that point president trump may see the light and change his mind but the damage will be done business leaders will have seen what can happen their willingness to take risks and invest in new capacity will be lower then we may see some highly leveraged companies default on loans that never should have been made in the first place lenders will tighten standards and starve even viable companies of financing the fed may try to counteract this with rate cuts or qe but if we ve learned anything the last decade it s that monetary policy no longer has the same effects it used to all this adds up to one thing recession the last straw now we are overdue for recession even without tariffs this historically weak growth cycle has to end eventually if tariffs don t trigger it something else will but tariffs could easily be the last straw this trade war could make the recession happen sooner last longer and cause more pain than it otherwise would what aggravates me most are the people saying we have to accept some pain in order to fix the problems with china first of all there is zero reason to think tariffs will solve the problems so we ll get more pain but little or no gain second those who so want other americans to suffer tend to be wealthy powerful people they won t lose their jobs they have great health insurance and don t have to worry about foreclosure and bill collectors those who actually are suffering will notice this next recession could easily become more than a recession people in pain do radical things and those who caused that pain probably won t like where it leads
economics economist financial times and nigeria one would imagine that business papers like economic success stories apparently not instead they feast and thrive on negatives financial times for instance is worried about a government policy that is enabling boom in rice production in nigeria and the economist is panicky about toothpick manufacturers springing up following tariffs that protect local manufacturers to get off the ground and compete globally both papers only see negatives specifically economist dwells on out of date statistics deliberately it turns away from the positives as it will complicate already tailored narratives some foreign correspondents keep the storyline simple africa is home for all bad things poverty disease and crime and unremitting bleakness lives on the continent and success is the aberration since only negative reports on africa make it to the international media a backward picture of a nation is painted succinctly and efforts at growth in different ramifications both investment and diplomacy are ignored from the content of these stories readers must be baffled that nigerians know toothpicks let alone be able to manufacture them the fact remains that with squeeze in media budgets there are not enough knowledgeable foreign correspondents based on the continent to report accurate news and uphold journalistic standards and the parachuting style clearly defies ethics and quality to cut cost many media houses rely on the expedience of technology the highly revered and sacrosanct fact checking skill of journalism slips as a result anyone with a laptop is trusted as credible source cogent arguments no longer have a place instead we have jumbled and emotive criticisms for instance the financial times declares proudly that president buhari failed to spur rice growing whilst stating that production was at record levels up 60 per cent in 2018 from what we had in 2013 the economist talks about overdependence on oil yet criticises policies such as subsidies or financial incentives that allow local businesses to compete and diversify the economy it frowns at power shortfalls but turns around to attack alhaji aliko dangote the man building the world s largest oil refinery and improving power infrastructure in nigeria fundamentally the foreign correspondents fail to appreciate context understandably if they have to cover a large patch with shoe string budgets but never the less it is impermissible as facts must remain sacred the economist states that the economy was sputtering when president buhari s first term began in 2015 and still concluded he made a bad situation worse sputtering sounds euphemistic the reality is that the economy was on its knees the overdependence on oil paired with impending global commodity crash made the entry into recession at the beginning of the term inevitable now however the first quarter growth of 2019 has been the strongest the international monetary fund imf recently said analysts and onlookers must recognise how deep the shock was to the economy as a famous american business magnate observed only when the tide goes out do you discover who s been swimming naked indeed nigeria had been awash in oil dollars over 100 a barrel yet previous governments failed to add muscle to the economy since the recession struck crude oil went below 40 per barrel the government has taken measures to redress weaknesses in our economy the imf goes on to praise the strong diversification in the economy and welcome the focus on public investment for instance the government has spent record figures on infrastructure in the past two years and capital expenditure is now around 30 per cent of the budget rather than inadequate 10 per cent in 2015 related posts experience the ultimate celebration xiaomi fan festival promotion there has also been a drive to self sufficiency where possible it makes no sense for nigeria to import rice yet foreign shipments were dumped to maintain dependency farmers needed help strategic tariffs were applied to allow for initial competition whilst the central bank of nigeria financial initiatives allowed growers to access capital for fertilizer and equipment over the past three years production has risen year on year nigeria as of 2018 is africa s largest producer of rice self sufficiency has almost been attained from reading some foreign articles you would be surprised to find these success stories mentioned amazed that anyone would cheer the decision on tariffs to ward off desolation and the failure to see or present any achievement perpetuates stereotypes that serve as disincentives to foreign direct investment and partnership granted there are challenges in nigeria the country is a large and diverse nation with structural challenges that have been passed down through decades but foreign reports ignore the complexity and instead offer platitudes as solutions this diminishes the difficulties facing those in governance they must merely stamp out corruption or improve governance common advice amongst those quick to criticise but barren in tangible and measurable solutions similarly we are told to harness the vim of nigerians which is true but this seems obvious as to even need mentioning it is to be sure how you do that we in governance have no illusion about this vim is harnessed when a nation has decent infrastructure that connects the economy and thousands of miles of road have been constructed as well as the expansion and upgrading of colonial era railway network when children have good education we are currently ensuring 9 million free school meals daily across the nation and it has boosted enrolment and attendance and when business reforms create enabling environment already nigeria has gone

new york reuters u s bond fund managers are betting that the steep gains in treasuries over the last month are here to stay yields on the benchmark 10 year treasury rate have dropped to near 2 10 after rising as high as 2 55 as recently as may 2 as fears of escalating trade wars and slowing global economic growth have spooked equity markets and sent investors to the safety of bonds bonds yields fall as security prices rise leaving investors with capital appreciation gains but instead of seeing the recent rally as just a fear trade fund managers from firms including blackrock inc wells fargo asset management and sierra investment management say they are still buying treasuries in anticipation of additional interest rate cuts this year by the federal reserve to try to revive inflation amid a slowing economy the near 16 trillion sector produced a total return of 2 35 in may its strongest monthly showing since august 2011 according to an index compiled by bloomberg and barclays long dated treasuries generated a stellar 6 7 return their juiciest performance since january 2015 we haven t gotten the inflation engine going and i don t think we will said margie patel a senior portfolio manager at wells fargo asset management it s a horrible outcome for fixed income investors who have been spoiled for 30 years and now they re facing a complete yield drought that will probably get worse she said adding that a fall in the yield of the 10 year treasury to 1 5 over the next year would not be out of the question the core consumer price index increased at an annual rate of 1 6 in april well below the fed s target rate of 2 fed chairman jerome powell said on tuesday that the central bank is watching the fallout from the ongoing trade war between the u s and china and will react as appropriate bob miller a portfolio manager and head of u s multi sector fixed income at blackrock said he expects the fed to cut interest rates by 50 basis points by the end of this year because of slowing global economic growth the challenge is that the rest of the world is doing worse than expectations from six months ago with europe being particularly soggy over the last year with the rest of the world proving disappointing and u s growth already decelerating i think you will see the fed respond he said as a result miller said he still sees value in the benchmark 10 year treasury as well as intermediate notes that mature in three to seven years if the fed does cut rates that could lead to opportunities in higher quality emerging market debt in countries with good structural fundamentals he said a prolonged rally in bonds could mean the end of the bull market in equities which had sent the benchmark s p 500 index up as much as 16 for the year to date in april and continued to push treasury yields lower the growth backdrop is deteriorating the u s economy was expected to slow but the risk is that it will slow more than previously expected and eat into corporate earnings miller said after its strong start for the year the s p 500 is down nearly 4 since the start of may as the united states and china remain at an impasse over trade and tariffs further declines in the u s equity market could bring more waves of buyers into the bond market further pushing yields lower said terri spath chief investment officer at sierra investment management there s a perception with u s stocks that they can go quickly from flawless to hopeless and since may 1 it s been more hopeless for stocks she said spath said she is continuing to put assets into long term treasury bonds and has zero of her portfolio in cash after having as much as 80 percent in cash during the steep selloffs in both the equity and fixed income markets in november i m not hiding under my desk yet because of a fear of a recession she said but i think there s room for yields to go even lower reporting by david randall editing by jennifer ablan and leslie adler by david randall

us job growth slowed sharply in may and wages rose less than expected raising fears that a loss of momentum in economic activity could be spreading to the labour market which could put pressure on the federal reserve to cut interest rates this year the broad cool off in hiring reported by the labor department on friday was before a recent escalation in trade tensions between the united states and two of its major trading partners china and mexico analysts have warned the trade fights could undermine the economy which will celebrate 10 years of expansion next month the longest on record adding a sting to the closely watched employment report far fewer jobs were created in march and april than previously reported indicating that hiring had shifted into a lower gear the labour market thus far has been largely resilient to the trade war with china today s report makes a cut more likely and supports our view that the trade tensions will ultimately slow growth enough for the fed to respond in september and december with cuts said joseph song an economist at bank of america merrill lynch in new york nonfarm payrolls increased by 75 000 jobs last month the government said it was the second time this year that job gains dropped below 100 000 economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 185 000 jobs last month job growth in march and april was revised down by 75 000 president donald trump in early may slapped additional tariffs of up to 25 per cent on us 200 billion of chinese goods which prompted retaliation by beijing last week mr trump said he would impose a tariff on all goods from mexico to force authorities in that country to stop immigrants from central america from crossing the border into the united states talks to prevent the duties from kicking in at 5 per cent on june 10 continue fed chairman jerome powell said on tuesday the us central bank was closely monitoring the implications of the trade tensions on the economy and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion mr trump who has routinely tweeted about the strong labour market made no comment about may s weak hiring but defended duties on chinese goods white house economic adviser kevin hassett told fox business network that bad weather in the midwest was to blame and described the meager job gains as a little bit of a blip down economists however said there was nothing to suggest the weather was the culprit the weakness in job growth was broadly experienced across industry groups and not obviously driven by distortions such as weather or strikes said michael feroli an economist at jpmorgan in new york us house of representative speaker nancy pelosi a democrat said the employment report was a disturbing sign that the administration s disastrous special interest agenda is hollowing out our economy following the report financial markets priced in a rate cut as early as july and two more later this year economists however believe the fed will probably wait for more signs of labour market weakness and clarity on the trade issues before easing monetary policy fed officials are due to meet on june 18 19 fed officials are likely to remain cautious at the june meeting and keep all their options open said michael hanson head of global macro strategy at td securities in new york the dollar fell to a 2 1 2 month low against a basket of currencies while us treasury prices rose stocks on wall street were trading higher worker shortages last month s slowdown in job gains however probably understates the labour market s health as layoffs remain low employment gains over the last three months have averaged 151 000 above the roughly 100 000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working age population in the four months since the first hiccup in hiring appeared in february however monthly payrolls gains have averaged just 127 000 the slowest pace over a comparable stretch in nearly seven years some of the weakness in hiring could be because of worker shortages especially in the construction transportation and manufacturing sectors but the worker shortage argument is somewhat undercut by moderate wage growth average hourly earnings grew just 3 1 per cent year over year the slowest annual increase since september just three months earlier wages had been rising at their fastest rate in a decade but gains have moderated since the tepid employment report added to soft data on consumer spending business investment manufacturing and homes sales in suggesting the economy was losing momentum in the second quarter following a temporary boost from exports inventory accumulation and defense spending growth is cooling as the massive stimulus from last year s tax cuts and spending increases fades the atlanta fed is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 1 4 per cent annualised rate in the second quarter the economy grew at a 3 1 per cent pace in the first quarter the unemployment rate remained near a 50 year low of 3 6 per cent in may a broader measure of unemployment which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment dropped to 7 1 per cent last month the lowest since december 2000 hiring slowed across all sectors in may with the share of industries showing job gains during the month the smallest since july 2016 manufacturing payrolls increased by 3 000 last month after gaining 5 000 positions in april the sector is struggling with an inventory overhang that has resulted in businesses placing fewer orders at factories employers in the construction sector hired 4 000 workers in may after adding 30 000 jobs to payrolls in april professional and business services employment rose by 33 000

g20 finance ministers and central bank governors pose for a family photo in fukuoka japan on saturday agence france presse the group of 20 finance ministers agreed on saturday to compile common rules to close loopholes used by global tech giants such as facebook to reduce their corporate taxes a copy of the bloc s draft communique obtained by reuters showed facebook google amazon and other large technology firms face criticism for cutting their tax bills by booking profits in low tax countries regardless of the location of the end customer such practices are seen by many as unfair the new rules would mean higher tax burdens for large multinational firms but would also make it harder for countries like ireland to attract foreign direct investment with the promise of ultra low corporate tax rates we welcome the recent progress on addressing the tax challenges arising from digitization and endorse the ambitious programme that consists of a two pillar approach the draft communique said we will redouble our efforts for a consensus based solution with a final report by 2020 britain and france have been among the most vocal proponents of proposals to tax big tech companies that focus on making it more difficult to shift profits to low tax jurisdictions and to introduce a minimum corporate tax this has put the two countries at loggerheads with the united states which has expressed concern that us internet companies are being unfairly targeted in a broad push to update the global corporate tax code the united states has significant concerns with the two corporate taxes proposed by france and the uk us treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on saturday at a two day meeting of g20 finance ministers in the japanese city of fukuoka it sounds like we have a strong consensus about the goals of tax reform mnuchin later said so now we need to just take the consensus across here and deal with technicalities of how we turn this into an agreement mnuchin spoke at a panel on global taxation at the g20 after the french and british finance ministers voiced sympathy with his concerns that new tax rules do not discriminate against particular firms big internet companies say they follow tax rules but have paid little tax in europe typically by channelling sales via countries such as ireland and luxembourg which have light touch tax regimes the g20s debate on changes to the tax code focus on two pillars that could be a double whammy for some companies the first pillar is dividing up the rights to tax a company where its goods or services are sold even if it does not have a physical presence in that country if companies are still able to find a way to book profits in low tax or offshore havens countries could then apply a global minimum tax rate to be agreed under the second pillar the path to a final agreement is still fraught with difficulty because of disagreement on a common definition of a digital business and on how to distribute tax authority among different countries there are differences between the united states and united kingdom over pillar one as for pillar two there are also differences in views within the group of 7 said a senior japanese finance ministry official present at the g20 the g7 likely will not issue any communique at a meeting of the world s leading economic powers next month according to the official still several finance ministers at the g20 said on saturday they needed to act quickly to correct unfair corporate tax codes or risk being punished by voters we cannot explain to a population that they should pay their taxes when certain companies do not because they shift their profits to low tax jurisdictions french finance minister bruno le maire said during the panel discussion the us government has voiced concern in the past that the european campaign for a digital tax unfairly targets us tech giants after listening to presentations by le maire and british finance minister philip hammond mnuchin said on saturday g20 countries should issue marching orders to their respective finance ministries to negotiate the technical aspects of a deal earlier this year countries and territories agreed a roadmap aimed at overhauling international tax rules that have been overtaken by the development of digital commerce it would be either illegal or useless for italy to issue bonds to pay its suppliers as these notes would break european currency rules or add to the country s massive government debt the italian finance minister said on saturday giuseppe tria was seeking to shoot down the notion floated by the ruling league party and backed by the whole parliament through a non binding motion that the italian state could pay its sizeable arrears with suppliers via small denomination bearer bonds he said these so called mini bots would either constitute new public debt which would make italy s public finances look even worse or introduce a parallel currency which is forbidden by european union treaties regulating the euro the economy ministry has already given a negative opinion tria told reuters and italian news agency ansa in an interview on the sidelines of a g20 meeting in fukuoka japan

us secretary of treasury steven mnuchin r delivers a speech during the g20 ministerial symposium on international taxation in the g20 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting in fukuoka on june 8 2019 reuters finance ministers and central bank governors meeting in japan this weekend will try to make headway on longstanding issues such as how much global giants like facebook and amazon should pay in taxes they re likely to end up focusing a large share of their attention however on how to keep global growth on track when the world s two biggest economies are entrenched in an escalating trade war us treasury secretary steven mnuchin who has headed trade talks with beijing along with us trade representative robert lighthizer was due to meet with yi gang governor of china s central bank on the sidelines of the g 20 s annual financial gathering in fukuoka in southern japan advertisement but it was unclear if their meeting a possible prelude to talks at the g 20 summit later this month between president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping might lead to a restart of those talks after weeks of stalemate as the trump administration prepares to expand retaliatory tariff hikes of up to 25 to another 300 billion of chinese products beijing has sought to highlight china s capacity to endure and overcome hardship yi told bloomberg television in an interview broadcast friday that he expected the meeting with mnuchin to be difficult but he said china s central bank the people s bank of china had plenty of room to maneuver to help keep the economy growing despite the pounding the country s export manufacturers are taking as the toll from higher tariffs mounts speaking thursday in france trump said he plans to make a decision about ramping up tariffs on china after speaking with xi at the summit in osaka at the month s end advertisement i will make that decision i would say over the next two weeks _ probably right after the g 20 he said the trump administration began slapping tariffs on imports of chinese goods nearly a year ago accusing china of resorting to predatory tactics to give chinese companies an edge in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence robotics and electric vehicles these tactics the u s contends include hacking into u s companies computers to steal trade secrets forcing foreign companies to hand over sensitive technology in exchange for access to the chinese market and unfairly subsidizing chinese tech firms trump has also complained repeatedly about america s huge trade deficit with china _ a record 379 billion last year _ which he blames on weak and naive negotiating by previous u s administrations the united states now is imposing 25 taxes on 250 billion in chinese goods beijing has counterpunched by targeting 110 billion worth of american products focusing on farm goods such as soybeans in a deliberate effort to inflict pain on trump supporters in the u s heartland advertisement unease over trade tensions and their potential impact on other economies has deepened since trump announced he would impose a 5 tax on mexican products starting monday _ a tax that would reach 25 by oct 1 if the mexican government fails to stop the flow of central american migrants into the united states trump said friday in a tweet that there was a good chance to make a deal with mexico if so they will begin purchasing farm agricultural products at very high levels starting immediately if we are unable to make the deal mexico will begin paying tariffs at the 5 level on monday while the tariffs have taken a minor toll on the u s economy the uncertainty and slowing demand are rippling across the globe earlier this week the world bank downgraded its forecast for the global

the shock federal election result has left re energy rent seekers reeling what was meant to be a green labor landslide with the promise that subsidies to wind and solar would double and be extended until kingdom come returned not only the liberal national coalition to power but left the energy minister angus taylor firmly in place if australia has any hope of restoring reliable and affordable power to all comers it s down to taylor stt hears that taylor s retailer reliability obligation ro which kicks into operation on 1 july has wind and large scale solar industries up in arms the ro was at the heart of the original national energy guarantee as explained here pm s reliable power play spells disaster for unreliable intermittent wind power in short the ro means that for every mw a retailer has promised to sell its customers it will need to have a contract to purchase a mw of dispatchable power to meet that promise a failure to do so will result in very substantial financial penalties for the retailer courtesy of the ro all of a sudden chaotically intermittent wind and solar have become worth a whole lot less if not worthless hence the sense of fear and loathing amongst those invested in wind and solar the neg put together by taylor was however quickly hijacked by then pm malcolm turnbull in cahoots with labor no doubt at the direction of his son alex born lucky turnbull a lad who s directed millions of his own and other people s money into rent seeking operations like infigen born lucky stars align perfectly for pm s son with mammoth bet on wind power outfit infigen turnbull s neg would have increased the effective renewable energy target to around 45 and included a legislated carbon dioxide gas emissions target it was turnbull s dogged pursuit of what was in reality green labor policy that resulted in knives being drawn in the liberal party room with turnbull s embittered corpse replaced by scott morrison turnbull trounced re obsessed pm ditched over ludicrous plan to double up on subsidised wind solar notwithstanding the flat out rejection of that very same policy by australia s truculent turds the equivalent of america s deplorables there are still a few in the liberal party acting as if the green labor alliance had actually taken power in canberra one of them is nsw energy minister matt kean who like his predecessor in title don harwin harbours the delusional belief that we re well on the way to an all wind and sun powered future harwin once made the ludicrous suggestion that wind and solar are cheaper coal fired power delusional nsw energy minister claims wind solar more reliable than coal gas well it seems that matt kean is no brighter liberals clash as nsw seeks to revive neg the australian perry williams 7 june 2019 the nsw government has defied canberra by demanding the resurrection of malcolm turnbull s dumped national energy guarantee as part of a policy revamp that also calls for coal plant extensions and potential market interventions to ensure stable power for the state after liddell shuts in 2022 just a week after reappointed energy minister angus taylor ruled out reviving the neg recently installed nsw energy minister matt kean fired a shot at the coalition by calling for an effective nationwide policy we need a national framework that properly integrates climate and energy policy mr kean will say in a sydney speech today that s why the nsw government still supports the national energy guarantee and will continue to support a national mechanism that integrates climate and energy policy which provides business with the freedom to innovate federal labor took the neg to the election as part of its policy platform and it enjoyed broad support among big business as a way of ending a decade of climate wars however scott morrison says the australian people rejected labor s more ambitious climate ambitions instead the coalition will forge ahead with elements of the policy including the retailer reliability obligation to ensure enough generation to meet power users needs mr kean part of the moderate nsw liberal left faction says the state has gained little from political volatility on both energy and climate since the howard government successive state and federal governments have been acting and reacting on climate and energy mr kean will tell a committee for economic development of australia event this political instability has increased uncertainty exacerbated risk stalled investment and contributed to the problem rather than helped to solve it the climate wars have not delivered for the people of nsw i know there are some on both the left and the right who want to continue this fight but it is time for a new approach to climate and energy policy the state s energy reset will focus on keeping the lights on cutting power bills and taking decisive and responsible action on climate change the biggest immediate challenge is ensuring the power grid stays affordable and reliable while also lowering emissions with agl energy s 1680mw liddell coal plant due to shut in 2022 mr kean argues the state needs to take a pragmatic approach to its generation mix it will encourage the extension or upgrades of other coal facilities to ensure the state avoids a repeat of the sudden exit of victoria s hazelwood plant in 2017 which caused a supply shortage and high prices in the national electricity market currently up to 80 per cent of nsw s electricity is produced by coal fired power during this transition private operators may need to upgrade coal fired power plants to ensure they can supply their customers and provide more time for firmed renewable generation to be built mr kean says coal mines in nsw will continue to supply power stations at home and overseas this does not mean that we have given up on taking action on climate change rather it reflects that our economy and economies overseas need to smooth the transition to low emissions electricity generation nsw will also consider a new intervention mechanism should it be faced with a lack of supply the electricity system is too big to fail put simply it is unacceptable for the state to be left with insufficient capacity to address peak demand we need to transition our generation not our expectations accordingly if the need arises the nsw government will act our strong preference is that we never have to we strongly prefer to create sufficient certainty so that governments don t have to step in as the provider of last resort new generation sources to replace liddell s capacity may also be fast tracked to ensure the state is not left empty handed liddell s capacity will be replaced by a combination of increased interconnection to other states and increased generation in nsw we are working closely with industry and will expedite these investments to ensure they are delivered on time mr kean says while noting a new coal station even if economic would take seven years to build and not be ready in time for liddell s closure in a potential nod to santos s long delayed narrabri project awaiting planning approval the government will also work to improve its native supplies given it currently relies on other states for 95 per cent of its gas needs while approval processes need to take their course we also support more gas being made available to the state this may be through import terminals pipelines or local sources of supply but whatever the case we need to ensure that the state has a secure supply of gas the australian matt kean is on the wrong side of history if he actually believes that there really is a transition underway and he must have been asleep over the last decade as his neighbours in south australia headed off on their inevitable transition with its labor government setting its very own 50 ret and meeting it the results have been an economic debacle sa pays the world s highest power prices which will inevitably jump again come 1 july sa is also renowned as an international laughingstock after a series of mass load shedding events and australia s only statewide blackout all due to the chaotic delivery of wind and solar some model stt suspects that matt kean is just another dupe for the likes of alex turnbull simon holmes a court and mike cannon brookes a group of spoiled brat troughers keen to keep the subsidy gravy train rolling to their very substantial benefit meanwhile back on earth moves are afoot to build the kind of generating capacity that people like matt kean and his cronies believe to be

confident of raising 2 billion in finance before the next state election the ambitious timeline to reach financial close will test the commitment of queensland premier annastacia palaszczuk to the construction of a new coal fired power station after she described the federal election result as a wake up call for labor over lengthy delays to the adani coalmine representatives from shine energy including chief executive ashley dodd met with senior officials from the energy department in brisbane yesterday to discuss the 10 million promised by scott morrison before the election for a bankable

provide new economic opportunities for thousands of traditional landowners we want to reach financial close by october next year that s our aim and we will push really hard to get it there he told the weekend australian liddell is shutting in 2022 and we want to have the first unit commissioned by 2022 it s now moving forward so we can actually get it done the federal government has delivered on its promise to the australian people the new ultra supercritical coal plant is planned for collinsville in the electorate of capricornia held by lnp mp michelle landry shine energy says the project would create 2000 jobs in the construction phase and 600 permanent jobs in operation and maintenance mr dodd said it was agreed at yesterday s meeting that the company would provide high level

detail on equity and debt contracts for the asset as well as the engineering procurement and construction contracts for the building of the new plant in addition shine energy will provide further details about its planned power purchasing agreement contracts and a connection application which is needed to link the power generation asset to the national electricity market resources minister matt canavan yesterday said it was great to see progress on large scale energy investment more supply of electricity will help us lower power prices and that will keep manufacturing industries alive senator canavan said we said before the election we will back new investments in power including in coal and that s why we are getting on with the job what i want to see from the labor party is not just words describing their love for coal but also actions as well if the labor party support our coal industry why wouldn t they support the use of some of that coal to drive economic development for indigenous australians and for north queensland ms landry said she was very excited about the new power station and said the meeting was full of energy and positivity i think this is going to be fantastic for collinsville they ve gone through some hard times and this is the light at the end of the tunnel for them she said the australian
menafn jordan times by ngozi okonjo iweala and brahima coulibaly washington dc the current backlash against globalisation most notably from working class citizens in advanced economies who are worried about stagnant wages and insecure jobs highlights how the benefits of global economic integration were oversold and its costs undercounted but the effects of globalisation on africa and its citizens have received far less attention even though the continent is projected to account for over 40 per cent of the world s population by the end of this century making globalisation more inclusive will require policies that tackle inequality within advanced economies and boost convergence in living standards between africa and high income countries african policymakers with support from external partners can play their part by accelerating regional integration bridging gaps in labour skills and digital infrastructure and creating a mechanism to own and regulate africa s digital data ever since the first industrial revolution led to a surge in international trade africa has remained largely on the sidelines of the global economy the main beneficiaries of early globalisation were today s advanced economies where industrial technologies emerged this in turn led to the great divergence in income levels between the global north and south more recently the advent of new information and communications technology in the 1990s dramatically lowered the costs of distance and ushered in another wave of globalisation characterised by the emergence of complex global value chains gvcs these gvcs contributed to the great convergence of recent decades by boosting industrial output in countries such as china india indonesia poland south korea taiwan and singapore enabling them to narrow the gap with advanced economies yet african countries have remained excluded from this process the continent s share of global merchandise trade has stagnated at around 3 per cent similar to its share of world manufacturing output to be sure globalisation has brought benefits to africa rising incomes elsewhere in the world have increased demand for african commodities and natural resources boosting national economies globalisation has also supported knowledge transfer enabling african countries to improve living standards by leapfrogging to new technologies but myriad challenges have far outweighed such benefits for one thing globalisation has contributed to premature deindustrialisation because advanced economies can now produce goods more cheaply african countries have found it difficult to develop local industries that create jobs moreover some multinational corporations operating in the region are dodging taxes through sophisticated and legal accounting mechanisms such as profit shifting depriving governments of much needed resources for economic development globalisation is also contributing to climate change which has a disproportionate effect on africa despite the continent s limited contribution to the problem cyclones idai and kenneth which recently devastated malawi mozambique and zimbabwe are a tragic example of what is to come unsurprisingly therefore the economic disparity between africa and richer countries has widened in recent decades with the ratio of african incomes to those in advanced economies falling from 12 per cent in the early 1980s to 8 per cent today in order to reverse this trend and enable africa to benefit more from globalisation the region s policymakers should accelerate their efforts in three areas first governments should promote further regional integration to make africa economically stronger and more effective at advancing its agenda internationally progress so far is very encouraging the african continental free trade agreement afcfta recently obtained the minimum 22 ratifications needed to enter into force thus creating a single african market for goods and services the afcfta along with the single african air transport market and the protocol on free movement of persons will help to unlock the region s tremendous economic potential second africa must improve its digital infrastructure and technology related skills to avoid being further marginalised at present the cost of internet access in africa is the highest in the world and internet penetration is only 37 per cent significantly below the world average of 57 per cent moreover the low cost low skill labour on which africa has traditionally relied is becoming less of a competitive advantage given the advent of the fourth industrial revolution and the higher production standards and infrastructure requirements of gvcs education and training programmes should therefore focus more on developing digital knowhow as well as on soft skills such as critical thinking and cognitive and socio behavioural capabilities third africa must create a system for owning and regulating its digital data in the modern era capital has displaced land as the most important asset and determinant of wealth but in the digital economy data will be key as demonstrated by the scramble among global technology firms such as facebook google and tencent to control it and as kai fu lee argues in his book ai superpowers the abundance of data generated by china s large population is giving the country an advantage over the united states in the field of artificial intelligence africa s population boom means the continent will also generate large amounts of data particularly as digitisation makes inroads e commerce platforms spread the middle class expands and consumer spending increases this new data driven wealth will accrue to those who actively harvest own and regulate such information leaving latecomers to play catch up africa s potential may be huge but it faces formidable challenges by 2030 the continent will be home to almost 90 per cent of the world s poorest people unless globalisation works better for africa than it has in the past its promise of shared prosperity will remain unfulfilled ngozi okonjo iweala a former finance minister of nigeria is chair of gavi the vaccine alliance and a co chair of the global commission on

from countries just beginning to modernize to the richest members of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the world is awash with opportunities for development while central bankers have control over an economy s monetary levels and politicians control fiscal affairs these two groups often cannot jumpstart growth without outside help enter foreign direct investments fdi in simple terms they are inflows or outflows of capital from one country to another with common examples including companies building factories abroad or investing in the development of an oil field global trends impacting fdi since march 2020 the covid 19 pandemic has overhauled the way that millions of people and business go about their days it is an extreme understatement to say that the pandemic has severely hampered the flows of fdi in fact fdi inflows to developed and transition economies fell by 58 percent in 2020 among the developed markets europe was particularly hard hit with fdi inflows falling by 80 prior to the pandemic many nations were already shifting toward protectionist type policies and were heightening scrutiny around incoming foreign investment since the pandemic these themes seem to have been extrapolated due to additional factors such as lockdowns bottlenecks to global supply chains and armed conflict as of june 2022 there doesn t yet seem to be a catalyst on the horizon to reverse these negative fdi trends and only time will tell when and how these trends will change countries with the most fdi each year more than 1 trillion in fdi flows into countries around the world but the distribution is far from equal according to the un conference on trade and development unctad the countries with the greatest share of fdi to gdp in 2020 were cayman islands hungary luxembourg congo republic hong kong sar china malta singapore mozambique guyana seychelles economies in the caribbean were hard hit by the pandemic and the stoppage of international tourism often reports of fdi exclude financial centers of the caribbean because inflows from the financial sector can skew the overall picture of fdi often with regards to fdi investors are often most focused on cross border m a activity and greenfield projects rather than strictly on capital flow with this in mind one highlight on the list in 2020 was hungary which has a population of 9 8 million according to the bureau of economic and business affairs hungary s central location and high quality infrastructure have made it an attractive destination for fdi according to the 2020 investment climate statements hungary to promote investment the government of hungary lowered the corporate tax rate to 9 percent in 2017 and the labor tax to 15 5 percent in july 2020 which is among the lowest in the european union fdi in hungary is a good example of how factors such as government economic policy and underlying market fundamentals combine to impact the overall level of foreign investment economies by total fdi viewing fdi as a percentage of gdp does not indicate the size of the economy being invested in some of the economies listed above are much larger smaller than others in terms of gdp alone and when you rank economies by total fdi dollars received the picture changes almost completely china 253 1 billion united states 211 3 billion hungary 171 4 billion germany 142 8 billion hong kong china 117 5 billion singapore 74 8 billion india 64 4 billion luxembourg 62 1 billion japan 61 5 billion british virgin islands 39 6 billion these 10 countries together received the bulk of global fdi with the united states and china accounting for approximately one third of the total while several of these countries do have natural resources that could entice foreign investment the real draw is the size of their populations a large population means a lot of consumers and a multinational company generally wants to be near its consumers proximity allows a company to reduce the cost of shipping goods and allows it to keep a close eye on shifting consumer tastes sitting in an office halfway across the world could cause a company to lose out trouble with politics foreign investment is often used as a political scapegoat for the world s ills and there are certainly times when it deserves a bad rap big companies can run roughshod over developing countries breeding corruption and removing a country s wealth rather than injecting it back into the domestic economy it is this overwhelming force that spawned the concept of a resource curse globalization which tends to go hand in hand with fdi is not the most popular or well liked economic concept even if it does benefit consumers in the end officials under pressure to fix the economy can earn brownie points by pointing a finger at foreign companies bent on owning the country with buy domestic legislation and non tariff barriers to trade reducing the ability of outsiders to gain market access the positive side foreign direct investment isn t all bad however inflows are a sign that the outside world considers an economy a worthwhile place to park capital and are a signal that a country has made it fdi allows countries without the domestically grown know how to develop resources that it may not have been able to otherwise profits from the use of capital can be used to build infrastructure improve healthcare and education improve productivity and modernize industries the trick is to balance the desire to fill state coffers with the knowledge that those funds have to improve the lives of the greatest number of people in the long run nothing creates instability quite like kleptocracy the bottom line how can a country entice the rest of the world to hand over cash countries such as hungary discussed above can increase the inflow of fdi by creating a business climate that makes foreign investors feel as if their capital is safe low tax rates or other tax incentives protection of private property rights access to loans and funding and infrastructure that allows the fruits of capital investment to reach market are a few of the incentives that countries may offer

great relevance today once again china is shaking the world this time however it is not experiencing a great revolutionary convulsion like the peiping rebellion of the 1850s the may 4th movement the canton and shanghai communes of the late 1920s the establishment of the people s republic of china or the cultural revolution these events shook the capitalist world to its foundations and inspired revolutionary struggles of oppressed people all over the world the latest development while it is shaking up u s imperialism is of a very different type may in the long run be of decisive importance a surge of production it has become plain in the last few months that there has been a phenomenal surge of production in china capitalist accounts here tell us that china s economy is likely to expand at a rate of 13 percent this year after a similar growth rate in 1992 it is alarming the bourgeoisie here they express concern over the plague of inflation which of course would erode the economic gains but why would the bourgeoisie here worry about that the truth of the matter is they are far more worried that china has demonstrated its capacity to produce in great quantity and can compete to some extent with western capitalism in the production of certain goods if not services china s growth rate has come to the fore in the capitalist press just at a time when the clinton administration is to decide whether to allow chinese imports on the same basis as before or utilize a provision of the jackson vanik law that gives the president authority to ban them by imposing onerous restrictions new method shows much bigger economy the new york times disclosed on may 20 that a new calculation of the world economies catapults china into third place in world production exceeded only by the u s and japan it is of course a remarkable feat under the new method based on the purchasing power of a country s currency at home rather than its value on international exchanges china s gross domestic product in 1991 was calculated at 1 66 trillion as against only 370 billion using the old method why the sudden change in methodology was it to do china a favor under the new method if china needs loans from the imf or the g 7 imperialist nations the interest would be based on a different formula now that china is no longer categorized as one of the poorest countries it is not eligible for certain kinds of debt relief the imperialists are quite disturbed by china s ability to expand its production at such a fast rate different from gorbachev s reforms china s economic growth is based upon the introduction of capitalist reforms similar to those introduced in eastern europe and the former ussr this can scarcely be disputed the difference according to chinese sources is that the reforms are working and that the growth in production is the biggest boon to the chinese people since the revolution triumphed in 1949 however it is important to differentiate china s reforms from the way capitalist practices were introduced in the ussr it is now seven years since mikhail gorbachev began to experiment with market reforms the result has not been a socialist modernization of the industrial and agricultural apparatus but a dismantling of socialist projects in industry and in agriculture indeed it has resulted in a breakdown a vandalizing of the achievements of socialist construction in an effort to bring about a restoration of capitalism in china however as best as we can see from here there has been a rapid development of industry a tremendous surge in the construction of hundreds of industrial projects rather than the dismantling of existing socialist projects with a view to privatization as has been going on in the former ussr however china s industrial growth is being carried out openly and unabashedly on a capitalist basis and it is going forward at a very rapid rate even exceeding the objectives of china s economic planners production under capitalism except when it is interrupted by crisis natural disasters or war can and does rise to phenomenal heights exceeding all previous modes of production raising production is not a huge let alone formidable problem under capitalism the problem lies in the antagonism between private ownership and the social character of production since the bourgeois counter revolution however a rise in production has not been achieved in what was the ussr just the opposite this is because the objective of the reformers there is not to increase production but to privatize the existing means of production and there is tremendous opposition to that the difference must be kept in mind struggle over trade during the bush administration an opinion piece in the new york times by leslie gelb communicated a threat to china that it was vulnerable to having its coastal provinces detached from the rest of the country these are the areas where the free market special economic zones are located the threat was meant to force china to accommodate to the u s on matters regarding human rights a code name for allowing counter revolutionary activity however bush was opposed to tightening trade restrictions on china notwithstanding the uproar by the democratic party faction in congress clinton on the other hand attacked bush s stand on china during the election campaign and called for new restrictions on trade now clinton finds himself in the same position as bush he has changed his position and is opposed to giving so called human rights pre eminence over trade with china once again economics determines politics and not vice versa class character of china the growing influence of the capitalist market in china has occasioned economists and political leaders on both sides of the pacific to give consideration to a class definition of china s social structure and state for instance last year the congress of the communist party characterized china as a socialist market economy it is well known by all students of marxist economics that the two terms are incompatible with each other china has had a planned economy how well or poorly it has been doing is not the issue the fact is that it instituted a planned economy soon after the revolution s triumph in 1949 the kernel of a planned economy has persisted through all the struggles and turmoil since a capitalist market economy is not planned but is spontaneous unpredictable chaotic the capitalist class everywhere is lyrical about the freedom of the market about how it sets free prices and production but this should not be taken as literally true monopoly capitalism restricts capitalist trade and production a market economy by definition is generally understood to be the very opposite of a planned economy the two terms are incompatible with each other but that does not necessarily exclude the possibility of their coexistence within the framework of a national state for a period of time in fact such a situation was created in the years closely following the bolshevik revolution under far different circumstances than exist today in china the capitalist market was reintroduced for a time even as plans were laid for the building of a socialist economy gatt enters the debate the question of the class character of china s state and of the reforms has undoubtedly caused a great deal of debate in china nor is it of theoretical or political significance in china alone for instance the organization known as the general agreement on tariffs and trade is by no means an innocent bystander watching the debate in china gatt is an organization set up by the imperialists that includes 105 countries it says in so many words if you want to trade with any one of us you have to abide by certain rules that we set under gatt s rules devised some years ago china the ussr eastern europe cuba the dprk vietnam and a few other countries could not become members unless they agreed to certain restrictions such as free trade china is undoubtedly trying very hard to meet those restrictions and get into gatt an article in the wall street journal of march 3 entitled chinese entry into gatt is stalled by thorny socialist market economy explains that the officials of gatt servants of the seven imperialists have asked china to describe precisely what it means by socialist market economy part of the debate in china over this term is precisely over how to meet the restrictions of gatt thus the struggle over the class characterization of china s economy and state is not solely a debate among so called doctrinaire communists it reaches into the summits of the capitalist government as well agriculture since the communes if china is to be called a socialist country what about the class character of the agricultural system china has a vast population of peasants and a minority of workers in the early 1960s after collectivization the commune was established as the unit of agricultural production farm work was elevated to collective labor and private ownership of the land was abolished the dismantling of the communes in the 1980s signified that agriculture in the main returned to private ownership either because of crop failures natural disasters or the inability to sustain themselves on the farm peasants in china are now flooding into the cities in a manner similar to that in many third world countries this has made it possible to employ millions in industrial projects one may say that what is going on in china is a period of industrialization similar to that in england in the last century the millions who were dispossessed from the land made cheap labor in industry possible and profitable marx described the horrors of early industrial development including the employment of women and children for long hours in his illuminating chapter in capital on primitive accumulation a planned economy china s collectivized and nationalized property in industry has become weakened as a result of both the privatization of agriculture and the institution of capitalist reforms is china today a planned economy in the sense that the basic elements of production and consumption are planned and that the operations are pursuant a given plan the answer at the present time is no the introduction of bourgeois reforms inhibits full scale planning so that to a large extent it is becoming a commodity producing economy the larger the special economic zones the larger the capitalist reforms the more china becomes a commodity producing economy and not a planned socialist economy however china s history since the beginning of the 19th century has been full of convulsions as it has attempted to free itself from imperialist domination it has also fought to remain a centralized national state with a degree of autonomy for the provinces were each province to decide for itself how and what it would produce a planned economy for the state as a whole would be impossible immediately before and during the tienanmen square days china appeared to be in danger of disintegrating into warlordism this was overcome and the decentralizing process that threatened to emerge was eliminated that was a victory of socialism the question of how far the chinese government can go with the capitalist reforms will certainly be up for review notwithstanding a constitutional provision meant to make the reforms a permanent feature in chinese society one fact has certainly emerged the millions who left the rural areas for the great cities of china and were absorbed into the proletariat have given the chinese government and communist party the opportunity to strengthen the socialist character of the state the growth of the proletariat is the objective factor most needed for the building of socialism it s important that the process of production be carried out in the spirit of socialist construction the calculations of the bourgeoisie are that as a result of their widening influence in the special economic zones they will ultimately overwhelm the socialist sector in china they believe that the socialist sector lacking the material conditions necessary for its growth including skilled labor and specialists will be stillborn the alternative they say is massive material assistance from the imperialists and this will undo socialist construction for the moment the party seems to be united on going forward with the reforms because they are bringing results deemed indispensable at the present time without a doubt a generation of young people a new breed of tienanmen square elements is being accommodated politically to this situation but the inevitability of a capitalist recession especially if it stems from a worldwide capitalist crisis is bound to create a classic confrontation between the socialized and the bourgeois sectors the question is how significant is the proletarian revolutionary element what is their influence in the higher councils of the party even if they are tiny and weak now the objective basis for their revolutionary growth is assured as frederick engels explained in socialism utopian and scientific part of his book anti duhring the great philosophers of the 18th century enlightenment voltaire rousseau montesquieu saint simon reflected the disillusionment with the old order and tore to shreds feudal ideology with their brilliance and wit on the other hand socialism is the ideological offspring of the growth of the proletariat china had its own enlightenment period that undermined feudal ideology the period in which the proletariat comes forward with its own ideological approach has been more protracted given the necessity to fight imperialism on all fronts and a more obdurate and stultified feudal system nevertheless with all its ups and downs china is moving toward socialism the efforts of the imperialists to stop it by force and violence have failed over the decades and their efforts at economic strangulation will also surely fail the road to socialism in china like everywhere else in the world may be difficult but it is assured

andres oppenheimer miami herald six months after mexican president andre s manuel lo pez obrador s dec 1 inauguration there are reasons to be worried about mexico s future that go far beyond president trump s insane plan to impose tariffs on mexican imports trump tweeted on may 30 that he will impose a 5 tax on mexican goods starting on june 10 he then said that the tax will increase to 25 unless mexico reduces the flow of central americans to the u s border trump s decision probably aimed at diverting public opinion from growing calls for his impeachment following special counsel robert mueller s report on his russia probe would be a devastating blow to mexico s economy and increase the pressure for more migration to the north but while trump s latest temper tantrum would make things worse mexico s economy is already heading down since the populist leftist lo pez obrador s inauguration far from lo pez obrador s campaign promise of 4 annual growth rates the economy had shrunk by 0 2 during the past three months compared with the previous three month period according to mexican government figures the bank of mexico the country s central bank released a survey of leading economists two days before trump s tax announcement downgrading the country s growth projections to between 0 8 and 1 8 percent lo pez obrador had earlier dismissed such grim economic projections saying that there will be much more growth he stresses among other things that the mexican peso has strengthened since he took office more latest border apprehensions hit high mark but they re not so dramatic in the el centro sector more why doesn t the tariffs spurred farm bailout stir up anti socialism protests but as i heard from many business people during a recent trip to mexico the business community is preparing for the worst most say that lo pez obrador is spending way beyond the government s means and scaring away investors with his populist anti free market rhetoric there are widespread fears that he will soon run out of money for his broad social subsidies and that some disastrous decisions such as scrapping a 13 billion airport reconstruction project that was well under way will continue to seriously undermine investors confidence on the security front where lo pez obrador had promised a drastic reduction of crime rates the number of homicides rose by 9 7 during the first three months of this year compared with the same period last year according to official figures lo pez obrador s potentially catastrophic education policies and his lack of interest in science technology and innovation are even more worrisome for mexico s long term future lo pez obrador is reversing education reforms that sought to impose mandatory teacher evaluations by independent agencies and at preventing corrupt teachers unions from deciding who could be a teacher in cahoots with powerful teachers unions lo pez obrador is seeking to reinstate teachers who flunked their evaluation tests and were deemed unfit to be in front of a classroom mexico needs exactly the opposite further reforms to improve education standards so that it can have a more skilled workforce capable of competing with china and other top manufacturing countries the most recent international pisa math test of 15 year old students showed that mexico was ranked 56 out of 70 countries by comparison singapore was ranked first hong kong second and china sixth on science technology and innovation lo pez obrador s recently unveiled 228 page national development plan for 2019 2024 devotes only five lines to science and technology his appointed director of mexico s science and technology agency known as conacyt recently was quoted as saying that her model country for scientific research is cuba that caribbean island despite its government propaganda to the contrary produced only nine international patents last year compared with chile s 161 and south korea s 91 000 according to the u n world intellectual property organization granted there are a few things that lo pez obrador deserves credit for such as his obsession with reducing corruption the jury is still out on whether he ll be able to do it and his wise decision to react calmly to trump s tirades and unhinged trade measures against mexico but lo pez obrador s first six months in power have been bad for mexico sadly trump s stupid tariffs in addition to raising car computer and tablet prices for u s consumers threaten to make mexico s future even bleaker trump and lo pez obrador should be working together to increase north america s economic integration seeking to turn mexico into a magnet for investments to reduce poverty and illegal migration right now however they re doing more harm than good andres oppenheimer is a latin america correspondent for the miami herald 3511 n w 91 avenue doral fla 33172 email aoppenheimer miamiherald com
mr godwin emefiele governor of the central bank of nigeria cbn on saturday emphasised the need to strengthen efforts over the coming years to stimulate growth and create jobs in critical sectors to insulate the economy from global shocks emefiele said this while giving a welcome address at a consultative roundtable titled going for growth with some economic stakeholders in lagos the cbn boss said that leaders and policy makers needed to strengthen their resolve in achieving the goal he also said that would assist in putting in place unconventional policies that would help insulate the economy from shocks in the global economy the cbn governor said in doing that the cbn had recently been caught in a syndrome termed the dilemma of monetary policy in nigeria emefiele said typically for a nation to be seen to be prosperous any citizen of that country will expect macro economic indices such as low interest rate regime stable exchange rate regime and robust reserve position low inflationary environment as well as an environment of full employment according to him discussions and comprehensive recommendations will form part of the roadmap in actualising collective intent of ensuring the monetary policy authorities implement measures that will help drive the growth emefiele said the apex bank had taken a number of actions in the last five years to support the growth of the economy which had helped in achieving the macro economic stability this he said had led to inflation trending down to 11 37 per cent from 18 72 per cent in january 2017 exchange rate stability at current levels with considerable convergence and reserves build up to current level of over 45 billion compared to 23 billion in october 2016 the governor said although we had hoped to achieve a lower level of interest rate this became impossible given the normalisation of monetary policy in the united states and the over 60 per cent drop in crude oil prices between 2014 and 2016 you will agree with me that the consequences of these unfortunate occurrences was a heightened inflationary pressure on the economy and monetary policy had no option but to embark on a regime of tightening so as to rein inflation we also deployed measures aimed at supporting improved productivity of the nigerian economy by restricting access to foreign exchange on 43 items that could be produced in the country we have also strengthened our intervention programmes which helped in restarting the flow of credit to critical sectors of the economy as part of our interventions we introduced the anchor borrowers programme abp a programme that helped to improve access to credit to small holder farmers through our intervention programmes such as commercial agricultural credit scheme and the real sector support fund we have enabled large agro processors and manufacturers expand their operations thereby supporting our efforts at improving domestic production of goods emefiele however said in spite of those results which were reassuring the task of building a stronger economy was far from complete with the pace of gross domestic product gdp growth remaining fragile and lagging behind population growth rate of 2 7 per cent he noted that the country had yet to see a substantial increase in credit to the private sector by the financial institutions our domestic industries particularly high employment generating sectors like textile and garment sectors have to deal with rampant smuggling and dumping of materials through our borders these challenges no doubt call for action by the monetary and fiscal policies through the implementation of policies the spirit and letter of which must be respected by all furthermore the rising volatility which we see today in the crude oil market occasioned by the rapid increase in the supply of shale oil by the united states and which has seen its production rise from 9 million barrels per day in 2017 to over 12 million barrels per day today this portends great risk to nigeria s growth trajectory if we do not take actions that would wean us from excessive reliance on crude earnings for survival the cbn boss said according to emefiele our goal in participating in this roundtable session today is to generate valuable insights from key stakeholders on the role monetary policy authorities could play in formulating and implementing policy measures that will support improved economic growth the lagos state governor mr babajide sanwo olu in his opening remarks said the state would continue to support the cbn s drive in ensuring continuous economic growth sanwo olu said that the state contributes up to 30 per cent of the nation s gdp saying that it was important to help unleash business potential in the country for favourable competition at the global market we are going to do this so that we can become increasingly competitive and innovative it is important to unleash the potential of the state so as to attract foreign direct investments fdis to the state sanwo olu said he said the country had to tap into opportunities that abound in the trade war between america and china as well as that in the brexit through exports sanwo olu urged the cbn to continue playing its part especially in providing infrastructure that would help boost energy power for businesses to thrive the governor promised to ensure that lagos as a 21st century economy requires improved power supply to drive businesses he pledged to modernise essential services in the state and strive for maximum efficiency in the public sector institutions
menafn ing another blow for us trade relations unless a last minute breakthrough happens in negotiations in washington today mexican imports into the us will be subject to a 5 tariff starting monday with president trump hardening his anti immigration stance ahead of next year s election and the short time for mexico to show results we suspect tariffs will indeed be implemented integrated cross border supply chains in the industrial sector especially autos suggest that the overall impact of even small tariffs can be substantial for certain segments and the stakes will get progressively higher in the coming weeks with tariffs set to rise to 10 on july 1 before topping at 25 in october mexico s president lopez obrador has tried to defuse the conflict adopting a conciliatory stance and proposing to flesh out a strategy with meetings in washington this week led by foreign relations minister marcelo ebrard it s unclear how negotiations will evolve as compliance by mexico to us demands should remain highly subjective and primarily dependent on president trump s personal disposition we are biased towards further deterioration in the local market environment in the shorter term under the assumption that trump will see that maintaining a hardline stance is in his best interest while business interests in mexico and in the us have been hurt and have pressured the government to de escalate the conflict we expect trump to resist initially as immigration remains a crucial issue for him at next year s election moreover trump appears to view mexico as the weaker party in the negotiation much more constrained in its ability to retaliate which increases his incentives to position aggressively for now in hopes to achieve bigger gains on the immigration prevention front despite the risk to business confidence the chief demand by the us administration appears to be greater cooperation from mexico on asylum policy especially by pushing asylum seekers from central america to do so with mexico as a safe third country which mexico appears to resist rating agencies and the risk to financial stability since lopez obrador took office all rating agencies have moved to downgrade mexico s credit rating outlook to some degree and the risk of ratings related financial market volatility has reached a new sense of urgency this week with fitch and moody s downgrading the credit ratings of the sovereign and pemex as earlier this year agencies justified the shift largely by noting the weaker growth economic policy uncertainty and the heavy burden represented by pemex s deteriorating credit profile and the potential for rising contingent liabilities fitch s new sub investment grade status for pemex bb negative outlook came sooner than expected as the agency had just announced a two notch downgrade in january and this is a particularly troubling development given its ramifications for financial markets moody s now rates pemex at baa3 ie just one notch above investment grade and with a negative outlook as a result the risk of forced selling by investors who cannot hold junk rated assets has increased sharply s p still rates pemex as a bbb credit with a negative outlook overall actions by rating agencies confirm the deep scepticism towards the policy choices by the new administration especially as it tries to boost the state presence in the economy particularly in the energy sector with predictably negative consequences for economic activity and the fiscal outlook separately the announcement by the rating agencies may have increased mexico s incentives to pursue a quicker resolution with the us on the trade conflict if tariffs are introduced the risk of a more lasting damage to mexico s medium term outlook should increase as it should deepen the weakening momentum in economic activity in that case unless energy policy directives turn more business friendly in mexico the risk of negative ratings action should remain elevated what about the usmca it could be a bumpy road the trump administration also submitted to congress last week the statement of administrative action for the new usmca trade agreement which starts the legislative clock for the ratification of the treaty the move apparently took the democrats who control the house by surprise and the consensus among political pundits in washington is that the two events ie the announcement of the tariffs on mexican imports and the starting the clock on the usmca approval has complicated the outlook for the approval of the usmca treaty by the us congress and this risk ie that the usmca is not approved by its legislative deadline at the end of september is a critical factor in our opinion that should force the trump administration to end the conflict with mexico sooner in time to make progress on the treaty by august as a result we suspect the administration should be able to introduce the 5 tariff next week and even increase it to 10 on july 1 but after that the administration s position should become increasingly hard to sustain with the risk of an anti tariff veto proof majority emerging in congress increasing significantly overall even though it appears that all parties want a trade agreement in place it is clear that the chances of a smooth usmca process have diminished moreover uncertainty vis √† vis the evolution of the political incentives for the governments in mexico and in the us suggests that the risk of mismanagement that results in the failure to approve the trade agreement is no longer trivial policy implications for mexico the mexican peso has reacted strongly to the tariff announcement selling off 3 in recent days and we suspect the currency has further to go with the actual implementation of the 5 tariff becoming the next catalyst that could push the usdmxn decidedly above 20 as a result of currency weakness along with the rise of pemex related uncertainties room for a dovish shift in banxico s monetary policy stance has been curtailed sharply we no longer expect banxico to cut the policy rate this year as central bankers should continue to rely on a mix of high rates and still solid macro fundamentals to anchor the mxn uncertainty on the trade policy front has added further downside to the business investment outlook which has already contracted in the past two quarters in the context of heightened domestic policy uncertainties and the perception of an anti business bias by the lopez obrador administration this together with reduced prospects for monetary easing should contribute to extend the sharp drop in gdp growth expectations according to the central bank monthly survey 2019 gdp growth forecasts dropped 100 basis points in the past 9 months from 2 3 to 1 3 now and the bias is for expectations to drop further towards our own 1 0 forecast in the coming months overall our base case scenario is that mexico will not be able to avoid tariffs next week but a solution to the conflict will be reached in july at the latest with mexico maintaining a constructive non retaliatory stance this suggests that even though we are likely to see further intense selling in financial assets the sell off should be relatively short lived ie it should correct once an agreement is announced we also assume that the usmca is likely to be approved by the us congress but it s clear that uncertainty regarding that has increased which should continue to weigh on mexico s business environment and produce a more lasting damage to mexico s medium term outlook
in the first of a two part interview bnamericas speaks to colombia s deputy energy minister diego mesa about the major challenges facing the country s power sector as it makes a transition toward non conventional renewable sources mesa will take part in the south america energy series saes colombia 2019 gas and renewables summit in bogot√° on june 20 and 21 more information about the event can be seen here bnamericas what are the key issues facing the power sector in colombia as the country begins to embrace renewable sources such as wind and solar mesa one of the main challenges that we have at the moment is that we have a power generation matrix that is heavily reliant on hydropower that s okay because we have the sixth cleanest matrix in the world but at the same time we re exposed to climate change phenomena such as el ni√±o so one of the things we want to do is make sure that the matrix is much more diversified and part of that objective is to incorporate non conventional renewables such as wind and solar into the matrix we have a number of objectives that we plan to pursue to complement the matrix to diversify the matrix and to make it more resilient i think we also have a challenge to make sure that the sector is much more competitive with a better price formation system in place the auction that we tried to launch in february that we re going to relaunch in the second half of this year tries to pursue two objectives one is to make sure that we have much more non conventional renewables in the matrix but at the same time that we have a competitive process in place for long term ppas bnamericas what went wrong in the first auction mesa we did the auction in late february and part of the whole process included that there were some competition indicators that had to be met those are designed by the regulator creg and those indicators included concentration participation and dominance and two of those concentration and dominance were not met and as a result of that the auction was not successful even though when you look at the bids from the demand and the supply side there was a cut in the curve and potentially we had an assignation of contracts but when we looked at the indicators we had to declare the auction unsuccessful bnamericas was the imbalance on the supply side or the demand side mesa it was mostly on the demand side but when you look at the indicators you look at the supply side it s a bit difficult to explain but what happened was that we didn t have enough participation from the demand side and the participation was not with the prices that we were expecting on the supply side the prices were very competitive as part of the process there is a ceiling price that the regulator set all the prices that came into the auction were below that price so that was very encouraging however on the demand side the prices were not what we were expecting and when we did the analysis in the aftermath we realized that it was a bit unusual that some companies that have a portion of their energy purchases exposed to the spot market in which the price is much higher didn t bid a price that was competitive enough to be assigned energy during the auction so i think the failure of the auction is explained in large part by lack of participation from the demand side from energy buyers bnamericas it has been said that changes for the next auction could include time blocks and contracts in us dollars to attract bidders is that correct mesa after the auction we went through a process of reflection and we wanted to understand what happened why the demand didn t participate as expected and i think the lessons learned were that the product that we were auctioning wasn t attractive enough for the demand side the reason for this is that in colombia most of the contracts are of a financial nature the contract was more of a physical nature so we decided that we needed to migrate towards the type of contract that the demand is much more used to in colombia that s one of the main changes we went from obliging generators to commit to supplying energy over the course of a year to hourly blocks in this sense the contracts become financial in nature and the generators will have to commit to provide an amount of energy during certain hours of the day which we divided this into three blocks it will be very similar to the auctions that chile introduced about five years ago we think that with that change the uncertainty on the demand side about the viability of non conventional renewable energy is going to be reduced significantly the second point that you mention is the currency on that front we realized that if we have the product either in us dollars or in a combination of pesos and dollars that s going to attract much more financing from abroad which will make the system much more competitive in a market sense so what we published late last month which is out for consultation is a resolution that has the product prices in pesos but 60 of the product price will be indexed to the exchange rate between the us dollar and the colombian peso the remaining 40 will be in colombian pesos we ve discussed this with international banks and they think that it s a step in the right direction we think that the generators are also happy with this hybrid system bnamericas does the fact that contracts will be assigned time intervals open up more opportunities for gas fired thermoelectric generators given that renewable energy can t be generated on a 24 7 basis mesa natural gas plants have a critical role in what we call this energy transition because obviously due to the viability of these sources natural gas is a backup source that we need to make sure is in the system one thing that we are exploring is how these generators that have these natural gas plants can offer coverage for renewables that are intermittent so i think there is a role for thermal plants based on natural gas going forward but not in this auction which will only be for renewables including small hydropower dams bnamericas do we know when the new rules will be confirmed and when the auction will be held mesa in the resolution that was published for comment we ve said that the auction will take place before september 30th this year we ve been talking to different agents in the market there is one request that the agents have made that is that they would like to have at least two months from the time that all the rules are set to the time that the auction takes places they want to have that time to prepare offers to get the financial guarantees the financing and so forth so our goal is to have all the different rules in place including the different resolutions and the contract model with the tender published and set by june 30th if we think june 30 to september 30 we have three months but obviously the agents will have to submit their offers before september 30 we re thinking of between two and three months for them to prepare their offers
