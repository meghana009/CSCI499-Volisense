introduction and summary importantly cap s plan shows that we can make the investments we need in a stronger economy all while holding the nation s debt to manageable levels and avoiding putting the burden on low and middle income americans illustrating that the united states has ample fiscal capacity if we as a country are willing to raise revenue in a progressive manner cap s fiscal solutions plan makes these investments while substantially improving the country s long term fiscal outlook specifically the plan slows the rise in the public debt so that three decades from now the debt would be roughly 92 percent of gdp when scored using conventional revenue estimates or 104 percent using dynamic scoring incorporating feedback from estimated macroeconomic effects 7 the level of public debt under the plan three decades from now is only modestly higher than today s level about 80 percent and much lower than projected levels which come to about 150 percent of gdp under congressional budget office s cbo long term budget outlook and potentially higher than 200 percent if current policies are extended indefinitely 8 the long term budget proposal presented by the center for american progress in this report cap s fiscal solutions plan is premised on the recognition that the united states faces a multitude of critical challenges that must be addressed concurrently crucially it is based on the conviction that we as a country can do big things 6 we can and we must dramatically increase investment in our people our economy and our future as these investments are essential to sustaining a strong economy over the long term accordingly this report proposes an approach that meets critical national challenges head on including the rising inequality that undermines our economy and democracy underinvestment in children and the future and the daunting threat of climate change while keeping federal debt to manageable levels the united states also faces long term fiscal challenges the evidence suggests that the debt is not an immediate problem since 2008 the public debt has doubled as a share of gross domestic product gdp from about 40 percent to 80 percent with no discernable consequences over the last 10 years real interest rates have declined to historically low levels and debt service is still a relatively small share of the federal budget 3 but over the long term if we maintain our current revenue and spending policies annual deficits will grow and the public debt as a share of gdp will rise from about 80 percent today to as high as 200 percent of gdp by mid century 4 high and rising debt will increase the share of the federal budget dedicated to debt service and could potentially slow economic growth 5 for these reasons the projected rise in public debt should be viewed as a long term risk that must be weighed against other risks and opportunities today the united states finds itself at the crossroads of many economic social and global challenges the past several decades have seen real wages for rank and file workers stagnate income and wealth inequality rise undue political power concentrate in the hands of the few and the pace of productivity growth and overall economic growth slow moreover despite the united states being among the wealthiest countries in the world millions of americans lack affordable health care or child care nearly one third of its children live in poverty or on the brink of poverty economic mobility has declined and many communities face persistently high unemployment and economic distress 1 at the same time scientists warn that the world must take dramatic action to reduce carbon emissions over the next decade to prevent irreversible harm to the planet our economy and our communities due to climate change 2 components of cap s fiscal solutions plan investing in the economy and the american people the budget plan is based on the recognition that while the public debt level can pose long term risks government borrowing is often necessary to finance needed public investments as a recent cap survey of the economic literature on debt and deficits concluded he government can incur debt to lay the foundation for widely shared prosperity yet america cannot afford wasteful trillion dollar giveaways to the wealthy 9 yet the recent runup in public debt has been caused largely by successive tax cuts favoring high income americans the damage from the financial crisis and foreign wars it would be a mistake to respond to the resulting deficits by sacrificing public investments in areas such as infrastructure education health care child care science and clean energy where those investments could bolster long term growth and ensure that its benefits are broadly shared in fact as former international monetary fund imf chief economist olivier blanchard underscored in a recent address when real interest rates are persistently low as they are now the fiscal and welfare costs of public debt are lower 10 that implies that the cost of failing to make critical public investments is higher accordingly cap s budget plan remedies the past failure to make needed investments in the economy and the american people focused on several broad areas guaranteeing affordable quality health care for all americans investing in innovation and the transition to a clean energy economy to ensure that the effects of climate change do not devastate future generations investing in jobs infrastructure and the middle class investing in children and families in addition to the new investments described below cap s plan maintains general nondefense discretionary spending at its real fiscal year 2019 levels relieving the harmful effects of the budget sequester and allowing for further investments not specified in this report nondefense discretionary spending funds core government functions and critical areas such as education public health environmental protection and veterans services guaranteeing affordable quality health care for all americans unlike all other developed countries the united states fails to provide universal health coverage to its citizens while the united states has seen significant coverage gains in recent years particularly under the affordable care act aca efforts to improve health care remain under attack the trump administration with help from its allies in congress has worked tirelessly to dismantle the aca and undermine access to medicaid as a result in one of the wealthiest nations on earth 30 million individuals remain uninsured and this number continues to grow 11 in order to address these challenges it is time to build upon the historic success of the aca and finally guarantee affordable quality health care for all americans 12 this budget plan incorporates medicare extra for all the health care plan cap originally outlined in 2018 medicare extra is a universal coverage plan that would eliminate underinsurance all americans regardless of income health status age or insurance status would have the right to enroll in the same high quality health plan modeled after medicare newborns individuals enrolled in medicaid and those currently purchasing insurance in the individual marketplace would automatically be enrolled in the new program while individuals receiving coverage through their work could retain private insurance they would also have the option to switch to medicare extra employers would also have the option to sponsor medicare extra for their employees medicare extra would provide comprehensive coverage and include important enhancements to the current medicare program an out of pocket limit coverage of dental care and hearing aids and integrated drug benefits the plan would offer free preventive care free treatment for chronic disease and free generic drugs cost sharing and premiums would be limited and scaled by income individuals with incomes below the federal poverty level including most individuals currently enrolled in medicaid would have no cost sharing requirements or premiums benefits under medicare extra would include primary and preventive services hospital services including emergency services ambulatory services prescription drugs and medical devices laboratory services maternity newborn and reproductive health care mental health and substance use disorder services habilitative and rehabilitative services dental vision and hearing services early and periodic screening diagnostic and treatment services for children medicare extra would significantly reduce health care costs for individuals and families and slow the growth of u s national health expenditures payment rates for medical providers would reference current medicare rates and employer plans would be able to take advantage of these savings medicare extra would negotiate prescription drug prices by giving preference to drugs whose prices reflect value and innovation medicare extra would also implement long overdue reforms to the payment and delivery system and take advantage of medicare s administrative efficiencies in sum medicare extra provides guaranteed affordable health coverage to every american while bending the health care cost curve over time cap anticipates that medicare extra will have a net cost of about 3 trillion over 10 years 2022 2031 and we have incorporated that target cost into this budget plan that cost estimate is net of savings achieved within health programs premiums and increased tax revenue generated indirectly from changes in employer sponsored health insurance the remainder of the cost would be financed by progressive tax revenues taking bold action to address climate change when it comes to implementing policies today that will leave a better world for future generations no issue is more important than climate change scientists have warned that the world must take dramatic action to reduce carbon emissions over the next decade to prevent irreversible harm to the planet our economy and our communities 13 the united states must lead the way but regrettably the current administration withdrew the united states from the landmark agreement reached in paris in 2015 to combat climate change president donald trump s withdrawal from the paris agreement undermined america s leadership and credibility and undermines the strength of our economy already more than 4 million workers are now employed in clean energy industries 14 the failure to make the needed policy choices and investments to promote a clean energy economy threatens the development of these growing industries and will impede u s economic growth over the long term climate change is also a critical fiscal issue the office of management and budget estimates that the annual costs of unmitigated climate change range from 34 billion to 112 billion by the mid to late century 15 what s more that estimate does not consider the significant resources the nation would need in order to address the effects of climate change on areas such as health care national security and infrastructure all of which could add untold costs to reduce carbon emissions cap s plan proposes a progressive budget neutral carbon tax set at the social cost of carbon emissions or roughly 52 per metric ton the carbon tax would shift public and private investment away from carbon intensive energy sources and toward renewable and lower carbon energy sources 16 because low and moderate income households spend a higher share of their incomes on energy costs and other forms of consumption a carbon tax can have a regressive distributional effect including increasing hardship for those with low incomes the cap plan therefore proposes to rebate all of the net revenue from the carbon tax to middle and low income americans such a progressive rebate system can be implemented in a number of ways including through the combination of lump sum rebates and tax cuts on labor income which cap proposed in 2016 17 establishing a price on carbon emissions is an important step toward confronting climate change but given the urgency and magnitude of the challenge it is not sufficient there s also a need for substantial public investments u s investment in climate science and clean energy research and development are critical to both domestic and global efforts to understand and combat climate change to strengthen these critical foundations the plan doubles federal spending on climate science clean energy research and development and programs supporting advanced manufacturing the budget plan would dramatically accelerate the transition to a 100 percent clean energy electricity sector through direct investments that will improve equity and assist low income and rural communities this includes updating outdated transmission infrastructure to better integrate renewables and storage technologies repairing and replacing outdated natural gas distribution pipelines to reduce methane leakage improving energy efficiency and reducing costs for low income households through an expanded weatherization assistance program wap and updating energy systems in municipal buildings schools universities and hospitals by funding the u s department of energy s state energy program for the next 10 years at the levels from the american recovery and reinvestment act arra of 2009 18 for the 56 percent of the united states landmass served by rural electric co ops cap s plan vastly expands funding available through the rural utilities service to both forgive outstanding debts on fossil fuel assets owned and operated by rural co ops and to replace them with zero emitting electric generation 19 the plan also includes cap s proposal for a 240 billion 10 year job creation program called the future ready communities corps the program which would help some of the most vulnerable communities by retrofitting them with energy efficient and solar ready homes and even relocating those who are situated on flood plains is estimated to avoid 60 billion per year in extreme weather related costs it would also employ 290 000 people and save households about 7 billion per year on their energy bills 20 the cap budget plan also makes significant investments in zero emissions transportation including installing electric vehicle ev charging stations in public spaces and federal workplaces the federal government would also facilitate the replacement of half the buses operated by transit agencies and one quarter of all school buses with ev alternatives through the expansion of the successful low or no emission vehicle program to help more americans transition to cleaner vehicles the plan calls for the government to implement a program to encourage trade ins of fuel inefficient vehicles for hybrid and ev alternatives the plan also extends tax credits for wind and solar energy and for electric vehicles in addition the plan proposes an annual national disaster resilience competition to fund major resilient infrastructure in communities affected by or at risk for natural disasters in order to help states pay for resilient infrastructure clean energy and clean transportation cap proposes the establishment of state future funds federally supported revolving loan funds that support innovative and resilient transportation and energy infrastructure and flood protections in areas that need them the most including low income areas and communities of color 21 additional funding for conservation and restoration would be provided to the fema pre disaster mitigation grant program the land and water conservation fund the u s forest service and the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration noaa we would also provide funding to relocate the alaska native communities who are at risk from sea level rise to areas that are safer and culturally appropriate investing in infrastructure jobs and the middle class millions of families in the middle and working class are not fully sharing in the gains or opportunities from economic growth median wages have been essentially stagnant for decades for many groups of workers inequality has shot upward and millions of families continue to live in poverty together with the rising costs of significant expenses such as health care higher education child care and rent these factors have contributed to a widening chasm in economic security and opportunity in 2016 the top 1 percent of earners received nearly one quarter of u s income while the bottom half received only 14 percent wealth inequality is even more stark the wealthiest 1 percent have 39 percent of the nations wealth while the bottom 90 percent have just 23 percent 22 the plan addresses these significant economic challenges that middle and working class americans now face through a series of targeted investments including rebuilding and reinvesting in america s infrastructure providing long term supports and services that allow more people with disabilities and seniors to thrive in their communities and establishing a federal jobs guarantee program that revitalizes communities that have been left behind 23 taken together these investments would generate growth while creating millions of jobs increasing worker power raising wages and reinvesting in the nation s physical and human capital rebuilding and reinvesting in america s infrastructure failing to invest in america s infrastructure puts a significant drag on the economy repeated underinvestment in infrastructure has led to deteriorating facilities broken roads and crumbling bridges which increase costs and reduce productivity 24 cap s plan would immediately work to reduce this gap by investing an additional 42 billion above baseline per year over the next decade funding would go to the nation s transportation and water infrastructure rebuilding roads rails and bridges and ensuring access to safe clean water this level of investment would generate through direct and indirect effects 350 000 jobs in the first 10 years 25 by reducing congestion and increasing mobility which in turn would cut unnecessary costs for households and businesses these investments would ultimately increase overall national competitiveness and growth providing long term supports and services too many seniors and people with disabilities lack access to critical home and community based support services and long term care as the u s population continues to age this problem will only compound forcing more and more people eligible for services onto waitlists without care as it stands now there are more than 700 000 people with disabilities who qualify for medicaid but remain on support service waitlists 26 in addition only 30 percent of seniors who require care and are not institutionalized receive paid support 27 moreover wages for caregivers in this sector such as personal care or home health aides are very low with median wages of just 10 to 12 per hour 28 it is clear that more investment is needed in this area therefore the cap plan earmarks 44 billion annually to support the generation of 1 million home health aide and personal care aide jobs as well as the creation of pathways for the federal government to work with those in the industry and community to develop training programs that provide care workers with specialized skills this investment would address a long unmet need and boost economic security for seniors people with disabilities and their families while allowing them to thrive in their communities lifting communities left behind with a federal job guarantee the gains of economic growth have not been shared evenly across income groups or regions and many communities have been left significantly behind due to a variety of economic and social factors including automation offshoring concentration in certain markets and structural racism although the significant investments outlined throughout this report will undoubtedly help many families and workers facing these situations find jobs and increase their economic security a more targeted approach is necessary to ensure the hardest hit communities see real positive gains as a result of this need cap s budget plan appropriates the funds required to pay for the jobs guarantee program as outlined in the previously published jobs blueprint for a full 30 years 29 the jobs guarantee would afford long term residents in the nation s most economically distressed counties comprising roughly 10 percent of the u s population a living wage job in their local labor market investing in children and families to expand opportunity reduce poverty and hardship and help families make ends meet cap s budget plan proposes significant investments in families and children including a major investment in high quality child care to ensure that no low or middle income family spends more than 7 percent of its income on child care the plan also invests in a comprehensive program of paid family and medical leave for american workers a new initiative to increase the pay of teachers serving in high poverty schools and a major new funding commitment to k 12 school modernization child care for families child care can frequently be among their largest household expense 30 the average cost of center based child care is more than 10 000 per year and high quality centers can cost dramatically more 31 unaffordable or inconsistent child care can reduce parents ability to fully participate in the labor market in fact breakdowns in child care cost u s businesses an estimated 4 4 billion per year and cost families even more in lost wages 28 9 billion a year 32 in the long run expanded access to child care and early childhood education provides children with the basis for future mobility and success resulting in long term growth and economic stability 33 cap s plan incorporates the child care for working families act introduced by sen patty murray d wa and rep bobby scott d va which would more than double the eligibility for child care assistance improve the quality of care itself as well as positions in the sector and dramatically reduce child care costs for families 34 this plan does so by providing universal access to preschool programs for children ages 3 and 4 and expanding child care subsidies to all low and middle income families composed of anyone earning less than 150 percent of the median income in their state these subsidies would ensure that no low or middle income family pays more than 7 percent of their earnings on child care and provide all families under 75 percent of the state median income with access to free child care comprehensive paid family and medical leave cap would also ensure that all families have access to paid leave by budgeting for the enactment of the family and medical insurance leave family act 35 workers should not have to sacrifice their economic security when they need to take time off to care for their family or chosen family under this plan all workers are afforded 12 weeks of paid leave during which they can earn two thirds of their monthly wages up to a monthly maximum of 4 000 the legislation fully finances paid leave through a small 0 4 percent payroll tax evenly split between employers and employees teacher pay the cap plan includes a fully refundable tax credit for teachers of high poverty schools which would increase teacher pay by as much as 10 000 per year 36 on average teachers earn just 60 percent of what their counterparts in other professions earn even when controlling for education and experience even more troubling in 30 states the average salary for teachers is below the family living wage 37 this proposed investment would begin to close the large pay gap that too many teachers in america face school modernization cap s budget plan would invest 46 billion annually for 10 years in rebuilding the nation s k 12 schools 38 this investment would cover the gap left by years of underinvestment in our public schools that has led to far too many schools especially those serving low income communities to fall into disrepair universal child allowance the plan also expands the child tax credit ctc to help provide economic security for many working and middle class families 39 the tax cuts and jobs act tcja of 2017 doubled the ctc to 2 000 per child but the increase was both temporary and poorly targeted with many of the hardest pressed families receiving only a partial benefit and in some cases little or no benefit cap s plan ensures that all low and middle income families receive the full benefit of the ctc by making the entire 2 000 per child credit refundable with no income phase in and by permanently indexing the amount to inflation additionally since child rearing costs are the highest for the youngest children the plan provides a fully refundable young child tax credit of 125 per month 1 500 per year for families with children under age 3 taken together these policies would tremendously reduce child poverty and substantially boost the incomes of many working and middle class families they would also dramatically improve the well being and prospects of children especially those in their first years of life the most critical stage of development research has shown that boosting the incomes of low income families improves children s health and increases educational attainment and earnings later in life 40 quite simply there is no investment we can make as a society that promises a higher return
while some economists claim that the world economy is heading towards long term stagnation others claim that what we are seeing is a short cycle analysts of the world economy are divided between those who foresee a recession and those who think it is just a question of controlling a slowdown there is a another underlying debate are we seeing long term stagnation or are the conditions of a new wave of expansion already foreshadowed the dynamic of capitalism as a system rests on its capacity for innovation and continuous improvement of labour productivity since the early 1970s this improvement has slowed down if until 2010 labour productivity grew at a rate of 2 5 per cent per year only increased by0 6 per date per year from that date until 2017 low growth despite these mediocre advances capital globally succeeded between 1970 and 2010 in maintaining the rate of profit and restoring the overall profitability of the system this was possible because from the global crisis of the 1970s capital launched a process of restructuring its productive spaces and services relocation and concentration of enterprises technocentric model of production accompanied by a strong offensive against labour structural reduction of wages changes in working conditions introduction of new technologies capital intensive investments however despite this maintenance of the rate of profit the growth of the global economy has been very weak although until the crisis of 2008 growth averaged 5 5 per cent a year mainly thanks to the contribution of so called emerging countries subsequently it did not exceed 3 7 per cent despite an improvement in the american economy this growth resulted in a strong concentration of wealth and an increase in inequalities around the world two visions on the basis of this stagnation of productivity because we have been witnessing a long period of insufficient demand and because the world economy is unable to give a strong impetus to wages and employment many analysts believe that the global economy is stagnating in the long run in one way or another they are rediscovering the thesis of structural stagnation that keynes disciple alvin hansen put forward in the late 1930s and that the former secretary to the us treasury lawrence summers took up again several years ago others on the contrary argue that what we have been seeing lately is really the end of the super cycle of indebtedness according to them the countries of the centre are absorbing the monetary expansion that they were forced into in order to end the crisis in 2008 the united states is raising interest rates and the european central bank is reducing the purchase of bonds and withdrawing the cheap money released by the crisis the possibilities of a new expansive wave are thus being prefigured the conjuncture in 2018 uncertainty dominated the global economy characterized by a deterioration of commercial relations strong market volatility and rising interest rates with on top of that the chinese slowdown and problems in europe especially the resurgence of extreme right nationalism the imf estimates that in 2018 global gdp grew by 3 7 per cent a lower percentage than in the period prior to 2008 5 5 per cent but higher than in the years following the crisis it is in the advanced countries 2 4 per cent as against 3 per cent previously that this trend is the most marked however according to the analyst jorge castro us production increased by 3 5 per cent in 2018 under conditions of full employment 3 7 per cent unemployment the lowest rate in three decades with an increase in real wages of 3 2 per cent the highest in ten years 1 8 per cent inflation and productivity increasing by 2 5 per cent the fact that the tax cuts decided by the trump administration resulted in the repatriation of capital worth 7 billion of which according to jorge castro part went to wall street but also part to productive investments is not unrelated to this table despite the importance of the us economy the world economy is weakening the imf has recalculated downwards its estimates for this year to 3 5 per cent and 2 5 per cent for the united states the slowdown taking place at a faster pace than was foreseen according to the oecd global expansion has reached its apogee while the wto has just predicted that world trade will continue to contract in the first half of this year in fact germany and japan have reduced their growth rates during recent months and the chinese economy with the slowest growth in nine years is slowing more quickly than had been foreseen in this situation how important is the conflict between the united states and china which is not only trade dispute with rising tariffs on both sides which have affected trade but which also has a strategic character aimed at determining who will control the fourth industrial revolution that is underway a new tariff escalation that is donald trump s threat if an agreement that satisfies him is not concluded would push the economy directly into recession but there are indications of a possible agreement after the truce concluded in buenos aires during the g20 meeting but it is not just the dispute between the united states and china that exerts an influence there are also indications of the possibility of a recession in the united states and of its global impact the meeting in davos concluded on the conviction that the global economy is not on the point of collapse but the risks are increasing are we at the dawn of a new world financial crisis we have noted that the world economy was entering a period of defining its long term prospects the way the present conjuncture is solved will influence this definition one of the distinguishing features of this situation is the uncertainty resulting from both political and economic unknowns among the first figure brexit extreme right wing nationalism in europe the tense relations of the united states with china and korea and also the case of venezuela among the latter are the deterioration of commercial relations the high volatility of markets rising interest rates and the chinese slowdown in the risk zone according to economist and former portuguese mp francisco louça there are three indicators of possible risks for 2019 a neoliberal deregulation spreads throughout the world which makes nation states increasingly vulnerable b speculative centres are still stimulated financial capital and the concentration of accumulation continue to be privileged c the accumulation of debts public private or business continues debts already exceed 300 per cent of world gdp for their part analysts oscar ugarteche and alfredo ocampo stress four specific points of the north american economy 1 between 2008 and the third quarter of 2017 gdp grew below its potential but from that last date its growth has been greater than this potential nearly 5 per cent in the third and fourth quarter of 2018 with an annual growth rate of 3 7 per cent according to them this cannot last any longer because it would overheat the economy with foreseeable consequences 2 the unemployment rate remained below its natural level throughout the years 2017 and 2018 they note that something similar happened in the moments preceding the three recent recessions 1990 2001 and 2008 more or less a year before 3 there are differences in bond yields of ten and two year treasury bills there is less risk in long term bonds than in short term bonds this is an anomaly that has already manifested itself in recent recessions anticipating them by more or less a year 4 for the first time since 2008 the interest rate is positive for these authors these four points indicate the possibility of an overheating of the us economy that would result in further interest rate hikes and appreciation of the dollar which would increase the trade deficit in addition a stronger dollar would attract new capital from emerging countries and reduce commodity prices especially in latin america a recent citigroup report indicates that a slowdown in the united states would affect global growth and its impact would be more important than during the previous financial crisis according to this report argentina mexico canada and taiwan would be the most exposed countries continuity of the crisis it turns out that the main causes that led to the crisis of 2008 have not disappeared large multinationals have continued to accumulate profits despite the weak growth of the world economy this accumulation is not the result of greater productive activity but of financialization speculation or appropriation of natural resources and commons which as a whole operate as a support for capitalist accumulation but at the same time because of their overdevelopment accentuate the contradictions of the system because this phase of the internationalization of capital that we know under the name of globalization has ushered in a new mode of domination this model has strong political and social implications â concentration of wealth â increased social inequalities â worsening of the climate crisis â localized wars and strengthening of the world debt system these are the products of the generalization of neoliberal policies however this new order has not yet been completely realized its completion requires dismantling of all the governance architecture that was built in the aftermath of the world war ii and replacing it by another founded on a new balance of power between the great powers especially between the united states and china are we in the preliminary stages of a new global finance while this new balance has not yet been completed from contraction to recession commercial deterioration market volatility high indebtedness speculative bubbles the risk of a new world recession is increasing is another 2008 coming data showing that the world economy has entered a zone of risk without a solution of continuity is accumulating imf director christine lagarde has just declared that everything is worse than expected for the global economy and that 70 per cent of the global economy is slowing down for his part the director of the world trade organization added that trade cannot fully play its role of engine of growth and predicted that global gdp growth and trade will be lower than in 2018 weakening in the united states at the beginning of this year the us federal reserve fed indicated that it could change its monetary policy a few weeks ago it made this announcement effective with an abrupt modification not only the bank rate of reference will not be raised throughout the current year but the policy of absorption of market liquidities will also be limited all of these measures indicate that the us economy is showing signs of weakening in a way this confirms what we have already indicated american growth has recently exceeded its potential and at the same time we can observe an anomaly a lower risk of long term bonds as against short term ones what we call an inversion of the curve everything seems to indicate that the momentum given to the economy through donald trump s tax reform and the tax breaks that helped repatriate some 7 billion has come to an end the experience of other crises indicates that all this can lead to overheating of the us economy which would lead to further interest rate increases of interest and an appreciation of the dollar increasing the us deficit with the aforementioned fed decision the increase in the interest rate is cancelled for this year 2019 but the deficit is the most important in ten years of the order of 621 billion of which 419 billion are owed to china and 110 billion to the eu the appreciation of the dollar is reversing the flow of speculative capital which leaves the so called emerging countries to take refuge in the greenback thus causing a strong devaluation of their currencies the brazilian real the turkish pound and the argentine peso and not only in the most industrialized countries growth and investment remain very low and their economies are contracting china has just reduced its forecast of growth for this year to 6 per cent the lowest rate in 25 years germany has done the same going from 1 8 per cent to 0 8 percent turkey went into recession after almost a decade of strong growth in japan after years of expansionist monetary policy they have come to the conclusion that there is a strong probability that the economy is shrinking russia estimates its growth at only 1 3 per cent while among the other bric members only india records an annual growth rate of 7 per cent available data indicate that the current slowdown of the world s major economies could be transformed into a global recession in the not too distant future and the central banks could not do much because rates of interest are already at zero or negative in the european union and in japan according to the fed they have also limited their policies of monetary absorption policies towards another 2008 in the united states the trump administration has continued deregulation and the easing of controls over the banking system moreover the fact that the fed decided to limit monetary absorption with which it partially conjured up the 2008 crisis means there will be more money in circulation while banking deregulation will facilitate the granting of credit without additional requirements all this is going to stimulate growth while speeding up the journey towards recession but for some analysts the risk is greater it is enough just to look in the mirror of 2008 to see why neoliberal deregulation threatens to spread again globally making nation states increasingly vulnerable the financial centres where speculation reigns and which favour accumulation in the hands of a small number are prospering again while global indebtedness whether state private or corporate already exceeds 300 per cent of world gdp the stock market and real estate bubbles complete the list of threats as if something was missing in the conflicts between china and the united states the brexit labyrinth the rise of european nationalisms and a trail of geopolitical conflicts add uncertainty to a situation where financial capital and speculators investing in the short term move around like fish in water nobody knows if this acceleration of the slowdown will end in a global recession but fears are growing eduardo lucita is part of the argentinean edi economists of the left collective and is a member of the fourth

gerald ssendaula the minister of finance planning and economic development presented the 2003 04 national budget proposals to the nation below is the text of his speech theme increased production for increased exports and the eradication of absolute poverty mr speaker sir honourable members of parliament i beg to move that parliament does resolve itself into a committee of supply for the consideration and approval of the revised revenue and expenditure estimates for the fiscal year 2002 2003 and the budgetary proposals for the estimates of revenue and expenditure for the fiscal year 2003 2004 mr speaker sir first allow me to congratulate his excellency professor gilbert bukenya on being elevated to the high office of vice president of the republic of uganda i wish to assure him of our co operation in this challenging assignment i also wish to congratulate him on being the first vice president under the movement government to preside over the presentation of the national budget mr speaker sir under article 155 1 of the constitution the president shall cause to be prepared and laid before parliament estimates of revenue and expenditure for each financial year i am accordingly performing this duty on behalf of the president mr speaker sir i would like to briefly introduce the main objectives of the government s medium term economic and budget strategy government has successfully completed the first phase of the economic programme namely economic rehabilitation the next challenge is to transform the economy through export led economic growth it is this challenge which i will discuss in this year s budget which has the theme increased production for increased exports and the eradication of absolute poverty the highest priority of government in the medium term remains that of achieving the accelerated economic growth that is adequate to eradicate mass poverty this requires a significant transformation of the economy through the expansion of production diversification quality control and adding value to our products for both domestic consumption and for export government is therefore committed to implementing the medium term competitiveness strategy for private sector development the plan for modernisation of agriculture and the strategic exports programme and to rigorously search for markets for our exports i shall shortly outline our policies and programmes in this area under pillars i and iii of the poverty eradication action plan peap these pillars are creating a framework for growth and structural transformation and measures to increase incomes accelerated private sector growth requires that the government allows room for the private sector to grow we must therefore restrain growth in government expenditure and ensure that we obtain value for money through efficient and effective public expenditure management we also want to reduce dependence on donor funding in order to ensure the sustainability of our budget we must therefore transform the economy to widen the tax base while at the same time enhancing revenue from tax and non tax sources achieving rapid economic growth and structural transformation also requires skilled motivated healthy human resources coupled with security and good governance and i shall describe our programmes for attaining these outcomes later in my speech under the respective pillars of the peap budget achievements for fy 2002 03 and planned outputs for fy 2003 04 mr speaker sir the budget that i am presenting reports on the economic and social achievements in financial year 2002 03 it also reports on a selection of priority actions which government intends to take during the fy 2003 04 to move further towards our long term objectives pillar 1 creating a framework for rapid economic growth and structural transformation performance of the economy gross domestic product gdp growth real gdp growth in 2002 03 is estimated at 4 9 percent this is lower than our targeted rate of growth of 7 per cent because of a slowdown in the growth of food crop agriculture on account of the deterioration in climatic conditions relative to the very good conditions which prevailed in 2001 02 however some sectors continued to grow strongly including manufacturing at 6 6 percent and the wholesale and retail trade and the transport and communication sectors which both grew at 9 7 percent mr speaker sir with the expected recovery in agricultural production growth in real gdp for fiscal year 2003 04 is projected at 5 6 percent however our medium term objective is to restore gdp growth to 7 percent per annum to achieve this objective it will be necessary to deepen and accelerate the supply side reforms required to boost the economy inflation mr speaker sir developments in the food crop markets have had an impact on inflation food crop prices fell sharply in 2001 02 because of the good harvests but the much slower growth of food crop production in 2002 03 has led to a rebound in food crop prices which in turn has pushed up headline consumer price inflation annual average headline inflation is estimated at 5 9 per cent this current year while annual underlying inflation which excludes food prices is projected at 2 9 per cent a related issue to focus on as we consider the area of general price levels is the use of coins in order for prices to reflect the true value of goods and services the bank of uganda has introduced small denomination coins of 10 50 100 200 and 500 shillings these are legal tender and should be accepted in the market in exchange for goods and services this could make a big difference in prices especially for micro spenders commercial bankers are expected to co operate to ensure circulation of the coins maintaining underlying inflation below 5 percent per annum continues to be the cornerstone of government s macroeconomic policy because low inflation is essential for promoting private sector led economic growth and for raising the level of domestic savings exports mr speaker sir our policy of diversification of exports has started to pay dividends despite the deterioration of the terms of trade the performance of uganda s export sector in 2002 03 has been good total export earnings from goods and non factor services are projected to increase by 15 percent from us 700m to us 805m coffee export earnings are projected at us 109m compared to us 85m last fiscal year boosted by a temporary recovery in coffee prices on the world market non coffee export earnings from goods and services are projected to increase by us 83 mill or 13 5 percent to us 696 mill fish export earnings are projected to increase by 12 percent from us 81 mill to us 90 mill this financial year horticulture earnings from products such as flowers fruit and vegetables are also increasing expanding by an impressive 38 percent from us 29 5 mill to us 40 7 mill over the same period over 4 000 jobs have been created and new market niches in usa europe and the middle east have been penetrated the recent initiatives by our development partners to increase market access for our exports have already opened up more opportunities as ugandan goods gain market recognition however these initiatives will only succeed if the same development partners do not engage in countermeasures to reduce market access we commend those development partners who have called on the european union and the united states to slash their agricultural subsidies increased regional co operation through our participation in the east african community and the common market for east and southern africa will also help our export efforts in the longer term the new partnership for africa s development nepad initiative will further enhance our regional integration efforts bringing us additional benefits in terms of infrastructural development export diversification and access to wider markets in the services sector i am pleased to state that our interventions in information and communication technology ict have already produced significant results two local ict companies are providing telemarketing and data processing services to north american companies thereby opening up job opportunities for our skilled youth and generating foreign exchange actions to promote strategic exports mr speaker sir financial year 2002 03 is the second year of implementing the 5 year strategic export programme sep a total of sh52 5b was provided to promote the production processing and marketing of strategic exports we realise that many of these interventions will take time to generate the desired structural transformation in the economy however judging from the preliminary results i am confident that the interventions so far made by the government will boost exports since the launching of the strategic export programme in september 2001 46 million coffee seedlings have been distributed to 200 000 households while 16 wet coffee processing machines with the capacity to process 20 000 tonnes of coffee per annum have been imported in addition the government has initiated the organic coffee certification scheme for 16 000 farmers in the tea sub sector 300 000 improved clones were imported for multiplication and five million seedlings distributed to 1 300 farmers furthermore over 100 nursery operators have been trained 150 nurseries with a capacity of 9 million seedlings have been brought into operation and 500 hectares of tea estates have been rehabilitated an important area for public action is to support the high potential for further growth in horticultural exports government is therefore committed to quality improvement and to this end has trained 315 farmers in nursery management 35 farmers in export marketing and 10 exporters on how to approach and access the european union market in the fisheries sector lake surveillance control monitoring and enforcement of regulations have been intensified thus curbing the use of illegal fishing gear and the marketing of immature fish fish farming has been promoted with twenty water sources being stocked with three million fish fry construction of 4 fish landing sites in wakawaka in bugiri district kasensero in rakai district kasenyi in wakiso district and kiyindi in mukono district will start next financial year the national fisheries policy is being developed in line with the principles agreed with the east african community in an effort to further enhance the capacity of local ict companies to be competitive government has embarked on investing in building a one stop facility incubation centre that can be easily accessed by emerging ict companies as they build their capacity to operate independently in order to provide a transparent framework for these services a new ict policy has been developed in the coming financial year there will be special emphasis on value addition and enhancing the export of products such as honey we shall also continue to improve market infrastructure and skills and enforce standards the marketing and agro processing strategy maps has been developed to guide the provision of market information to farmers and traders to promote farmer organisations to introduce quality standards to promote post harvest technologies and to develop market infrastructure the uganda commodity exchange uce is already trading in grains and other agricultural commodities while a warehouse receipt system wrs bill is before cabinet these interventions will help in developing our export sector and in enhancing the ability of traders to access credit in addition the co operative movement is being revitalised and set to play a leading role in the mobilisation of savings and the provision to members of credit and agricultural production and marketing services efficient co operatives will be able to access resources mobilised by government for on lending to the private sector in the mineral sub sector government has provided a further sh1 6b during the current financial year in support of the ongoing petroleum exploration programme exploration activities in the semliki basin have

mubende district is processing gold in busia and producing vermiculite in wakiso district in addition the tororo cement plant has been fully rehabilitated with a production capacity of 1 000 tonnes per day during fy 2003 04 the value of mineral exports is projected to grow to us 71 0 mill from us 66 mill in 2002 strengthening the business environment in line with the medium term competitiveness strategy we are implementing measures to improve the national infrastructure strengthen the financial sector and the legal and regulatory framework and promote science and technology and higher education improving national infrastructure in the main roads sector the road sector development plan rsdp has been updated and covers the period up to financial year 2010 11 the signing of works

bombo road namungoona on hoima road and terminates at the busega roundabout for the first time flyovers will be introduced in the kampala road system the construction of natete road via bakuli mengo and wakaliga to nateete and the kampala gaba road will improve the flow of traffic in the city efficient railway links to the coast are important for our export drive in this regard progress has been made towards a joint concession to the private sector of the uganda kenya railway twenty four hour customs services for trantuted and excessive terminal handling charges for ugandan bound goods at mombasa port have been removed in the water sector reforms in the delivery of water services in the large urban towns through the national water and sewerage corporation have begun to bear fruit by the beginning of this financial year water service coverage in the large towns was 60 per cent up from 57 per cent in 2001 02 the target is to increase coverage to 65 per cent by june 2004 however the coverage provided by sewerage services is still very low in the 16 towns under the jurisdiction of the national water and sewerage corporation in 2003 04 government will consolidate these achievements through wider private sector participation in this sector the efficiency of our main electricity supply has continued to improve an international electricity firm took over the operations of the two hydro electric generation facilities at kiira and nalubaale this is a significant achievement in the reform of the energy sector a similar concession arrangement for the operations of the uganda electricity distribution company limited is under negotiation strengthening the financial sector mr speaker sir a strong financial sector is essential for supporting private investment in this regard the resolution of uganda commercial bank limited was a significant step the revision of the financial institutions statute was intended to further strengthen prudent regulation in this country and bring it into line with international best practice the recently enacted micro finance and deposit taking institutions act provides a regulatory framework for soundly managed and well capitalised micro finance institutions to mobilise deposits and thereby expand the pool of financial resources available to small entrepreneurs the implementation of the micro finance outreach plan will further strengthen the regulatory framework and capacity of this sector strengthening the legal and regulatory framework mr speaker sir the private sector requires a strong supportive legal and regulatory framework in this regard the reforms we have introduced in the commercial justice sub sector have started to yield results i am pleased to report that the average length of time taken to dispose of cases in the commercial court is now only six and a half months well below the target of ten months set by the sector the current average number of adjournments has also reduced substantially key areas in which improvements are needed to the regulatory framework include business registration and licensing tax administration and customs access to land and site development and labour market regulation government is committed to adopting in its laws and policy making processes the principle of regulatory best practice any laws proposed must be analysed in terms of their cost implications on business a well functioning labour market which reflects the right balance between job security and flexibility is pivotal to economic growth we are committed to reviewing the existing labour legislation that simultaneously provides for improved conditions and quality of employment as well as the creation of more job opportunities government will support the introduction of pragmatic and

iron fist has greatly minimized the capacity and ability of lord s resistance army lra to terrorise and cause havoc to the population in the north the army has been able to recover about 10 000 illegal guns from the karamojong at the same time government is vigorously pursuing peace initiatives wherever possible and has signed a peace agreement with unrf ii and integrated the forces into the

eliminated work is ongoing to reduce the case backlog in the chief magistrates courts currently numbering 20 000 cases public administration expenditure on public administration has continued to be a burden on the budget crowding out spending on other critical priority programmes currently expenditure on the sector is second only to education with an allocation of 17 7 per cent of the government budget there is a need to reduce the cost of public administration so that resources can be freed for use in other productive areas such as infrastructure and strategic exports in march this year h e

of utility bills continues to be a major problem government has now agreed on a concrete plan to implement a pre payment system for telephone services other utility providers have been advised to explore the options available to them for the introduction of prepayment systems in the interim accounting officers are expected to prepay for water and electricity services on a monthly basis the utility companies are at liberty to discontinue services to defaulting institutions mr speaker sir i am happy to report that during the next financial year we will start to implement the fiscal decentralisation strategy the strategy will be piloted in 15 local governments and will be rolled out to all governments by fy 2005 06 the number of conditional grants and the associated bank accounts

commend the efforts of the uganda revenue authority management and staff for meeting the domestic revenue target this financial year this made it possible for aggregate budget releases to be in line with the approved budget however reallocations were made during the year particularly to address security requirements necessitated by the situation in the north poverty action fund expenditures and those in other critical areas were protected from the impact of the reallocations and are projected to perform at close to 100 per cent of their provision domestic interest rates have been higher than budgeted due to higher than anticipated interest rates on treasury bills for the year this reinforces the need to reduce the fiscal deficit over the medium term as i have already indicated proposed revenue and expenditure for fy 2003 04 in the next fiscal year tax and non tax revenues collected by the uganda revenue authority are projected to increase by 19 per cent to sh1 655b of this amount sh79 7b is non tax revenue non tax revenues from all other sources will amount to sh35 7b bringing total domestic revenue to sh1 691b this is equivalent to 13 per cent of gdp in 2003 04 up from a projected performance of 12 1 per cent this year the estimate of tax revenue takes into account the measures that i will announce shortly to fill the resource gap of sh34 7b total government expenditures in the coming year will rise by 16 per cent to shs 3 154 bn the main components of which are sh1 733b for recurrent expenditure sh1 357b for development expenditure and sh45b for settling some domestic arrears the above expenditure represents 24 3 per cent of gdp as compared to the expected performance of 23 3 per cent this fiscal year the overall deficit excluding grants is projected at sh1 463b which is equivalent to 11 2 per cent of gdp the deficit will be financed with grants and highly concessional loans in line with the government s debt strategy grants consist of sh1 043b of which sh538b is budget support and sh505b is project support loans consist of sh480b of which sh200b is budget support and sh280b is project support total assistance from our development partners therefore amounts to sh1 523b which is equivalent to 48 per cent of total expenditure details on financing the deficit can be found in table i of this budget speech in fy 2002 03 the fiscal deficit fell from 13 1 percent to 11 1 percent of gdp and this level will be more or less maintained for fy 2003 04 further reduction of the fiscal deficit must be achieved over the medium term by

investment in human capital and the promotion of science and technology will make this possible mr speaker i must re emphasise the need to reduce the fiscal deficit gradually over time in relation to gdp for two main reasons first the large increase in the fiscal deficit in recent years has threatened the competitiveness of the private sector due to the impact that the financing of the deficit has had on interest rates the exchange rate and production costs second the increased dependency on donor aid reflected by the increase in the deficit has increased the vulnerability of our budget to aid fluctuations mr speaker sir private sector led growth combined with our desire to reduce dependency on donor aid requires that government improves the efficiency and effectiveness of its spending and with your support and co operation we are determined to see that this is achieved i highly commend this budget to you mr speaker sir and honourable members i beg to move for god and my country

world they have wrought to an affirmative alternate vision something more positive and more generative scores of post neoliberal ideas from worldviews to policy proposals bubble just below the surface of the everyday neoliberalism has long had its critics people who have argued against market fundamentalism and pointed out its systemic flaws but those critics have been moving closer to the heart of mainstream discussion for at least a decade the financial crisis of 2008 and the election of 2016 were major turning points since the ascendance of donald trump to the presidency and even amidst all of the deliberate crises that he and his administration have created or perhaps because of them our political debate has become a contest of innovative big ideas mostly but not exclusively on the progressive left some ideas that were considered laughable a few short years ago but are now part of day to day conversation most notably proposals for far higher wealth and capital taxation and ambitious public efforts to combat climate change or to expand public programs like free college and medicare are distinctly not neoliberal post neoliberals are beginning to break through this should provide some reassurance a new world is within our imaginative powers it is burbling around the academy economists think about power political scientists think about economics and neoliberalism has become both the bête noire and term of art in mainstream commentary everywhere the intellectual argument will and should continue it s fruitful with a healthy balance of productive agreement and also room for debate however now is the time to focus not only on ideas but also on strategy organizing and building the kinds of alliances that can develop into robust networks institutions and political power because with the world in crisis the urgent question is how we get from here to there on this front we can learn from the neoliberals themselves neoliberalism began in the late 1940s as a loosely organized intellectual philosophy rooted in economics but it gained power and salience only once the ideas took institutional forms in the 1960s and 70s as the ideology began to find a more popular voice it may have lost some intellectual cohesion and purity but it more than made up for that loss in the influence that comes from speaking effectively to different groups neoliberalism was no longer confined to 39 scholars 38 of them white men meeting at the hôtel du parc in mont pèlerin switzerland in 1947 or to the economics department at the university of chicago in the years shortly thereafter by the early 1970s neoliberal ideas were beginning to reach a broader cross section of americans white middle class homeowners executives at the u s chamber of commerce leaders of the nascent but growing evangelical jesus movement this is about more than political alliances although it is certainly that the diversity of the neoliberal coalition ultimately strengthened the ideology in the face of policy and even political failure neither contrary economic evidence nor electoral losses slowed neoliberalism down precisely because of the range and breadth of its institutional forms as we seek to build power for the post neoliberal ideology that is starting to emerge from thinkers we must now turn our attention to social and political groups and the institutional ways in which they structure our thinking about how the world currently works and how it ought to work this essay envisions the what and the how of a world beyond neoliberalism not just the ideas but also the politics and institutions of a world that remains just out of reach figuring out the ideas the politics and the institutions all at once is tough but we do not have the luxury of time today is our 1947 the time when neoliberalism was at its intellectual beginnings today though it is neoliberalism s critics and post neoliberalism s visionaries who are just starting to meet confer and organize in deliberate ways discussions about the shape and substance of a robust neoliberal alternative are fledgling but they are happening yet today is also our 1974 when neoliberalism began its march to political dominance now as then american culture is at war with itself and the core institutions of our politics the presidency the justice system are in turmoil the road ahead is perilous looking at the story of the neoliberal order s construction provides a road map the neoliberals were unlikely allies but in the end intellectuals movement leaders and politicians built common bonds and lasting institutions that allowed the neoliberal ideology to take power and to hold sway even after the economic ideas themselves lost explanatory and predictive power we can learn from their history neoliberalism beyond economics movement fuel we often use neoliberalism as a shorthand for conservative economics the idea that lower taxes and smaller government will lead to a vibrant private sector and better economic outcomes for all but neoliberalism really isn t just conservative economics it was and remains a shape shifting coalition that brought together strange but ultimately oddly compatible bedfellows in the 1980s some liberals like washington monthly founding editor charles peters also laid claim to the term but they meant it differently peters and his circle were centrist liberals neoliberalism s language social values neoliberalism speaks in a language rooted in values and a vision for society its central moral claim essential to its popular appeal was economic liberty this liberty focused form of freedom centered on an individual s right to contract and the importance of property ownership economic liberty was for neoliberals a precondition of all other more political freedoms this is not the only way of conceptualizing freedom consider the freedom of the abolition movement or women s liberation or franklin roosevelt s four freedoms and his economic bill of rights but it continues to dominate everyday thinking especially in the united states to an astonishing degree neoliberalism s vision for society made the market the prime organizing mechanism by privileging markets above all other institutions neoliberalism created a confusing and contradictory but ultimately extremely effective view of government on the one hand neoliberalism denigrates government anything that strays from market centrism is at best dismissed as inefficient and woolly headed and at worst demonized as collectivist socialism on the other hand neoliberalism is hardly anti state neoliberals as the historian quinn slobodian argues built their project by using the state to encase markets in order to protect them from democratic challenges this anti state strong state paradox is a powerful albeit perplexing element of the ideology the economic expression of neoliberalism s language came first certainly with the now famed 1947 gathering at mont pèlerin and the development of chicago school economics and the university of virginia branch in the subsequent years but neoliberalism became political movement fuel more than two decades after the mont pelerin society was founded neoliberalism s pivot and rise to power one important telling of neoliberalism s rise centers on keynesianism which by the early 1970s was struggling to explain the economy keynesians had no response to the oil shocks of 1973 and the resultant stagflation the consumer price index inflation nearing 10 percent by 1974 was likewise inexplicable the failure of keynesianism is certainly a key part of the story but the reality is more complicated the chaos of the late 1960s and early 1970s was not just economic it was all encompassing there was drastic change in race and gender roles and family norms in america s role in the world and in cherished political institutions all at once first and foremost the era was violent vietnam was wrenching and also begat violence at home at kent state in may 1970 the fact that upstanding midwestern college students could become radicalized was so shocking that ordinary americans told reporters that they were sorry the national guard didn t kill more before that was the assassination of martin luther king jr and the assassination of bobby kennedy violence was pervasive from january 1969 through mid 1970 the united states sustained 4 330 bombings resulting in 43 deaths racial suppression also led to violence the watts uprising or riots the description is debated in 1965 detroit in 1967 the changing racial order ignited backlash housing desegregation drove white flight school desegregation and busing drove massive resistance throughout the south virginia s elected officials closed schools rather than integrating them and violent resistance in cities from boston to new york at the same time the american presidency itself was under siege with the publication of the pentagon papers in 1971 america learned that two presidents lied about the vietnam war by 1974 we had watergate and the resignation of both spiro agnew and richard nixon in short by the early 1970s the world as americans knew it was coming apart this was especially so for a white middle class that had known lasting economic and social stability historian n d b connolly describes neoliberalism as white flight from liberalism the era was also destabilizing for black americans who had never known economic or social steadiness for many it must have felt like a revolution from within driven by the radicalization of their own children the civil rights movement was led by young men and women in their 20s the new left the weather underground and though it sounds quaint today boys with long hair girls with legally available contraception and sex education in the classroom these became central political issues for the emerging new right vestiges of which remain in the bitter fight over reproductive rights today part of what was going on was a fight over the fundamentals of american identity from vietnam to the disputes between parents and their children which americans could claim with certainty that their beliefs were right the counterstrategy focused in large part on the supercharging of traditional business and an economics that supported private business interests this adherents believed could be the bulwark against both economic chaos and social radicalism bringing peace and prosperity but also a reminder of stable enduring american values the 1971 powell memo one of the most famous conservative documents of its time makes this jumble of issues and perspectives economic social moral clear today most progressives remember the memo as a blueprint on how to save free enterprise capitalism but lewis powell s note to the education committee of the u s chamber of commerce was less about the economy and instead unusually attuned to social decay powell writes of left leaning students as revolutionaries communists who are attacking bank of america branches with fire bombs he frets that news stands at airports drugstores and elsewhere are filled with paperbacks and pamphlets advocating everything from revolution to erotic free love one finds almost no attractive well written paperbacks or pamphlets on our side in response he urges the chamber to organize which would be funded and led by the top management of blue chip businesses powell was not a republican but a traditional southern democrat and would soon become a swing vote on the supreme court hardly a movement conservative he was seeking order not counterrevolution but his thinking paralleled those farther right especially evangelical christians who were animated by the same combination of economic and social issues as lisa mcgirr masterfully describes activists who had once campaigned for barry goldwater as staunch anti communists often john birch society members were by the 1970s concerning themselves with domestic corruption obscenity sex education abortion were the new targets of attack for activists who had previously championed ayn rand and friedrich hayek and who equated the growth of the welfare state with socialism and socialism with communism neoliberalism s four faces take what you want leave the rest so by the 1970s the problem to be solved wasn t only inflation and it wasn t just the keynesianism that had plagued many at mont pèlerin the crux of the matter was the entire public minded governing philosophy ushered in by franklin roosevelt s new deal taxation regulation and expansion of social insurance the 1930s era government led economic recovery plan had by the 1970s combined with rights movements civil rights feminism the youth movement to encourage upheaval and ultimately violence abroad and more menacingly at home the neoliberal answer was to return to a form of traditional private sector stewardship of the economy that stewardship according to both lewis powell and movement conservative activists and evangelicals should be funded nurtured and shaped by movement organizations of all types including religious institutions that became megachurches with broadcasts reaching tens of millions of people as well as political actors like ronald reagan governor and movie star who could actually take power and build governmental institutions to suit their own pro business mindset the power of this alliance was that it enabled huge neoliberal inspired movement success even as neoliberal economics itself did more poorly than advertised ronald reagan s tax cuts for example were not successful on purely economic terms any economic boom from the 1980s was due to a range of factors including federal defense spending did not pay for themselves and in fact the reagan administration raised taxes from 1982 84 and in 1987 to make up for the fast growing federal deficit george h w bush raised taxes after famously promising not to in 1990 and bill clinton did so again in 1993 but the myths reagan the tax cutter and our greatest president tax cuts fueling growth continue it should also be noted that neoliberalism had plenty of empirical failures based even on its own predictions as mike konczal and katy milani note we saw less gdp growth an average of 2 5 percent as compared to 3 9 percent in neoliberalism s post 1980 heyday the top marginal tax rate cuts expounded by neoliberals don t lead to more growth but are correlated with an increase in the income share of the top 1 percent neoliberalism was supposed to help compete away racial discrimination in the labor market but income and wealth disparities by race have worsened since 1980 but in a take what you want leave the rest world of powerful alliances and institutions neoliberalism s shape shifting abilities made it sticky marketized thinking became part of both parties an evangelicalism that began in the 1960s as a way to welcome wayward barefoot youth back to christ became the prosperity gospel equating personal worth with financial success today evangelicals continue to vote overwhelmingly republican our nation s leading politicians our presidents from nixon to reagan to clinton racialized the notion of public welfare queens for example and ensured that white fear of black crime morphed into three strikes criminal justice laws and then into privatized prisons each piece of this can be traced back to neoliberalism s basic precepts but of course went far beyond what friedrich hayek milton friedman or lewis powell could have imagined what comes after the point of highlighting various modern forms of marketized thinking is not to indict all of the ills of modern conservatism indeed of contemporary mainstream politics under a single ideology it is however to remind us of the economic worldview roots of much that isn t obviously economic it is also to suggest that whatever comes after neoliberalism has to incorporate the role of political alliances institution building politicians and policy ideas into its form increasing strength academic disciplines idea generation and policies today it is post neoliberalism that is in an exciting almost out of the wilderness arguing with ourselves phase we agree on plenty the economic social and moral failure of market fundamentalism the need to resurrect democracy against domination and to understand the democracy fight and the economic fight as one and the same and the need for common values as part of our own statement of aims as was true for the neoliberals of 1947 we also have our own tensions are we in favor of more decentralization and community control the dakota pipeline fight 350 org or more centralized decision making green new deal industrial policy focused on the transformation of our energy grid should we focus on more worker democracy and ownership collectivists and network pragmatists or more modern sectoral and inclusive federal labor law a wagner act for the twenty first century the most important forward movement in the post neoliberal world is in fact in the economics profession itself a decade after the financial crisis laid bare the dysfunction of the entire global political economy a new generation of academic economists has grown to prominence organized by upstart networks like economists for inclusive prosperity and the washington center for equitable growth they are disdainful of neoliberalism s market fetishism using new economic tools and asking new questions this next generation of academics has systematically shown just how wrong neoliberalism s economic conservatism is this group of upstarts will undoubtedly face real obstacles in the mainstream of the profession but they are at the nation s leading research institutions and represent a new wave we are also seeing a much more creative contra neoliberal fusion of law and economics as articulated in law and political economy manifestos by some in the field this group of younger scholars begins with the presumption that law is the mediating institution that ties together politics and economics and if it continues to prioritize efficiency and treat it as a neutral value law will keep driving crises of economic social and racial inequality the thinking from these economists and lawyers is moving quickly to influence real world policy and political shifts a new focus on antitrust and monopolies in federal politics has democratic candidates on the left and in the middle railing against the strictures of the consumer welfare standard and calling for breaking up big tech industrial agriculture and pharmaceuticals some lawmakers are calling for public banking massive public investment in green infrastructure and publicly provided health insurance these are all post neoliberal proposals and they have become increasingly commonplace revolutions in the economic and legal academies are essential to building a better political economy and so of course are policies but if we are truly to move past the neoliberal era to build something new we must remember that although economics per se is always a central talisman of politics political ideologies stretch beyond economics and beyond economists and then gain real power neoliberalism s diverse allies stitched together a common underlying understanding about how the world works where prosperity comes from the role of individuals families markets and governments ultimately those shared beliefs grew and endured because they were reinforced and reproduced by day to day institutions practices and norms those are the transmission belts of ideological power pervasive weakness political institutions social norms today post neoliberals are just beginning to recognize themselves as such in that sense we are once again in 1947 but the political moment has all of the elements of 1970s chaos a morally hollow bankrupt presidency a movement of young people who don t hold the same basic understandings or beliefs systems as their parents a palpable political vacuum in both major political parties the desperate desire from all quarters for leadership and a way forward and threats of violence and domestic terror on the rise as the tectonic plates shift neoliberalism may have lost its explanatory and intellectual power and new thinking may in fact be rising that is a necessary step but it is not sufficient neoliberal institutions remain strong exactly where post neoliberal or at least non neoliberal institutions are weakest large profitable often extractive private corporations hold more market power than ever any hope of countering this with public power will first require digging out of a ditch decades in the making the court system from the supreme court on down holds to a doctrine that is clearly pro business and anti labor the department of justice antitrust division the federal trade commission ftc the federal communications commission the treasury department the department of commerce the u s trade representative the white house national economic council all of these government agencies and institutions are certainly in the trump administration neoliberal but even in previous administrations democrat and republican neoliberal beliefs about the primacy of the private sector and the secondary at best role of workers consumers and citizens dominated the consumer welfare standard held that only price and not worker well being community well being or long term investment matter in making merger and acquisition decisions split decision making power across the doj the ftc and a range of sector specific agencies department of transportation for airlines department of agriculture for livestock etc make for diffuse ineffective decision making and the five member ftc structure makes split voting and status quo outcomes the norm consumer voice and input is muted at best and worker and citizen voice is nonexistent outside of government progressive nonprofit organizations are growing and some especially economic policy groups are working in more alignment than ever before but large scale worker organizations including formal labor unions are on the ropes with membership at an all time low progressive legal organizations have made no progress in changing either jurisprudence or judicial selection further the social belief system of neoliberalism remains pervasive certainly newer thinkers do not have the institutional equivalent of evangelical churches which preach a capitalist gospel and at the same time drive turnout for conservative republicans still in many areas neoliberal beliefs prevail one of the most fundamental such beliefs concerns the social value of human beings as human capital as a result our schools certainly our most prevalent public institutions in every neighborhood working with tens of millions of american families every day focus on educational return on investment as heavily predicated on students lifetime earnings in the labor market similarly as wendy brown has argued our understanding of democratic politics and democratic participation per the citizens united supreme court decision presents speech as a capital right and political life and elections as marketplaces our neoliberal understanding of democracy and speech within a democracy is not about self rule or building the demos but about value enhancement in a competitive marketplace the argument here is not that post neoliberals need to mimic exactly what neoliberals did to gain power after all it s not clear that they had a road map that pointed from mont pèlerin to ronald reagan much less the crystal cathedral of the 1980s and today s network of evangelical megachurches but even as we continue to refine the economics and the political philosophy we must remember the importance of building social and institutional power we should be attentive to the not obviously economic vectors of change how we establish and fund our public schools or how we build regulatory institutions that serve the public these institutions shape our decisions and our very sense of what normal problem solving is in our political economy as this essay asserted at the outset today is both 1947 and 1974 our ideas are nascent and more exciting and interesting than they have been in at least a generation at the same time that our politics have gone up in flames we don t have the luxury of time that the mont pèlerins did can we build new institutions while we simultaneously sort out new ideas it is to put it mildly a tall order both of our biggest political institutions the democratic and republican parties have been neoliberal on both the right and left though right neoliberalism has presided over far more egregious outcomes for the last half dozen presidential administrations as long as anyone active in politics today can remember countering widely held beliefs and norms is no easy task post 2016 new progressive organizations seem to be on the rise we are building relationships networks and knowledge that could be anti neoliberal but we lack a language or even a name for what this movement as a whole might be or look like our campaigns remain single issue guns choice climate are still the ways in which we organize our political thinking and political practices even economic policy is reduced to a silo we do not as a movement know how to argue for basic structural changes in the conduct of politics itself and thus in how the economy is conceptualized and managed and we certainly do not have institutions that are practiced in so doing it is not clear what the new institutions will be but it is clear that we will need them imagine a pro public equivalent of the chamber of commerce which advocates not for a single industry but for business qua business consider the countervailing power of a multimillion member organization spending hundreds of millions annually in an organized fashion to advocate not on environmental or reproductive health or any other single issue but instead connecting those dots to argue for public focused structures for government itself perhaps some of the new networks like indivisible with thousands of local groups and millions of members or rev william barber s poor people s campaign will be able to work in concert with longer standing organizing networks perhaps they could even establish or work within physical places where people of faith or shared values can gather the values piece of course is essential for these organizations and their leaders to truly counteract neoliberalism they must share a common moral understanding of our economy our society and the role of an active government in our politics government institutions matter too when franklin roosevelt built the new deal he started more than 100 new government agencies today that is startling some of roosevelt s institutions have disappeared into the mists of time the federal theater project the civilian conservation corps but some remain the national labor relations board the securities and exchange commission the federal communications commission how will we use or remake existing government entities and what will our new institutions be for new ideas to take root they need institutions within which to grow and flourish therefore we need to be imaginative in our institution building and two principles should guide us first privilege human beings and human well being not markets per se and actually not government per se either it is less about whether our new ideas are socialist or capitalist but we would do well to remember that the 1940s neoliberals began with moral assertions about economic freedom as a precondition or perhaps more inspiring to us the civil rights movement began with a fundamental assertion both economic and political both human and moral every person has worth value and dignity that animating value and a network of churches within which that value could grow changed history second any new institutions must be alert to the realities of power the importance of countervailing power and of stewarding power well politics after all is about power at its core neoliberal intellectuals tried to assume away power and built an entire discipline and way of thinking that competes power away but neoliberal real world actors used that as a vacuum to build vast institutional networks that are about nothing but power the chamber of commerce the american legislative exchange council americans for prosperity while at the same time marketizing government such that most of its decisions are made in the service of private actors large corporations with armies of lobbyists rather than in the public good to get better economic and social outcomes government simply must be structured to do its job and led by people who understand what that job is and don t act as handmaidens for an increasingly rent seeking corporate sector post neoliberals must put people at the heart of their endeavor and we must build institutions of our own that contest for power rather than seek some mythical middle from the outset the world at large is still neoliberal because of that any middle is going to start from within a markets first framework and any outcome will therefore subsume common good government action within marketized policy mechanisms subsidies vouchers and tax credits which we know are all neoliberal and insufficient in terms of delivering actual results our new institutions and the norms embedded within them should begin with realities of challenging for power and not a not red america not blue america but one america ideal that sounds terrific but ends up when legislation is actually on the table negotiating against itself stewarding power well is essential but imagining that it does not exist is naïve and ultimately foolish in the end the ideas did come first for neoliberals as we build a post neoliberal world the ideas framework has already come before any genuine institution building we must continue to sharpen those ideas and ensure that they become a common and commonly understood language we are on the cusp of new vernacular that vernacular should drive institutions because institutions provide the day to day within which ideas are tested normalized and passed on the core power of ideas as hewlett foundation president larry kramer has noted isn t to be right or wrong it is to tilt the playing field for or against certain claims by this light a post neoliberal world is already dawning it is time to turn to strategy organizing and building the kinds of friendships networks alliances and institutions that will make these ideas real
article 3 months old commodities jun 11 2019 richard rick mills ahead of the herd as a general rule the most successful man in life is the man who has the best information the season for gold gold was riding high last monday on bad news regarding the us economy causing stocks to fall and wall street traders to pile into bullion us markets were choppy on the first trading day after june 1 when the united states increased the tariff on 200 billion of chinese imports from 10 to 25 shares of the so called faang stocks slumped pulling the s p 500 and the dow with them after media reports that the department of justice is weighing actions against google and apple and the federal trade commission said it wants to conduct a probe against facebook for improper use of data roller coaster dow jones contributing to the jitters was a white paper from china published over the weekend that blamed the us for escalating the trade war ie imposing 25 tariffs following an accusation that china backtracked on commitments agreed to earlier the u s government accusation of chinese backtracking is totally groundless it is common practice for both sides to make new proposals for adjustments to the text and language in ongoing consultations the white paper read in the previous more than 10 rounds of negotiations the u s administration kept changing its demands it is reckless to accuse china of backtracking while the talks are still under way us president trump responded that the tariffs on china are working with chinese firms leaving the country to avoid paying tariffs no visible increase in inflation and the us taking billions the imf showed that the billions in tariffs are actually being paid by us companies not chinese firms as trump has argued he also accused china of subsidizing its industries to help them cope with the trade war all the uncertainty was enough to propel gold to a two month high as of last monday the precious metal was holding at 1 324 38 a climb of nearly 43 since may 1 when gold finished at 1 281 40 the price was helped by a 0 1 point drop in the us dollar index since may 31 the index has dropped over a full point from 98 12 to the current 97 06 gold and the usd normally move in opposite directions there are plenty of other reasons to believe we are heading into a summer exploration season backstopped by some very bullish signs for gold this article gets into the nitty gritty of each and concludes that now is a very good time to be owning promising junior gold stocks as a wager on rising gold prices and some spectacular drill results forward looking indicators the first reason is a set of forward looking indicators that show the us economy has all but stopped growing from the 3 2 it managed in the first quarter the pmi the ism

pmi figure 50 2 the cleanest of the dirty shirts germany japan and china were all lower the finance publication notes that orders for durable goods like cars and appliances have steadily ticked down since december and have shown no growth for three months in a row the pmis for us services and manufacturing in may were the lowest since recessionary 2009 after the data was released gdp forecasts

on monday by the institute for supply management its manufacturing index read 52 1 in april weaker than consensus forecasts which expected 53 readings above 50 are seen as a sign of economic growth zero hedge notes that the 52 1 figure was the weakest since october 2016 despite a kick of new export orders and employment the fact that three of five ism components production inventories and supplier deliveries declined is a worrying sign that stagflation is looming when unemployment and inflation both rise and economic growth falls no trade deal the lack of a trade deal between the us and china of course it s what scaring everybody into thinking that we could be in for a long protracted jag of protectionism china s president xi jinping said as much when he compared the current conflict to the long march of 1935 and urged citizens to prepare for hardship kitco quotes scotiabank saying a bigger move in gold will occur when the market digests a no trade deal scenario whereby global growth continues to fall inflation rates rise equities weaken and the risk of a recession increases the widening cold war accelerated with a no trade deal now the base case after huawei was blacklisted tariffs were upped and china continues to retaliating most recently with weaponizing rare earths we are in a sustained global economic us vs them war see copper note which goes into more detail with dire implications for both global growth now and inflation later scotiabank commodity strategist nicky shiels wrote in a macro update last week the us president isn t helping matters by his erratic careless messaging that is putting the country at odds with its so called allies on monday trump kicked off a state visit to the united kingdom by calling london s mayor a stone cold loser after mayor sadiq khan said trump is one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat to liberal democracy from the far right trump ended last week by impetuously threatening mexico with 5 tariffs on june 10 if moves are not made to stem migrants from central america cnn business noted that mexico is now the united states largest trading partner and that the tax on imports would affect just about every sector of the american economy including autos electronics oil food products and appliances yield curve inversion in may the yield curve between 10 year and 3 month treasury notes re inverted after dipping in march into negative territory for the first time since 2007 marketwatch reported the yield on the 10 year note fell to 2 402 below the 3 month note s 2 406 yield an inverted 10 year 3 month yield curve is a reliable recession indicator the yield curve is the difference in returns between short term and long term bonds the curve has been inverted since may 23 the yields on long term treasury bills are getting worse they should be much higher than short term notes because investors demand a higher interest rate for holding bonds long term on monday the yield on the 10 year note fell below 2 07 the lowest in 20 months while the 30 year bond also slumped to 2 53 forbes quotes an economist at moody s analytics saying that the yield curve inversion spells bad news ahead for the us economy generally the yield curve inverts when investors are worried about the long term outlook of the economy said deritis most economists say an inverted yield doesn t cause a recession but reflects negative sentiment about growth meanwhile in canada which takes its cues from the us economy the yield curve on government bonds inverted the most since 2007 on worries that trump s threat to impose tariffs on mexican imports could mean the demise of the new nafta agreement ten year bond yields last friday fell five basis points to 1 51 and 17 points below the three month notes trade war with europe the us federal reserve pays close attention to the yield curve as it is a measure of investors confidence in the economy the fed had planned to raise interest rates this year on the strength of a growing economy but has since backed off considering the negative outlook for global growth and concerns over the us economy now the fed is watching bond yields to see if a further yield curve inversion will drag the dollar down which would be good for gold prices a little out of left field morgan stanley thinks it s not the us china trade dispute investors should be paying attention to but a looming trade conflict with the european union that could seriously dent the economy the trump administration was planning on slapping a 25 tariff on european car imports on may 18 but has deferred a decision for six months the morgan stanley analysts said in a report that a trade war with europe would cause so much economic pain it would force the fed to lower interest rates to juice growth as for the fed its board of governors is hinting that a potential rate cut is being considered as a way to bolster a flagging economy the new york times states if the incoming data were to show a persistent shortfall in inflation below our 2 percent objective or were it to indicate that global economic and financial developments present a material downside risk to our baseline outlook officials would take that into account in assessing whether interest rates should continue to remain unchanged the fed s vice chairman richard clarida said during a speech in new york on thursday depression analog in fact some would say the fed is downplaying a far greater risk to the economy heralded by the disturbing yield curve inversion and the trade war which appears to escalate by the week clive maund states in an editorial that what is going on now is very similar to what went down in the 1930 s with protectionism trade wars and then depression leading to a major war maund thinks a war between the us and iran is the most likely scenario given the neo conservative alliance with israel we agree with the first part and that iran is certainly a powder keg but the drama will be contained a more regional rather than global affair at ahead of the herd we prefer to place our bets on a military confrontation with china which certainly by the trump administration is seen as the enemy other authors agree over at project syndicate economics professor nouriel roubini argues that china and the us are gradually moving towards war maybe not a hot war although the constant tensions in the south china sea suggest otherwise but likely a cold war which is what historically happens when an emerging power china confronts an established power the us something called the thucydides trap what started as a trade war now threatens to escalate into a permanent state of mutual animosity this is reflected in the trump administration s national security strategy which deems china a strategic competitor that should be contained on all fronts flashpoint taiwan we have written extensively on the tensions between the us and china in the south china sea where china holds historical claims despite international treaties to the contrary ie the un convention on the law of the sea ongoing maneuvers in the south china sea demonstrate that beijing is willing to flex its muscles in a region it sees as strategically and economically important china has been dredging seabed and building islands on which it has constructed outposts including missile batteries despite claims of ownership by vietnam malaysia philippines taiwan and brunei in 2016 steve bannon president donald trump s former chief strategist declared that there was no doubt in his mind that the us would go to war with china in the south china sea in the next five to 10 years there s also taiwan the united states supplies weapons to taiwan despite not having diplomatic relations with the island and its government china sees taiwan as a breakaway territory that must be re united with the chinese mainland its independence is not recognized by beijing a forced annexation of taiwan to china would almost certainly cause a war between china and the us the americans would never allow taiwan a key tentacle of us influence to be overtaken by the chinese yet that is exactly what beijing appears willing to go to war over shao yuanming a senior official of the people s liberation army reportedly said after a speech by acting us defense secretary patrick shanahan that china would defend its sovereignty over taiwan should anyone ie the us try to keep it separate from the mainland china will have to be reunified shao said on saturday if anybody wants to separate taiwan from china the chinese military will protect the country s sovereignty at all costs the next day defense minister wei fenghe equated president lincoln s efforts to prevent the secession of the union during the civil war to china s approach to taiwan it sees the island as integral to its territory bloomberg reported american friends told me that abraham lincoln was the greatest american president because he led the country to victory in the civil war and prevented the secession of the u s wei said on sunday at the shangri la dialogue a security conference in singapore the u s is indivisible so is china china must be and will be reunified tensions over taiwan have escalated in recent months with the us regularly sailing warships through the taiwan strait gold backed asian currency china has recently taken steps towards moving away from the us dollar as the world s reserve currency in may 2018 the country launched a shanghai based oil futures contract denominated in the national currency the yuan or renminbi and backed by gold the oil futures contract would be a way for oil producers like saudi arabia to circumvent the us petrodollar which derives much of its value by being the currency used to buy and sell oil currency observers say the oil futures contract is a way for china to challenge the petrodollar and to set the stage for the yuan as the world s dominant currency later in 2018 china announced that it signed a cross border pact with russia to work out a new payments system the idea being that national currencies could be used in bilateral trade to cut out the us dollar and thereby allow russia to bypass us sanctions and china to get around us tariffs the malaysian prime minister has taken this idea a step further in suggesting a common asian currency presumably similar to the euro of the european union last week prime minister mahathir mohamad said common currency for east asia could be pegged to gold and used for settling imports and exports though not for domestic transactions the concept was a reaction to what mohamad said was the manipulation of local currencies by external factors and came on the heels of a statement by the trump administration that included malaysia among nine countries to watch for currency manipulation peak gold at ahead of the herd among the reasons we like gold as an investment is that gold companies are finding less of it last month anglogold ashanti announced plans to sell its last remaining gold mine in south africa the mponeng mine southwest of johannesburg due to ore depletion we are now facing peak gold where gold production from here on will keep falling the experts agree the industry is seeing a significant slowdown in the number of large deposits being discovered it used to be that major gold miners were looking at 5 million ounce projects to buy and develop now they d be happy with a million ozs in the ground one of the most well respected ceos in the industry mark bristow who headed randgold before it merged with barrick remarked on the tight gold supply in a recent interview with the northern miner asked to comment on how the gold industry could look in five to 10 years bristow had this to say the industry is in decline we ve got ourselves into a really tight spot because we haven t invested in exploration and our future now when you look at the average life of mine it s less than the time it takes to discover and develop a world class asset the supply side of our industry is very tight the demand side and i disagree with some of the talk presenters here today in that gold is an inelastic industry just like everything else when we overdid the hedging and dumped twice as much gold into the market that we were actually producing the gold price went to us 255 an ounce we stopped doing it and it started going up the chinese started buying gold and it went even further then all we did is we took lower and lower grades and produced more and more gold and we put a roof a ceiling on the gold price and we ve driven it down since then to a point now where we are staring at tightening in the market conclusion the result as we see it has to be continuing strength in the gold price with major producers like anglogold ashanti seeing the end of gold mining in south africa a lack of discoveries in recent years and as bristow points out the length of time needed to build a gold mine these days being longer than the time it takes to mine it out that s really something when you think about it the lives of gold mines have become so short it takes longer to discover one and put it into production than the time from the onset of mining to closure combine these supply factors with the demand side reasons for owning gold right now to recap they include the series of economic indicators showing that us growth is grinding to a halt worsening yield curve inversion a potential trade spat with europe waiting in the wings as the us china trade war appears no closer to a resolution and the increasing tension between china and the us over taiwan and the south china sea raising the possibility of war and a flight to safe havens like gold and you have all the makings of

deputy governor ben broadbent reiterated that brexit is the major risk to growth in inflation outlook in a treasury select committee hearing he noted the outlook for both growth and inflation will depend significantly on the nature and timing of eu withdrawal in particular the new trading arrangements between the eu and the uk whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth how households businesses and financial markets respond and the balance of these effects on demand supply and the exchange rate broadbent also pointed out the may inflation report was conditioned to market path of bank rate rising only 25bps over the three year forecast horizon but were the economy to develop in line with our projection and taking as given other asset prices in the forecast interest rates would probably have to rise by a little more than what was in the curve at the time of the forecast policymaker michael saunders warned no deal brexit would probably have a significant adverse effect on the uk s long term growth prospects because of reduced openness to international trade in both goods and services and the resultant deterioration in the attractiveness of the uk as a global business location saunders also noted the major external risk is that the ongoing trade tensions could escalate further with successive rounds of retaliation hence undermining business confidence and growth on a wide scale the uk as a highly globalized economy would suffer through various channels including effects on exports investment and asset prices eu reiterates no brexit renegotiation even with new uk

beijing china s exports unexpectedly returned to growth in may despite higher us tariffs but imports fell the most in nearly three years in a further sign of weak domestic demand that could prompt beijing to step up stimulus measures some analysts suspected chinese exporters may have rushed out shipments to the united states to avoid new tariffs on us 300 billion of goods that president donald trump is threatening to impose in a rapidly escalating trade dispute but monday s better than expected export data is unlikely to ease fears that a longer and costlier us china trade war may no longer be avoidable pushing the global economy towards recession china s may exports rose 1 1 per cent from a year earlier compared with market expectations for a modest decline customs data showed we expect export growth to remain positive in june likely supported by continued front loading of us bound exports but it should then tumble in the third quarter when we expect the threatened tariffs to be imposed economists at nomura said in a note to clients therefore we believe beijing will likely step up its stimulus measures to stabilise financial markets and growth business distortions related to april s cut in the value added tax vat may also have eased helping export readings the nomura economists added analysts polled by reuters had expected may shipments from the world s largest exporter to have fallen 3 8 per cent from a year earlier after a contraction of 2 7 per cent in april while china is not as dependent on exports as in the past they still account for nearly a fifth of its gross domestic product trade tensions between washington and beijing escalated sharply last month after the trump administration accused china of having reneged on promises to make structural changes to its economic practices mr trump on may 10 slapped higher tariffs of up to 25 per cent on us 200 billion of chinese goods and then took steps to levy duties on all remaining us 300 billion chinese imports beijing retaliated with tariff hikes on us goods mr trump has said he expects to hold a meeting with chinese president xi jinping at a g 20 leaders summit late this month but analysts such as capital economics believe the chances of a lasting trade deal are receding as both sides appear to be digging in for a long battle trade sanctions are spreading from goods to services capital economics noted last week with china issuing a warning to citizens about risks of travelling in the us and american lawmakers pushing to tighten visas for chinese students damage from the trade war along with a broader softening in global demand will make 2019 the worst year for trade since the financial crisis a decade ago with only 0 2 per cent growth according to economists at ing china s trade surplus with the us a major irritant for washington widened to a four month high of us 26 89 billion in may from us 21 01 billion in april monday s data showed exports to the us fell at a more moderate pace of 4 2 per cent after dropping 13 2 per cent in april while china s imports of us goods declined 26 8 per cent from a year earlier china s may imports were much weaker than expected falling 8 5 per cent the sharpest drop since july 2016 that left the country with a trade surplus of us 41 65 billion for the month analysts had forecast imports would fall 3 8 per cent reversing an expansion of 4 per cent in april which some had suspected was related to the reduction in the vat highlighting sluggish demand imports of copper fell the red metal is widely used in construction electrical goods and manufacturing and is considered a bellwether for the health of an economy for january may china s total exports rose just 0 4 per cent from a year earlier while imports declined 3 7 per cent as trade pressures intensify analysts believe china will loosen policy further in months ahead to shore up economic growth investors are also watching to see how much beijing allows the yuan to weaken to offset higher us tariffs the tightly managed currency has depreciated nearly 3 per cent against the us dollar since trade tensions flared in early may and is nearing a closely watched support level analysts do not expect a surprise devaluation from china like one in 2015 which could risk capital outflows and further angering washington but some believe more yuan weakness is inevitable if the trade war drags on separate data on monday showed china s foreign exchange reserves rose unexpectedly in may suggesting the central bank has intervened only lightly to cushion the recent fall in the yuan the central bank has cut banks reserve requirements rrr six times since early 2018 and guided some interest rates lower while urging banks to lend more and keeping ample amounts of liquidity in the banking system a growing number of analysts believe it could cut benchmark interest rates in the event of a full blown trade war especially if the us federal reserve eases policy first beijing also has leaned more heavily on fiscal stimulus than in past downturns possibly due to high levels of debt left over from past credit sprees it has fast tracked infrastructure projects cut taxes for companies and raised export tax rebates the economy has yet to get back on firm footing however reuters
fed running out of time and conventional weapons the buy and hold mantra from wall street carnival barkers should have died decades ago after all just buying stocks has gotten you absolutely crushed in china for more than a decade and in japan you have been buried under an avalanche of losses for the last three decades and even in the good old usa you wouldn t want to just own stocks if the economy was about to enter another deflationary recession depression like 2008 likewise you wouldn t want to own any bonds at all in a high inflation environment as we had during the 70s the truth is that the mainstream financial media is for the most part clueless and our fed is blatantly feckless the fed has gone from claiming in late 2018 that it would hike rates another four times to now saying that it is open to actually start cutting rates very soon my friend john rubino who runs the show at dollarcollapse com recently noted bad debts are everywhere from emerging market dollar denominated bonds to italian sovereign debt chinese shadow banks us subprime auto loans and us student loans all are teetering on the edge i would add that the banking system of europe is insolvent look no further than deutsche bank with its massive derivatives book which is the 15th largest bank in the world and 4th biggest in europe its stock was trading at 150 pre crisis but it has now crashed to a record low 6 90 today if this bank fails look for it to take down multiple banks around the globe the us is in bad shape and there is little doubt about it but the nucleus of the next crisis does not have to emanate from america i find it incredible that so many people ignore the melting down nuclear reactors around the world china s factory data shows that the nation s manufacturing sector is now contracting china s national bureau of statistics released official manufacturing pmi for the month of may which fell to 49 4 from 50 1 in april south korean gdp shrank in q1 by 0 4 in case you were not aware south korea and copper prices both have phds in the global economy copper for its use in construction and korea for its production of semiconductors both are highly sensitive to economic activity and both are crashing here is one example as to why the fed is so deathly afraid of a recession wisdom tree and factset did a study on zombie companies they are defined as those with current trailing 12 month interest expenses that exceed the average of the past three years of earnings before interest and taxes that number is now just under 23 which is much higher than the 13 rate that what was evident in 2007 just prior to the great recession to put this in perspective nearly 1 4 of firms in the russell 2000 don t even make enough money to service their debt much less pay back the debt as economic growth begins to slow sharply interest rates on high yield debt will start to rise and zombie companies will get shut out of the credit market if they cannot service the debt they go bankrupt and close the doors as these companies lay off their workforce the economy will slow further and that will push junk bond yields higher this will cause more companies to go belly up and increase the unemployment rolls creating a death spiral of debt defaults rising unemployment and crashing junk bond prices soaring yields a recession depression would be virtually guaranteed given the record amount of corporate debt there s 5 4t worth bbb junk leveraged loans outstanding compared to 1 5 trillion sub prime mortgages in 2007 this means the eps on the s p 500 may not be anywhere close to the ridiculous 186 projected for 2020 don t forget s p 500 earnings dropped by over 80 in the last recession crashing eps will most definitely pop the equity bubble and stock prices should fall more than 50 there will also be a rising strain on government transfer payments welfare unemployment food stamps which will cause deficits to explode well north of 2 trillion per annum now let s discuss the yield curve yes it does matter and no it s not different this time the spread that most matters in the world of the yield curve is the 10year minus fed funds this is because of something called negative carry the current spread between the 10year and fed funds rate is minus 30bps if shadow banks were to borrow money overnight to invest in longer duration assets they would be losing money on each trade hence they stop borrowing causing money supply growth to dry up quickly at that point banks profits and the economy contract at a faster pace in reality it doesn t matter why the curve inverts the effect is the same so don t believe the perma bulls when they tell you the curve has inverted for technical reasons and therefore it is different this time it matters a lot especially to the fed the fed funds futures market is now pricing in 3 4 rate cuts over the next 12 months it is the market that tells the fed when it is time to cut rates because of the inverted yield curve the fed s comparable minuscule intellectual capacity has no possible ability to compete with the market s collective wisdom about where the economy is heading that s why we don t need a central bank at all especially one that has inserted itself into markets to such a degree that it has now supplanted them entirely the salient question is will the coming rate cut s be enough to pull the us out of its march towards recession and does it also save china japan korea and the rest of the maimed global economies around the globe and does it also rescue the european banking system as well the answer is no what the global economy really needs to perpetuate the growth illusion is a resolution to all the trade wars along with rate cuts and another massive qe to re inflate faltering asset prices in conclusion here is a recent a quote from fed chair powell offering more evidence that the fed and every other central bank on the planet are simply slaves to the stock market and headed firmly down the path towards creating a condition of global stagflation perhaps it is time to retire the term unconventional when referring to tools that were used in the crisis we know that tools like these are likely to be needed in some form in future effective lower bound elb spells which we hope will be rare elb spells are central bank speak for when rates are brought down to zero percent and stay there for a decade they will need to not openly go back into qe but then even find new ways to get a massive amount of money directly into the hands of consumers therefore the fed will be forced to once again try to bail out the economy and stock market later this year however it only has 225 bps of easing left before the elb is reached it is most probable that the fed is already too late and also does not have enough conventional weapons to stave off a depression in markets and the economy that is why before too long we will have to deal with the unconventional weapons of universal basic income helicopter money and negative nominal interest rates the chances of this leading to a viable solution to markets and the economy is less than the level

singapore most asia pacific economies may not resort to fiscal stimulus unless a full blown trade war between the united states and china comes to pass say economists last week china indicated that it has tremendous room for monetary and fiscal adjustment if trade tensions worsen but although manufacturing figures have weakened across the region fiscal moves have been taken mainly by markets closer to the trade war such as south korea for others monetary loosening may suffice for now policy makers began taking a more accommodative policy stance even before the recent trade war escalation noted asean 3 macroeconomic research office chief economist khor hoe ee who does not expect fiscal moves to be on the cards for now most regional economies continue to be in the mid phase of the business cycle and close to long term trend in the credit cycle there is thus generally no need for major stimulus measures at this juncture as the current policy mix is broadly appropriate malaysia and the philippines have already cut their policy rates china and the philippines have also cut reserve requirements for banks last tuesday the reserve bank of australia cut its official cash rate for the first time in almost three years economists at uob global economics and markets research expect bank indonesia to possibly join the rate cutting cycle in the second half of this year dbs economists expect the us to make rate cuts of 25 basis points each in september and december to be explained as insurance against global market risks and chronically below target inflation in a may report deutsche bank economists considered the likely policy responses of emerging asia economies in the case of an all out trade war if the us slaps a 25 per cent tariff rate on remaining china imports a decision likely to be made by the end of this month they expect monetary stimulus to be applied in most economies with the asean countries likely to rely more on monetary policy than on fiscal policy to support growth in contrast given their relatively low policy rates developed asian economies are likely to rely more heavily on fiscal stimulus given their stronger fiscal health they added but things could change if trade tensions continue to take a toll and certainly if talks sour said maybank kim eng senior economist chua hak bin we expect more governments and central banks across asia to introduce stimulus measures and ease monetary policy as the us china trade war takes its toll on growth and exports asean governments with the fiscal space should accelerate their infrastructure build up and boost public investment with falling global interest rates governments can tap lower financing costs for capital expenditure he added to support exporters specifically governments could look at moves such as income tax rebates lower trade financing costs and more generous tax deductions for machinery and equipment investments he said regional exporters that have been particularly hard hit include taiwan and south korea in both markets the purchasing managers index a leading indicator for new export orders has been in contractionary territory for at least nine months dbs group research economist ma tieying said both economies have room to expand fiscal policy given that government debt levels are not high at 30 to 40 per cent of gross domestic product and sovereign rating profiles are sound south korea unveiled a 6 7 trillion won s 7 86 trillion supplementary budget in april to shore up the economy at its may monetary policy board meeting bank of korea governor lee ju yeol emphasised the importance of policy coordination on the fiscal front citi economists marie kim and yoon jeeho noted while singapore s manufacturing figures have slumped the domestic economy remains robust said dr khor still against a worrying external backdrop the trade war an already maturing tech cycle and brexit uncertainties he does see scope for fiscal policy to mitigate the impact on local exporters or other firms affected by the trade conflict some temporary and targeted fiscal measures such as corporate income tax rebates or greater capital expenditures would be supportive he said the uob economists named singapore among the asian economies that are in a fiscally strong position to implement countercyclical policies if needed maybank s dr chua believes that singapore will likely respond in the event of a full blown trade war as the risk of a recession would be high he suggested that singapore introduce a targeted trade war stimulus package this could include financial support for export industries especially small and medium sized enterprises ready lines for trade financing incentives to attract multinationals as parts of supply chains shift towards asean and relaxed mortgage loan to value rules noting that mortgage growth has nearly ground to a halt since last july s tightening measures he said there is probably room to ease some of the housing financing rules without significant risk to the property market or financial stability

yesterday it s not risk off that trump did not put into effect tariffs that were only threatened i e maintaining the status quo it s actually more risk on because the last minute flip flop demonstrates all too well that this guy is erratic impulsive and cannot be trusted he can threaten to re impose the tariffs at any moment if he is not satisfied with mexican actions all too likely because the migration control task is beyond mexican capabilities or for no reason that anyone else can see and this is on top of the disconnect of trade tariffs an economic basic and national security immigration something shared with the spineless congress this is the context in which it doesn t matter one whit whether senate republican objections to the mexico tariffs had anything to do with the cancellation in addition what did the plubs give to trump in return for a temporary cancellation if objections had nothing to do with the cancellation why are the plubs in control of the senate it doesn t get any worse than this this is truly the worst case scenario risk aversion should be soaring not retreating now on to the fed and its expected rate cuts yesterday important fund manager gundlach tweeted he sees four rate cuts this year in contrast today we have important goldman sachs economist hatzius saying although it is a close call we still expect the to keep the funds rate unchanged in the remainder of the year oh for heaven s sake let s note that if the slowdown in the economy is truly severe rate cuts of any number are not going to prop up the stock market indefinitely besides goldman is presumably thinking about a normal fed leadership relying on normal economic analysis not factoring in that if the fed declines to cut rates and pdq trump is going to fire powell or worse conditions are not normal we have three things to figure out first does the fed have a sound basis to cut in the form of a deflationary threat second what other effects will trump s meddling bring about if he fires powell it s one thing if he fires the whole board it s something else and if he abolishes the fed by executive order it s a whole other can of worms don t think trump wouldn t do any of these things there is no limit to the outrageous things trump is perfectly capable of doing he started with dismissing mccain as no war hero this from a draft dodger once he got away with that it s no stretch to abolishing the fed which brings us to the third thing what is the effect of rate cuts on the dollar we made a mistake sticking to the normal scenario that has the currency with the yield advantage winning in the end once the relative ate of change is absorbed after all the only reason to prefer a currency with a negative interest rate rate of return is if you think its currency is going to appreciate up to now we had no reason to suppose sterling or the euro had the economic chops or political conditions to appreciate the uk faces a hard brexit and the eurozone has italy acting like the maverick in a spaghetti western but the uk and eurozone are starting to look like paragons of stability and sensibility in comparison to the us we can understand the yen and the swiss franc getting the safe haven bid negative returns notwithstanding but the pound and or the euro well if the us falls farther down the trump rabbit hole yes we need to widen our perspective to the circumstances under which a currency with a high yield persists in falling despite the advantage we have plenty of instance throughout history nigeria for example has very high rates and a lousy currency because confidence in the capability and honesty of the government and economic integrity is terribly low rock bottom in fact and nigeria has oil back before there was a eurozone many of us remember high yields in greece that us fund managers basked in but zero liquidity to get out of the darn paper or the currency once the drachma was in the process of being devalued you could drive a truck between the drachma bid and offer we also say the us is hardly nigeria or greece but trump is rapidly trying to turn the us into a tinpot dictatorship in fact the most trump recent attack on the fed sounds all too much like erdogan s attacks on the turkish central bank only a few months ago we are required by professional standards to review the inflation deflation material and other aspects of the near term outlook for financial conditions and the economy but let s be honest and admit that much of it is a fruitless exercise when trump can smash conventional analysis to smithereens on a whim about that inflation outlook the fed is getting some evidence from the ny fed that inflation expectations are continuing to fall the ny fed s survey of consumer expectations shows respondents expect price pressures rising but at a slower pace one year out inflation should be up only 0 25 less than the public expected in april this survey group also expects their incomes not to rise the wsj reports other measures of expected inflation are also softening for example the market based five year five year forward inflation expectation rate has been below 2 since early may signaling investors and others are losing confidence price pressures will be moving higher to make matters worse actual inflation has weakened this year rather than picked up as officials had expected in march the fed s preferred price pressure gauge the personal consumption expenditures price index was up 1 5 from a year ago and by 1 6 with food and energy factors taken out so far the fed can live with naming the absence of price pressure as temporary ny fed gov williams said so only last week and the dallas fed has a measure trimmed mean pce that was up 2 in march matching the fed s target that brings the tipping point down to the job market as noted above the number of new openings is now higher than the number of unemployed although we continue to think there is a vast pool of unemployed not being counted as available in the participation rate metric but the numbers show 7 449 million jobs available and only 5 824 million job seekers in april the wsj reports the number of openings increased across education retail and construction and outnumbered the unemployed by 1 625 million in april the largest gap on records back to 2000 the only way to get those secret workers out of the shadow economy and into the official workforce is to raise wages and that s simply not happening nor likely to cutting interest rates might be nice temporarily for the stock market but does nothing to boost wages bottom line it s altogether possible that despite the yield advantage albeit a contracting one the dollar loses its status as top dog because of trump confidence in the system that issues a currency is a necessity the dollar is not like any other currency in the world because of its reserve currency and trade numeraire status trump is in the process of destroying that confidence we have been wondering ever since his election at what point sentiment against trump would manifest itself it has been ironic that the dollar thrives when the country s leader is incompetent on the whole markets ignore politics until the politics threaten the status quo we have that now starting to occur in the us worse the leader prefers a depreciating currency and says so we are starting to think the dollar will have a hard time clawing back gains we had thought the euro s upside breakout was a temporary thing but not we are not so sure this is an excerpt from

donald trump likes to point to rising stock prices on wall street as a measure of his economic miracle in reality u s stock prices have exhibited a pattern of behavior as erratic as that of the u s commander in chief while the dow jones industrial average is trading where it was at the start of 2018 it has fluctuated wildly in recent months sharp declines and rallies often in the course of a single trading session have become the norm at the end of last year the market dropped 20 from its peak meeting the definition of a bear market then in the first quarter of 2019 it clawed back most of the losses then stock prices started to weaken once more now there is another rally but one wonders for how long actually the erratic behavior of wall street s key indices started earlier notably on the night in november 2016 when donald trump was elected the initial reaction when the voting results started to pour in was highly negative 10 trillion of wealth created then there was a huge reversal stock prices surged and by the time the dow set its all time high at nearly 27 000 last year the u s stock market added one third of its value thus in just two years a whopping 10 trillion of wealth has been created by wall street the gains moreover came not from a low point such after the 2008 09 sell off but from record highs the dow is an index of 30 bluest of the blue chips the largest and the most solid u s companies with tried and true business models and extensive track records they are also the most thoroughly analyzed companies in the world with literally thousands of analysts poring over their balance sheets stock prices represent the discounted present value of all dividends the company will pay out in perpetuity in other words it is a reflection of what investors think is going to happen to a given company s profitability in the future a seismic shift obviously there had to be some kind of a seismic shift in the overall economy to warrant such a dramatic repricing of those 30 companies and the creation of all that wealth was the election of trump and the appointment of his cabinet such a seismic shift the trump administration did loosen a number of regulations and environmental protection rules especially those that had been put in place under barack obama that made companies more profitable and cut the red tape and associated expenses however these were marginal changes adding a piddling amount to the corporate bottom line moreover u s regulations had been far less onerous than in most other rich industrial countries in addition u s multinationals continue to function successfully under more restrictive regulatory regimes abroad for instance in western europe the trump tax cut scam and then there was the trump tax cut it has always been a scam since it put money into the hands of corporations and the very rich doing very little for the real economy recent studies confirm that it provided no boost to investment or consumption just a short term infusion of liquidity so why does the u s stock market sustain its value why has it been so resilient with corrections proving to be short lived and followed by new rallies the answer may lie in the nature of pyramid schemes sergei mavrodi who set up a massive pyramid scheme in russia just as the soviet union collapsed argued that his business model was workable his mmm pyramid could have gone on paying dividends to existing investors forever as long as his well publicized success brought in new investors and confidence in his scheme endured but when the russian government moved in it undermined confidence and the whole thing collapsed the nature of pyramid schemes it is a spurious argument but it is not without merit large new inflows could continue to buoy the scheme and if the government or some other respectful entity pledged to back it it could have gone on for a very long time as to the long term john maynard keynes did once say that in the long run we re all dead the world economy fronted by the u s economy and underpinned by the u s dollar and dollar denominated financial assets has been in a bubble stage ever since it came out of the 2008 09 great recession this is not to say that the real economy is a bubble industry produces goods businesses provide services farmers grow food and the technology revolution powers ahead at an accelerating pace but in many asset classes there are massive and ultimately unsustainable bubbles like other pyramid schemes they go on because government entities give them their imprimatur and infuse liquidity another successful swindler bernie madoff claimed after the incomplete financial regulations had been enacted following the 2008 global financial crisis that the whole government was a ponzi scheme now there is a bubble in u s stocks and in international bond markets where yields are often negative meaning that governments are paid to pile on debt in real estate markets in key metropolitan areas property is overpriced by trillions of dollars a collapse of the massively overbuilt new york market alone would send shockwaves through the global financial system and that s a bubble that donald trump personally has a decided interest in keeping from popping so many bubbles in the u s there is a corporate debt bubble a consumer debt bubble and a student loan bubble in the united states there is even a bubble in the oil market despite the fact that oil prices have dropped by some 50 since 2010 14 and remarkably there is a labor market bubble a record low unemployment rate principally achieved with the help of still low labor force participation other key ingredients are the sea of low paying service sector jobs and the uber style gig economy both of which aren t allowing people to earn their cost of living that bubble was in evidence before the financial crisis and all those jobs evaporated within a few months now the situation is far worse these u s bubbles the corporate debt bubble a consumer debt bubble a student loan bubble and a labor market bubble are interlocking if one bursts it could trigger the bursting of others donald trump bubble maker trump s policies have acted to protect the bubbles and to inflate them further the tax cut infused liquidity into financial markets and high end real estate even his reckless trade wars have been beneficial for stocks and bonds fearing global economic and political turmoil investors are piling into the safest assets which are dollar denominated securities especially u s treasuries meanwhile concern about a possible global economic slowdown is making the u s federal reserve nervous it has hinted that it may cut interest rates spurring a rally on wall street last week the fed is acting as a government guarantor of a pyramid scheme if something cannot go on forever it will stop said conservative economist herbert stein back in the 1970s accordingly the bubble economy will inevitably come to an end bubbles are bicycle like phenomena they tumble when they stop moving and the stock market has not moved up for a year and a half conclusion the bursting of a number of interconnected bubbles may change the configuration of the global economic and political system as if that weren t bad enough donald trump is piling on by antagonizing america s allies and friends and initiating spurious trade conflicts trump is laying the groundwork for america s failure as a world leader it is an interesting sign of the times that the bitcoin which many economists believe is inherently worthless refuses to go away after dropping sharply in late 2018 it has rallied this year possibly this is another bubble but it may also be a troubling indicator for the future of the u s dollar as a global reserve currency

in the years immediately preceding world war ii winston churchill is quoted as having said the era of procrastination of half measures of soothing expedients of delays is coming to its close in its place we are entering a period of consequences world war ii purported to be a war to end all wars ended in 1945 after usa dropped two nuclear bombs on japan it did not end wars but it did have huge consequences evidence of which is unfolding even today perhaps the greatest single consequence is the combination of growth of money and banking systems rampant exploitation of natural resources and the parallel growth of production consumption pollution of all sorts this is turn has spawned environmental and ecological consequences at planetary scale with accompanying existential threats finance debt economic growth inequality a major fallout of world war ii was the formation in july 1944 of the bretton woods institutions the international monetary fund imf the international bank of reconstruction and development ibrd and the general agreement on tariff trade gatt they created the financial order of the post war world and defined the rules boundaries and goal posts of financial and economic cooperation after reconstruction of war devastated europe ibrd morphed into the world bank group which turned its attention to third world countries in 1995 wto replaced gatt the imf wb wto triad became the world s largest generator and provider of knowledge the fountain head of economic reform policies and programs they prescribed economic reforms founded on the centrality of economic growth as measured principally by the rate of growth of gdp this ideology for economic progress was taught in all major us and european and later in third world universities and created a multitude of indoctrinated economists of all nationalities who educated trained and advised the leaders and the elite of third world countries this ideology of economic growth on a corporate market consumer basis is neo liberalism promoted annually at the davos jamboree the bretton woods international financial institutions ifis were joined by banks like asian development bank and african development bank and ifis from japan and european countries even lower tier ifi executives had access to the top most echelons of governments hence ifis became the source of finance for development projects in the third world and also enablers for preparing project proposals and appointing consultants to educate and advise corruptible third world leaders to apply for and receive loans and solicit foreign investments thus banker driven debt economies expanded economic growth as the measure of national progress became the focus of economic thinking and was institutionalized in countries across the globe with impetus imparted and momentum maintained using the political economic clout of imf wb and other ifis it was accepted worldwide because it suited the elite politician bureaucrat corporate nexus or pbc sometimes referred to as the deep state which has behind the screen control of governments of all countries admittedly much of the knowledge and the finance provided for projects resulted in creation of infrastructural and other assets in third world countries but most of the accruing benefits went to economically better off sections of society with neglect of the poorer sections with grandiose plans for development calling for huge capital investments and loans from ifis available on pre condition of undertaking prescribed economic reforms many third world countries sank into debt some entered a debt trap when the outgo of interest on loans exceeded the revenue from projects plus export earnings overall this resulted in growing economic inequality within and between societies in admission of this an internal study group of the international monetary fund imf reported in july 2016 that their decades long advocacy and practice of economic reforms had serious failings the report is titled neoliberalism oversold with the boldfaced sentence instead of delivering growth some neoliberal policies have increased inequality thereby jeopardizing durable expansion thomas piketty s 2013 incisive best seller capital in the twenty first century may possibly have triggered the imf admission need for a different economic model at a recent meeting of imf and wb efforts were made to play down fears of a slowing global economy due a deteriorating trade climate the key phrases are fears of a slowing global economy and deteriorating trade climate questions which arise are why should there be fear and who feels fear also questions are about what effect a deteriorating global trade climate stated to be principally about the economic conflict between usa and china may have on the majority of the 7 2 billion global human inhabitants since the talk is global let s view other global matters the global economy being the sum of the economies of the countries on the globe and the economy of a country being the sum of the economies of its constituent states or regions it follows that at the very root of the global economy lies the economy of every human household taking the argument down to the household is justified by the etymology of the word economy which is from the greek word oikonomia referring to household management and thrift with eight of the world s wealthiest persons owning as much wealth as the bottom 50 of humanity there appears huge justification for an alternative economic paradigm to replace the current one of unending year on year economic growth which has caused unjust and growing inequality within and between nations leading to political military economic confrontation between nations and social unrest within nations current economic model put simply even simplistically the current economic model is founded upon the need for growth of the national economy as a means to generate wealth gross domestic product gdp is a measure of total economic production representing the market value of all goods and services including personal consumption institutional purchases and sales and adding exports and subtracting imports gdp is generally accepted as a comprehensive yardstick to assess a nation s economic growth and its year on year growth indicates economic health the generation of wealth money precisely by economic growth accrues to the upper economic echelons and this is expected to trickle down to people who live if that s the right word in the lowest economic layers of society this has not happened in any country rather economic disparity has widened politics is slave to economics every government attempts to gain political advantage by claiming a higher gdp growth rate as demonstrative of better performance opposition political parties always attempt to play down government s performance by contesting these figures even left oriented economists question the validity of 7 gdp growth rate claimed by the bjp led nda 2 government but do not question the economic model thus economists across the political spectrum have been and are on the gdp growth rate bandwagon and routinely quarrel about figures of gdp growth rate questioning the computation methods or the validity of the statistical data used for computation there appears to be no understanding that the economic model has failed to reach economic benefit to people at the bottom of the socio economic heap of humanity political promises notwithstanding apart from the economic model generating economic disparity and social unrest it is unsustainable from other perspectives politics is driven by an economic model that cannot address the here and now economic needs of food shelter health education jobs of vast numbers hence elections and voting are a cruel charade a drama scripted by parties and persons across the political spectrum to distract attention from the real life economic miseries of the invisible millions with promises of good days in the future the key agenda must be to accelerate growth is an article by none less than former chairman of the economic advisory council to india s prime minister the title and content of which indicates the mindset elections change governments but the economic growth ideology remains and its implementation maintains momentum even accelerates politics remains slave to economics and the pbc nexus remains in control regardless of which political party or tall leader is in power economic growth existential threat continuous economic growth year upon year is growth compounded and the size of an economy growing at say 7 would double in ten years the energy demanded acquired and consumed to enable such economic growth would also approximately double former rbi governor c rangarajan said 2016 the potential to grow at 8 to 9 per cent at least for a decade exists we have to make it happen thus by 2026 with government s concerted effort the size of the economy the energy consumed and global warming gw gases emitted for such growth would have more than doubled for india alone at global level this worldwide energy mostly fossil fuel consumption year upon year which is integral to economic growth has resulted in atmospheric co 2 rising to 415 ppm a level not exceeded for the last 3 million years this is accelerating gw and climate change cc which are existential threats to all life forms the direct cause and effect relationship between economic growth and gw cc is undeniable maintaining corporate control india s new economic policy formulated in 1991 by then union finance minister dr manmohan singh was specifically about imf wb orchestrated economic reform including structural adjustment all based firmly upon unending economic growth nep 1991 was effectively furthered by the thousands of opinion policy and decision makers in governments and indian institutions of higher education who were trained in foreign universities and wb institutes these persons have had and continue to have easy access to and disproportionate influence in the corridors of power in central and state governments regardless of the political party in power such trained persons were and are in positions of power at various levels in various ministries and they promote the mind set of ideas policies proposals plans and projects to yield targetted rates of gdp growth so that india may progress this mind set has proposed and promoted capital and machine intensive mega projects which need to acquire land water and mineral resources for this state and or central governments with help from the deep state circumvent bypass or amend laws enacted to protect people or the environment from such projects but governments justify such projects by touting economic growth a sales pitch which has always satisfied all political persuasions on the ground challenges by affected populations to such projects are met with police action in favour of the corporations and against protestors litigation is difficult and expensive and out of reach of poor project affected people and in any case usually fail sometimes the affected populations merely demand that extant laws e g forest rights act panchayat extension to schedule areas act right to fair compensation transparency in land acquisition resettlement and rehabilitation act 2013 be implemented faithfully but governments usually win against the people and corporations have their way people s resistance to amendments to weaken such laws has even been labelled as naxal or maoist to criminalize legitimate protest and individuals who help generally illiterate people affected by the project are subjected to slapp or charged under draconian laws like uapa the message as to who is boss is unequivocal the same economic policy has gained momentum with successive governments and under the bjp led nda government starting 2014 its implementation has been intensified across sectors over the years successive governments have sent top ministers travelling along with corporate honchos to the annual world economic forum at davos to decide how to spur economic growth and how to defeat economic competitors even as they propose sdgs and negotiate carbon credits notwithstanding the wisdom brought home from davos is that worldwide economic growth is uncertain and growing economic inequality and climate change are worrying issues however questioning the economic growth paradigm is economic blasphemy economist dr rathin roy believes that india s rapid growth has been essentially powered by its top 100 million citizens the leading indicators of economic prosperity he says are things that these indians consume cars 2 wheelers air conditioners and so on having had their fill of home made goods they have now moved to imported luxuries foreign holidays and italian kitchens for example money generated by gdp growth is used for industrialized production of goods and services which depends upon extraction and consumption of free natural capital of resources like minerals fuel fresh water land this year on year unending gdp growth demands year on year increased consumption of natural capital while the production processes produce more and more pollution of land water and air unending consumption of goods and services is highly energy intensive and directly connected with energy use burning of fossil fuels principally oil it generates ghgs and increases gw however the only thing that economists appear to fear is a slowing global economy because the rate at which goods and services are purchased consumed is flagging corporate influence on economic policy has resulted in capital intensive mega projects designed to boost gdp growth which have countrywide and worldwide effects the reality of sustained public protests against these projects is a part of the worry brought home from davos still rather than addressing the causes of protests state and central governments influenced by the pbc nexus ignore rubbish or suppress them by police beatings or firings charging protestors with war against the state and sedition and jailing them under draconian laws or trumped up charges another method of the pbc nexus maintaining control is the creation of the revolving door by which key executives or scientists in industrial commercial corporations are manoevred into government administrative posts where they influence policy and seamlessly revert to the parent corporate sector after a tenure climate change on the one hand the ministry of environment forests moef has been re named with climate change cc added to its designation so now moef cc and on the other this same ministry is part of the pbc nexus to slacken environmental laws rules and regulations so as to enable extractive and manufacturing industries and the hospitality industry to expand into new regions and generate profits this increases gdp and boosts economic growth but it is oblivious to the resulting intensification of gw and cc it is learned that scientists retiring or leaving the moeff cc are not replaced by scientists but by bureaucrats who cannot apply scientific rigour to environmental problems but uncritically obey bureaucratic and political dictats making a joke of environmental protection in 2008 prime minister s council on climate change government of india issued a 56 page national action plan on climate change napcc it states emphasizing the overriding priority of maintaining high economic growth rates to raise living standards the plan identifies measures that promote our development objectives while also yielding co benefits for addressing climate change effectively and outlines eight missions and three programs for implementation napcc suffers from a fundamental conflict between the priority of maintaining high economic growth rates which do not raise living standards but increase economic disparity even while enhancing the ecological sustainability of india s development path as demonstrated below maintaining high economic growth rates raising gdp growth rates involves not merely higher consumption but growing rates of consumption of all sorts of goods and services this will raise demand and consumption of oil and inevitably result in increased ghg emissions and consequent increased gw promoting the present development objectives which are based upon economic growth actually defeat measures to reduce ghg emissions and reduce the intensity of the inevitable effects of climate change this is incompatible with yielding co benefits for addressing climate change effectively the present economic policy and cc are incompatible bed mates the former cannot sleep with the window open and the latter cannot sleep with the window closed trying to tackle cc while actually working to sustain rapid economic growth is as illogical as trying to mop a floor dry without turning off the tap the economic growth ideology is clearly unsustainable and inconsistencies in the overview principles and approach of napcc display a regrettable myopia in policy consequences the current economic model of endless year on year consumption driven production of goods and services taken at national or global level has serious downstream effects drawing endlessly on the natural capital of primary mineral and other finite resources for projects to boost economic growth inevitably depletes it in turn it adversely affects the forests rivers and lakes land and oceans the ecological capital which depletes as natural capital and ecological capital are depleted by projects designed for the production consumption treadmill there is inevitable effect on people through displacement and loss of livelihood which destroys or adversely modifies the social structure of communities and families creating social tensions and unrest peace in society is social capital since development of any sort can only be successful in a peaceful society but the sacrosanct economic growth paradigm results in loss of social capital and this is evidenced by the glaring growing economic suffering and social unrest in urban rural and forest areas the divergence between money growing exponentially due to year on year economic growth and energy availability remaining stagnant or reducing can result in collapse of the financial system ominous signs of which are manifesting in different ways yet economists of all political persuasions willing prisoners within their ivory tower of economic growth urge the government of the day to adopt urgent measures to increase consumption of goods and services and strive for ever higher growth world leaders are uncomprehending or ignorant of the cause and effect relationship between economic policies and gw and cc they are unable to relate obvious negative inter societal and intra societal consequences with economic growth policies being helpless in the stranglehold of the neo liberal pbc deep state gw and cc is a major consequence of the economic growth paradigm homo sapiens has brought itself along with a host of other species to the brink of a great extinction the way forward it is not difficult to understand that tackling cc threats is priority one among a list of worldwide socio political imperatives survival is not possible without protection preservation and conservation of natural resources and bio diversity for egalitarian provision of the basic needs of water food energy clothing shelter and health education welfare and employment for all emphasizing the word all this is notwithstanding that tackling cc faces strong opposition from the ruling us administration and ignorance indifference opposition among most other governments worldwide since they all represent the interests of their respective pbc nexus more than that of the people whom they represent defeating the entrenched ideology of economic growth involves organizing socio political initiatives to give primacy to sectors such as energy food water shelter jobs employment health and education perhaps the most prominent is a political initiative in usa called the green new deal which bring economics to heel in the larger interest of human societies the gnd will convert the old gray economy into a new sustainable economy that is environmentally sound economically viable and socially responsible it seeks to solve the climate crisis by combining quick action to get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions and 100 renewable energy by 2030 along with an economic bill of rights the gnd sets a target year and proposes the way forward to meet that target unlike the sdgs which actually encourage economic growth proposed at davos the gnd is practical clear headed and socially responsible and deserves the most urgent study in all societies for implementation leaders and opinion makers in societies need to acquire the practical wisdom to understand that climate change due to global warming is an existential threat to most living species and certainly to human societes the threat is growing not receding measures based on that understanding need implementation to mitigate the effects of climate change and find an easier transition to so called deep adaptation necessary for species survival solutions for mitigation and adaptation as a survival route for human societies clearly lies in rejecting the evil of unending economic growth and adopting non fossil fuel based technologies our lives and the lives of future

additional income beginner teachers have an even tougher time affording miami skyrocketing housing prices combined with relatively low educator salaries have made the area one of the nation s priciest cities for starting teachers in the first analysis of its kind usa today examined salaries and housing costs for teachers all over the country teachers hustle to afford housing elementary school teacher stacie baur in pennsylvania teaches english to chinese students via skype to make ends meet jack gruber usa today new teachers can t afford the median rent almost anywhere in the u s the analysis shows a point often made during recent teacher strikes across the country but that s not the full story it s not just pay no matter where they work or what they earn teachers feel disrespect despite widespread demand for higher salaries teachers in some regions are actually making ends meet especially as they approach the middle of their careers in other areas mid career teachers are right to say they can t afford to live on their salaries without picking up side hustles or commuting long distances some of those places are only affordable for the very highest paid teachers and then there are places that no teacher can afford no matter how much they earn like miami loading a lot of people who have a passion for education cannot make it as a career said karla hernandez mats president of the union for teachers in miami dade county public schools we have teachers as uber drivers lyft drivers they certainly love teaching but they can t pay their bills with love what does affordable mean to gauge teachers standard of living usa today looked at salaries in the lowest middle and highest pay brackets in almost all the nation s metropolitan areas cities and their surrounding counties the data reflect the earnings of teachers in public and private schools collected as part of a bureau of labor statistics survey released in may 2017 areas were deemed affordable if teachers would have to spend no more than 30 of their salaries after accounting for federal taxes to afford the local median rent or mortgage that s in line with experts recommendations for budgeting in today s era of teacher strikes and walkouts the analysis answers a key question can educators in this area afford to live on their take home pay often that answer was no because housing costs exceeded 30 of teachers salaries after taxes the reasons why varied depending on the community starting teacher salaries were low or teachers pay didn t increase much over time or housing was comparably expensive compounding teachers financial troubles are other costs the analysis could not include like student debt health insurance contributions and child care costs starting out teachers can afford few cities beginning teachers or those in the bottom 10 of the pay scale can afford to rent a median priced unit in just 13 of the 291 metro areas analyzed loading the johnstown pennsylvania metro area is one of them the former steelworker town about 90 minutes east of pittsburgh is a distressed city with a low tax base around 3 000 students attend schools in the local district 83 of them are poor a starting johnstown teacher with a bachelor s degree earns 49 995 nearby homes are relatively cheap in part because the city has a number of blighted properties and public housing complexes as a result said nancy behe president of the johnstown teachers union many teachers own their homes instead of renting teacher pay varies in the smaller districts nearby but in one the starting salary is just 18 500 behe said which pulls down pay for the johnstown metro area in the usa today analysis loading new teachers can also afford to live in springfield ohio starting salaries in the school district are currently about 37 000 and rising to 37 789 next year plus the current contract gives teachers an annual bonus of 1 000 said kathryn richison a longtime springfield teacher houses in springfield are affordable she said that s largely because people aren t clamoring to buy or rent them many choose to live instead in nearby dayton or columbus for the big city amenities richison said loading how much should teachers be paid the average salary of a u s teacher was 58 950 in 2016 17 when adjusted for inflation that s slightly less than what the average teacher earned almost two decades ago even when benefits are thrown in america s teachers earned 13 less in 2018 than private sector workers with similar levels of education according to the economic policy institute the nonprofit think tank which receives funding from labor unions examined decades of federal data growing unrest over low pay sparked teacher walkouts last year in states

payment yet baur said it s hard to save when things keep getting more expensive these mid career teachers are still struggling in some areas teachers are struggling because their pay doesn t increase much even as they gain more years of experience on average in the metros analyzed usa today found that elementary school teachers salaries grow by 31 322 after taxes as they moved from the bottom to

than i do she said education coverage at usa today is made possible in part by a grant from the bill melinda gates foundation the gates foundation does not provide editorial input how we did it this story caps a school year focus on the pressures facing american teachers to perform the analysis usa today relied on data from two sources salary figures came from employers who reported to the bureau of labor statistics occupational employment statistics program as released in may 2017 because elementary teachers are the most prevalent the analysis focused on elementary pay in the 10th median and 90th percentile in each metro the survey includes public and private schools other analyses of teacher salaries tend to use a single measure of pay usually starting teacher salaries or median pay both of which oversimplify the issue usa today s spectrum of pay approach based on percentiles was designed to account for the fact that most teachers make more money as they gain years of experience similarly examining pay in metro areas instead of states allowed reporters to differentiate between high and low cost areas even within the same state to further account for real life factors usa today applied the federal tax rate for single filers to each salary figure to estimate elementary teachers take home pay in each metro next the analysis aimed to show whether teachers could afford to live on their take home pay their pay was compared with the proprietary zillow rental index from the real estate website that measure starts with median rents in each metro and applies a three month moving average while accounting for outlier figures the analysis focused on rent prices because mortgage payments can vary dramatically based on local taxes interest rates and insurance rates rental prices were most inclusive of the additional costs that factor into housing the 291 metros analyzed were those for which data existed in both the federal salary and zillow data sets
the prohibiting duties we lay on all articles of foreign manufacture which prudence indeed requires us to establish at home with the patriotic determination of every good citizen to use no foreign article which can be made within ourselves without regard to difference of price secures us against a relapse into foreign dependency thomas jefferson in an 1815 letter to john baptiste say a french economist a free people should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent on others for essentials particularly military supplies president george washington under free trade the trader is the master and the producer the slave protection is but the law of nature the law of self preservation of self development of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man free trade destroys the dignity and independence of american labor it will take away from the people of this country who work for a living and the majority of them live by the sweat of their faces it will take from them heart and home and hope it will be self destruction president william mckinley i wish we still had tariffs on all imports why because tariffs are what kept america s manufacturing alive our people with decent jobs our ability to purchase quality goods produced by american owned companies and because those tariffs once supported the entire cost of running our country for 126 years until 1913 there was no federal income tax and we kept all of the monies we earned today s communist progressive taxation is a far cry from what our founders envisioned for america s citizens following world war ii america began switching from a policy of protection to a policy of free trade which used international trade deals as a means of diplomacy and alliance building slowly eroding and ultimately destroying america s status as the world s dominant manufacturing power the idea that america s economic tradition has been economic liberty laissez faire and wide open cowboy capitalism which would naturally include free trade is simply not real history the reality is that all four presidents on mount rushmore were protectionists protectionism was in fact the real american way trump s populist pro tariff advisors bannon and navarro opposed the globalists in trump s administration including economic adviser gary cohn and council on foreign relations cfr member army lt gen h r mcmaster then trump s national security adviser gary cohn resigned when the president called for broad import tariffs on steel and aluminum anathema to establishment free trade democrats and republicans mcmaster was fired and replaced by former un ambassador john bolton the 1913 income tax this tax dominates the revenue scheme of the federal government today it is totally unconstitutional prior to ratification of the 16th amendment income tax in february 1913 the federal government managed its few constitutional responsibilities without an income tax except during the civil war period during peacetime it did so largely or even entirely on import taxes called tariffs congress ran the fed government on tariffs alone because fed responsibilities did not include welfare programs agricultural subsidies social security or medicare medicaid before the northern war of aggression the need for tariff revenue to finance the federal government generally kept the tariffs at reasonable levels during wartime throughout early american history the founding fathers were able to raise additional revenue employing a different method of direct taxation authorized by the u s constitution prior to the 16th amendment these alternative taxing methods gave the young american nation embarrassing peacetime budget surpluses that several times came close to paying off the national debt president andrew jackson boasted in his veto of the maysville road bill in 1830 that god had blessed the nation with no taxes except tariffs on imports and no national debt old hickory presided over a nation where congress had abolished all federal internal taxes and no citizen saw a tax collector of the united states unless that citizen was in the business of importing foreign goods and now the 20 dollar bill sporting the visage of tennessee s beloved president andrew jackson will be replaced with the picture of abolitionist harriet tubman while american consumers were occasionally manipulated by outrageously high protective tariffs inside the united states a massive free market emerged over which the u s government had almost no influence by way of contrast the advent of the income tax prompted some congressmen to note that this tax was designed not principally for revenue the u s government had always had plenty of money from tariffs but to manipulate the american people and their choices in the market this has been the legacy of the income tax while the income tax has produced the type of revenue that has made a massive transfer of wealth from the productive to the unproductive the incentives through thousands of deductions and tax credits have manipulated the american people into choices that they wouldn t have otherwise made in a free market these manipulations whether in favor of green energy research cash for clunker automobile purchases or tobacco crop subsidies have been chosen according to the prevailing virtue in washington prior to 1913 americans were responsible for themselves and independent enough to know that their future depended not on the government but solely on themselves selling out american manufacturing in 1992 ads in local newspapers encouraged businesses to transfer their manufacturing to honduras el salvador the caribbean basin international development zone of the dominican republic and haiti these were international free trade zones and port industrial free zones this included mexico instead of paying living wages in the united states corporations were urged to move to countries where wages were 33 to 56 per hour in 1991 a u s government agency actually directed apparel firms in the southeast to be approached and sold on the idea of going offshore where the labor was cheaper there is a puerto rican and asian connection as well hundreds of companies moved their plants out of our country and this was 27 years ago i remember a friend of mine who worked for levi strauss jeans at a terrific middle class salary being told to train the mexican workers how to do their jobs knowing the company was moving manufacturing to mexico the mexicans were given free living accommodations in our country they were free from our income taxes and they took over the jobs our american citizens had for a lot less money and manufacturing was ultimately moved to mexico check out the 1992 article from the pennsylvania crier it will shock you then go to the original pennsylvania crier home page and click on downloads the information in this website documents history with far more than anything you ll find in today s school books it is invaluable our country s manufacturing was purposely sold to third world countries to the detriment of our own people when nafta was first promoted the calls to our congressional reps were ten to one against it but our globalist enemies sold us out and voted for it unfortunately trump s trade representative cfr member robert lighthizer has sold us out and fooled our president into thinking the usmca is a better deal than nafta it is not and trump does not have conservative advisers who will read lighthizer s usmca and tell him the truth numerous articles have been written regarding the contents and the loss of our sovereignty publius huldah wrote that it not only violates our u s constitution but it also sets up global government and my friend j w bryan has written numerous articles exposing the dangers within the usmca trump s tariffs on chinese imports last september 2018 president trump announced tariffs on roughly 200 billion of imports from china these tariffs are on top of the ones imposed during the summer on 50 billion of products from that country mr trump has consistently believed that beijing needed america far more than america needed china largely because china is the country running large trade surpluses in 2017 china s merchandise trade surplus against the united states hit a record 375 6 billion as trump knows trade surplus countries get mauled in trade wars therefore beijing not washington is the party that needs to talk to reduce tension after extensive trade talks with china ended without an agreement on may 10 2019 president trump raised the tariffs on another 200 billion in chinese imports from 10 to 25 china retaliated three days later announcing new tariffs on 60 billion of american exports asia expert gordon chang is urging the president to remain strong on tariffs telling fox business lou dobbs the only way to prevent chinese theft and trade imbalance is for the u s to raise tariffs and implement continued pressure on the chinese chang told dobbs we have seen so many trade negotiations between previous presidents and the chinese they have all failed the chinese have violated every single agreement this is really important for us this is where we either stand or we fail and the only thing that s going to get us there is president trump of course there are free trade republicans like senator ted cruz who claim these actions will hurt the farmers and people of texas cruz previously supported giving fast track authority on trade to president obama but our president already said the government would be subsidizing the farmers losses during this fair trade battle with china the mexican border and trade personally i d like to see the border closed completely the trade trucks can stand in line at the border and be thoroughly inspected to allow them into the states but the border should be closed all border ports of entry should also be closed we are being flooded with illegal immigrants pleading asylum being loosed in america and never showing up for their court appearances if anyone believes there are only 12 to 30 million illegals in this country they are not paying attention the count is over 60 million or more and growing daily we do not have enough border patrol agents ice agents fences or walls built as high as the vatican or congressional laws to protect american citizens from the influx and costs of these lawbreakers there are many islamist terrorists amongst them who daily illegally cross into america president trump threatened tariffs on mexico being raised every single month until something was done by mexico to stop them according to the state department mexico agreed to dispatch 6 000 national guardsmen at the border with guatemala to block migrants from reaching the united states and expand a trump administration program that holds thousands of asylum seekers in mexico during u s immigration processing over 90 percent of those released into america never appear in court and are free to remain in america if mexico s actions do not have the expected results additional measures could be taken within 90 days and the two countries will continue to discuss add on steps during that period this includes tariffs on mexican goods coming into our country increasing every month until this influx of illegal aliens is quelled without our president and without these tariff threats there would have been no deal in 1916 president woodrow wilson put more than 100 000 national guard troops on the mexican border the military buildup followed an early morning raid at the garrison town of columbus new mexico ten soldiers and eight civilians were killed when the mexican revolutionary leader general francisco pancho villa attacked with almost 500 men it s time for america to put thousands upon thousands of national guard troops on our border again and armed with equipment to prevent the surge of illegals from entering our country and yes there is new military equipment that repels invaders called the active denial systems non lethal weapon and turns them back without hurting them this needs to be manned and used on the entire southern border conclusion pat buchanan was absolutely on target when he stated once a nation has put its foot onto the slippery slope of global free trade the process is inexorable the end inevitable death of the nation state tariffs are the answer the only way our nation can regain control of trade that benefits american citizens is through tariffs neither china nor mexico will cave to our demands unless they suffer the consequences of american tariffs if we subsidize our farmers and those who lose during this battle a battle that we continue to fight

the canadian dollar slipped 0 12 percent on tuesday after the market tried to scale back probabilities of multiple rate cuts in 2019 by the u s federal reserve trade war concerns also rose as the precedent of a quick win in the trade war with mexico could see the us use the tool more this year the usmca ratification process is due to start and is not exempt from revisions based on political agendas uncertainty about what the outcome of the us china trade dispute will be ahead of a potential meeting in japan at the end of the month are giving the greenback a boost as its appeal as a safe haven rises the us dollar is mixed against major pairs the eur and the gbp are higher against the greenback after president trump tweeted earlier this morning about the unfair strength of the us dollar rising probabilities of an interest rate cut by the fed are keeping the dollar under pressure but given the appeal of the currency as a safe haven during the us china trade war it continues to appreciate despite the wishes of the trump administration the market is pricing in multiple rate cuts before the end of the year but before that happens the case for a weaker us economy has to present itself before the fed inflation data to be released on wednesday could validate the downward trend started with the disappointing jobs report last week core inflation is expected to gain 0 2 percent and the headline indicator only 0 1 percent wage growth was also a miss on friday with a 0 2 percent gain when the forecast called for 0 3 percent the fed will wait for a confirmation of us slowdown before it acts the us central bank is not known for being pro active and will not fix the economy until there is proof that is broken a rate cut in the summer will materialize if there is proof of a slowdown but could also get readopt a patient stance if there is a trade agreement between the us and china the flip side is that failing to discuss trade or a rise in aggressive rhetoric from either side could increase the trade headwinds against the us economy and force chair powell to cut sooner rather than later crude flat as strong dollar offsets opec extension rumours oil is flat on tuesday as the us dollar rebound continues for its second day putting pressure on energy prices the dollar is higher after the deal with mexico on immigration avoided tariffs and closed off a trade front so that now the us can focus on the us china trade dispute the negotiations between the two super powers don t have a set date and with the g20 in japan fast approaching the chance there is a positive announcement is uncertain the impact on oil prices from further downgrades in global growth could lead to further losses russia is playing hard to get and remains not committal about extending the opec deal to cut oil production the deal has been the major stabilizing force for crude prices but rising us production and a prolonged trade war are close to offsetting the balance russia could be improving their position to seek leverage out of saudi arabia before agreeing to rejoin the major producers yellow metal recovers as trade tensions rise safe haven appeal gold rose 0 1 percent on tuesday after falling more than 1 percent at the start of the week as the short lived us mexico tariff dispute once again put emphasis on the us china trade war the us dollar rebounded despite mixed economic indicators putting investors on alert of possible rate cuts from the fed equities were the main beneficiaries on monday but as equities failed to gain momentum the yellow metal was once again seen as a destination in times of uncertainty gold remains bid as the main dispute between us and china remains unresolved if there is no sit down between leaders at the g20 the yellow metal will rise as investors will be on the lookout for a safe haven the u s federal reserve is expected to announce at least one interest rate cut in 2019 putting less pressure on the metal as recession fears increase physical demand for gold continues at a healthy pace and the asset s appeal as a safe haven will depend on negotiations between the us and china at the g20 markets end six day win streak await us inflation for clues on fed s move equities in the us ended lower after the massive rebound on monday june has seen the stock rally narrative reborn and with the us china in the background this month and the mexican import dispute being so short lived it all fed into the expectations of higher levels if trade headwinds remain subdued as the potential g20 meeting between trump and xi gets closer the anxiety in the market will be reflected in equity prices and is up to the trump administration to manage those expectations better than in the past a trade deal in june is a long shot seeing how far apart the two sides are but signs of progress would spark optimism that a deal is once again within sight which could prompt equities to jump into a higher gear pound rises on solid jobs and inflation data the british pound became the biggest major pair winner against the us dollar on tuesday the pound appreciated 0 30 percent after the release of the uk s jobs report the jobs data showed a 3 3 yearly rise in wages and the lowest unemployment rate since 1974 the shadow of brexit was felt even in the light of positive data as the number of jobs added was the weakest since august with employers holding back on hiring as the divorce between the united kingdom and the european union could be entering its endgame the rise in wages in particular is seen as the right inflationary data feeding into the expectations that the bank of england boe could lift the interest rate to avoid the economy overheating despite brexit headwinds comments no monday from michael saunders delinked any future action from the central bank to the brexit outcome the divergence between the boe who could potentially raise rates in 2019 compared to the fed and the ecb that have a

the chorus for reduction of real interest rates as the panacea for the current economic slowdown is getting louder from commentators to administrators to economists that seems the only item on the menu these days interest rates nominal and real inflation forex rates and reserves investments capital account convertibility and foreign investment flows all from the input or causative side and growth output and employment on the resultant side are intricately interconnected there seems a need to look at things comprehensively and evolve a framework agreement between the rbi and the government people buy things in advance if either it is likely to be costlier in the future when they need it or for de risking like gold and real estate but what if the realised prices later consistently prove to be lower would people still buy upfront or would it indicate some discrepancy let us see it in the context of forex rates the actual rates post facto have consistently been lower far lower than the forward rates rates quoted today for dollar that will be delivered say three six months later the first one is determined based on the difference in inflation rates over the period concerned and the second one based on difference in nominal interest rates if the real interest rates are deducted from nominal then the movement in both should be determined by difference in inflation provided there are no excess capital flows vis a vis the cad the persistence of actual rate being way less than forward rate represents a serious imbalance and causes problems in domestic competitiveness flow of foreign currency investment absorptive capacity etc for example if apples representative of a basket of goods are selling at rs 50 in india and 1 overseas then exchange rate should be ideally 1 rs 50 say next year indian apples have suffered an inflation of 10 per cent and have gone up to rs 55 but apples overseas have suffered an inflation of 2 per cent and gone up to 1 02 then the exchange rate should be rs 55 1 02 53 93 but if the exchange rate is kept at say rs 51 then the indian exporter will get 1 02 x 51 52 02 rs apple while he is able to get rs 55 selling it domestically why would he export to overcome this we should allow the re to correct this will happen if we match the supplies into india with its net exports contours of a new framework given this imbalance the framework pact between the government and the rbi should cover all essential variables not just one or two in isolation such an agreement should cover the following limits on forex inflows the inflows should be calibrated to match the absorptive capacity of the economy and its investment needs while capital account convertibility can remain rbi has to limit the quantum either at total levels or under each major source of inflow reserves are a costly loss making insurance asset much like gold with individuals whose costs are far more than the difference between interest earned and paid ithe limits can be 1 2 per cent of what is required to plug the cad or 6 months imports 2 weeks maintenance of competitiveness competitiveness comprises two elements the physical and the currency physical competitiveness comes from technology scale skills iprs and natural resource endowments over which neither the rbi nor the government may have control currency distorted by capital flows needs to stay competitive which can be achieved only if it floats freely to reflect the inflation differential forex rates rbi should be mandated to maintain the reer values now the exchange rate is far lower than the reer value the present massive divergence can be settled now on a one time basis with no more than 2 3 per cent deviation being permitted subsequently recalibrating reer values again instead of using the general inflation numbers of the countries to arrive at an reer band it should be the inflation of major input costs including interest costs of goods and services traded between india and its major trading partners there are real dangers of currencies as a whole being governed by factors other than what determines competitiveness real interest rates real interest rates should be mandated to be within 5 10 bps spread over interest rates in competing countries and those investing into india high real interest rates and overvalued currency may encourage debt flows more than investments in real assets and fdis inflation divergence between estimated actuals and realised actuals after the end of period is difficult to control even for items like forex rates it s time we move on to inflation targets for 3 4 major groups food inflation is more politically sensitive and socially damaging than white goods or real estate stability of laws the last 4 5 years have seen sudden sharp changes in rules governing provisioning npas default status etc and levels of support to distressed assets even those which are clean but facing stretched cash flows changes should factor in reasonable adjustment period quid pro quo if these are corrected governments should undertake to do the following i to stay within the 3 4 per cent fiscal deficit targets ii to smoothen msp increases based on fundamentals rather than subject to political whims and fancies iii to curtail interest declared on mandated savings like pf ppf etc and iv not to announce arbitrary minimum wages the current economic impasse is arising out of highly overvalued currency uncompetitive real interest rates and inflows far in excess of absorptive capacity the entire burden of spurring growth and employment hence falls on the government which has to substitute for the private sector rendered uncompetitive due to these imbalances an agreement on the above lines would go a long way in kick starting growth and employment the noted economist irving fisher in his book the money illusion quotes reginald mckenna chancellor of exchequer uk as follows since the war central bank reforms have been instituted in albania austria chile colombia germany hungary india russia south africa in all these countries except india not one central bank has copied the bank act of england all have adopted some system which is similar to the federal reserve act which provides for an elastic currency the greater elasticity of the federal reserve system is the main reason for the higher prosperity of america what was true then of the us is true today of china which has proved far more nimble footed than india the writer is the author of making growth happen in india
the prohibiting duties we lay on all articles of foreign manufacture which prudence indeed requires us to establish at home with the patriotic determination of every good citizen to use no foreign article which can be made within ourselves without regard to difference of price secures us against a relapse into foreign dependency thomas jefferson in an 1815 letter to john baptiste say a french economist a free people should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent on others for essentials particularly military supplies president george washington under free trade the trader is the master and the producer the slave protection is but the law of nature the law of self preservation of self development of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man free trade destroys the dignity and independence of american labor it will take away from the people of this country who work for a living and the majority of them live by the sweat of their faces it will take from them heart and home and hope it will be self destruction president william mckinley i wish we still had tariffs on all imports why because tariffs are what kept america s manufacturing alive our people with decent jobs our ability to purchase quality goods produced by american owned companies and because those tariffs once supported the entire cost of running our country for 126 years until 1913 there was no federal income tax and we kept all of the monies we earned today s communist progressive taxation is a far cry from what our founders envisioned for america s citizens following world war ii america began switching from a policy of protection to a policy of free trade which used international trade deals as a means of diplomacy and alliance building slowly eroding and ultimately destroying america s status as the world s dominant manufacturing power the idea that america s economic tradition has been economic liberty laissez faire and wide open cowboy capitalism which would naturally include free trade is simply not real history the reality is that all four presidents on mount rushmore were protectionists protectionism was in fact the real american way trump s populist pro tariff advisors bannon and navarro opposed the globalists in trump s administration including economic adviser gary cohn and council on foreign relations cfr member army lt gen h r mcmaster then trump s national security adviser gary cohn resigned when the president called for broad import tariffs on steel and aluminum anathema to establishment free trade democrats and republicans mcmaster was fired and replaced by former un ambassador john bolton the 1913 income tax this tax dominates the revenue scheme of the federal government today it is totally unconstitutional prior to ratification of the 16th amendment income tax in february 1913 the federal government managed its few constitutional responsibilities without an income tax except during the civil war period during peacetime it did so largely or even entirely on import taxes called tariffs congress ran the fed government on tariffs alone because fed responsibilities did not include welfare programs agricultural subsidies social security or medicare medicaid before the northern war of aggression the need for tariff revenue to finance the federal government generally kept the tariffs at reasonable levels during wartime throughout early american history the founding fathers were able to raise additional revenue employing a different method of direct taxation authorized by the u s constitution prior to the 16th amendment these alternative taxing methods gave the young american nation embarrassing peacetime budget surpluses that several times came close to paying off the national debt president andrew jackson boasted in his veto of the maysville road bill in 1830 that god had blessed the nation with no taxes except tariffs on imports and no national debt old hickory presided over a nation where congress had abolished all federal internal taxes and no citizen saw a tax collector of the united states unless that citizen was in the business of importing foreign goods and now the 20 dollar bill sporting the visage of tennessee s beloved president andrew jackson will be replaced with the picture of abolitionist harriet tubman while american consumers were occasionally manipulated by outrageously high protective tariffs inside the united states a massive free market emerged over which the u s government had almost no influence by way of contrast the advent of the income tax prompted some congressmen to note that this tax was designed not principally for revenue the u s government had always had plenty of money from tariffs but to manipulate the american people and their choices in the market this has been the legacy of the income tax while the income tax has produced the type of revenue that has made a massive transfer of wealth from the productive to the unproductive the incentives through thousands of deductions and tax credits have manipulated the american people into choices that they wouldn t have otherwise made in a free market these manipulations whether in favor of green energy research cash for clunker automobile purchases or tobacco crop subsidies have been chosen according to the prevailing virtue in washington prior to 1913 americans were responsible for themselves and independent enough to know that their future depended not on the government but solely on themselves selling out american manufacturing in 1992 ads in local newspapers encouraged businesses to transfer their manufacturing to honduras el salvador the caribbean basin international development zone of the dominican republic and haiti these were international free trade zones and port industrial free zones this included mexico instead of paying living wages in the united states corporations were urged to move to countries where wages were 33 to 56 per hour in 1991 a u s government agency actually directed apparel firms in the southeast to be approached and sold on the idea of going offshore where the labor was cheaper there is a puerto rican and asian connection as well hundreds of companies moved their plants out of our country and this was 27 years ago i remember a friend of mine who worked for levi strauss jeans at a terrific middle class salary being told to train the mexican workers how to do their jobs knowing the company was moving manufacturing to mexico the mexicans were given free living accommodations in our country they were free from our income taxes and they took over the jobs our american citizens had for a lot less money and manufacturing was ultimately moved to mexico check out the 1992 article from the pennsylvania crier it will shock you then go to the original pennsylvania crier home page and click on downloads the information in this website documents history with far more than anything you ll find in today s school books it is invaluable our country s manufacturing was purposely sold to third world countries to the detriment of our own people when nafta was first promoted the calls to our congressional reps were ten to one against it but our globalist enemies sold us out and voted for it unfortunately trump s trade representative cfr member robert lighthizer has sold us out and fooled our president into thinking the usmca is a better deal than nafta it is not and trump does not have conservative advisers who will read lighthizer s usmca and tell him the truth numerous articles have been written regarding the contents and the loss of our sovereignty publius huldah wrote that it not only violates our u s constitution but it also sets up global government and my friend j w bryan has written numerous articles exposing the dangers within the usmca trump s tariffs on chinese imports last september 2018 president trump announced tariffs on roughly 200 billion of imports from china these tariffs are on top of the ones imposed during the summer on 50 billion of products from that country mr trump has consistently believed that beijing needed america far more than america needed china largely because china is the country running large trade surpluses in 2017 china s merchandise trade surplus against the united states hit a record 375 6 billion as trump knows trade surplus countries get mauled in trade wars therefore beijing not washington is the party that needs to talk to reduce tension after extensive trade talks with china ended without an agreement on may 10 2019 president trump raised the tariffs on another 200 billion in chinese imports from 10 to 25 china retaliated three days later announcing new tariffs on 60 billion of american exports asia expert gordon chang is urging the president to remain strong on tariffs telling fox business lou dobbs opens a new window the only way to prevent chinese theft and trade imbalance is for

trump of course there are free trade republicans like senator ted cruz who claim these actions will hurt the farmers and people of texas cruz previously supported giving fast track authority on trade to president obama but our president already said the government would be subsidizing the farmers losses during this fair trade battle with china the mexican border and trade personally i d like to see the border closed completely the trade trucks can stand in line at the border and be thoroughly inspected to allow them into the states but the border should be closed all border ports of entry should also be closed we are being flooded with illegal immigrants pleading asylum being loosed in america and never showing up for their court appearances if anyone believes there are only 12 to 30 million illegals in this country they are not paying attention the count is over 60 million or more and growing daily we do not have enough border patrol agents ice agents fences or walls built as high as the vatican or congressional laws to protect american citizens from the influx and costs of these lawbreakers there are many islamist terrorists amongst them who daily illegally cross into america president trump threatened tariffs on mexico being raised every single month until something was done by mexico to stop them according to the state department mexico agreed to dispatch 6 000 national guardsmen at the border with guatemala to block migrants from reaching the united states and expand a trump administration program that holds thousands of asylum seekers in mexico during u s immigration processing over 90 percent of those released into america never appear in court and are free to remain in america if mexico s actions do not have the expected results additional measures could be taken within 90 days and the two countries will continue to discuss add on steps during that period this includes tariffs on mexican goods coming into our country increasing every month until this influx of illegal aliens is quelled link without our president and without these tariff threats there would have been no deal in 1916 president woodrow wilson put more than 100 000 national guard troops on the mexican border the military buildup followed an early morning raid at the garrison town of columbus new mexico ten soldiers and eight civilians were killed when the mexican revolutionary leader general francisco pancho villa attacked with almost 500 men it s time for america to put thousands upon thousands of national guard troops on our border again and armed with equipment to prevent the surge of illegals from entering our country and yes there is new military equipment that repels invaders called the active denial systems non lethal weapon and turns them back without

global free trade the process is inexorable the end inevitable death of the nation state tariffs are the answer the only way our nation can regain control of trade that benefits american citizens is through tariffs neither china nor mexico will cave to our demands unless they suffer the consequences of american tariffs if we subsidize our farmers and those who lose during this battle a battle

source wikipedia quote by st jerome editing by the author based on a story by dan brown an epigram by balzac and a painting by caravaggio as the next fomc swiftly approaches the testing of chairman powellâ s â patienceâ by data and global politics is nearing its zenith despite this trial by data and events this ascetic monetary policy monk endures like his holy namesake source eric dodds editing by the author quote by jm keynes lesser mortals even keynes himself would have folded by now and eased but chairman powell is made of sterner stuff he seeks salvation through data dependence the fed may only achieve salvation by sacrificing him and his â patienceâ unless of course he obliges first the plot thickens it is a mystery worthy of a netflix series or two the fed is now in the uncomfortable position of finding out that being â patientâ has put it in the â discomfort zoneâ vis a vis global political and economic developments in real time which are already entering the â alarm zoneâ the fed has responded to this predicament by embarking on a lengthy program of a monetary policy framework review this framework review is now being driven by the inputs in real time from global and political economic developments mr market is way ahead of the fed thereby exposing the fedâ s loss of credible commitment to its dual mandate source and caption the author the gap between mr market and the fed recently widened further as the former has chosen to default to the chinese trade war narrative rather than the fuzzy narrative that is being framed by president trump and dissonant fed speakers source and caption the author the chinese have signaled a trade war with a duration at least as far out as 2035 source bloomberg caption by the author this view has now been embraced by those widely accepted as the american voices of mr market it is no longer a trade war it is a new cold war the thucydides trap is real mr marketâ s embrace is not ideological however it is pecuniary all he wants is for the fed to ease source and caption the author the fed is responding but it is still behind the market curve of events the last report suggested that this will ultimately require the fed to quantitatively and qualitatively ease in order to seize back control of the initiative and mr marketâ s narrative before this qqe endgame however the fed needs to clear its name and avoid being blamed for previous missteps that have led to this conclusion the fedâ s most notable misstep being the last interest rate hike the fedâ s next most notable misstep being the continued unwinding of its balance sheet the fedâ s most notable mis perception leading to said missteps being the view that tight labor markets require tight monetary policy this airbrushing process is now being undertaken with some haste source and caption the author the fedâ s problem derives in large part from the fact that it is actually following an asset price targeting mandate rather than its congressional dual mandate quantitative easing was nothing more than an illustration of this fact hidden behind guidance about stimulating the monetary transition mechanism of late the fed has divined that rising asset prices do not reflect the current worsening economic growth situation it has therefore tried to prevent markets going higher what the fed did not understand is that president trump was already doing this much better than fed guidance the last rate hike has shown the fed that it cannot drive asset prices lower with tighter monetary policy at a time when global growth is deteriorating because of the trade situation the fed has thus opted to be â patientâ until asset prices reflect its own view of the appropriate point to start easing monetary policy again unfortunately it does not understand that in todayâ s economic environment being â patientâ is the same thing as tightening monetary policy source reuters caption by the author speaking recently fed governor randal quarles practically conceded the fact that the fedâ s asset price targeting mandate is the main priority referencing this mandate under the broader heading of financial stability policy he gamely tried to convince an audience that asset prices are not too frothy he also tried to convince the same audience that it is acceptable to target asset prices with monetary policy under certain circumstances even though strictly speaking monetary policy should be confined to dual mandate targets reading between the lines of his equivocal extemporizing it is clear that quarles would like the fed to maintain its independence to divine when it should target asset prices and when it should adhere to its dual mandate the fedâ s handling of the current situation does not leave one with any confidence to allow it to continue to have its cake and eat it if this was the â quarles putâ it was poorly delivered and completely discounted by mr market the latter would like to be shown and not told these days source bloomberg caption by the author the last report noted the fed begrudgingly following in the bank of japanâ s footsteps towards a new round of quantitative and qualitative easing the fedâ s global point man dallas fed president robert kaplan was also noted as a having twin related horrors his first horror is that the fedâ s credible commitment to inflation targeting is in shreds since it has failed consistently to do so since the gfc his related horror is that technology and its manifestation in the new economy has structurally prevented the fed from ever hitting this inflation target evidently boj governor kuroda is a kindred spirit with kaplan thereby sharing the same fears kurodaâ s latest commentary will no doubt resonate strongly with future guidance from kaplan the boj governor has now opened the subject matter of debate over the structural impediments to inflation targeting and hence central bank credibility in his view the structural threat is so real as to make central bankers deploy new monetary policy frameworks and guidance clearly the fed embraces his conclusion because it is doing the very same remedial actions that he suggested kuroda implies that structural economic reforms should be used to address the impacts of technology this vague inference does not make it clear how structural reforms actually stimulate inflation the experience to date is that structural reforms in search of productivity actually contribute to disinflation kurodaâ s lead on the subject actually implies that central bankers would like to drop inflation targets because failing to hit them has totally destroyed their credibility this does not mean that central banks will abandon easy monetary policy what it means is that they will press on within even easier monetary policy only this time they do not wish to be benchmarked to measurable performance metrics over to robert kaplan to weave kurodaâ s magic into the fedâ s monetary policy framework review jean claude trichet has spoken in support of kuroda so one should also look for the ecb to water down its rigid inflation targeting posturing in the future central bankers should be very careful by ducking out of inflation target responsibility they will then have to over deliver on economic growth failure to deliver on growth would then see their credibility fatally questioned if they cannot be seen to deliver on growth or inflation their reason to exist other than to inflate asset prices is questionable they could however hang on to the latter as part of their lender of last resort function source and caption the author fed vice chairman richard clarida tried to move with alacrity to respond to the rapidly changing narrative delivered by mr market and made in china according to him the fed is â attuned to potential risks to growthâ unfortunately clarida only sees mr marketâ s clearly visible real risks as â potentialâ he is not attuned to the risks that the fedâ s own words and actions lack of action are to growth the fed is going to have to respond with actions and not words if it really wants to be taken seriously again minnesota fed president neel kashkari did a much better drum roll for the next easing phase than his vice chair unequivocally signalling that the next move is to ease kashkari opined that he is â not quite there yetâ he would like what he calls â noiseâ in the trade war rhetoric to run its course through the data first his other preconditions of low inflation expectations and stagnant wages have already been ticked so he is nearly good to go it is also simply a matter of time for new york fed president john williams to get there with kashkari when he does he is quite prepared to cut interest rates aggressively when deflation or a severe downturn threatens it may take some time for san francisco fed president mary daly to go anywhere her default tactic of being â patientâ when confronted by uncertainty has the unfortunate bi product of making her even more inert as new risky headlines cross the tape she views the prospect of america fighting trade wars on the pacific atlantic and latin american fronts as reasons to do nothing rather than reasons to anticipate an economic slowdown doing nothing when the fedâ s balance sheet is still contracting on auto pilot is the same thing as quantitative tightening daly is in fact doing something by apparently doing nothing even if what she is doing is wrong original photo substance media caption by the author st louis fed president james bullard is definitely there in the last report his avowed intention and capability to be more aggressive in calls for easier monetary policy was noted this has now progressed to his recent opining that the yield curve is telling him itâ s time for a rate cut the next step is for him to openly dissent for the record in fed minutes at the next point the fuse is lit and the countdown to the next ease and the formal challenge to chairman powellâ s stewardship will begin source and caption by the author chicago fed president charles evansâ painful transition from the â patientâ comfort zone into the discomfort zone has been amusing to watch his internal conflict between trying to support the chairmanâ s â transitoryâ disinflation claim and the growing trade headwinds is clearly wearing on him in his most recent act of public humiliation he embraced the art of rhetoric as a crutch evans had no choice since the chicago fed was hosting a monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices conference the timing of the conference was critical for the fed to show that it actually does listen this author has noted that thus far the fed listens forums have been used by the fed to try and tell mr market what to do thus far the fed has failed and mr market has followed his own intuition about the incoming data and headlines speaking rhetorically of a time when the us economy is weakening evans promised that he would support a vigorous monetary policy easing response apparently that time is not now but at least he has put down a marker for a future u turn if chairman powell took note he would have seen that the ever loyal evans had given him the chance to seize the initiative and lead by changing his own â transitoryâ disinflation rhetoric this was potentially powellâ s last chance source bloomberg caption by william shakespeare and editing by the author chairman powell swiftly took his cue from evans and responded rhetorically hypothetically speaking like evans he opined that if the trade war headwinds grow stronger the fed will respond with interest rate cuts powellâ s remarks were swiftly reiterated by fed governor lael brainard in her view â trade policy is definitely a downside risk a rate cut may therefore be needed to continue the current expansion rather than to deal with a trade war created recession this sounds very much like brainard trying to slip in some room for one of those â insurance policyâ interest rate cuts that are actually a policy u turn in reality any such rate cut should be correctly viewed as an admission of failure for the last rate hike president trump will certainly tweet frame it that way source and caption by the author powellâ s latest guidance basically confirmed that the fed asset price targeting mandate is actually taking precedence over its official dual mandates on this occasion the chairman sought to arrest a risk off market decline the powell put was promised unfortunately in the past chairman powell has flip flopped on so many of his verbal commitments and observations that his credibility has gone mr market understands that if he were to rally risk assets too far without exercising the powell put first the chairman would swiftly rescind it powellâ s market manipulating rhetoric is hollow so he is going to have to deliver on this one first to get his credibility back delivering will be painful since it implies that the last rate hike was a failure not delivering will however be much more painful for him in the long run just to make sure the powell put risk on rally does not get carried away beyond reality in the us real economy dallas fed president kaplan then swiftly applied the brakes according to his braking guidance it is still too early to make a decision to ease monetary policy again mr market should thus go back into patience mode and await further developments kaplan is not just living a dream he is living a fantasy if he thinks that he can get mr market back in his patience box with words john williams also tried his best not to boost risk asset prices whilst simultaneously adjusting his guidance in the process his new positioning has him â keeping an open mindâ on interest rates whilst still clinging to his baseline â patienceâ the opening of his mind has been done by the deterioration in the global trade situation guidance from the regional fed by way of the latest beige book classified the us economy as â modestâ in general and â moderateâ at best in a few locations the regional fed input into the next fomc meeting clearly shows that things remain the same in the american economic hinterland going into the next fomc meeting one can therefore expect the committee to show concern about the deterioration in background conditions given its continued â patientâ bias there is however no reason to expect it to move in anticipation of a further slowdown by easing monetary policy the fomc will no doubt adopt the rhetorical pose of chairman powell by talking about what may happen if things were to get worse there will also be dissent in the ranks from kashkari and bullard which will get the limelight and mr marketâ s attention source and caption by the author the fedâ s previously noted dalliance with what was termed â faux populismâ now looks set to yield the curve ball that puts the central bank circa discomfort alarm zone this â faux populismâ was borne out of a curious aligned interest between the fed and the unemployed underemployed ostensibly chairman powell opines that he wishes to extend the current business cycle in order to raise wages and bring folks back into the labor market in his heart of hearts he understands fully that higher labor force participation is a keeping a lid on wages though source investing com caption and editing by the author mr market was transfixed by the disinflationary signals from the latest employment situation report context for the disinflationary strategy behind the fedâ s â faux populismâ was better illustrated by the latest unit labour cost data for those who like charts the bigger picture shows lower highs now leading to new lows fed â patienceâ throughout this transformation is becoming difficult to understand especially since the fed is now allegedly all for higher inflation and higher wages source and caption the author alleged inflation targeting by doing nothing with interest rates is thus ultimately disinflation targeting in practice that will lead to even lower interest rates mr market has sussed all this out and has a tendency to drive asset prices higher to the ultimate conclusion of lower interest rates and a bigger cheaper labor pool the fed in the meantime periodically prevents mr market from getting too carried away by verbally deflating asset markets the fed is thus left with an asset price targeting mandate in practice whilst it verbally commits to the lower for longer inflation targeting agenda that is actually a disinflation targeting agenda in practice the fedâ s job of alleged inflation targeting commitment has also just received its first debunking by its own fed listens initiative the overwhelming feedback from the unemployed underemployed is that they actually do not want inflation in fact inflation is the biggest economic headwind perceived by them based on this feedback if the fed truly cares about the middle class and those excluded from the real economy it should not target higher inflation inflation targeting is thus doa with those who work for a living those who speculate for a living are another story mr market strongly wishes that the fed should target inflation by cutting interest rates this is however not in the interest of the middle class and the financially excluded who the fed claims that it has been listening to who therefore should the fed listen to source and caption by the author clearly the fed is currently pretending to listen to those who donâ t want it to target inflation clearly the fed is not listening to president trump so that he is doing his best to make mr market force the fed to listen both of them clearly mr market is listening to president trump the fed has divined that the best thing to do is to sit pat be â patientâ and let mr market and mr real economy duel it out with president trump egging both fighters on unfortunately for the fed the decision to do nothing is in fact an implicit decision to do quantitative tightening this implied quantitative tightening is evidenced by the fedâ s continued policy of letting its balance sheet run off with the clear consequences of market interest rates trading up through its fed funds target levels this means that the fed will ultimately have to ease again it simply has to now pick its time and its trigger the volatility created by the duel between mr market and mr real economy on a battlefield of background quantitative tightening is one that only mr market will win the market volatility backs out into tighter real economy liquidity through the agency of financial institutions and banks the combination of tight capital market liquidity and tight real economy liquidity will then beget monetary policy easing from the fed recent fed speakers have simply indicated that this conclusion has moved closer of late mr market has sensed this so the fed speakers have had to curb his enthusiasm itâ s hard to keep a good man down though
what is income inequality and why is it a serious threat to the entire economy john coble follow published in the startup 13 min read jun 11 2019 3 share monetary policy cannot save us in the next recession we must stimulate the right part of the economy photo by ian espinosa on unsplash the problem with income inequality income inequality is a great danger to the american economy income inequality has decimated the middle class income inequality has hurt and continues to harm the entire economy it is important to stress that the opposite of income inequality is not income equality no one is talking about everyone having the same income even the most extreme marxist countries do not advocate for this what we are talking about is a reduction in income inequality a reduction in income inequality is necessary because a large proportion of the population does not have sufficient income to afford the basic necessities required to live comfortably consequently the optimal amount of basic necessities are not produced therefore less than optimal amounts of people are employed to produce these products companies are not making as high a profit off these items because there are not enough buyers therefore the economy is not working as well as it could be an example of a basic necessity is toilet paper rich or poor an individual uses about the same amount if there are fewer poor people buying toilet paper the wealthy are not going to make up the balance this applies to all non luxury goods an example involving cars would be a 100 000 car vs a 20 000 car it takes about the same amount of people to produce each car there are probably a hundred 20 000 models sold for every 100 000 car sold if everyone that needs a 20 000 car can buy one we are in good condition however if one of these hundred cars cannot be sold because of insufficient income then the economy loses the same level of labor demand as it would if that one 100 000 car were not sold therefore the loss of the labor necessary for the production of one 20 000 car has a similar effect on the real economy as the loss of the production of one 100 000 car i use the word real economy because some of our distorted economic statistics might not show this

via marketwatch the federal reserve appearing satisfied that the economy is close enough to 2 inflation and full employment is reviewing strategies and tools perhaps it should consider some radical options such as letting ordinary individuals establish accounts at the central bank and injecting helicopter money into each of those consumer accounts when the central bank determines the economy needs a boost historically when the economy slowed the fed pushed down the federal funds rate that banks pay one another to borrow excess reserves that rippled through to rates for short term lines of business credit 10 year and 30 year treasury securities corporate bonds and home mortgages along with buying and selling treasury bills to manipulate the federal funds rate the fed can adjust what it pays banks for their deposits at the central bank currently banks receive 2 35 on those accounts even as they only pay their own depositors less than 0 2 on similar accounts the federal funds rate that fed policy makers consider neutral one that will neither boost inflation nor slow economic activity has fallen before the financial crisis the fed raised that rate to 5 25 but it would never set it that high even with unemployment so low these days currently the target is about 2 25 to 2 5 and the fed doesn t have much room to cut rates if the economy slows that s the most compelling reason for its strategic review moreover longer term rates on treasury securities corporate bonds to finance big investment projects and home mortgages don t move up and down with federal funds rate as they once did when ben bernanke raised the federal funds rate in 2004 2006 longer term treasury rates hardly budged and as the fed pushed up rates four times in 2018 the fannie mae 30 year mortgage rate rose but then fell back even before the final rate increase in december globally ordinary business is increasingly conducted in dollars even when americans aren t involved the dollar s share of cross border debt financing has jumped to 62 and about 40 of all cross border trade is denominated in dollars even though the u s is less than one fifth of the global economy to accommodate all this foreign banks businesses and individual investors hold large amounts of dollars and dollar denominated securities if u s long term rates creep up in response to adjustments in the federal funds rate foreign money seeking yield can flow into u s treasurys and mortgage backed securities and drive those rates back down we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us in the wake of the financial crisis the fed lowered the federal funds rate to near zero in 2008 without much effect ordinary folks on the precipice of bankruptcy thanks to job losses crashing stock and home prices worth less than their mortgages weren t about to borrow to buy cars or remodel kitchens and banks were not about to lend to technically insolvent customers the fed turned to quantitative easing it purchased 3 7 trillion longer term treasurys and 30 year mortgage backed securities and helped the treasury bail out the biggest banks near zero borrowing rates for bank funds is like free steel for auto makers but in the early days of the financial crisis those rates did little to revive the economy because banks had no appetite for new lending and consumers required several years to work off excessive credit card balances unload houses they couldn t afford or get debt forgiven altogether the next time a recession harkens the fed might consider being more democratic not just lend money cheaply to banks but rather give it away to ordinary working folks as the fed would have to account for that money on its balance sheet that would require the treasury to place on deposit securities of equal value essentially the fed would be financing monetarizing an increase in the national debt to stimulate the economy but cutting out the middleman new federal spending on roads bridges and the like which take so much time to effect recently the fed began offering interest paying deposits to hedge funds and asset managers it seems only fair to let working folks open interest paying accounts at the fed too then when dark clouds gather instead of giving money to banks to squander on big salaries deposit a tidy sum in the account of every american to spend or pay down debt that would get the economy rolling again quickly

shares on wall street were higher after the us reached an agreement with mexico on an effort to contain the flow of mostly central americans across the southern us border and hopes for a rate cut by the federal reserve in new york trade bhp added 0 4 per cent and rio tinto was up 1 1 per cent in a rambling interview on cnbc prompted by an earlier interview on the network of a business group leader with whom he didn t agree president trump threatened again to hit china with more tariffs and renewed his attack on the fed look without tariffs we would be captive to every country and we have been for many years that s why we have an us800 billion trading deficit for years we lose a fortune with virtually every country advertisement as for the fed mr trump reitereated yet again that his advice isn t being put into practice as he critisised the fed for raising rates far too fast and he lamented that china s xi jinping basically is the head of china s central bank and he isn t calling the shots at the fed he can do whatever he wants they devalue they loosen or you would just say they pump a lot of money into china and it nullifies to an extent not fully it nullifies the tariffs while us equities in particular rallied on hopes of rate cut and president trump s decision not to impose tariffs on mexican imports the outlook remains clouded in a morning note morgan stanley s michael wilson said we re modestly adjusting our earnings forecasts to reflect re escalating trade tensions but our broader forecast for a 2400 3000 rangebound s p remains intact fed could cut as soon as july but it may not halt slowdown recession advertisement mr wilson also said the firm s economists recently performed a scenario analysis to assess economic growth in three distinct paths around us china trade tensions their work led them to change their forecasts for global growth to a stagnation through year end rather than a continued recovery sustained escalation and incremental tariffs would further slow growth projections to the point of recession investor optimism for rate cut could be misplaced though investor enthusiasm around the idea of easier fed policy is understandable mr wilson said however if the fed were to cut out of concern that we are entering a real unemployment cycle we think such a cut should not be bought until there is further clarity on the employment picture we think friday s rally should be faded and investors should continue to skew portfolios defensively advertisement rbc capital markets tom porcelli said markets may have run too far ahead despite the market pricing in a very elevated probability of a fed rate cut at the july meeting we still think there is significant uncertainty around this event mr porcelli said indeed the fact that the main variable in the reaction function is seemingly trade tensions with china means more variability should be priced into this outcome mr porcelli said the fed can play the june meeting messaging with some modicum of flexibility with a rate cut conditional on how china us trade negotiations evolve we find it hard to believe that the fed would cut rates if all of a sudden we struck a deal with china and equities were trading at all time highs come the july confab but a deterioration in trade dealings would also increase the risk that the fed s economic growth profile for the second half of 2019 gets a downgrade and the risk that financial conditions deteriorate potential for lower equities wider corporate spreads etc advertisement what makes this outcome difficult to gauge is the significant volatility in the trump administration s behaviour in recent weeks we went from improving trade relations with mexico removing steel tariffs pushing usmca forward to threatening massive tariffs to finally back away from that in other words the tails around the distribution of trade negotiation outcomes are fat today s agenda local nab business conditions and business confidence for

i ve been shouting from the rooftops for six months that the federal reserve is too tight on money and that this lack of dollar liquidity has cut into growth so it is somewhat vindicating that fed chairman jerome powell seems to be finally coming around to that idea the betting markets are now predicting at least one rate cut this year and perhaps two here s the problem once again the fed board has stumbled upon the right conclusion for the wrong reason its rhetoric and tortured logic confuse everyone the reason to cut interest rate targets and the interest the fed pays on bank reserves is that prices are falling for most commodities and many consumer goods for four months running the inflation rate has been below the fed s own stated target of 2 some longer term bonds lower interest rates compared to shorter term bonds the so called inverted yield curve are not a signal of recession but of deflation worries by investors sign up free daily newsletter sign up but powell and others on the board of governors keep saying that they feel compelled to cut interest rates to reverse the negative economic impact of tariffs and because economic growth may be slowing yes tariffs are hurting the economy and yes the growth rate for the second quarter of 2019 is now estimated to be running at less than 2 that s concerning as my former colleague at the wall street journal george melloan pointed out last week the fed can t undo the damage of tariffs by printing money so it shouldn t try as larry kudlow the president s chief economist puts it the fed can print money but it can t print jobs too many economists inside and outside the fed still don t get this just last week larry summers the former chief economist for presidents bill clinton and barack obama argued that the benefits of supporting the economy need to be weighed against the risks of allowing inflation in other words he believes there is an inflation employment trade off this cockamamie phillips curve illogic that too much growth causes inflation and the cure for slow growth is printing more money just won t go away that s why we continually see bewildering headlines that read growth worries spur the fed to lower interest rates all we have to do is go back to last summer when growth reached nearly 4 and yet this prosperity burst was not accompanied by higher prices trump tax cuts and deregulation have increased the supply of goods and services which means lower not higher prices the same thing happened after the reagan tax cuts in 1981 the economy boomed with growth rates as high as 6 and 7 and prices fell from the raging 14 inflation rates under jimmy carter to 3 to 4 throughout the 1980s the performance of the real economy is dictated by policy changes technology innovation labor force growth and so on the fed s interest rate changes and open market operations control the price levels not real economic output fed economists are fixated on the belief that simply printing money can increase growth which is plainly and dangerously wrong this is what the fed tried to do to reduce unemployment in the 1970s and we didn t get jobs we got runaway inflation more recently venezuela and zimbabwe have tried to create prosperity by printing money and it only added to their economic miseries so yes the fed should cut rates now and it should have done so months ago because prices are falling in many sectors better late than never there is no sign of inflation anywhere in the economy today restoring stable prices by increasing dollar liquidity at a time when the whole globe wants dollars can erase the threat of deflation and raise growth rates by as much as half a percentage point which is a lot as most of the rest of the world is effectively pegged to the dollar a more stable dollar will help stimulate moribund growth rates in nations around the globe trump is right to try to drain the fed board of economists who are still peddling dead keynesian ideas about money sound money and a stable dollar on top of the prosperity enhancing effects of deregulation and tax cuts can give us 3 to 4 growth with no inflation for as far as the eye can see just what is jerome powell so afraid of stephen moore is a senior fellow at the heritage foundation and an economic consultant with freedomworks he is the co author of trumponomics inside the america first plan to revive the american economy to find out more about stephen moore and read features by other creators syndicate writers and cartoonists visit the creators syndicate webpage at www creators com copyright 2019 creators com see other political commentaries see other commentaries by stephen moore views expressed in this column are those of the author not those of rasmussen reports comments about this content should be directed to the author or syndicate
it s close to being the ultimate sacrifice for the pakistan army no we re not talking about laying down lives on the fields of battle this sacrifice is about giving up the annual hike in the military budget the move was finally confirmed tuesday when pakistan s minister of state for revenue hammad azhar presented an austerity budget involving all round belt tightening before the budget there d been weeks of stony silence from the military even when it became clear every arm of government faced hefty cuts because the economy is in such pathetic shape under such circumstances could the armed forces budget be left untouched only a few commentators dared suggest the idea the signal the armed forces would bow to what the government described as a critical financial situation came last week when pakistan army chief qamar bajwa declared the military would be foregoing the routine increase in the annual defence budget the armed forces haven t agreed to actual cuts but they ve accepted a seeming freeze and the pampered officer corps will even forego their yearly increments of course pakistan s armed forces pulls in cash under so many different heads it s hard to tell if the spending freeze will actually take effect or not for pakistan going slow on defence spending is an indication of just how big a hole the economy is in the government hopes to hike tax revenues by 35 per cent a tough task in a country where only a fraction pay taxes the economy s grim state was highlighted in the pre budget economic survey the outgoing government fixed ambitious targets for the economy that might never have been possible to attain but they were missed by huge margins the only sector that surpassed targets was livestock which obviously wasn t a huge cause for jubilation gdp growth was a pallid 3 29 per cent compared to the targeted 6 3 per cent for the 2020 financial year growth s been fixed at just 4 per cent industrial growth clocked 1 4 per cent vastly undershooting the 7 6 per cent target services did slightly better at 4 7 per cent but even that fell short of the 6 5 per cent goal agricultural growth crawled at a measly 0 85 per cent no easy money making a pilgrimage to the imf is hardly a new experience for pakistan but this time round the world s a vastly different place from earlier years a hostile washington administration has made good on its threats to cut coalition support funding to the armed forces so one easy money avenue is closed for the moment with washington leaning on it the imf has been extra stern about loan conditions imposed on pakistan significantly last month pakistan appointed raza baqir who worked for the imf for nearly two decades as central bank governor inevitably spurring speculation the imf had sent its viceroy to ensure islamabad stuck to its tough terms the situation has been made worse by prime minister imran khan s initial refusal to accept the economy is well and truly up the creek at first he made it a point of honour pakistan would not go with a begging bowl to the imf and made pilgrimages instead to islamabad s few rich allies like saudi arabia and china as a result of his travels pakistan s received 9 2 billion from saudi arabia china and the uae nevertheless finally khan was forced to concede reality and called in the imf which after tough negotiations offered 6 billion another 2 billion is expected from the asian development bank the imf made it clear it won t be paying the first tranche of cash till its conditions are implemented in the budget the imf has also insisted pakistan s currency find its own level and just before the budget s presentation the rupee fell to 151 92 to a dollar meanwhile the pakistan stock exchange has been in free fall sliding from a 2016 peak of 52 000 to 34 280 on monday in the short run the imf s insistence on belt tightening will only worsen the plights of business and citizens the imf has insisted for instance on an end to exporters tax breaks which is likely to slam industries like textiles edible oil prices have also been hiked pakistan has been working hard to convince its lenders that times have changed and it s working hard to lower tensions with india indeed khan s been making doveish noises trying to cloak himself as a peacemaker compared to the hawkish narendra modi the question is will pakistan s dire economic situation convince the people who matter the armed forces that one way forward would be to abandon its quest to keep pace with india pakistan s defence budget this year is about 11 billion compared to india s 68 billion but india s defence spending is at a more affordable below 2 per cent of gdp by contrast even pakistan s official defence budget is 4 per cent of gdp and that s a very incomplete picture for instance pensions are outside the main military budget and so are anti terrorism funds the forces also get cash from what s called the public sector development programme arms purchases are from some other part of the government budget estimates are defence gobbles up 20 per cent of the government s budget bear in mind pakistan has consistently kept up its defence spending even though economically it s fallen behind its neighbours in 1995 pakistan s exports totalled 11 6 billion that rose to 21 billion by 2017 by contrast bangladesh once the poorer of the two countries had exports worth 34 billion in 2017 and aims to push that to 39 billion this year peace prospects it may be too optimistic to think pakistan s financial woes could ever persuade the military to smoke the peace pipe with india however there are strong external forces at work here the chinese are worried the money being poured into the china pakistan economic corridor will be wasted unless pakistan becomes stable internally a large chunk of chinese investments are being made in khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan two troubled provinces between last july and this april foreign investment nosedived 51 per cent to 1 3 billion a drop of 51 per cent from the year earlier period similarly the americans need pakistan to bring the afghan taliban to the table but they re also less willing than ever to put up with the country s sheltering of terrorists some months ago ex norwegian prime minister magne bondevik travelled to kashmir where he met hurriyat and other leaders soon afterwards bondevik travelled to pakistan prompting a flurry of speculation about back channel negotiations commentators in pakistan forecast the economy will remain feeble for at least three years could that weaken the powers that be to a point where they d be amenable to outside pressures for that to happen the thinking of pakistan s ruling elite would have to undergo a top to bottom sea change

the financial turmoil and debt problems in recent years have reinvigorated the debate about returning to a gold standard particularly as gold prices have risen sharply starting in 1971 the united states refused to redeem its dollars federal reserve notes because excessive government debt and money printing had caused the gold price per ounce in the free market to rise way above the fixed redemption price of gold since the united states dollar was backed by gold up to that point and had gained the status as the most important reserve currency most other countries around the world had already abandoned their own gold standards and instead pegged their currencies to the united states dollar to maintain demand for an unbacked dollar the u s persuaded saudi arabia to price petroleum in dollars on the world market the gold standard for money was used throughout the years of industrial economies in the nineteenth century gold certificates and bills were added to this circulating stock of money based on the value of gold after world war ii the gold standard was replaced by convertible currencies with a fixed exchange rate based on the bretton woods system however gold was used during the period of grecian history before and during the time of homer s life during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries european nations starting minting gold coins rather than their earlier preference of using silver bullion for coinage dating back as far as 600 bc gold has been used as money and to preserve wealth today mints produce gold bars and bullion coins for gold dealers to sell to buyers the first coins with gold were struck in asia minor gold prices are constantly changing which keeps investors checking the price of this precious metal every morning despite this level of speculation gold continues to be the most popular investment precious metal for centuries gold has been a mysterious symbol of value and wealth learn more about gold prices what makes this precious metal coveted by so many people around the world today and about buying gold as an investment the globalist international monetary fund imf in washington d c maintains statistics of national assets

certain platinum group metals have been higher the perception of gold brings to mind wealth and comfort beyond that associated with stocks equities and money buying gold is a way to diversify risks as the stock market can be unpredictable the safest most reliable play on gold prices is to own physical gold however investors also use contracts gold futures and derivatives to build financial portfolio options exposed to gold prices top selling gold bullion what are the benefits of buying gold as an investment commodities are basic goods that can be interchanged with other commodities of the same type in commerce in fact gold is not specifically a currency or a commodity since it has the features of both it is best described as commodity money trading happens on the spot market in addition to the future market used for commodities gold is not reliant on a single central bank or government for this reason precious metal investments are used to hedge against inflation and financial turmoil what is the gold spot price and how is it determined traders determine the spot price of gold on futures exchanges metals contracts change hands in london and shanghai when u s markets are closed but the largest and most influential market for metals prices is the u s comex exchange the quote for immediate settlement at any given time is effectively the spot price or spot contract gold is also priced in the euro indian rupee russian ruble the chinese yuan etc spot paper prices can sometimes diverge from real world pricing in the markets for physical precious metals for many factors during periods of extreme stress in markets it may be impossible to obtain physical metal anywhere near the quoted spot price premiums on retail bullion products may surge as a consequence when the physical gold market diverges from the paper market wholesale over the counter prices may be more realistic than spot prices times of inflation and deflation can affect gold prices and changes may take a while to take effect why does the gold price fluctuate excessive money printing tends to drive gold prices up as more currency units are chasing the same number of gold ounces on the other hand the price of gold does not tend to perform as well as compared to other assets when governments are behaving responsibly and living within their means geopolitical conflict mine supply and demand for gold in jewelry also have an effect on gold prices the money metals website is one of the best sources for news relating to precious metals but so are zerohedge and a few other sites along with some apps an investor will seek to make a profit but there is always a risk of loss with any investment the most successful investors seek updated information daily each week

rely on facts rather than the opinions of a writer at a blog website tweets from a social media account you follow or commentary at the office a random comment may not be valid while facts and figures are verifiable rather than making a quick response to a conversation take the time to do your research for your gold investing portfolio what causes the price of gold to go up a hundred years ago gold sold for just 20 per ounce in recent years gold has traded between 1 200 and 1 900 per ounce that s a huge move up in nominal terms over the past century yet in real terms gold prices today aren t much different from what they were when they were last quoted at 20 an ounce it s not that gold has become so much more expensive it s that the currency in which gold prices are quoted has depreciated so much the us dollar has lost nearly 97 of its value since the federal reserve was created in 1913 over time gold s value in terms of purchasing power stays relatively constant of course there are major cycles wherein gold can gain or lose value dramatically due to supply and demand issues speculation or manipulation but as long as the u s dollar index keeps losing value gold the ultimate money can be expected to ultimately reflect that depreciation by carrying a steadily higher price tag what was the highest price of gold per ounce ever gold spot prices hit an all time high of 1 900 oz in august 2011 however that nominal high wasn t a new high in real terms the january 1980 peak of 850 oz still hasn t been surpassed when adjusted for inflation according to the government s inflation calculator 850 in 1980 dollars translates to 2 475 in 2011 dollars and a purchase price of 2 708 in 2018 dollars these are low end inflation adjustments based on a heavily massaged consumer price index in recent years the cpi has tended to understate real world inflation according to many independent economists so gold could run significantly higher even than the cpi adjusted figures before making a true new high in real terms gold price per gram how many grams are in an ounce of gold one troy ounce of gold is equivalent to 31 1 grams although gold prices are most commonly quoted in ounces gold bullion is also bought and sold by the gram grams can be a more convenient unit for pricing when trading gold in small quantities or using gold for everyday barter transactions better bullion dealers sell gold bullion products by the gram for example pamp suisse and other well regarded mints produce 1 gram gold bars also the royal canadian mint produces packs of 1 gram gold maple leaf coins for purchase what is the dow to gold ratio the dow gold ratio measures how highly valued the stock market is compared to gold the dow gold ratio tends to move lower during both deflationary depressions as in the 1930s and inflationary panics as in the late 1970s at the bottom of the great depression dow gold reached a 1 1 ratio that same 1 1 ratio was briefly reached again in january 1980 when both gold prices and the dow jones industrials sported an 850 handle in 2017 and 2018 the dow gold multiple had a range from 16 to 20 during the next financial crisis that cost ratio is likely to collapse in favor of gold some gold bugs believe a return to 1 1 parity gold being the same price as the dow will happen again a 10 000 dow and 10 000 gold for example may seem far fetched today but during a true panic in markets one or the other price extremes or both simultaneously could be realized ways to purchase gold gold products as an investment are typically purchased in the following three forms gold bullion coins gold bullion bars gold bullion rounds the weight of gold is measured by troy ounce gold can be purchased by the gram in ounces or even by the kilogram kilo in the form of a gold brick since sizes range from an oz to kilos direct physical possession of gold is not required often this gold is stored in a safe with a dealer or at the bank or another facility other options include gold certificates exchange traded fund products etfs gold bullion price derivatives and gold accounts for example contributing to a gold or precious metals ira e g gold ira or

variety of sizes bars may range from a single gram to 100 ounces each rounds and coins are commonly sold in 1 ounce and fractional sizes the main difference between a round and a coin is that the former is produced by a private mint while the latter is produced by a government mint a government minted gold coin like the vienna philharmonic coin from austria europe typically has a legal tender face value attached to it which is considerably less than its metal value specialty products such as jewelry and collector s items are generally not considered to be bullion bullion investors should avoid collectible numismatic coins that carry high premiums over spot prices is gold bullion traceable by the government in almost all cases no dealers do not have to report the transaction to the irs

u s president donald trump s latest twitter missive on financial markets holds water for some currency watchers trump said tuesday that the euro is devalued against the dollar putting the u s at a big disadvantage he may not be wrong the common currency is over 22 undervalued versus the greenback according to the organization for economic cooperation and development s purchasing power parity model and then there s the big mac approach to gauging currency valuations which shows the euro is about 15 too cheap this is because the euro and other currencies are devalued against the dollar putting the u s at a big disadvantage the fed interest rate way too high added to ridiculous quantitative tightening they don t have a clue donald j trump realdonaldtrump june 11 2019 the euro s definitely undervalued on most measures said kit juckes societe generale sa s chief global fx strategist a persistent current account surplus when unemployment is falling makes it hard to argue the currency isn t undervalued the euro briefly dipped following trump s tweet to a daily low of 1 1302 before rebounding to trade little changed at 1 1314 the common currency has weakened about 4 against the greenback over the past 12 months other gauges suggest that valuations haven t skewed too far from historical norms a federal reserve dollar index that s inflation adjusted and trade weighted is about 6 above its 20 year average meanwhile the euro is about 6 below its average since its debut at the start of 1999 it s well within the normal range of valuation said adam cole chief currency strategist at rbc capital markets i don t think there s a policy of maintaining an undervalued currency or holding it at undervalued levels the euro is only a few percentage points undervalued based on proprietary measures that show the exchange rate that would bring consumer prices to equal levels across countries cole said valuation matters the dollar s value is a concern for the u s administration if its strength makes american exports less competitive abroad it s also a worry for monetary policy makers as it tends to restrain import prices working against their efforts to boost inflation fed policy is partly responsible for the euro s valuation according to jane foley head of currency strategy at rabobank international in london the fact that the fed has been the only group of 10 central bank to ratchet up a significant amount of policy normalization since 2015 certainly helped support the usd she said of course it can be argued that trump s tax cuts in 2018 increased the need of the fed to hike last year
on friday at 8 30 am et the bls will release the employment report for may the consensus is for an increase of 180 000 non farm payroll jobs in may and for the unemployment rate to increase to 3 7 last month the bls reported 263 000 jobs added in april here is a summary of recent data the adp employment report showed an increase of only 27 000 private sector payroll jobs in may this was well below the consensus expectations of 175 000 private sector payroll jobs added the adp report hasn t been very useful in predicting the bls report for any one month but in general this suggests employment growth below expectations the ism manufacturing employment index increased in may to 53 7 a historical correlation between the ism manufacturing employment index and the bls employment report for manufacturing suggests that private sector bls manufacturing payroll was mostly unchanged in may the adp report indicated manufacturing jobs decreased 3 000 in may the ism non manufacturing employment index increased in may to 58 1 a historical correlation between the ism non manufacturing employment index and the bls employment report for non manufacturing suggests that private sector bls non manufacturing payroll increased 290 000 in may combined the ism surveys suggest employment gains above the consensus expectations initial weekly unemployment claims averaged 213 000 in may up slightly from april for the bls reference week includes the 12th of the month initial claims were at 211 000 up from 193 000 during the reference week the previous month the increase during the reference week suggests a weaker employment report in may than in april the final april university of michigan consumer sentiment index increased to 100 0 from the april reading of 97 2 sentiment is frequently coincident with changes in the labor market but there are other factors too like gasoline prices and politics conclusion the ism reports combined were strong however the adp was very weak almost opposites both reports suggested manufacturing employment was weak also the increase in unemployment claims during the reference week suggests a weaker report in may than in april usually i put a little more emphasis on the ism reports than the adp report so i m going to ignore the weak adp report could be a mistake and my guess is the employment report will be close to the consensus

the 2020 presidential election is already shaping up to be one of the most bitterly contested in history the outcome could have enormous ramifications for all asset markets including precious metals in the meantime a lot can happen before november 2020 especially with the federal reserve apparently set to turn dovish and cut interest rates this summer some historical research into presidential election cycles suggests that the stock market tends to perform well heading into an election year the incumbent administration tends to focus on padding economic statistics and during election years fed officials who swear up and down they aren t motivated by politics tend to avoid making policy moves such as rate hikes that could make them vulnerable to political attacks gold and silver fared well last time a republican stood for re election gold and silver which are less tied to the economy than stocks show little recent correlation with election years the last time a republican incumbent was up for re election was 2004 incumbent president george w bush faced off against democrat challenger john kerry gold and silver markets performed well in the second half of 2003 and made modest gains in 2004 the metals were in the early stages of a major bull market in 2008 when barack obama and john mccain were vying for the white house the financial crisis hit silver got slammed along with virtually all other assets during that infamous autumn gold however weathered the storm quite well and ended up putting in a gain for the year the stunning election victory of donald trump in 2016 lit a fire under the stock market and put something of a damper on retail demand for physical precious metals in the united states although gold prices are now up since trump s election win and inauguration silver has trended lower and coin and bar demand remains soft compared to the heady years under president obama unlike stocks precious metals tend to benefit from the fear trade if a pro socialist democrat actually wins the white house in 2020 you can bet a lot of investors will decide to hunker down and get defensive gold and silver markets may begin to display an inverse correlation to trends in president trump s poll numbers however larger macro forces now in motion namely steadily rising government debt and accommodative monetary policy will stay in motion through next year s election and beyond regardless of who wins it s only a matter of whether the election results accelerate the debt fueled monetary crisis that is coming if the gop keeps the white house in 2020 it s not necessarily bad news for metals investors recall that when george w bush won re election in november 2004 gold was trading at a mere 450 oz the money metal went on to hit a record 1 000 oz in early 2008 over that same period silver advanced from under 8 oz to over 20 oz importantly precious metals vastly outperformed the stock market through the four years of bush ii s second term radical leftists push democrats to go for broke on spending promises some in the conservative media stamp democrats as suffering from trump derangement syndrome unhinged hatred of the president is only part of what s driving democrats to take increasingly radical positions packing the supreme court abolishing the electoral college abolishing ice censoring the internet medicare for all green new deal etc even before trump the base of the democrat party had been lurching ideologically to the left today democrat candidates are being pushed to reject mixed economy welfare statism and fully embrace socialist doctrines nearly the entire field of democrat presidential candidates has essentially adopted bernie sanders platform one exception former colorado governor john hickenlooper who is running as a pragmatic problem solver with a business background he recently gave a speech to california democrats in which he said socialism was the wrong way to go he was roundly booed meanwhile 76 year old uncle joe biden is disavowing himself to appease far left activists but that is proving to be difficult for him under pressure he suddenly reversed his decades long support of the hyde amendment which bars federal funding of most abortions biden is also trying to play catch up to the trillions in new spending programs proposed by bernie sanders and elizabeth warren clumsily rolling out a partially plagiarized clean energy revolution that would cost the economy at least 5 trillion 2020 prediction winner will embrace more money printing as for senator pocahontas warren has gone off the reservation when it comes to taxing spending and printing currency out of thin air she would pay for her multi trillion dollar progressive wish list by instituting a new wealth tax and pushing the u s dollar lower i e inflation as warren put it her monetary policy vague as it is would entail more actively managing our currency value it sounds like modern monetary theory mmt which is likely coming in one form or another in the years ahead as the government struggles just to pay interest on an exponentially growing debt load under mmt the government would directly print the dollars it needs to close its deficits rather than issue new bonds similar monetary experiments didn t work out so well in zimbabwe and venezuela given president trump s repeated clashes with the federal reserve over what he sees as too tight monetary policy he might be all too willing to support a bipartisan push for a more actively managed more inflationary monetary system investors who are thinking about selling precious metals or refraining from buying until trump leaves office should check their premises

u s president donald trump s latest twitter missive on financial markets holds water for some currency watchers trump said tuesday that the euro is devalued against the dollar putting the u s at a big disadvantage he may not be wrong the common currency is over 22 undervalued versus the greenback according to the organization for economic cooperation and development s purchasing power parity model and then there s the big mac approach to gauging currency valuations which shows the euro is about 15 too cheap this is because the euro and other currencies are devalued against the dollar putting the u s at a big disadvantage the fed interest rate way too high added to ridiculous quantitative tightening they don t have a clue donald j trump realdonaldtrump june 11 2019 the euro s definitely undervalued on most measures said kit juckes societe generale sa s chief global fx strategist a persistent current account surplus when unemployment is falling makes it hard to argue the currency isn t undervalued the euro briefly dipped following trump s tweet to a daily low of 1 1302 before rebounding to trade little changed at 1 1314 the common currency has weakened about 4 against the greenback over the past 12 months other gauges suggest that valuations haven t skewed too far from historical norms a federal reserve dollar index that s inflation adjusted and trade weighted is about 6 above its 20 year average meanwhile the euro is about 6 below its average since its debut at the start of 1999 it s well within the normal range of valuation said adam cole chief currency strategist at rbc capital markets i don t think there s a policy of maintaining an undervalued currency or holding it at undervalued levels the euro is only a few percentage points undervalued based on proprietary measures that show the exchange rate that would bring consumer prices to equal levels across countries cole said valuation matters the dollar s value is a concern for the u s administration if its strength makes american exports less competitive abroad it s also a worry for monetary policy makers as it tends to restrain import prices working against their efforts to boost inflation fed policy is partly responsible for the euro s valuation according to jane foley head of currency strategy at rabobank international in london the fact that the fed has been the only group of 10 central bank to ratchet up a significant amount of policy normalization since 2015 certainly helped support the usd she said of course it can be argued that trump s tax cuts in 2018 increased the need of the fed to hike last year

aaron edmond is seeking the occoquan district supervisor position as a veteran himself edmond places high priority on improving veteran services and affordable housing name aaron c edmond party democrat town lake ridge running for occoquan district supervisor website edmondforsupervisor com facebook twitter work senior executive assistant front office manager education franklin high school somerset nj currently pursuing undergraduate degree in public administration george mason university community involvement despite long days at the pentagon and grueling morning evening commutes i never stopped fighting to get other democrats elected and worked vigorously on several campaigns to flip key seats in the virginia house of delegates i also helped to successfully lobby the prince william county school board to update their non discrimination policy to include gender identity and sexual orientation lastly i independently organized and chaired an ad hoc schools committee comprised of local parents teachers students and elected officials to lobby for more school funding to reduce classroom sizes and get a pay increase for our teachers eagle scout class of 2011 awarded presidential volunteer service award 2012 president obama member of rotary club of lake ridge streetlight ministry volunteer questions and answers pl what are the top three major issues facing the district you wish to represent edmond veteran services education and affordable housing pl what concrete solutions do you propose to address these issues edmond veterans services as a veteran i believe it is our responsibility to keep the promises we have made to those who have served and are currently serving in the united states armed forces having experienced social services in prince william county i will work with the social services department in prince william county to expand help for veterans through veterans assistance programs veterans employment programs mental health services for veterans and programs to combat veterans homelessness as i have crossed the occoquan district a top issue among veterans is that they don t have access to reliable public transportation options to get to doctor s appointments on average missing 2 3 medical appointments due to this major quality of life issue as the next occoquan district supervisor i would like to immediately invest in county run medical transportation vans that can pick vets up at home via constituent request and get vets to the doctor on time i would like to start procuring transportation vans and building up staffing through county revenues and public private partnerships education as a former student representative on the franklin township board of education and as a prince william county democratic committee ad hoc schools committee chair i have an intimate knowledge of the challenges that school boards face to close the achievement gap create equity in education and fund vital programs that contribute to academic success every child no matter where they live in our community deserves access to a quality education regardless of their socioeconomic status or background prince william county is the second largest school district in the commonwealth of virginia we are home to 100 schools and centers employing approximately 11 542 school teachers administrators and staff that serve approximately 90 203 students throughout the county prince william county schools have been ranked among the nation s 100 best communities for young people by america s promise alliance and ing for three years in a row the school system includes 12 high schools 16 middle schools 60 elementary schools 2 traditional schools grades 1 8 1 k 8 elementary middle school 3 special education schools 1 alternative school as the next occoquan district supervisor i am proposing that we focus on several key areas to provide students in prince william county with a world class education these key areas include putting our children first by investing rapidly in capital improvements and creating more equity in our school facilities supporting our teachers as they educate our next generation of leaders looking at innovative ways to increase school division revenues creating and fostering opportunities for educational partnerships to expand opportunities for higher learning funding the expansion of pre k for all prince william county residents working to close the achievement gap ending the school to prison pipeline and funding critical special education programs when we adequately invest in our public school system our teachers are equipped with the best tools to educate the workforce of the future children first capital improvements and equity in school facilities our children s future starts today and we should prioritize their needs first prince william county serves approximately 90 203 students in about 95 different facilities children are often packed into classrooms or trailers due to classroom overcrowding which does not allow for them to maximize their full potential the school division has developed a capital improvements program that begins to address the issues of overcrowding but lags far behind in keeping up with our rapid growth as a county and current school enrollment trends the prince william county school board and the prince william board of county supervisors in recent years have formed a joint capital improvements committee to address reducing classroom trailers and overall capital needs but they have still not managed to solidify a definitive plan to make the reduction of classroom trailers a reality in 2018 they approved a plan that would eliminate 206 classroom trailers at 44 schools but getting this plan funded and added to the capital improvements program has stalled originally the plan would cost prince william county tax payers 159 million and delays in making a final decision have ballooned the cost to 179 million as the next occoquan district supervisor getting this portable classroom reduction plan included in the capital improvements program and having it funded in the fy 2021 county budget will be one of my top priorities i would also like to bring more teachers parents students members of the business community and developers into the conversation to ensure we have a long term plan for smart growth and we create a permanent solution to eliminate classroom overcrowding having our students learning in trailers is not only a safety issue but it has been proven to be a barrier to improved student performance as the next occoquan district supervisor another of my top priorities will be partnering with the prince william county school board and developing public private partnership to bring more steam labs and classrooms to schools throughout prince william county as we look with an eye towards the future and our 2040 comprehensive plan we need to ensure every student has access to explore and develop a love for steam the prince william county school system should be a leader in our commonwealth and that starts with the realization that we need to start investing in steam labs now rather than later when we fund access to dedicated spaces to advanced science technology engineering arts and math we allow our students to think critically and practice high level problem solving regardless of their socioeconomic status or their background making these investments are critical to student development and their success in the 21st century we must also ensure there is equity in funding our school athletic facilities to give our students athletes the best facilities to succeed and compete in an environment that keeps their safety in mind as the next occoquan district supervisor i will work closely with the prince william county school board to expand funding for existing facilities so there is more room for student athletes to practice and will also fund updates to deteriorating facilities in our school system to improve safety and usability across all schools support our teachers many studies have found a correlation between job satisfaction and job performance the correlation is just as significant when discussing our teachers when we ensure that teachers are satisfied our teacher retention rates will be higher and we will see a correlation in student success rates currently the annual salary of a teacher in the county is 59 000 while the average cost of living in the county is 65 000 the disparity in income versus cost of living requires most teachers to work two jobs or seek employment in neighboring counties where they can get a significant pay increase by working closely with the prince william county school board i will continue to push for annual increases in teacher salaries to ensure their salaries meet and are in keeping with the basic cost of living for what our teachers give our children that is the least we can do not only is adequate funding needed for teacher salaries but so is funding for teacher professional development with the changes in the world and in the classroom it is essential that our teachers stay up to date so they can deliver high quality instruction aligned with college and vocational career readiness how do we benefit our students if they aren t entering the world ready to tackle these growing challenges however professional development for teachers is only successful if other items are in place smaller class sizes more support for teachers up to date facilities and equipment etc we must not only train our teachers to be experts in the classroom but we must also empower them to be leaders in prince william county our children are important and are one of our most prized assets let s make sure that everyone has a seat at the table so that we can ensure their access to a world class education increase and diversify local tax revenues to fund school division in virginia school boards do not have taxing authority and are fiscally dependent on their local governments prince william county government collects tax revenue from local sources i e property taxes local sales taxes etc and then transfers a percentage of the revenue to prince william county schools working cooperatively the school division and the board of county supervisors created a revenue sharing agreement the school division currently receives 57 23 percent of the county s general revenues under this agreement the real property tax is the single largest revenue source for prince william county contributing approximately 65 1 percent of general revenues it is levied on all land improvements and leasehold interest on land or improvements collectively called real property except that which has been legally exempted from taxation by the prince william county code and the code of virginia currently our county relies heavily on real property tax revenues from county real estate to keep our general fund for the county budget well funded but we have not adequately encouraged an environment to bring in more commercial revenues from commercial properties in the county as the next occoquan district supervisor i will work hard to diversify our tax revenue base to bring in more commercial revenues to help fund our public school system through our current revenue sharing agreement building educational partnerships as the next occoquan district supervisor i want to continue to build partnerships with the tech medical and major business industries in our local area and with northern virginia community college to create more college career goals for prince william county students by working closely with the prince william county school board i strongly believe that these opportunities will attract more people to our local community and give students an advantage in preparing to go into a competitive career market as the next occoquan district supervisor i would also like to partner with northern virginia community college woodbridge campus to encourage them to place greater emphasis on economic development initiatives to help diversify our local regional economy and create high paying jobs for our community college graduates the perfect way to complete these objectives is to begin a broad conversation on the steps needed to bring a state of the art innovation center to prince william county this innovation center would provide opportunities for nvcc students faculty and staff to collaborate with industry leaders participate in internships and have a dedicated space to experiment with creating their own tech startup companies and inventions lastly as the next occoquan district supervisor i would like to build partnerships with existing colleges universities and trade schools in northern virginia to encourage them to offer reduced tuition rates and registration cost to current prince william county employees expanding opportunities for current county employees to pursue higher education opportunities empowers our county workforce and keeps them competitive in their prospective fields funding the expansion of pre k for all pwc residents as the next occoquan district supervisor i am committed to working with the prince william county school board to ensure we include funding and procure classroom space to expand pre k opportunities for all prince william county students research findings highlight the benefits of expanding access to high quality preschool especially for children who are disadvantaged to improve the long term outcomes for children and their families for children at risk of falling behind in school quality early learning and care programs can help improve their readiness for school and school success with better attendance higher test scores and reduced grade level retention karoly bigelow 2005 reynolds temple ou 2007 other lasting benefits include higher rates of high school completion greater likelihood of attending college and higher lifetime earnings reynolds ou 2011 by reducing grade retention the use of special education and welfare and involvement in crime these quality programs can save between 4 and 17 for every dollar invested reynolds et al 2007 schweinhart et al 2005 even middle income families have difficulty affording center based preschools with the average cost per child estimated at one third of the median annual income in the county burd sharps lewis 2014 as occoquan district supervisor i would like to build countywide interest in universal preschool and work with the prince william county school board to develop a way ahead to make this a reality for our residents not only will this give our students a competitive edge early on and provide our county savings in the long run but it will also provide an economic relief for working class families closing the achievement gap ending the school prison pipeline and special education funding over the last decade the prince william county school system has seen significant demographic changes with increased minority enrollment overall these changes put our county in a unique position to increase achievement levels of minority and low income students and as the next occoquan district supervisor i am committed to creating academic equity across the county and to ensuring we fund the tools to close the achievement gap these investments include adequate county funding for developing a rigorous curriculum increasing academic standards and retaining the best teachers across the country the school the prison pipeline has become an epidemic and has proven to disproportionately affect students of color as the next occoquan district supervisor i am committed to protecting every student s civil right to a quality public education and advocating for the end of zero tolerance policies i would like to work with our local prince william county police department to ensure that our student resource officers receive adequate training to deescalate situations with our students and prioritize keeping students in the classroom so they can continue to receive a world class education more funding for student counselors and psychologists in our school system opposed to armed security guards are critical to students learning in a comfortable environment and not in fear as the next occoquan district supervisor i am committed to providing adequate funding in the budget for our special needs programs in our prince william county school system in addition to adequate funding our gifted and talented specialty programs when funding our local school system it is important that we encourage the school board to differentiate funding based on specific student learning needs distribute funding for special education equitably and provide special education services that result in the effective and efficient delivery of high quality services affordable housing as a member of the united states navy i moved to prince william county in 2013 because of its diversity and the affordable cost of living but i quickly discovered that prince william county like most of northern virginia ranked above the national average for an affordable place to live prince william county is home to more than 463 023 residents that make up over 149 120 households one of the most significant expenses that residents of prince william county incur is their rent or mortgage on average a household makes 101 059 and pays an average of 2 217 27 of income in mortgage and 1 620 20 of income in rent on average a month bureau 2017 with the rising cost of living expenses and average wages and salaries not rising more families are struggling to find an affordable place to live within the county finding a quality and safe place to live shouldn t break the bank for any individual or family in prince william county along with families that are looking for affordable housing in our county a growing homeless population is also looking for shelter according to a 2018 report by the metropolitan washington council of governments cog there are well over 375 homeless individuals in the county as the next occoquan district supervisor on the prince william board of county supervisors i am proposing two initiatives to assist prince william county residents with more affordable housing options the affordable housing trust fund and expanding public private partnerships on a local level creating more affordable housing opportunities means talking equity with an honest and common sense approach housing trust fund with the cost of living rising consistently and the lack of wage and salary increases many individuals find themselves living from paycheck to paycheck zach friedman wrote in his forbes article careerbuilder found that 78 of u s workers are living paycheck to paycheck this number may be further exacerbated by the recent federal government shutdown which has resulted in more than 800 000 federal employees not receiving paychecks friedman 2019 i am proposing a housing trust fund as an initiative to assist lower and middle income individuals and families offset their monthly housing expenses in an emergency financial situation on a case by case basis the unfortunate reality is that many residents in the county are just one missed paycheck or unexpected emergency from homelessness and or financial hardship the key to homelessness prevention is to create a safety net to prevent residents from becoming homeless in the first place addressing homelessness and taking preventive measures can save local government resources and revenues in the long run the housing trust fund is a repository of funding created through a diversion of county tax dollars state funding and grant funds into a central county department such as the prince william county department of housing and community development to loan individuals in need of emergency funding to pay their monthly housing expenses as one of the wealthiest counties in the united states it is our responsibility to ensure that we put the needs of all prince william county residents first and take a hands on approach to homelessness prevention public private partnerships prince william county and the northern virginia region are home to many companies and nonprofits that assist individuals in need while these organizations are successful as individual groups i am proposing that we build more public private partnerships on the county level to bring more affordable housing options to our community and provide more resources to get homeless residents off the streets and into quality housing as the next occoquan district supervisor my goal would be to bring our local county government to the table with all of these entities to create a repository of resources for individuals to utilize when they are in need these private sector companies and organizations would meet with the board of county supervisors and county staff every quarter to assess the most current needs of the community finding solutions to affordable housing and homelessness will involve having everyone at the table from developers nonprofit organizations business owners and government officials as the next occoquan district supervisor i will work towards creating inclusionary housing programs that through county planning ordinances and revised zoning would require or incentivize developers to build below market rate homes and apartment rental units for lower and middle income residents in the county for these inclusionary housing programs to be a success i am committed to working closely with county staff and developers to ensure this initiative is in line with our local economic and housing market characteristics i am committed to finding solutions to lower the cost of living in our community through county revenues and public private partnerships by working together and thinking outside the box we can make our community affordable for everyone pl from your perspective what is the job description of the office you re seeking edmond from my perspective as a supervisor i would work with my fellow board members to oversee the operation of county government in conjunction with the county executive in prince william county the role of a local supervisor to me is being a champion and an ambassador of your district it is the responsibility of a supervisor to be in touch with our constituents on a constant basis this allows for us to best be equipped to relay their concerns to the bocs in the important decision making process of running a local government from social services to budgetary decisions to zoning development to economic development to public safety supervisors have the most power to impact the everyday lives of residents supervisors have to be eager to always learn and master a wide variety of complicated issues topics lastly they need to be able to partner with a wide variety of neighboring county governments municipalities to tackle issues of shared interest like transportation funding major infrastructure projects tackling homelessness and reducing environmental impacts as the next occoquan supervisor i will not be afraid to partner with businesses neighboring governments and local leaders to develop an innovative vision to move prince william county forward pl what expertise will you bring to the office edmond i will bring my lifetime of service and leadership as a public servant in the military to my role as occoquan district supervisor joining the military as an e 1 i led my peers and quickly achieved the rank of e6 within 6 short years i have an unwavering dedication to tackling difficult problems and sticking to the the task at hand becoming an eagle scout has taught me the importance of paying it forward and constantly looking at ways to give back in essence my greatest expertise is knowing what it takes to serve the public at large to do the greatest good as a naval administrator at the highest levels i have gained experience managing millions of dollars of government funds to manage official travel logistics and personnel assignments to critical mission areas at home and abroad pl do you feel that the average citizen is well informed and understands the workings of local government edmond after the 2016 election that caught many voters by surprise i believe the average citizen is more informed than ever and paying close attention to the decision making of elected officials on all levels of government i want to continue to keep my constituents informed by constantly being accessible in the community reaching out to voters must transform into reaching out to constituents regularly after election day i want to leverage social media in the digital age regular op ed pieces in local newspaper outlets telephone town halls in person town halls and quarterly newsletters to keep my constituents informed and give them multiple platforms to provide me with their views opinions on topics that affect them directly in real time i would also like to expand supervisor office hours to saturdays so working families during the week have time to visit my office on the weekends when there schedules might be more flexible pl have you ever made any mistakes in your public life how have they affected you edmond since entering in this race i have never promised to be the perfect candidate and as people we all naturally fall short occasionally but i have quickly learned to learn from your mistakes and use them as a method to better yourself whether you fall short with career goals personal finances family relationships or commitment to a personal endeavor you have to be able to forgive yourself and acknowledge i am greater than my past mistakes i am in this race to prove as politician you shouldn t necessarily strive for perfection but should strive for authenticity and the ability to put the needs of others before your own i want to be a leader that proves that despite your personal shortcomings in life you can always turn the page and step up to lead in your community to make a difference pl our readers want leaders in local government why should they vote for you edmond my life story could have ended in many different ways but through god s grace people dedicated to my success and the art of perseverance i have always made the best of the cards i have been dealt three strong women my great grandmother grandmother and great aunt representing two family generations would teach me the values of good character accountability respect for others hard work and most importantly knowing right from wrong these remarkable women stepped in to fill the gap and if i summed up the meaning of what they taught me it would be do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways that you can as long as you can the strength that they instilled in me and the

new york ap once this trade war cloud gets lifted investors should have little to worry about right monday s market action makes it seem that way stocks around the world climbed after president donald trump withdrew a threat to impose tariffs on mexico at least for now that leaves investors hoping for a deal to soothe the more contentious and complex trade dispute with china which helped sink stocks last month but there are other concerns that shouldn t be overlooked economic trends were already signaling trouble before the latest round of tariff induced fear friday s surprisingly weak jobs report where employers added far fewer jobs than economists expected gave extra pause corporate profits are also under pressure if the administration fixes the problem it created i m sure there will be a short term pop in the stock market said rich weiss chief investment officer of multi asset strategies at american century investments however i believe it s only short term because ultimately that will not remedy the underlying fundamentals which are just not strong of course many along wall street are still forecasting gains for stocks this year much of the optimism rides on analyst forecasts for profit growth to accelerate later this year plus stock prices are looking like better values following their tumble in recent weeks perhaps most importantly the federal reserve has intimated it may come to the market s rescue again and cut interest rates if the trade war swamps the economy but skeptics say optimists aren t looking closely enough at all the troubles getting overshadowed by trade disputes among the concerns advertising slowing economic growth even before the latest trade skirmishes the bright spots for the u s economy are still clear the job market is solid as long as friday s disappointing report doesn t herald something more lasting the unemployment rate at 3 6 is at its lowest since 1969 and consumers are feeling relatively confident that s key when consumer spending accounts for two thirds of the economy but skeptics point to other recent economic reports that showed weakness in april before this latest round of trade worries flared up among them another drop in north american freight shipments slower manufacturing growth than economists expected and weaker business spending on equipment michael wilson equity strategist at morgan

the policy interest rates of advanced country central banks are stuck at uncomfortably low levels and not just for the moment a growing body of evidence suggests that this awkward condition is likely to persist inflation in the us europe and japan continues to undershoot official targets measures of the natural rate of interest consistent with normal economic conditions have been trending downward for years estimates of the natural rate for the us currently put it in the range of 2 25 2 5 in other words just where the federal reserve s policy rate is lodged this means that the fed has little scope for tightening without missing its inflation target and endangering economic growth and what is true of the fed is truer still of the european central bank and the bank of japan this ceiling on the feasible level of interest rates means that when the next recession hits central banks will have little scope for reducing them to be sure certain creative members of the central banking community have experimented with negative interest rates but scholarly post mortems suggest that negative rates adversely affect commercial banks profitability and weaken the banking system it follows that risk averse central bankers will be loath to repeat these experiments thus when the next recession hits central banks will again be forced to resort to quantitative easing qe4 if we can call it that will elicit howls of protest from the critics of previous rounds of qe who warned that central banks were exceeding their mandates by purchasing mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds the detractors complained central banks were distorting financial markets by engaging in maturity extension operations they were destroying the information content of the yield curve by expanding their balance sheets they were exposing themselves to the risk of capital losses disapproving politicians questioned whether central bankers could be entrusted to carry out this expanding range of transactions without adult supervision by the public s designated representatives namely themselves it followed as sure as night follows day that central banks independence came under increasingly hostile political attack the lesson drawn by those who set great store by central bank independence is that qe should have been avoided last time and is best avoided in the future because it opens the door to political interference with the conduct of monetary policy another criticism of qe especially prevalent in europe is that it creates moral hazard for governments but qe s opponents should consider the alternative absent this support from advanced country central banks following the global financial crisis a debilitating deflation might have set in and the post crisis recession would have been more severe what would the critics have said then it seems unlikely that central bank independence would have survived the even more damning accusation justified in the event that monetary policymakers were asleep at the switch another criticism of qe especially prevalent in europe is that it creates moral hazard for governments central banks purchases of government securities artificially depress the cost of borrowing normally governments issuing additional debt see their borrowing costs rise which discourages them from overdoing it in particular market discipline in the form of higher interest rates will cause a government like italy s tempted to increase deficit spending to think twice not so however when the central bank acts as bond buyer of last resort and is prepared to purchase government securities without limit in such circumstances market discipline will be incapacitated populist leaders predisposed to ignore budget constraints and promising lavish transfers to their constituents will then have more room to run the economy will experience an immediate sugar high as a result of the additional public spending solidifying support for the political incumbents but as the american economist herbert stein famously observed something that can t go on forever ultimately won t in the long run either debt default or debt monetisation and inflation will inevitably result from populist profligacy sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk it is better the implication follows for central banks to resist the siren song of qe governments will then feel pressure to live within their means if populist leaders nevertheless implement their characteristically irresponsible fiscal policies financial markets will take them to task if investors sell off massively on the populists watch their political support will collapse again however one must consider the alternative if central banks shun qe in the next downturn the resulting output collapse will be more severe populist politicians arguing that mainstream leaders and their appointees are not reliable stewards of the economy will have more evidence to invoke and more anger to channel when they campaign for office with populists heading more governments budget deficits will be larger not smaller instability will be greater not less the critics of qe are right to warn of unintended consequences but shunning qe may have unintended consequences as well the critics should be careful what they wish for barry eichengreen is professor of economics at the university of california berkeley and a former senior policy adviser at the international monetary fund project syndicate
new york once this trade war cloud gets lifted investors should have little to worry about right monday s market action makes it seem that way stocks around the world climbed after president donald

menafn jordan times alexandria united states in a recent project syndicate commentary james k galbraith of the university of texas at austin defends modern monetary theory mmt and corrects some misunderstandings about the relationships among mmt federal deficits and central bank independence but galbraith does not explore what is perhaps the most important issue of all the political conditions needed to implement mmt effectively mmt owes its newfound relevance to the fact that deflation rather than inflation is becoming central banks main concern for a high debt high deficit economy like the united states deflation is an especially serious threat because it delays consumption and increases debtor anxiety consumers forego major purchases on the assumption that future prices will be lower homeowners with mortgages cut back their spending when they see home prices falling and the equity in their homes declining these cutbacks worry the federal reserve fed because they add to deflationary pressures and could trigger deeper spending cuts stock market declines and widespread deleveraging the fed s inability so far to reach its 2 per cent target for annual inflation suggests that it lacks the means to overcome persistent disinflationary forces in the economy these forces include increased us market concentration which diminishes aggregate demand by weakening employee bargaining power and increasing income inequality population aging inadequate investment in infrastructure and climate change abatement and technology driven labour displacement making matters worse us political gridlock assures continued commitment to economically exhausted strategies such as tax cuts for the rich at the expense of investing in education and other sources of long term growth these conditions cry out for significant changes in us government spending and tax policies mmt is seen as a way to accomplish the needed changes it holds that a government can spend as much as it wants if it borrows in its own currency and its central bank can buy as much of the government s debt as necessary as long as doing so does not generate unacceptably high inflation both tax cut advocates and supporters of public investment find little not to like mmt has been roundly criticised by economists across the political spectrum from kenneth rogoff and lawrence h summers of harvard university to paul krugman of the city university of new york all contend that it is a political argument masquerading as economic theory but galbraith and ray dalio of bridgewater associates see mmt differently dalio argues that mmt is real and more to the point it is an inevitable policy step in historically recurring debt cycle downturns in his book principles for navigating big debt crises dalio documents the steps that central banks have historically taken when faced with a booming economy that suddenly crumples under the weight of debt the first step monetary policy one mp1 is to cut overnight official rates to stimulate credit and investment expansion the second mp2 is to buy government debt quantitative easing to support asset prices and prevent uncontrollable waves of deleveraging if mp1 and mp2 are insufficient to halt a downturn central banks take step three mmt which dalio calls mp3 and proceed to finance the spending priorities that political leaders deem most essential the priorities can range from financing major national projects to helicopter money transfers directly to consumers achieving political agreement on what to finance and how is essential for implementing mp3 effectively in a financial meltdown or other national emergency political unity and prompt action are essential unity requires a strong consensus on what should be financed speed requires the existence of a trusted institution to direct the spending in the early 1940s when the us entered world war ii and winning the war became the government s top priority the fed entered full mp3 mode it not only set short and long term rates for treasury bonds but also bought as much government debt as necessary to finance the war effort mp3 was possible because the war united the country politically and gave the roosevelt administration near authoritarian rule over the economy the core weakness of mp3 mmt advocacy is the absence of an explanation of how to achieve political unity on what to finance and how this absence is inexcusable total us debt as a share of gdp is approaching levels associated with past financial meltdowns and that does not even account for the hidden debts associated with infrastructure maintenance rising sea levels and unfunded pensions for the reasons dalio lays out a us debt crisis requiring some form of mp3 is all but inevitable the crucial question that any effort to achieve political unity must answer is what constitutes justifiable spending alexander hamilton america s first secretary of the treasury offered an answer in 1781 a national debt he wrote if it is not excessive will be to us a national blessing a government s debt is excessive if it cannot be repaid because its proceeds were spent in ways that did not increase national wealth enough to do so debt resulting from tax cuts that are spent on mega yachts would almost certainly be excessive debt incurred to improve educational outcomes maintain essential infrastructure or address climate change would probably not be accordingly it will be easier to achieve political unity if mp3 proceeds are spent on priorities such as education infrastructure or climate the political test for justifying mp3 financed government spending is clear will future generations judge that the borrowing was not excessive most americans born well after world war ii would say that the debt incurred to win that war was justified as was the debt that financed the construction of the interstate highway system which literally paved the way for stronger growth as the 1930s and 1940s show mp3 is a natural component of government responses to major debt downturns and the political crises they trigger we know much more about what contributes to economic growth and sustainability than we did in the first half of the 20th century to speed recovery from the next downturn we need to identify now the types of spending that will contribute most to sustainable recovery and that in hindsight will be viewed as most justified by future americans we need also to design the institutions that will direct the spending these are the keys to building the political unity that mmt requires to know what to finance and how future americans can show us the way we need only put ourselves in their shoes robert h dugger is managing partner at hanover provident capital llc copyright project syndicate

washington us president donald trump said on monday he was ready to impose another round of punitive tariffs on chinese imports if he cannot make progress in trade talks with china s president at a group of 20 summit later this month since two days of talks to resolve the us china trade dispute last month in washington ended in a stalemate trump has repeatedly said he expected to meet president xi jinping at the june 28 29 summit in osaka japan china has not confirmed any such meeting trump said last week he would decide after the meeting of the leaders of the world s largest economies whether to carry out a threat to impose tariffs on at least 300 billion in chinese goods in comments to reporters on monday trump said he still thought the meeting with xi would happen we are scheduled to talk and to meet i think interesting things will happen let s see what happens trump told reporters at the white house the united states has already imposed 25 tariffs on 250 billion worth of goods china s foreign ministry said on monday that china is open to more trade talks with washington but has nothing to announce about a possible meeting tensions between washington and beijing rose sharply in may after the trump administration accused china of having reneged on promises to make structural economic changes during months of trade talks the united states is seeking sweeping changes including an end to forced technology transfers and theft of us trade secrets it also wants curbs on subsidies for chinese state owned enterprises and better access for us firms in chinese markets on may 10 trump raised tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods up to 25 and took steps to levy duties on an additional 300 billion in chinese imports beijing retaliated with tariff hikes on a revised list of 60 billion in us goods the us government has also angered china by putting huawei technologies co ltd on a blacklist that effectively bans us companies from doing business with the chinese firm the world s biggest telecoms equipment maker investors worry china will retaliate by putting us companies on a blacklist or banning exports to the united states of rare earth metals which are used in products such as memory chips rechargeable batteries and cell phones fitch ratings said on monday any such move would be disruptive to the us technology sector and could hurt some chinese sectors as well though it added that it was too early to assess potential credit implications in an interview with cnbc trump said the huawei dispute could be addressed as part of a trade deal with china deal with mexico the escalating trade war between the world s two largest economies has unnerved financial markets with worries that it could further disrupt global manufacturing and supply chains and push an already slowing global economy into recession on sunday international monetary fund managing director christine lagarde said resolving the current trade tensions should be the top priority for g20 economies china reported on monday its exports unexpectedly grew 1 1 per cent in may from a year ago despite the higher us tariffs but imports fell the most in nearly three years some analysts suspect chinese exporters may have rushed out shipments to the united states to avoid potential new us tariffs many us business groups oppose the tariffs with companies worried about slowing demand as they pass higher prices along to consumers and manufacturers across a range of products late last month trump said he would impose tariffs on mexican goods if mexico did not agree to take strong steps to curb the flow of mostly central american migrants crossing the us mexico border washington and mexico city reached a deal on friday to avert the tariffs removing for the time being at least the prospect that the united states would find itself in trade wars with two of its three largest trading partners global equities rose on monday and the us dollar gained against a basket of currencies the mexican peso rose more than 2 against the greenback reversing most of its losses from the past couple of weeks trump who has embraced protectionism as part of an america first agenda said on monday the tariff threat on mexico would be reinstated if mexico s congress did not ratify another part of the migration pact
there is good news and bad news about us president donald trump the good news is he has not initiated a military war apart from bombing a few empty tarmacs in syria the bad news is he is setting the world alight with his economic war the globe is being split into two with australia nervously sitting between the two sides america and china at least we have a trade deficit with america so are not an immediate target but we might want to consider becoming more self sufficient and broadening our industrial base the list of countries trump is targeting with sanctions tariffs or threats is impressive the trade war with china is intensifying given that a substantial slice of america s industry base is located there this must be seriously concerning for corporate america especially a company like apple the ban on the chinese tech giant huawei may ultimately split the world s digital infrastructure into two camps especially if huawei decides to develop its own operating system trump has ended india s designation as a developing nation which allowed it to export over 2000 products duty free japan is being threatened with tariffs on its automobile exports europe has been subjected to tariffs with more coming that is how the allies or neutrals are being treated the enemies are being hit with sanctions iran is the main target and america is taking aim at any allies who don t comply when europe decided to remain in the nuclear agreement with iran after america pulled out a new exchange instex was established to allow transactions america s response threatening to block european access to swift the telecommunications architecture for international finance and the primary vehicle for the global domination of the us dollar america is also demanding that germany stop the nord stream 2 natural gas pipeline being laid from russia under the baltic sea to force germany to take more expensive american gas instead a bill to sanction any company involved in nord stream 2 is being prepared by the us congress another war front is america s siege of venezuela which is nothing more than a flagrant grab for the world s largest oil reserves public enemy number one russia is also subject to extreme sanctions but the effect there is mixed according to oliver bullough in his book moneyland about half russia s net wealth is offshore a lot of that money is going back before it is acquired by

menafn baystreet ca a month or so ago u s president donald trump extracted a promise from saudi arabia that it would pump more oil to mitigate the risk of oil price spikes resulting from the end to waivers on iranian oil exports there was scepticism at the time about the saudi willingness and or ability to make good on this promise but last week oil entered official bear market territory defined by a drop of 20 or more in prices from the most recent high according to historical market data the average bear market for crude oil lasts 60 trading days so the question now is with opec and non opec oil producers nopec meetings on the 25th and 26th of june can trump still trust the saudis to do their part in keeping prices on the low side in fact as oilprice com reveals trump cannot lose whether the saudis keep their promise or not from the u s perspective there are two key reasons defining this no lose position the first being economic the second geopolitical the economic reason is that despite the u s economy continuing to perform robustly over the first quarter of this year better than consensus economic growth of 3 2 many feel that a recession may be around the corner in this context has been cited the fall in the ihs markit u s manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi for may by more than two points to 50 5 the lowest level since september 2009 and the seasonally adjusted u s retail sales figure dropping by 0 2 in april from the previous month for the second time in three months beneath this is the economic uncertainty attached to the u s s ongoing trade war with china which equally negatively affects the perennially dubious growth figures that flow out of beijing a key link between the u s s ongoing economic recovery and the oil price is the price of gasoline with the rule of thumb being that every us 10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil results in a us 0 25 change in the price of a gallon of gasoline in turn the american automobile association in washington has stated that for every us 0 01 that the average price of gasoline falls more than us 1 billion per year in additional consumer spending is freed up the point was underlined by bob mcnally the former energy adviser to the former president george w bush that few things terrify an american president more than a spike in fuel prices this is the principal reason why whenever there is a spike in the wti oil price the trump price cap comment kicks in as evidenced most recently when wti oil spiked through the key us 65 00 pb technical resistance level when he tweeted very important that opec increase the flow of oil world markets are fragile price of oil getting too high thank you the geopolitical reason relates to the various breakeven prices in the global crude oil market of its major producers by exploiting the differences in the differing points of relative economic pain the u s is seeking to drive a wedge between the recently burgeoning relationship between the de facto leader of opec saudi arabia and the de facto leader of nopec russia past that the u s is perfectly happy as well to break up opec once and for all to begin with saudi arabia needs an oil price above us 84 per barrel of brent to balance its budget and it needs to move into sustained surplus territory in order to redress the disastrous effects of its attempt from 2014 to 2016 to destroy the then nascent u s shale oil industry recently and partly a result of the success of the current opec plan saudi arabia posted a budget surplus of sar27 8 billion us 7 4 billion for the first quarter of this year the first such surplus since saudi arabia instigated its anti shale strategy in 2015 it recorded a near catastrophic budget deficit of 14 8 of gdp then 12 8 of gdp in 2016 then a slight improvement to a deficit of 8 9 of gdp in 2017 before it worsened again last year with a deficit of 9 2 of gdp so bad was saudi arabia s financial situation as a result of the half baked shale destruction strategy that the kingdom was forced to spend around us 250 billion of its precious foreign exchange reserves in just 2014 and 2015 that even senior saudis said are lost forever it also led to the unheard of criticism by a senior saudi the country s then deputy economic minister mohamed al tuwaijri in october 2016 that if we don t take any reform measures and if the global economy stays the same then we re doomed to bankruptcy in three to four years as it is by the saudi s own estimation despite the first quarter blip up it will not make another annual surplus until 2023 at the earliest for russia there has been a shift in recent weeks on extending its agreement to cut its oil production in tandem with opec russia s finance minister anton siluanov recently said there is a dilemma what should we do with opec should we lose the market which is being occupied by the americans or quit the deal this came on the back of similar expressions by russian oil giant rosneft that object to losing market share to the u s by dint of the production cuts separately christopher granville managing director of global political research for ts lombard in london told oilprice com russia s president vladimir putin reminded his audience at a moscow investment conference that russia s fiscal policy is framed around a us 40 per barrel price based on the estimated us 35 45 per barrel marginal cost of producing shale oil in the u s indeed andrew dittmar a senior drillinginfo oil and gas mergers and acquisitions analyst in austin texas told oilprice com there has been a lot of talk recently about a slowing in the u s shale sector but that is just part of the natural business cycle for any business initially a business puts all of its capital into exploration and production and then it tweaks the capital expenditure to reward investors in the business from free cash flow in the form of dividends or share buybacks he said shale is still working to convince wall street that it can make the shift to shareholder returns but within the industry it has won over smart long term oil giants such as chevron and exxon in a major endorsement of a bright future he added according to recent projections from the us energy information administration eia permian production could double from its current level of nearly 4 million bpd mbpd to at least 8 mbpd within the next four years shale will also be instrumental in pushing up u s crude oil production to an average 12 45 mbpd this year and to 13 38 mbpd next year according to the eia effectively this means that the u s cannot lose the current manoeuvre from its global oil playbook either saudi continues to toe the line on prices in which case the u s benefits economically immediately or it does not and the u s moves to destroy the opec cartel quite quickly the mechanism for this the no oil producing and exporting cartels act nopec bill is already in place and the only thing standing in the way of the bill going through is the veto of president trump being broadly supported in both the u s house of representatives and senate the bill would allow individual opec member states or the group as a whole to be sued for cartel like activity under existing u s antitrust legislation if saudi continues to toe the line on averting oil supply tightness and corollary price spikes then the president is likely to continue to veto it according to u s political sources if it did not then not only would it face the prospect of anti trust opec related lawsuits but also would likely see a pick up in the tempo of the civil lawsuits currently ranged against it for its alleged role in the 9 11 terrorist attacks on the u s this follows the overriding on 28 september 2017 by the u s congress of former president barack obama s veto of the justice against sponsors of terrorism act jasta making it possible for victims families to sue the government of saudi arabia within a short space of time there were seven major lawsuits in federal courts alleging saudi government support and funding for the 9 11 terrorist attack based on the fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers were saudi nationals the extremely poor reputation of saudi arabia that was stoked by this even before the alleged state sponsored murder of journalist jamal khashoggi is believed to be a key reason why saudi did not go ahead with retaining the new york stock exchange as a key overseas listing destination for the aramco ipo when it was first mooted the lawsuits would open up saudi s us 1 trillion or so of assets in the u s to be seized in restitution by simon watkins for oilprice com menafn1106201902120000id1098629103
globalization is in trouble a populist backlash personified by u s president donald trump is in full swing a simmering trade war between china and the united states could easily boil over countries across europe are shutting their borders to immigrants even globalization s biggest boosters now concede that it has produced lopsided benefits and that something will have to change today s woes have their roots in the 1990s when policymakers set the world on its current hyperglobalist path requiring domestic economies to be put in the service of the world economy instead of the other way around in trade the transformation was signaled by the creation of the world trade organization in 1995 the wto not only made it harder for countries to shield themselves from international competition but also reached into policy areas that international trade rules had not previously touched agriculture services intellectual property industrial policy and health and sanitary regulations even more ambitious regional trade deals such as the north american free trade agreement took off around the same time in finance the change was marked by a fundamental shift in governments attitudes away from managing capital flows and toward liberalization pushed by the united states and global organizations such as the international monetary fund and the organization for economic cooperation and development countries freed up vast quantities of short term finance to slosh across borders in search of higher returns at the time these changes seemed to be based on sound economics openness to trade would lead economies to allocate their resources to where they would be the most productive capital would flow from the countries where it was plentiful to the countries where it was needed more trade and freer finance would unleash private investment and fuel global economic growth but these new arrangements came with risks that the hyperglobalists did not foresee although economic theory could have predicted the downside to globalization just as well as it did the upside increased trade with china and other low wage countries accelerated the decline in manufacturing employment in the developed world leaving many distressed communities behind the financialization of the global economy produced the worst financial crisis since the great depression and after the crash international institutions promoted policies of austerity that made the damage even worse more and more of what happened to ordinary people seemed the result of anonymous market forces or caused by distant decision makers in foreign countries politicians and policymakers downplayed these problems denying that the new terms of the global economy entailed sacrificing sovereignty yet they seemed immobilized by these same forces the center right and the center left disagreed not over the rules of the new world economy but over how they should accommodate their national economies to them the right wanted to cut taxes and slash regulations the left asked for more spending on education and public infrastructure both sides agreed that economies needed to be refashioned in the name of global competitiveness globalization exclaimed u s president bill clinton is the economic equivalent of a force of nature like wind or water british prime minister tony blair mocked those who wanted to debate globalization saying you might as well debate whether autumn should follow summer yet there was nothing inevitable about the path the world followed beginning in the 1990s international institutions played their part but hyperglobalization was more a state of mind than a genuine immutable constraint on domestic policy before it came along countries had experimented with two very different models of globalization the gold standard and the bretton woods system the new hyperglobalization was closer in spirit to the historically more distant and more intrusive gold standard that is the source of many of today s problems it is to the more flexible principles of bretton woods that today s policymakers should look if they are to craft a fairer and more sustainable global economy the golden straitjacket for roughly 50 years before world war i plus a brief revival during the interwar period the gold standard set the rules of economic management a government on the gold standard had to fix the value of its national currency to the price of gold maintain open borders to finance and repay its external debts under all circumstances if those rules meant the government had to impose what economists would today call austerity so be it however great the damage to domestic incomes and employment that willingness to impose economic pain meant it was no coincidence that the first self consciously populist movement arose under the gold standard at the tail end of the nineteenth century the people s party gave voice to distressed american farmers who were suffering from high interest rates on their debt and declining prices for their crops the solution was clear easier credit enabled by making the currency redeemable in silver as well as gold if the government allowed anyone with silver bullion to convert it into currency at a set rate the supply of money would increase driving up prices and easing the burden of the farmers debts but the northeastern establishment and its backing for the gold standard stood in the way frustrations grew and at the 1896 democratic national convention william jennings bryan a candidate for the presidential nomination famously declared you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold william jennings bryan campaigning in 1896 library of congress the gold standard survived the populist assault in the united states thanks in part to fortuitous discoveries of gold ore that eased credit conditions after the 1890s nearly four decades later the gold standard would be brought down for good this time by the united kingdom under the pressure of similar grievances after effectively suspending the gold standard during world war i the united kingdom returned to it in 1925 at its pre war rate but the british economy was only a shadow of its pre war self and four years later the crash of 1929 pushed the country over the edge business and labor demanded lower interest rates which under the gold standard would have sent capital fleeing abroad this time however the british government chose the domestic economy over the global rules and abandoned the gold standard in 1931 two years later franklin roosevelt the newly elected u s president wisely followed suit as economists now know the sooner a country left the gold standard the sooner it came out of the great depression the experience of the gold standard taught the architects of the postwar international economic system chief among them the economist john maynard keynes that keeping domestic economies on a tight leash to promote international trade and investment made the system more not less fragile accordingly the international regime that the allied countries crafted at the bretton woods conference in 1944 gave governments plenty of room to set monetary and fiscal policy central to this system were the controls it put on international capital mobility as keynes emphasized capital controls were not merely a temporary expedient until financial markets stabilized after the war they were a permanent arrangement each government fixed the value of its currency but it could adjust that value when the economy ran up against the constraint of international finance the bretton woods system was predicated on the belief that the best way to encourage international trade and long term investment was to enable national governments to manage their economies it is to the more flexible principles of bretton woods that today s policymakers should look if they are to craft a fairer and more sustainable global economy bretton woods covered only international monetary and financial arrangements rules for trade developed in a more ad hoc manner under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt but the same philosophy applied countries were to open up their economies only to the extent that this did not upset domestic social and political bargains trade liberalization remained limited to lowering border restrictions import quotas and tariffs on manufactured goods and applied only to developed countries developing countries were essentially free to do what they wanted and even developed countries had plenty of flexibility to protect sensitive sectors when in the early 1970s a rapid rise in garment imports from developing countries threatened employment in the developed world developed and developing nations negotiated a special regime that allowed the former to reimpose import quotas compared with both the gold standard and the subsequent hyper globalization the bretton woods and gatt rules gave countries great freedom to choose the terms on which they would participate in the world economy advanced economies used that freedom to regulate and tax their economies as they wished and to build generous welfare states unhindered by worries of global competitiveness or capital flight developing nations diversified their economies through trade restrictions and industrial policies domestic autonomy from global economic pressures might sound like a recipe for less globalization but during the bretton woods era the global economy was on a tear developed and developing economies alike grew at unprecedented rates trade and foreign direct investment expanded even faster outpacing the growth of world gdp the share of exports in global output more than tripled from less than five percent in 1945 to 16 percent in 1981 this success was a remarkable validation of keynes idea that the global economy functions best when each government takes care of its own economy and society back to the spirit of the gold standard ironically the hyperglobalists used the very success of the bretton woods system to legitimize their own project to displace it if the shallow bretton woods arrangements had done so much to lift world trade investment and living standards they argued imagine what deeper integration could achieve but in the process of constructing the new regime the central lesson of the old one was forgotten globalization became the end national economies the means economists and policymakers came to view every conceivable feature of domestic economies through the lens of global markets domestic regulations were either hidden trade barriers to be negotiated away through trade agreements or potential sources of trade competitiveness the confidence of financial markets became the paramount measure of the success or failure of monetary and fiscal policy the premise of the bretton woods regime had been that the gatt and other international agreements would act as a counterweight to powerful protectionists at home labor unions and firms serving mainly the domestic market by the 1990s however the balance of political power in rich countries had swung away from the protectionists toward exporter and investor lobbies the trade deals that emerged in the 1990s reflected the strength of those lobbies the clearest illustration of that power came when international trade agreements incorporated domestic protections for intellectual property rights the result of aggressive lobbying by pharmaceutical firms eager to capture profits by extending their monopoly power to foreign markets to this day big pharma is the single largest lobby behind trade deals international investors also won special privileges in trade agreements allowing them and only them to directly sue governments in international tribunals for alleged violations of their property rights big banks with the power of the u s treasury behind them pushed countries to open up to international finance those who lost out from hyper globalization received little support many manufacturing dependent communities in the united states saw their jobs shipped off to china and mexico and suffered serious economic and social consequences ranging from joblessness to epidemics of drug addiction in principle workers hurt by trade should have been compensated through the federal trade adjustment assistance program but politicians had no incentives to fund it adequately or to make sure it was working well economists were brimming with confidence in the 1990s about globalization as an engine of growth the game was to encourage exports and attract foreign investment do that and the gains would prove so large that everyone would eventually win this technocratic consensus served to legitimize and further reinforce the power of globalizing corporate and financial special interests an important element of hyper globalist triumphalism was the belief that countries with different economic and social models would ultimately converge if not on identical models at least on sufficiently similar market economy models china s admission to the wto in particular was predicated on the expectation in the west that the state would give up directing economic activity the chinese government however had different ideas it saw little reason to move away from the kind of managed economy that had produced such miraculous results over the previous 40 years western investors complaints that china was violating its wto commitments and engaging in unfair economic practices fell on deaf ears regardless of the legal merits of each side s case the deeper problem lay elsewhere the new trade regime could not accommodate the full range of institutional diversity among the world s largest economies a saner globalization policymakers can no longer resuscitate the bretton woods system in all its details the world can t and shouldn t go back to fixed exchange rates pervasive capital controls and high levels of trade protection but policymakers can draw on its lessons to craft a new healthier globalization trump s in your face unilateralism is the wrong way forward politicians should work to revive the multilateral trade regime s legitimacy rather than squelching it the way to achieve that however is not to further open markets and tighten global rules on trade and investment barriers to trade in goods and many services are already quite low the task is to ensure greater popular support for a world economy that is open in essential respects even if it falls short of the hyperglobalist ideal if china and the united states are to resolve their trade conflict they need to acknowledge that the differences between their economies are not going away building that support will require new international norms that expand the space for governments to pursue domestic objectives for rich countries this will mean a system that allows them to reconstitute their domestic social contracts the set of rules that permit countries to temporarily protect sensitive sectors from competition badly needs reform for example the wto allows countries to impose temporary tariffs known as antidumping duties on imports being sold by a foreign company below cost that threaten to harm a domestic industry the wto should also let governments respond to so called social dumping the practice of countries violating workers rights in order to keep wages low and attract production an anti social dumping regime would permit countries to protect not merely industry profits but labor standards too for developing countries the international rules should accommodate governments need to restructure their economies to accelerate growth the wto should also loosen the rules on subsidies investment and intellectual property rights that constrain developing countries ability to boost particular industries if china and the united states are to resolve their trade conflict they need to acknowledge that the differences between their economies are not going away the chinese economic miracle was built on industrial and financial policies that violated key tenets of the new hyperglobalist regime subsidies for preferred industries requirements that foreign companies transfer technology to domestic firms if they wanted to operate in china pervasive state ownership and currency controls the chinese government is not going to abandon such policies now what u s companies see as the theft of intellectual property is a time honored practice in which a young united states itself engaged back when it was playing catch up with industrializing england in the nineteenth century for its part china must realize that the united states and european countries have legitimate reasons to protect their social contracts and homegrown technologies from chinese practices taking a page from the u s soviet relationship during the cold war china and the united states should aim for peaceful coexistence rather than convergence in international finance countries should reinstate the norm that domestic governments get to control the cross border mobility of capital especially of the short term kind the rules should prioritize the integrity of domestic macroeconomic policies tax systems and financial regulations over free capital flows the international monetary fund has already reversed its categorical opposition to capital controls but governments and international institutions should do more to legitimize their use for example governments can make their domestic economies more stable by using countercyclical capital regulation that is restricting capital inflows when the economy is running hot and taxing outflows during a downturn governments should also crack down on tax evasion by the wealthy by establishing a global financial registry that would record the residence and nationality of shareholders and the actual owners of financial assets left to its own devices globalization always creates winners and losers a key principle for a new globalization should be that changes in its rules must produce benefits for all rather than the few economic theory contributes an important idea here it suggests that the scope for compensating the losers is much greater when the barrier being reduced is high to begin with from this perspective whittling away at the remaining mostly minor restrictions on trade in goods or financial assets does not make much sense countries should focus instead on freeing up cross border labor mobility where the barriers are far greater indeed labor markets are the area that offers the strongest economic case for deepening globalization expanding temporary work visa programs especially for low skilled workers in advanced economies would be one way to go proposing greater globalization of labor markets might seem to fly in the face of the usual concern that increased competition from foreign workers will harm low skilled workers in advanced economies and it may well be a political nonstarter in the united states and western europe right now if governments aren t proposing to compensate those who lose out they should take this concern seriously but the potential economic gains are huge even a small increase in cross border labor mobility would produce global economic gains that would dwarf those from the completion of the entire current long stalled round of multilateral trade negotiations that means there s plenty of scope for compensating the losers for example by taxing increased cross border labor flows and spending the proceeds directly on labor market assistance programs in general global governance should be light and flexible allowing governments to choose their own methods of regulation countries trade not to confer benefits on others but because trade creates gains at home when those gains are distributed fairly throughout the domestic economy countries don t need external rules to enforce openness they ll choose it of their own accord a lighter touch may even help globalization after all trade expanded faster relative to global output during the three and a half decades of the bretton woods regime than it has since 1990 even excluding the slowdown following the 2008 global financial crisis countries should pursue international agreements to constrain domestic policy only when they re needed to tackle genuine beggar thy neighbor problems such as corporate tax havens economic cartels and policies that keep one s currency artificially cheap the current system of international rules tries to rein in many economic policies that don t represent true beggar thy neighbor problems consider bans on genetically modified organisms agricultural subsidies industrial policies and overly lax financial regulation each of these policies could well harm other countries but the domestic economy in question will pay the bulk of the economic cost governments adopt such policies presumably because they think the social and political benefits are worth the price tag in any individual case a government might well be wrong but international institutions aren t likely to be better judges of the tradeoffs and even when they re right their decisions will lack democratic legitimacy the push into hyperglobalization since the 1990s has led to much greater levels of international economic integration at the same time it has produced domestic disintegration as professional corporate and financial elites have connected with their peers all over the globe they have grown more distant from their compatriots at home today s populist backlash is a symptom of that fragmentation the bulk of the work needed to mend domestic economic and political systems has to be done at home closing the economic and social gaps widened by hyperglobalization will require restoring primacy to the domestic sphere in the policy hierarchy and demoting the international the greatest contribution the world economy can make to this project is to enable rather than encumber that correction

s market action makes it seem that way stocks around the world climbed after president donald trump withdrew a threat to impose tariffs on mexico at least for now that leaves investors hoping for a deal to soothe the more contentious and complex trade dispute with china which helped sink stocks last month but there are other concerns that shouldn t be overlooked economic trends were already signaling trouble before the latest round of tariff induced fear friday s surprisingly weak jobs report where employers added far fewer jobs than economists expected gave extra pause corporate profits are also under pressure if the administration fixes the problem it created i m sure there will be a short term pop in the stock market said rich weiss chief investment officer of multi asset strategies at american century investments however i believe it s only short term because ultimately that will not remedy the underlying fundamentals which are just not strong of course many along wall street are still forecasting gains for stocks this year much of the optimism rides on analyst forecasts for profit growth to accelerate later this year plus stock prices are looking like better values following their tumble in recent weeks perhaps most importantly the federal reserve has intimated it may come to the market s rescue again and cut interest rates if the trade war swamps the economy but skeptics say optimists aren t looking closely enough at all the troubles getting overshadowed by trade disputes among the concerns slowing economic growth even before the latest trade skirmishes the bright spots for the u s economy are still clear the job market is solid as long as friday s disappointing report doesn t herald something more lasting the unemployment rate at 3 6 is at its lowest since 1969 and consumers are feeling relatively confident that s key when consumer spending accounts for two thirds of the economy but skeptics point to other recent economic reports that showed weakness in april before this latest round of trade worries flared up among them another drop in north american freight shipments slower manufacturing growth than economists expected and weaker business spending on equipment michael wilson equity strategist at morgan stanley sees a warning flag in falling profits for many retailers while the industry s overall figures for the first quarter may look decent due to big gains for amazon nordstrom and other retailers saw big declines that could be an early sign that u s consumers whose spending is such a key part of the economy may be less willing to spend in coming months get ready for more potential growth disappointments even with a trade deal wilson wrote in a recent research report lackluster profit growth companies across the s p 500 reported roughly flat earnings for the first three months of 2019 as they re no longer getting the big boost of the first year of lower tax rates but analysts are more optimistic about trends later this year and are forecasting growth to accelerate to 7 in the fourth quarter according to factset that s key because stock prices tend to track the path of corporate profits over the long term but skeptics say those projections are too high barry bannister a strategist at stifel who was among the first voices on wall street to turn cautious on stocks last year expects earnings in the second half of 2019 to fall short of analysts projections particularly in the technology health care and energy industries with the dollar s value strong and u s manufacturing slowing he s looking for ceos to give profit forecasts for the second half of 2019 that fall short of analysts expectations with announcements coming as soon as next month when companies begin reporting their second quarter results companies are also paying higher wages to their workers and average hourly earnings rose 3 1 in may which raises their costs compare that against the consumer price index which gives a window into how easily companies can pass along price increases to their customers notes chun wang senior analyst at leuthold cpi inflation hasn t been that high since 2011 and it was at 2 in april all those pressures could bring down profit margins for companies which have recently been at record highs if companies aren t able to extract as much profit from each 1 in revenue they ll need to make up for it by delivering more in sales a slowing economy would make that tough politics are always looming even beyond trade talks politics can sway markets in washington regulators may be setting

sanders i vermont took a shot at his democratic opponents who are taking a more centrist approach i understand that there are some well intentioned democrats and candidates who believe that the best way forward is a middle ground strategy that antagonizes no one that stands up to nobody and that changes nothing he said in my view that approach is not just bad public policy but it is a failed political strategy that i feel could end up with the re election of donald trump requirements under fire lots of debate about democrats 2020 debates sanders added the american people want change they want real change and we have got to provide that change tulsi gabbard u s rep tulsi gabbard d hawaii leaned into her experience as a military combat veteran during her five minutes on stage sunday i

buttigieg south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg told the gathering he wants to change the channel on trump s presidency to do so he said democrats need to push back on the notion that values like freedom belong the republican party you aren t free if you don t have a living wage in this country buttigieg said democrats he said need to stop running campaigns on a return to bygone days we can no more bring back the 90s than the republicans can bring back the 50s democrats can only win if they embrace bold ideas making the district of columbia and puerto rico states treating the climate crisis as a national security issue and securing the right to abortions he said kamala harris u s sen kamala harris a california democrat and a former prosecutor tied trump s actions as president to various forms of fraud adding there s a rap sheet full of evidence to make the case scotus quarreling conservative gains at supreme court leading to anger and peeks behind the curtain he promised health care and then he tried to rip health care away from millions of people what s that called health care fraud he said he was for working people then he passed the tax bill benefiting the top 1 and the biggest corporations in this country that s tax fraud he believes the president of russia and the north korean dictator over the word of the american intelligence community securities fraud and then he claims to be the best president we ve seen in the generation she said well i say let s call barack obama because that s identity fraud she ended with a line she s repeated often i m here to ask for your support because i am prepared to make the case for america and to prosecute the case against donald trump john delaney former u s rep john delaney d maryland devoted the bulk of his speech to advocating for universal health care in america but not the medicare for all plan that many of his rivals have embraced rattling off a list of european countries that have universal health care systems delaney said medicare for all is not the only way to achieve universal coverage the one thing about all those countries whose systems we admire none of them have a single payer universal health care system he said delaney who has already been to all 99 iowa counties walked onstage to johnny cash s i ve been everywhere jay inslee washington gov jay inslee said democrats should look to his home state to understand how he would govern the nation inslee said washington s rising gross domestic product is proof that the state s 15 an hour minimum wage hasn t hurt businesses the governor who has stressed climate change in his campaign said the green energy sector is the source of economic growth we know the turbines in iowa don t cause cancer they cause jobs inslee said to applause i can tell you that if given this honor of becoming president i will wake up every day i will make defeating climate change the first paramount duty of the united states inslee said kirsten gillibrand u s sen kirsten gillibrand d new york who has stressed her fight for abortion access in her campaign returned to that theme sunday across this country right wing politicians and a whole lot of men are making decisions about our reproductive freedom now is not the time to be polite now is not the time for small steps now is the time to fight like hell gillibrand also took a subtle jab at former vice president joe biden the front runner in the 2020 race who said recently that he backs repealing the so called hyde amendment which bans most uses of federal funds to pay for abortions biden previously supported the amendment but switched positions in recent days i don t think there is room in our party for a democratic candidate who does not support women s full reproductive freedom she said tim ryan u s rep tim ryan d ohio told the crowd that boxing champion muhammad ali allegedly said he s never been knocked down he s either up or he s getting up the same is true of workers women the iowa democratic party and the country at large ryan said america has never been knocked down we are either up or we are getting up ryan said the congressman repeated his campaign promise that if he wins the oval office he will do everything in his power to restore the middle class by putting together a modern industrial policy for the country we don t just talk about 15 an hour we talk about 30 an hour and 40 an hour and 50 an hour jobs so that if you work hard and you play by the rules you can make a living in the united states of america he said andrew yang entrepreneur andrew yang used his five minutes to pitch the universal basic income idea he s put in front of audiences around the state and across the country he wants the government to give every adult citizen 1 000 every month yang argues that technology will displace workers what the country needs yang said is economic support neighbor negotiations donald trump claims there s more to migrant deal with mexico than he announced donald trump is our president today because he got the problems right but he doesn t have the solutions we need yang said marianne williamson author marianne williamson said democrats don t need someone who has political toughness to take on trump instead she argued they need someone who has a very different way of thinking about politics i want you to know my deep feeling that if you think that our job is simply to find someone tough enough to beat donald trump you are naive about the nature of the opponent she said something deeper something far more dangerous is going on here than traditional political toughness williamson said only one thing will counter the fear she said trump has brought to the county it s not money it s not just strategy it s not just anger and it s not just mobilizing our base it is love she said last time we won with hope this time we will win with love elizabeth warren u s sen elizabeth warren d massachusetts got applause for her proposal to tax the rich cancel student loan debt fight climate change and to protect a woman s righ to have an abortion but she said her campaign with all of its plans comes down to one question who does this government work for is it going to continue to work just for a thinner and thinner slice at the top or are we going to make this government work for the rest of america i m in this fight to make it work for the rest of america warren said tucker carlson on elizabeth warren she sounds like donald trump at his best she said her campaign is building a grassroots movement to make that happen a movement that s included dozens of town halls visits to 20 states and puerto rico and yeah we re coming up on our 30 000th selfie why do i have the time to do that because i m not spending my time with high dollar donors and with corporate lobbyists i m spending my time with you she said john hickenlooper former colorado gov john hickenlooper took the stage sunday to share a grim picture of trump s united states we now live in a country where children are taken from their mothers and put in cages where a woman s right to control her own body is under constant assault where the sick and the elderly have to choose between paying their medical bills or their utility bills hickenlooper said donald trump is the worst president our country has ever had but defeating him is far from guaranteed hickenlooper said if he were president he would grant access to birth control and abortion support a public option for health care coverage make a commitment to addressing the climate crisis and create one million apprenticeships to fill the country s skills gap amy klobuchar u s sen amy klobuchar d minnesota noted her iowa neighbor status in cedar rapids i can see iowa from my porch said the candidate who has been a frequent iowa visitor for years she told the crowd she has an optimistic economic agenda that bridges the rural urban divide and gives people the opportunities she had that is what this country is about she said no matter who you know no matter what you look like no matter what your connections are no matter who you love that you can become president of the united states that is a country of shared dreams and we have a president that tries to fracture those dreams every single day the midwest she said is the place to mend those fractures what better place to vow to revive the heart of america than in the heartland of america she said steve bullock limiting dark money spending in u s elections has been the fight of my career montana gov steve bullock told the crowd highlighting a law he signed to increase disclosure of spending in state elections he said when he ran for re election in 2016 he saw advertisements paid for by the wealthy koch brothers but when they came up to the new state deadline requiring disclosure of ad sponsors around election time the ads stopped if we can stop the koch brothers in montana we can stop them in iowa bullock said we can stop them all across this country bullock said he s challenged the u s supreme court s citizens united ruling and won as a democrat in a state that voted for trump the path to victory isn t just through the coasts it includes places we lost last election he said think about it almost a third of your counties voted for obama twice and trump this is about the white house and your statehouse and if we can t fire up democrats and win back places we lost in 16 we may as well fold up that great big tent right now women s rights are under assault joe biden says at atlanta event with beto o rourke bill de blasio new york city mayor bill de blasio who invited his wife on stage and introduced to her the crowd said he s already implemented the policy proposals he and many other democrats are pitching i run the biggest toughest most diverse city in the world i have 8 6 million highly opinionated constituents all of them have an opinion he said but one thing we agree on is putting working people first de blasio noted new york is implementing universal pre kindergarten and paid family leave don t you think you should have that in iowa and all over the country he said when critics worry about the cost he told the crowd he says there s plenty of money in this world and there s plenty of money in this country it s just in the wrong hands michael bennet after noting he just entered the race and didn t have many supporters in the crowd rep michael bennet d colorado crammed a long list of issues he supports into his five minutes but none can become a reality unless washington s broken politics are fixed first he said climate change health care on all the issues you ve heard about today he senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has said no and he has sent it to the legislative graveyard to die bennet said among the policies he mentioned on which he hopes the country gets to yes the american family act the act would expand the child tax credit from up to 2

rourke d texas closed out the last speech of the event by touting his plan to bring new voters into the process and to guard against barriers to participation and attempts to influence the country s elections first let s bring tens of millions of our fellow americans in through same day and automatic voter registration next let s remove every barrier in place a new voting rights act for this country no more purges of the voter rolls or voter ids to keep people out and let s restore faith in this democracy by holding accountable those who invaded it in 2016 and then afterward sought to cover up and obstruct the investigation o rourke said he also took time to thank iowans for the advice they gave him as he has honed his campaign to each one of you that i ve had the chance to meet at one of our town halls or visits to your community i m grateful for the lessons that you have taught me he said
once this trade war cloud gets lifted investors should have little to worry about right monday s market action makes it seem that way stocks around the world climbed after president donald trump withdrew a threat to impose tariffs on mexico at least for now that leaves investors hoping for a deal to soothe the more contentious and complex trade dispute with china which helped sink stocks last month but there are other concerns that shouldn t be overlooked economic trends were already signaling trouble before the latest round of tariff induced fear friday s surprisingly weak jobs report where employers added far fewer jobs than economists expected gave extra pause corporate profits are also under pressure if the administration fixes the problem it created i m sure there will be a short term pop in the stock market said rich weiss chief investment officer of multi asset strategies at american century investments however i believe it s only short term because ultimately that will not remedy the underlying fundamentals which are just not strong of course many along wall street are still forecasting gains for stocks this year much of the optimism rides on analyst forecasts for profit growth to accelerate later this year plus stock prices are looking like better values following their tumble in recent weeks perhaps most importantly the federal reserve has intimated it may come to the market s rescue again and cut interest rates if the trade war swamps the economy but skeptics say optimists aren t looking closely enough at all the troubles getting overshadowed by trade disputes among the concerns investors should know about slowing economic growth even before the latest trade skirmishes the bright spots for the u s economy are still clear the job market is solid as long as friday s disappointing report doesn t herald something more lasting the unemployment rate at 3 6 is at its lowest since 1969 and consumers are feeling relatively confident that s key when consumer spending accounts for two thirds of the economy but skeptics point to other recent economic reports that showed weakness in april before this latest round of trade worries flared up among them another drop in north american freight shipments slower manufacturing growth than economists expected and weaker business spending on equipment michael wilson equity strategist at morgan stanley sees a warning flag in falling profits for many retailers while the industry s overall figures for the first quarter may look decent due to big gains for amazon nordstrom and other retailers saw big declines that could be an early sign that u s consumers whose spending is such a key part of the economy may be less willing to spend in coming months get ready for more potential growth disappointments even with a trade deal wilson wrote in a recent research report investors should know about lackluster profit growth companies across the s p 500 reported roughly flat earnings for the first three months of 2019 as they re no longer getting the big boost of the first year of lower tax rates but analysts are more optimistic about trends later this year and are forecasting growth to accelerate to 7 in the fourth quarter according to factset that s key because stock prices tend to track the path of corporate profits over the long term but skeptics say those projections are too high barry bannister a strategist at stifel who was among the first voices on wall street to turn cautious on stocks last year expects earnings in the second half of 2019 to fall short of analysts projections particularly in the technology health care and energy industries with the dollar s value strong and u s manufacturing slowing he s looking for ceos to give profit forecasts for the second half of 2019 that fall short of analysts expectations with announcements coming as soon as next month when companies begin reporting their second quarter results companies are also paying higher wages to their workers and average hourly earnings rose 3 1 in may which raises their costs compare that against the consumer price index which gives a window into how easily companies can pass along price increases to their customers notes chun wang senior analyst at leuthold cpi inflation hasn t been that high since 2011 and it was at 2 in april all those pressures could bring down profit margins for companies which have recently been at record highs if companies aren t able to extract as much profit from each 1 in revenue they ll need to make up for it by delivering more in sales a slowing economy would make that tough investors should know about always looming politics even beyond trade talks politics can sway markets in washington regulators may be setting the stage for antitrust probes into some of the biggest tech companies amazon apple google s parent and other mega tech companies have been some of the market s best performing stocks in recent years and losses for them have outsized effects on s p 500 index funds consider june 3 when nearly three quarters of all the stocks in the s p 500 rose but the overall index fell 0 3 because big technology companies had a bad day in the middle east the trump administration has pledged maximum pressure on iran beyond the possibility of violence the increasing tensions could send the price of oil soaring as well as inflation which has long been dormant in europe britain is still negotiating its exit from the european union and investors are worried about signs of increasing tension between the bloc and italy so fixing the china situation does not fix the rest of the world said american century s weiss is it a positive sure it s positive in the short term but it doesn t remedy all the other things we have going on the

technology companies and banks helped power stocks higher on wall street monday as investors welcomed news that the u s and mexico averted a trade war and potentially damaging tariffs the latest gains extend the market s winning streak to a fifth day that follows the strongest week for stocks since november in what has been a marked turnaround for the market after escalating trade tensions fueled a turbulent skid in may some of those trade jitters eased a bit monday at least in regard to the trade spat between the u s and mexico president donald trump suspended plans to impose tariffs on mexican goods after the countries struck a deal on immigration the dispute threatened to raise costs for american companies and consumers and expand a global trade war that already includes china read more trump defends mexico deal to avoid tariffs during an interview with cnbc trump said monday that he expects to meet with chinese president xi jinping at the group of 20 summit in japan later this month that may have given investors some cause for optimism in the dispute between washington and beijing though trump noted that an additional wave of u s tariffs on chinese goods will go into effect if the xi refuses to meet at the summit relief in trade tensions in terms of mexico and hope for relief in trade tensions with china seem to be helping the market today said willie delwiche investment strategist at baird the s p 500 index gained 13 39 points or 0 5 to 2 886 73 the benchmark index rose 4 4 last week its best weekly performance of 2019 it s now about 2 below its record set on april

0 6 to 1 523 56 stock indexes in europe finished broadly higher the latest gains build on the market s momentum from last week when a lackluster u s jobs report appeared to increase the odds that the federal reserve will have to cut interest rates in coming months last week federal reserve chairman jay powell held out the possibility that the central bank will soon cut rates to protect the economic recovery from any damage resulting from the trump administration s multiple trade disputes many analysts think the fed will cut rates more than once before year s end perhaps beginning in july we have essentially over five trading days undone the preceding 19 days worth of weakness delwiche noted other market indicators still signal that investors are worried about the potential for an economic slowdown however the yield on the 10 year treasury note remains sharply lower from where it was at the beginning of may before the trump administration s tariff threats escalated trade conflicts with china and mexico that spooked investors triggering a monthlong sell off that derailed the market s strong start to the year if you look beyond the s p 500 it s not nearly as rosy a picture delwiche said you don t want to make too much of what we ve seen over the past week it s been encouraging but it s by no means an all clear everything is ok signal on monday news of the deal

pre the rba rate cut chinese trade data released on friday showed exports rose 1 1 year on year in may when economists had expected a second tariff related drop following a fall in april imports fell by a greater than expected 8 5 imports from the us specifically fell 26 8 the surprise export result is likely attributable to chinese exporters trying to get their goods out ahead of trump s final tranche of tariffs the weak numbers overall bolster expectations of further stimulus from beijing the asx200 closed up 0 7 for the week recovering early falls from trump s sudden threat to hit mexico with tariffs on thursday night it appeared those tariffs might be delayed and by friday night the story became even more bizarre more on that below suffice to say yet another rally on wall street on friday night sent our futures up 32 points by saturday morning friday night trump s original threat to place escalating tariffs on mexican exports came out of the blue particularly given progress was being made in congress to ratify the new usmca trade agreement commonly known as nafta 2 0 but the real surprise was the reason for the tariffs being mexico s failure to stop the tide of illegal immigrants suddenly trump was using tariffs as a political weapon beyond trade a mexican delegation rushed to washington and by thursday night the story was that the tariffs may be delayed as an agreement is reached on friday night trump tweeted that tariffs may not need to be imposed if mexico agrees to buy more us agricultural products and farm equipment hang on one minute a trade tariff is being used as leverage against immigration and the next we re back to trade again how does one keep up either way wall street took the news as progress but the real reason us stock rallied further on friday night was the jobs report the dow rose 263 points or 1 0 while the s p gained 1 0 to 2873 and the nasdaq added 1 7 the us added only 75 000 jobs in may when 185 000 were forecast gains in march and april were revised down by a net 75 000 the three month rolling average of new jobs has fallen to 151 000 from 245 000 in january the unemployment rate nevertheless remained steady at 3 6 one wonders why when the unemployment rate is at an historical low economists are surprised at a slowing rate of jobs growth but a big miss on jobs is music to wall street s ears it means the fed is now under even more pressure to cut rates the result was enough to send the us dollar index down another 0 3 and the us ten year bond yield down another 4 basis points to 2 08 dollar weakness and hope tariffs on mexico will be averted meant oil prices jumped back another 2 5 two sessions earlier they had fallen by more than 20 not only has wall street recovered all of the losses triggered by the initial mexico tariff announcement which saw the s p500 break down through its 200 day moving average it has surged ahead to be close to square from a month ago meanwhile the governor of the people s bank of china told bloomberg on friday that the central bank has tremendous room to use monetary policy to stimulate the chinese economy trade deal at the g20 not a chance commodities friday night while oil markets may have welcomed the news on mexican tariffs on friday night mexico being a big exporter of oil to the us there was no such relief for base metals prices even as the us dollar fell on the jobs numbers a rebound during the week for lead was clipped by a 2 7 fall after which all other metals continued to slide gradually lower it was the eighth straight down week for copper gold is currently in limbo after surging through the us 1300 oz mark waiting to see what happens next the aussie was up 0 3 at us 0 6994 on friday night the spi overnight closed up 32 points on saturday morning monday night mexico agreed on the weekend to take strong measures to stem the tide of illegal immigrants to the us pledging to deploy its national guard to its own southern border with guatemala trump has thus suspended the tariffs for now there is no mention of mexican purchases of us agricultural products and farm equipment trump has warned nonetheless that there needs to be signs of progress on the matter to avoid the tariffs going back on critics have noted that mexico had previously agreed to deploy its national guard to the guatemalan border and thus are asking what s new the g20 finance ministers met over the weekend and in a sideline meeting talks with the governor of the pboc were described as candid and constructive by the us treasury secretary wall street took this as a positive despite the pboc governor hinting on friday night the central bank has the capacity to help china weather a trade war while washington insists a sideline meeting between presidents trump and xi will go ahead at the g20 leaders meeting at the end of the month beijing is yet to confirm such a hook up commentators suggest that if there is any possibility trump might do a walk away from negotiations in tokyo as was the case with kim jong un xi will not agree to meet the dow was up over two hundred points once more during monday night s session on all of the positives above but faded away in the afternoon to a more modest gain many believe the rebound rally which included solid sessions every day last week has now overshot critical to caution is a belief wall street is jumping the gun in its fed rate cut assumptions particularly on the timing the us ten year bond yield rebounded on monday night rising 6 basis points to 2 14 bonds too have been considered overbought and the rebound helped us financials to lead the day s rally commodities monday night spot metals minerals energy futures gold oz 1327 40 7 20 0 54 silver oz 14 67 0 27 1 81 copper lb 2 63 0 01 0 25

suspension of tariffs on mexico should have provided a boost for oil prices but realistically that boost came on friday night last night traders were worrying about forecasts of yet another big build of us crude inventories to be revealed in this week s data and worried that russia has yet to agree to extensions of its agreement with opec to keep a lid on production that s another meeting for the end of the month meanwhile gold fell back likely as there was no escalation on the tariff front and despite the us dollar being relatively steady as for base metals lead continues to fly around but the others appear stuck in a realm of uncertainty a 0 5 drop for the aussie to us 0 6958 seems rather substantial against a steady greenback and despite iron ore trading back over the ton the spi

once this trade war cloud gets lifted investors should have little to worry about right monday s market action makes it seem that way stocks around the world climbed after president donald trump withdrew a threat to impose tariffs on mexico at least for now that leaves investors hoping for a deal to soothe the more contentious and complex trade dispute with china which helped sink stocks last month but there are other concerns that shouldn t be overlooked economic trends were already signaling trouble before the latest round of tariff induced fear friday s surprisingly weak jobs report where employers added far fewer jobs than economists expected gave extra pause corporate profits are also under pressure if the administration fixes the problem it created i m sure there will be a short term pop in the stock market said rich weiss chief investment officer of multi asset strategies at american century investments however i believe it s only short term because ultimately that will not remedy the underlying fundamentals which are just not strong of course many along wall street are still forecasting gains for stocks this year much of the optimism rides on analyst forecasts for profit growth to accelerate later this year plus stock prices are looking like better values following their tumble in recent weeks perhaps most importantly the federal reserve has intimated it may come to the market s rescue again and cut interest rates if the trade war swamps the economy but skeptics say optimists aren t looking closely enough at all the troubles getting overshadowed by trade disputes among the concerns slowing economic growth even before the latest trade skirmishes the bright spots for the u s economy are still clear the job market is solid as long as friday s disappointing report doesn t herald something more lasting the unemployment rate at 3 6 is at its lowest since 1969 and consumers are feeling relatively confident that s key when consumer spending accounts for two thirds of the economy but skeptics point to other recent economic reports that showed weakness in april before this latest round of trade worries flared up among them another drop in north american freight shipments slower manufacturing growth than economists expected and weaker business spending on equipment michael wilson equity strategist at morgan stanley sees a warning flag in falling profits for many retailers while the industry s overall figures for the first quarter may look decent due to big gains for amazon nordstrom and other retailers saw big declines that could be an early sign that u s consumers whose spending is such a key part of the economy may be less willing to spend in coming months get ready for more potential growth disappointments even with a trade deal wilson wrote in a recent research report lackluster profit growth companies across the s p 500 reported roughly flat earnings for the first three months of 2019 as they re no longer getting the big boost of the first year of lower tax rates but analysts are more optimistic about trends later this year and are forecasting growth to accelerate to 7 in the fourth quarter according to factset that s key because stock prices tend to track the path of corporate profits over the long term but skeptics say those projections are too high barry bannister a strategist at stifel who was among the first voices on wall street to turn cautious on stocks last year expects earnings in the second half of 2019 to fall short of analysts projections particularly in the technology health care and energy industries with the dollar s value strong and u s manufacturing slowing he s looking for ceos to give profit forecasts for the second half of 2019 that fall short of analysts expectations with announcements coming as soon as next month when companies begin reporting their second quarter results companies are also paying higher wages to their workers and average hourly earnings rose 3 1 in may which raises their costs compare that against the consumer price index which gives a window into how easily companies can pass along price increases to their customers notes chun wang senior analyst at leuthold cpi inflation hasn t been that high since 2011 and it was at 2 in april all those pressures could bring down profit margins for companies which have recently been at record highs if companies aren t able to extract as much profit from each 1 in revenue they ll need to make up for it by delivering more in sales a slowing economy would make that tough politics are always looming

imf executive board members washington d c on may 31 2019 the executive board of the international monetary fund imf concluded the article iv consultation with liberia liberia remains a fragile post conflict country with weak capacity and limited physical and human capital accumulation external assistance to liberia is winding down from its peak in 2016 to address pressing needs the government launched its pro poor agenda for prosperity and development papd focusing on physical and human capital accumulation policy uncertainty and slippages however imposed a significant toll on the economy over the past two years particularly higher fiscal deficits and accommodative monetary policy have led to rapid depreciation of the liberia dollar and increased inflation eroding the purchasing power of the poor the near and medium term outlook under the baseline scenario is challenging growth is projected to slow further to about 0 4 percent in 2019 and remain below 2 percent into the medium term in the baseline scenario the authorities face the possibility of a forced abrupt adjustment when domestic and external financing options are exhausted an alternative reform scenario is therefore presented as a more viable alternative in which growth weakens somewhat in the near term due to proactive fiscal and monetary tightening but picks up significantly over the medium term to exceed 5 percent by 2024 executive board assessment executive directors noted that liberia is facing major economic challenges and welcomed the authorities efforts to bolster macroeconomic stability directors emphasized that steadfast and well sequenced policies and structural reforms are essential to enhance macroeconomic stability and promote higher sustainable and inclusive growth they welcomed the authorities pro poor agenda for prosperity and development papd and agreed that garnering support from the international community will be important directors emphasized that significant fiscal adjustment is needed going forward they underscored that efforts should focus on mobilizing domestic revenue and rationalizing spending especially the wage bill while securing needed space for social and capital spending directors encouraged the authorities to formulate realistic budgets and to implement a sound borrowing plan that ensures debt sustainability while advocating caution in engaging in non concessional borrowing they also called for further progress in public financial management reforms to improve the quality of spending in a resource constrained environment directors agreed that the central bank of liberia cbl should tighten monetary policy with the objective of reducing inflation to single digits by 2021 directors emphasized that further issuance of cbl bills should be suspended until the cost of the operation is included in the government budget and the fiscal financing gap is closed without cbl financing directors noted that while the financial soundness indicators show that the banking sector appears adequately capitalized the cbl should enhance its supervisory efforts they highlighted the need to prioritize strengthening the cbl s supervisory regulatory and resolution frameworks in light of the elevated level of nonperforming loans focusing on measures that improve loan underwriting standards directors highlighted the need to improve the external position by tightening monetary and fiscal policies allowing for greater exchange rate flexibility and raising competitiveness through improvements in the business environment they welcomed that the authorities pro poor agenda focuses on physical and human capital particularly improving service delivery in health and education directors noted that in the context of the development agenda aggressive efforts should be made to strengthen governance and reduce corruption they advised the authorities to upgrade their anti corruption and aml cft frameworks in line with international standards directors emphasized that continued efforts to improve the quality and availability of data are essential for fund surveillance and economic policy making under article iv of the imf s articles of agreement the imf holds bilateral discussions with members usually every year a staff team visits the country collects economic and financial information and discusses with officials the country s economic developments and policies on return to headquarters the staff prepares a report which forms the basis for discussion by the executive board at the conclusion of the discussion the managing director as chairman of the board summarizes the views of executive directors and this summary is transmitted to the country s authorities an explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here
the debate around modern monetary theory mmt is picking up steam with its partisans pushing the model further into the public sphere than one might expect and the old guard of establishment economics together with some more interesting critical voices pushing back the questions at stake can make the average person s head spin can a government with sovereign control over its currency create money at will to meet social needs or would this create out of control inflationary spirals does tax income precede government spending or does spending create the money that s then taxed back to tweak the distribution of incomes and rein in inflation to most americans this is all probably a bit opaque and abstract the inner workings of our money supply and its deep connections to the banking sector are after all as bill greider memorably put it the secrets of the temple but when we look at the core issue we find that more americans than not agree with the basic political judgement that mmt tries to justify theoretically namely that deficits shouldn t matter if social needs are not being met at the democracy collaborative a poll we commissioned with yougov shows this preference clearly 50 of respondents thought the government should worry more about basic social needs like healthcare and housing even if it means more deficit spending compared to just 32 who felt that the government needs to relieve our tax burden by cutting the deficit even if it means scaling back basic social programs for healthcare and housing so while most americans probably don t have an opinion on the intricacies of heterodox monetary theory by a significant margin more of them agree with mmt s political conclusions about spending of course with trigger words like tax burden and deficits included we did see a sharp partisan tilt in our results still it s encouraging to see that nearly 1 in 3 republicans don t think deficits matter more than social spending and with 74 percent of democrats ready to spend more to meet basic needs even if it increases the deficit the kind of austerity lite paygo triangulation advanced by speaker pelosi seems utterly incomprehensible the point is to recognize that whether or not we can decide in favor of or against mmt is somewhat academic there are a wide range of important technical issues to be worked out around tax interest and full employment policies but when we re operating in a context where actually existing financialized capitalism regularly features negative interest rates trillions of dollars of central bank asset purchases and seemingly unlimited tax cuts for the rich letting ourselves be boxed in by technocratic assumptions about what s feasible according to economic theory seems uncalled for we should identify the priorities we want and then build the monetary and fiscal mechanisms we need to get there rather than cowering before the supposedly terrible and unknowable forces of money and the economy the lesson of the last crash should not be that the market is an unpredictable and capricious god it should be that when you design a system to incentivize untrammeled financialization you get exactly what you asked for so let s start instead with what the majority of people want the economy to do for them and then design and build with those goals in mind as our polling showed these goals are simple but powerful fundamentally most people agree that the economy should be delivering better outcomes and believe that government intervention is a good way to guarantee that these outcomes happen we asked whether people had a right to an income that can support them and their family a job that pays at minimum a living wage and affordable housing for all three of these basic demands respondents who thought people should or maybe should have this right was between 65 and 68 of those surveyed compared to just 26 30 of respondents who felt that people should not or should not necessarily enjoy those rights austerity s insistent nag but how will we pay for it should not be the starting point of our political imagination rather we should start from an economic agenda designed to deliver better outcomes on key goals in the most direct way possible and then creatively work out how will we pay for it as a matter of technical due diligence with the understanding that deficits are only an absolute constraint for those intent on austerity at all costs the answers we arrive at may or may not draw from mmt s proposed insights although they should be honest and realistic in either case when the policymakers and central bankers of the 1 are willing to break every rule in the economics textbook to protect and expand an unequal status quo we shouldn t be afraid to demand basic economic human rights first and leave it to the economists to invent a way to pay for it

cedar rapids ia nineteen presidential candidates took the stage at the iowa democratic party s 2019 hall of fame event in cedar rapids on sunday marking the largest event of the campaign so far it s amazing it s like a carnival carrie ball 47 a stay at home mom from cedar rapids said with a hearty laugh you can run into any of them with 1 500 activists and 200 members of the media in attendance each of the candidates tried to stand out but with only five minutes to speak time was kept by loud instrumental music that drowned out speech droners who ran over they had to make their cases quickly some candidates shortened their standard stump speeches others added a bit more flare and many but not all brought huge crowds of supporters with them who cheered and clapped and rallied for their chosen pick let s get this party started said iowa democratic party chair troy price as he kicked off the hourslong event here were the best moment each of the candidates had in their attempts to woo the crowd in the order of their speeches iowa poll joe biden leads followed by bernie sanders elizabeth warren and pete buttigieg cory booker u s sen cory booker s speech built to a crescendo echoing the theme of his campaign that the election is about more than beating president donald trump donald trump wants this election to be about him on his terms and his turf that s how he wins we win when

sanders i vermont took a shot at his democratic opponents who are taking a more centrist approach i understand that there are some well intentioned democrats and candidates who believe that the best way forward is a middle ground strategy that antagonizes no one that stands up to nobody and that changes nothing he said in my view that approach is not just bad public policy but it is a failed

his home state to understand how he would govern the nation inslee said washington s rising gross domestic product is proof that the state s 15 an hour minimum wage hasn t hurt businesses the governor

president joe biden the front runner in the 2020 race who said recently that he backs repealing the so called hyde amendment which bans most uses of federal funds to pay for abortions biden previously

someone who has political toughness to take on trump instead she argued they need someone who has a very different way of thinking about politics i want you to know my deep feeling that if you think that our job is simply to find someone tough enough to beat donald trump you are naive about the nature of the opponent she said something deeper something far more dangerous is going on here than traditional political toughness williamson said only one thing will counter the fear she said trump has brought to the county it s not money it s not just strategy it s not just anger and it s not just mobilizing our base it is love she said last time we won with hope this time we will win with love elizabeth warren u s sen elizabeth warren d massachusetts got applause for her proposal to tax the rich cancel student loan debt fight climate change and to protect a woman s righ to have an abortion but she said her campaign with all of its plans comes down to one question who does this government work for is it going to continue to work just for a thinner and thinner slice at the top or are we going to make this government work for the rest of america i m in this fight to make it work for the rest of america warren said tucker carlson on elizabeth warren she sounds like donald trump at his best she said her campaign is building a grassroots movement to make that happen a movement that s included dozens of town halls visits to 20 states and puerto rico and yeah we re coming up on our 30 000th selfie why do i have the time to do that because i m not spending my time with high dollar donors and with corporate lobbyists i m spending my time with you she said john hickenlooper former colorado gov john hickenlooper took the stage sunday to share a grim picture of

the elderly have to choose between paying their medical bills or their utility bills hickenlooper said donald trump is the worst president our country has ever had but defeating him is far from guaranteed hickenlooper said if he were president he would grant access to birth control and abortion support a public option for health care coverage make a commitment to addressing the climate

she had that is what this country is about she said no matter who you know no matter what you look like no matter what your connections are no matter who you love that you can become president of the united states that is a country of shared dreams and we have a president that tries to fracture those dreams every single day the midwest she said is the place to mend those fractures what better

bullock told the crowd highlighting a law he signed to increase disclosure of spending in state elections he said when he ran for re election in 2016 he saw advertisements paid for by the wealthy koch brothers but when they came up to the new state deadline requiring disclosure of ad sponsors around election time the ads stopped if we can stop the koch brothers in montana we can stop them in iowa bullock said we can stop them all across this country bullock said he s challenged the u s supreme court s citizens united ruling and won as a democrat in a state that voted for trump the path to victory isn t just through the coasts it includes places we lost last election he said think about it almost a third of your counties voted for obama twice and trump this is about the white house and your statehouse and if we can t fire up democrats and win back places we lost in 16 we may as well fold up that great big tent right now women s rights are under assault joe biden says at atlanta
