by kalima nkonde the untold story of zambia s excessive debt and low foreign reserves is the negative impact that illicit financial flows have had and continue to have on the country zambians need to be made aware that the debt that the country has accumulated is in a large measure due to the fact that billions of us dollars disappear each year without a trace and end up in tax havens and or absorbed into western economies and now china forcing government to accumulate excessive debt to fill the gap created in order to carry out development projects in the light of the mining houses threats of massive layoffs of over 21 000 zambians following 2019 budget tax reforms affecting them which are meant to ensure zambians benefit more from their resources rather than continue accumulating debt while shareholders of mining houses are getting richer it is appropriate that the debate should be extended to illicit financial flows which mines are alleged to be among the major culprits according to research by global financial integrity and other renowned economists like professor dikumana of massachusetts university zambia and other african countries are net creditors which mean far more money flowed out of zambia than into them thus exposing the hypocrisy of the benefits of foreign direct investment and donor funding recent research shows that the total sum that leaves developing countries each year as unreported financial outflows referred to as illicit capital flight amounts to as much as ten times the annual global aid flows and twice the amount of debt developing countries repay each year it is important to have a full picture of the extent of illicit financial flows problem by taking a holistic and helicopter view with regard to the conduits or channels used to siphon funds out of zambia there are three broad channels that billions of dollars are lost these are through multinational enterprises smuggling of natural resources and through corruption and money laundering activities multinational enterprises tax avoidance and evasion the major culprits of illicit financial flows are multinational enterprises mnes through the manipulation of trade transactions trade misinvoicing under valuing exports and overvaluing imports transfer pricing payments between parent companies and their subsidiaries and profit shifting mechanisms designed to conceal revenues are all common practices by companies seeking to maximise profits in the process undermining or negating the expected positive effect of foreign direct investment and aid according to the world bank mnes like the mines have tended to structure their businesses by consolidating high value functions and related intangible assets in hubs that provide goods and services to their global operations they locate them in low tax jurisdictions or in jurisdictions allowing the establishment of preferentially taxed special purpose entities according to stephen yeboah a research consultant at the african natural resources centre of the african development bank afdb nigeria and zambia are among the worst affected in terms of not benefiting from their resources in africa the practices of misinvoicing in nigeria s oil and zambia s copper exports and imports reflect the challenges that illicit financial flows present to africa s extractive sector between 1996 and 2014 under invoicing of oil exports from nigeria to the united states was worth 69 7 billion in zambia over the same period a record of 28 9 billion of copper exports to switzerland which is more than half of all its copper exports did not reflect in switzerland s import statistics he wrote in his research paper in 2012 the then deputy minister of finance miles sampa reported that zambia had lost 2 billion dollars in tax evasion by mining houses sampa said that only two mines claimed profits in that year and that the other mines for one reason or another some genuine some not are always making losses most of it is due to transfer pricing or tax avoidance in their 2013 report on illicit financial flows iffs from africa global financial integrity and the african development bank said zambia had lost approximately us 8 8 million in iffs from 2001 to 2010 the amount of money mining houses make from zambia which is not apparent to the government and zambians was further confirmed in a video four years ago by vendeta s majority shareholder anil agarwal speaking in march 2014 where he revealed how he bought kcm for just 25 million speaking to the jain international trade organisation 6 in bangalore india march 22 23 2014 he is quoted as having boasted about his investment in kcm it s been 9 years and since then every year it is giving us a minimum of 500 million dollar plus 1 billion dollar every year it has been continuously giving back in july 2017 the zambia financial intelligence centre reported that multinational mining companies were robbing zambia an estimated 3 billion annually through tax evasion and illicit financial flows iff in its 2019 budget the zambian government has made a number of proposed tax changes mainly affecting the mining sector mining houses have threatened jobs cuts in thousands and to cut in future capital investments the government on the other hand through the minister of mines richard musukwa has reacted angrily the minister was quoted by the news diggers newspaper that it will not tolerate the arm twisting and black mailing tactics of the mines the schemes being postulated by mining houses are arm twisting tactics something they cannot do in their home countries but we will not allow situations where mining houses start dictating what type of taxes we should have imagine having a country where we have foreigners telling us how we should tax them when they come here they come under a guise of investors and enjoy a lot of concessions and tax holidays in fact at the time when they start making profits most of them wind up operations they would have already made huge profits so what government would like to do with these tax measures is to ensure that we seek transfer pricing tax avoidance which have been perpetuated by these multinational companies musukwa was quoted by news diggers president lungu through his spokesman amos chanda as reported by news diggers said that the threats of mass layoffs by mines have no merit the government does not accept that mining companies that fully comply with sales tax in australia in the us canada would fail to comply with sales tax in zambia the president does not see merit in the opposition to sales tax as things stand amos chanda said according to lusaka times of 29th december 2018 on arrival on the copperbelt for the pf provincial conference president lungu amplified on the issue by categorically saying government will not allow mine owners lay off workers with impunity lusaka times reported that president lungu said he will a not allow mine workers lay off workers with impunity government will not be intimated by threats from mine owners to lay off workers investors in the mining industry are reminded that mines and minerals are assets of the country which zambians must benefit from through taxes to build roads health centres schools it is clear that state house is not amused by mining house s tactics president lungu should not be taken for granted based on how he gave in to miners demands in the past although he does appear weak slow and indecisive to his critics he has demonstrated in the past that he can take tough and bold decisions as he did with the removal of electricity farm subsidies and street venders which affected ordinary zambians who are his voters the indications from government are that the pf administration have reached a tipping point with regard to multinationals and are throwing the kitchen sink at them mining houses are well advised that given all the allegations of tax avoidance tax evasion suspected illicit financial flows their continued extortionary threats they may just open a pandora s box which will result in a tanzanian s magufuli type mining reforms where they will be worse off the zambian government is under tremendous financial pressure of debt servicing and from the zambian public who are overtaxed and hurting economically it has its back on the wall on the other hand zambians on social media and other fora are in uproar about the greed of mining houses and are overwhelmingly in support of government 2019 budget tax measures the influential economic association of zambia whose opinion the current administration respects and listens to led by dr lubinda haabazoka has come in support of government tax proposals and even made some draconian suggestions of nationalisation zambians are of the view that they have been bearing the bulk of the country s tax burden they feel overtaxed with direct indirect taxes and levies while at the same time subsidising the mines with power it s time the mines paid their fair share of taxes the gripe among zambians is that the mining houses are treated like sacred cows in zambia when their contribution to the ordinary zambian has had minimal impact based on a number of metrics including poverty alleviation mining houses retrenched an estimated 15 000 miners when copper prices were low in 2015 but very few were rehired when prices soared to 7 000 and zambians have been quiet mining houses have previously rejected over five different tax and other proposals to benefit zambia by government such as windfall tax revision of vat rule 18 increase of royalty tax to 8 and 20 for underground and open pit respectively 7 5 on imports of copper concentrate tax statutory instruments 33 and 55 si33 and 55 to monitor and stem illegal or illicit outflows and each time the government has curved in 100 after threats of closure of mines or retrenchment this has made government critics to conclude and accuse the zambian government of being weak and compromised because other governments like tanzania drc south africa have resisted the arm twisting and black mail tactics of mining houses in their countries zambians are urging the government to stand its ground and not budge there are some who are even suggesting the revocation mining licences if they retrench or do not comply others are suggesting that zambia should ask chinese investors to take over as copper and cobalt mining s future is bright with the car electric revolution on the horizon others are asking for nationalisation or increase of government stake in mines through zccm ih so that zambia benefits more from its resources the bottom line zambians argue is that the country s benefits from foreign direct investments especially the mines has been minimal in terms of tax revenue employment creation foreign exchange earnings forward and backward linkages technology and skills transfer and community social benefits through corporate social responsibility it is time that zambia pressed a reset button regarding fdi by recalibrating its policies incentives and generally revisits the current development model which is dysfunctional natural resources smuggling the other channel that zambia is losing billions of dollars which is currently being ignored is the smuggling of the country s natural resources there is no doubt that there is illicit exploitation of natural resources such as gold cobalt uranium timber emeralds diamonds manganese and other precious metals and wildlife which is being exported abroad illegally these activities are being carried out by criminal gangs and some big multinational companies some who are involved in the exportation of soil as the late president michael sata once put it the question one would ask is if canada s barrick gold s subsidiary in tanzania acacia mining was caught red handed with containers containing concentrates more than 10 times the amount they declared at the port of dar es salaam what could prevent multinationals in zambia doing the same the recent revelation by the news diggers newspaper that china imported 20 times more mukula timber from zambia than was declared gives credence to the assertion that there is so much revenue being lost through smuggling high volumes of mukula continue to be exported as logs despite regulations prohibiting it recent mukula production in zambia could have amounted to about 110 000 per annum with revenue losses of about us 3 2 million and bribes paid to state officials of about us 1 7 million while official statistics remain incomplete and unclear comparing zambia and chinese customs data reveals significant differences the centre for international forest research cifor regional scientist and chief researcher dr davison gumbo was quoted as saying by the paper according to the president of the gemstone and allied workers union of zambia sifuniso nyumbu as quoted the mast newspaper zambia lost an estimated 7 billion due to illegal mining and sale of gemstones the illegal activities are dotted around all parts of the country and as of 2017 we are talking of about 7billion which was being lost through illegal mining and exports of gemstones he said zambia has the best emeralds and amethyst in the world but there is very little being done to realize revenue by government external borrowing and money laundering fueled capital flight although the writer has not come across evidence suggesting that zambia is losing money through the third channel of illicit financial flow according to james k boyce of the department of economics political economy research institute university of massachusetts amherst in the usa extensive research has found out that most of the highly indebted african countries lose money through external debt fuelled capital flight external borrowing can lead to capital flight and capital flight can lead to external borrowing understanding these linkages is important for the formulation of appropriate policy responses in debt fuelled capital flight external borrowing finances private wealth accumulation outside the borrowing country the borrowing government contracts loans in the name of the public officials and other politically connected individuals then siphon part or all of the money into their own pockets via kickbacks padded procurements contracts and diversion of funds and stash part or all of the proceeds abroad for safekeeping he said when addressing the united nations on illicit financial flows in africa according to james k boyce some of the borrowings by most african governments are odious borrowings which are defined as loans contracted by government without the consent of the people and from which the people will not benefit and the lenders are also aware of this but still they lend the countries suggested solutions there is no argument whatsoever that zambia is losing billions through sophisticated multinational machinations smuggling corruption and money laundering the african union the africa development bank the g20 the world bank and the united nations have all agreed and confirmed this although the challenge of fighting illicit financial flows is a mammoth one and no one country can fight it alone there are still some measures that can minimise the scourge as the evidence of international studies have shown that countries like botswana have the lowest illicit financial outflows in africa whereas zambia and nigeria have the highest there is therefore something that zambia can do the fight against corruption is a starting point as there appears a positive correlation between corruption and illicit financial flows the zambian government can also seriously look at building and strengthening the capacity of zambia revenue authority zra as it is currently not well resourced with technology and specialized staff with sufficient qualifications and experience to handle the sophisticated machinations of mines and mnes there is also need to research the structures value chain characteristics and processes of the mining industry in their home countries in order to fight and limit smuggling of resources simple security measures can be a deterrent there is need to put in measures of monitoring small aerodromes in rural zambia especially north western province and inspections of light aircraft and drones bound for foreign countries the army and air force could be useful in the enforcement of zambia s economic security by limiting smuggling conclusion zambia has no problem with finance for development it has a problem with finance mobilisation and enforcement of laws and regulations we are endowed with resources and if domestic resources were mobilised so that we benefit from our natural resources like botswana has done we would not borrow so much the zambian government s current business development model in practice is based on two pillars one the lope sided promotion of foreign investment without joint venture arrangements while paying lip service to indigenous high value entrepreneurs two the raising of development finance through excessive borrowing rather than mobilization of domestic revenue this is a flawed business model and will not bring development as it only promotes billions of dollars flowing out of the country with little retained in the country for multiplier effects no country has ever developed from excessive borrowings and foreign direct investments alone ask china south korea vietnam and others south east asia countries domestic revenue mobilisation and aggressive promotion of indigenous and local investors and providing incentives to joint venture with foreigners is the key and only way for zambia to develop foreigners never developed any country but merely complemented locals there are thousands of zambians including the writer with multi million dollar viable projects in mining banking transport manufacturing tourism which are rotting because government through zda have no such database and have not aggressively tried to find them and matched them with foreigners with cash like the chinese but just allow 100 owned foreign investors to set up shop china does not do that learn from them editor s note the writer kalima nkonde is a chartered accountant by profession and a private sector development expert and an entrepreneur
towards market dominated neoliberal capitalism what has been less adequately reported is that all these countries in the middle east and north africa mena experienced an intense economic transformation imposed by the imf and the world bank during the previous couple of decades away from the state command economy model of arab socialism of the 1960s and 70s and towards market dominated neoliberal capitalism in the 1980s and 90s through the guidance and assistance of the imf and the world bank the mena region pursued neoliberal economic policies entrepreneurial freedom strong property rights free markets and free trade which led to great income inequalities and a concentration of wealth among the small political elite and its cronies the arab spring uprisings took place within the conditions of sharply increased poverty very high youth unemployment and lack of opportunities for young people youth unemployment was over 30 percent everywhere in the region and in syria and jordan young people under the age of 30 constitute more than 70 percent of the unemployed workforce in the whole mena region there was and still is a vivid mismatch between demography and economic structure while demography is evolving the economic structure is totally unresponsive to the needs of growing populations the harsh neoliberal policies of the 1990s and 2000s made the situation worse much worse rather than improve the economy and provide solutions the most obvious common feature of the principal storm centres tunisia egypt libya and syria was the far reaching program of neo liberal restructuring directed by the imf and put into practice quickly by the regimes with similar devastating results these included privatisation of almost all state owned enterprises mass poverty large scale unemployment in particular growing youth unemployment the lack of opportunities for university and college graduates falling real wages and the accumulation of vast amounts of wealth in the hands of the country s top ruling families in egypt for instance the world bank and the imf had prescribed extensive neoliberal policies since 1991 by the mid 2000s more than a decade and a half of neoliberal reforms brought the egyptian society to the brink of a deep social crisis in line with the economic reform and structural adjustment programme signed with the imf in 1991 the public sector in egypt was steadily privatised and prices and rents liberalised and increased sharply by 2005 209 of the 314 public sector companies had been sold either wholly or in part which was accompanied by massive lay offs and created extreme insecurity for those who were lucky enough to keep their jobs labour unrest increased from 2005 onwards while high food prices and high inflation added to the suffering of the majority of people as the businesses were celebrating positive growth rates and increased profit margins the world bank reports show that some 60 percent of egypt s population is either poor or vulnerable and inequality is on the rise egypt s economy was ruined largely by a combination of the self destructive policies of its regime and neoliberal policies imposed by the global financial bodies the country s economy suffered disastrously under an imf and world bank imposed restructuring process the same course took place in tunisia libya syria and other countries in the region these countries all started taking direct advice and loans from the imf the world bank and bond markets in the 1990s and since then their autocratic rulers have been consistently praised by these global agencies of neoliberalism as well as the governments of the us france and britain a capitalist dream iraq however is a different story in the sense that an exceptionally harsh neoliberal restructuring was introduced by a military invasion led by the us army in the most brutal and boldest way ever seen in the world the 2003 invasion of iraq led by the bush administration in the us turned iraq into a neoliberal utopia when saddam hussein s regime was defeated and replaced by the coalition provisional authority cpa headed by paul bremer a series of extensive neoliberal measures were quickly introduced in its first month without any waiting period from privatisation of 200 iraqi state owned companies to reducing corporate tax from 45 percent to 15 percent and from allowing foreign firms to retain 100 percent of their iraqi assets to a complete restructuring the iraqi banking system iraq s oil revenues were put in a us dominated development fund the development fund for iraq dfi held in an account at the federal reserve in new york and used for restructuring expenditure according to us government appointed audit reports to the us congress in 2004 2005 and 2006 from the special inspector general for iraqi reconstruction sigir there was poor delivery of contracts overcharging embezzlement and general fraud by private contractors and 8 8 billion of the 23 billion money held at dfi account remains unaccounted for the coalition provisional authority ran the occupation regime during its first 14 months and directed the most extreme version of neoliberal restructuring put in practice ever in the world enforcing the market as the organising and regulative principle of the state and society even the imf was alarmed and advised a more cautious approach in less than 14 months paul bremer issued 26 orders as a result of which the iraqi state was deprived of economic sovereignty and control of its own affairs more than half a million iraqi citizens abruptly lost their jobs after which over 50 percent of the workforce became unemployed the whole extensive neoliberal shock programme of economic reforms was described by the economist in september 2003 as a capitalist dream when the war started the economy of iraq had already been in deep trouble following the eight year long war against iran in the 1980s the first gulf war of 1990 91 and un imposed financial and trade embargo on iraq since 1990 on top of this after the invasion the coalition provisional authority paid large sums from the iraqi public sources to a number of international corporations ostensibly as compensation for lost profits or decline of business due to saddam hussein s aggressive behaviour in the region since 1990 sheraton received 11 million bechtel 7 million pepsi 3 8 million mobil 2 3 million kentucky fried chicken 321 000 and toys r us 190 000 all us based enterprises israeli farmers received 8 million supposedly because they were not able to harvest fully due to the threat from saddam s regime and israeli hoteliers and travel agencies received 15 million a detailed account of these compensations were given in the book by eric herring and glen rangwala iraq in fragments the occupation and its legacy during the first year of the occupation about 50 billion of reconstruction contracts were commissioned to various us corporations including halliburton bechtel skylinkusa stevedoring services of america and bearingpoint during the same period only 2 percent of the contracts were given to iraqi firms research by the financial times showed in 2013 that the top 10 american and foreign contractors in iraq secured business worth at least 72 billion between them prof david whyte of liverpool university describes this economic performance of the coalition provisional authority as one of the most audacious and spectacular crimes of theft in modern history the suspension of the normal rule of law by the occupying powers in turn encouraged coalition provisional authority tolerance of and participation in the theft of public funds in iraq state corporate criminality in the case of occupied iraq must therefore be understood as part of a wider strategy of political and economic domination what was left behind the war in iraq officially ended in 2011 when president obama declared the withdrawal of the troops in october and the last us soldiers left iraq on 18 december what was left behind however a deeply traumatized country with a totally bankrupt economy according to the un seven million iraqis were living below the poverty line one in five of young men and significantly more young women under 24 are unemployed in a country where almost 60 percent of the population is under 24 the draconian measures undertaken after the 2003 invasion left behind a seriously weakened iraq in every sense a large amount of iraqi money was paid to us contractors to implement local projects many of them never finished drowned in a sea of bureaucracy corruption and open theft no one knew how many such contractors were hired and how much money were paid to them for the tasks many of which remained incomplete in 2009 there were about 13 000 contractors employed by us agencies iraq has experienced several parliamentary elections since the invasion the first one in 2005 and the latest in 2018 at least fifteen pms came to power representing different political parties coalitions none of them however managed to satisfy the serious and rightful demands of the iraqi people ending corruption increasing living standards creating jobs and opportunities for increasing number of young educated people providing security and proper funding for the services there are of course many local reasons for this failure from increasing security concerns to the violent civil war in next door syria and to longstanding divisions of the country along ethnic and religious lines however the desperate state of the economy lack of opportunities for the local people sharply increased corruption as a result of contracting systems put in place by the us pro consul bremer have seriously contributed to the miserable state of affairs at times these different factors converge and at times they pull against each other but the state of the economy has remained as the most significant context and the obstacle for any iraqi government to deal with the serious problems of the country
playing poodle to the imf is not the way ahead by garvin karunaratne it is heartening to note that our new governor of the central bank had understood that the imf s neoliberal economics that we have closely followed from 1978 has miserably failed sri lanka s new chief flays neo liberalism economy next 28 12 19 following the imf since 1978 for over four decades has made us become a heavily indebted country a situation from which there is no return my two books how the imf ruined sri lanka and alternative programmes of success 2006 godages and how the imf sabotaged third world development godages kindle 2017 which happen to be the only books that are critical of the imf s teachings that also provide details of how salvation can be reached may be of service in fact my guru professor george axinn professor of international development at michigan state university in his introduction to my 2006 book how the imf ruined sri lanka wrote it is hoped that this timely book will enable international organizations to arrest the trend of failures in detail in the late seventies the imf took on the new role of prescribing the path to be taken by the third world countries to run their economies this was the structural adjustment program the imf imposed on every country that sought financial help in the early seventies the oil sheiks increased the price of oil threefold and many countries had to flock to the imf for help the imf laid down conditions that the countries had to follow if they are to get financial assistance and following the neoliberal policies was insisted on the imf was the institution established by the united nations to help and guide all countries in financial matters and no one questioned what the imf did since gaining independence the third world countries had to manage their finances the incoming foreign exchange mainly from exports was carefully handled and spent with great care for essential goods and items that were required for national development i speak through sheer experience i was once in charge of allocating foreign exchange for small industrialists in sri lanka we registered them after inspection where we carefully looked into what they produced whether it was required for our country in case their production required any item imported raw material or machinery an allocation of foreign exchange was allowed anyone could apply for foreign exchange for travel or imports each case was looked into in detail by the controller of exchange of the central bank no allocation of foreign exchange was made for foreign studies unless the study could not be done in the country or the study was required for national development a budget deficit was not heard of a small deficit in any year had to be covered in the next year it was a strictly controlled situation because the country had to manage with the foreign exchange it had we had no other option whatsoever countries had two budgets a foreign exchange budget and a local currency budget the foreign exchange budget had to manage all our foreign expenditure within the incoming foreign exchange while the local currency budget was managed with tax collection supplemented by printed local currency the imf model the structural adjustment programme liberalized the use of foreign exchange the imf prescribed that the countries should allow anyone any amount of foreign exchange for everything for luxury travel for importing anything for foreign studies and advised the countries to raise funds by privatizing state assets and also by borrowing foreign exchange if the country could not meet the demand the imf initially gave loans at low interest and even gave periods of grace when no repayment was charged this helped the countries and the leaders did not care about borrowing because they may not be in charge when the loans have to be repaid even a small commercial entrepreneur a sweets peddler on the street will know that this model of extravagant spending without matching the expenses to what is available is a guaranteed recipe for disaster but the imf bluffed its way through by retaining the likes of erudite professionals like stiglitz and sachs with whom no one could ever argue and win the imf laid down various conditions that had to be followed the conditions laid down were carefully decided to help the developed countries paul volker tells us of how the conditionality was decided as chairman of the federal reserve along with administrative colleagues major foreign central banks and especially the imf could arrange stop gap official financing and set out appropriate conditions for the heavily indebted borrower countries determined out of our common concern about threats to the american and the global banking system from banker to the world the funds obtained on loan were actually used to pay the debts and because the debts were to the imf and financial institutions of the developed countries thus the foreign exchange that came in was shunted back with profits the interest back to the developed countries however the country s books recorded the loan as a debt and this is the how the foreign debt has ballooned imports were not to be controlled the incoming foreign exchange was to be collected by the banks and to be used for imports and payments the government provided a list of items which should not be imported the banks were to decide the exchange rate at which they would buy and sell the foreign exchange that came into the country it was no longer to be controlled by the government it was supposed to be done by the process of supply and demand but because the relaxed use of foreign exchange caused a great demand when the supply was inadequate the local currency was inevitably devalued devaluation meant that all exports were discounted to the amount of the devaluation in 1978 sri lanka devalued the rupee by 101 rs 15 70 to rs 31 50 this devaluation meant that our exports were sold at half price while we had to pay double 101 more for imports a high interest rate was imposed this meant that entrepreneurs in the country had to obtain loans at high interest rates in sri lanka when this neo liberal free trade model was enforced the bank loan rate was raised to 25 the local entrepreneurs could not compete with the imports that came in without paying tariffs or paying low tariffs the result was that local entrepreneurs gave up their businesses instead they found easy money by depositing the money in fixed deposits imports took the place of local production and this increased the debt of the country this was advantageous to the developed countries because they found buyers for their manufactures the private sector was enthroned as the engine of growth and the public sector activities were constrained the problem is that the aim of the private sector is to gain the maximum profit while the aim of the public sector is the development of the country the commercial infrastructure that the country had built to enable development had to be abolished this included the guaranteed price scheme for paddy loan schemes to spur production and these had to be abolished in sri lanka this also included the marketing department that offered high prices for vegetables and fruits and simultaneously conducted sales at fair prices to consumers through a network of small shops to avoid inflation the aim of the marketing department was to break even and therefore kept a margin of around 15 to cover cost of transport and wastage while the private sector traders kept a margin of 100 this scheme helped the producer because a price higher than what was paid by traders was offered to producers simultaneously the produce was sold at cheap rates to consumers in cities at fair price shops this effectively controlled inflation the marketing department also ran a cannery that purchased stocks of fruits and produced jam food preparations and juice making the country self sufficient thereby saving foreign exchange spent for imports there was the cooperative wholesale establishment that purchased essential items abroad and sold keeping a low margin to avoid importers charging high prices the small industries department imported cotton yarn for distribution to textile makers it also guided handloomers to get into production it provided expertise for cooperative powerlooms to make fabric the department had a research unit at velona to help the powerlooms thus sri lanka had a developed textile industry we were self sufficient in producing all our textiles this entire commercial infrastructure necessary for national development was abolished at the instance of the imf on the grounds that the public sector should not deal with commerce this was inimical for development the imf recommends that countries should obtain foreign investment currently the third world countries are bending backwards to entice foreigners to invest in sri lanka investors come in search of profits one area of foreign investment is water opening up water services for investors mean that foreign companies come in establish water storage and purification systems and sell water to the people they foreign companies collect profits for ever this is the process set up by the imf for capital foreign exchange to flow back from the third world to the developed countries water services and purification systems are simple well known devices that can be easily set up by local entrepreneurs but the locals are not provided with inducements like tax haven periods and loans at reasonable interest to get into business what has happened when foreign investors invest in water is that the local resource of water too has been converted to foreign exchange to flow from third world countries to the developed countries third world countries have enticed mcdonalds pizza hut and such multinationals to come in they bring in a small sum of foreign exchange initially to establish their business they get into local trading in the local currency but take away the profits in foreign currency for ever without paying any taxes it amounts to a net loss of our foreign reserves foreign companies getting into trading in local rupees like uber etc also amounts to a net loss of our foreign exchange as though they calculate profits in rupees they take away their profits in foreign currency one of the latest inroads is hotel bookings by foreign companies over the internet hotel bookings done insist on payment in rupees to the hotelier but the internet companies gets fifteen percent of the payment paid to them in foreign currency again this goes from our reserves it is sad that our central bank fails to even understand how our foreign reserves are being robbed by these foreign investors overall all the economies of the third world got restructured by the imf s structural adjustment programme and foreign exchange flowed from the third world countries to the developed countries tremendous funds were sent out of the third world countries to the developed countries the debt service alone flowing from developing countries to the developed countries amounts to 600 billion annually this amounts to five times the aid budget the wto s agreement on intellectual property trips collects 60 billion annually jackson hickel aid in reverse how poor countries develop rich countries in global policy newleftproject org thus as far as third world countries are concerned foreign investment bore a negative result on the whole every aspect of the imf s structural adjustment programme caused poverty in third world countries and created a situation where foreign exchange flowed from the third world back to the imf and the developed countries milton friedman of the chicago school of economics the author of the free trade liberalization neoliberal model of the imf died recently having taken all third world countries and even some european countries to their graves all these countries have followed the neo liberal free trade model this model also brought riches in billions from the third world to the developed countries yet the imf holds on to this neo liberal free trade model like flogging a dead horse it is upto the imf to understand their mistake and provide a growth strategy the single strategy used by the imf is to impose austerity which only brings about more poverty in the country the rich are supported as their life style and mode of living purchase of luxury cars and luxury items travel sending their offspring for foreign education and holidays all create a flow of foreign exchange from the third world countries to the developed countries this is not a model for development instead it is a model designed to make the third world countries indebted create the flow of foreign exchange from the third world countries to the developed countries in short to make the third world countries colonies of the developed countries isn t it sad that the imf despite its failures over the past four decades has failed to find an algorithm to bring about growth and prosperity my book how the imf sabotaged third world development kindle documents this story of how the third world countries were gradually brought under the imf control their model of development actually enriched the developed countries at the cost of third world countries as far as economic development is concerned the imf model of development is not functioning in the interests of the third world countries already the ruler of ecuador has decided not to pay up the loans because the loans were non developmental it is upto our leaders to ensure that loans are obtained for development purposes only and not used to provide for luxury living the import of luxury cars and luxury travel all for the rich it is not surprising that the neoliberal policies imposed on sri lanka by the imf has resulted in our having accumulated a foreign debt of some 55 to 60 billion a debt to service which our country has to pay 4 8 billion in 2020 the solution in view of the fact that foreign direct investment has today a negative effect on our foreign resources the only option available to the government is to insist that where the profit comes from trading in the local currency the profit cannot be taken away in foreign currency in the days before the imf introduced its structural adjustment programme the usa had to collect payments for the supply of food under the pl 480 in local currency then the usa offered this money to us agribusiness firms at below market interest wessel hantman trading the future the government has to understand the basic fact that foreign investment brings a negative result to our own foreign reserves in case the investors trade in the local currency the only path available to the government is to follow import substitution where we ourselves produce what we import and stop imports we save the foreign exchange spent for imports and also find incomes for workers in the process this has to be done on a massive scale our country has a great deal of experience in handling import substitution type of industries we hand a marketing department cannery that was able to make sri lanka self sufficient in all food preparations fruit juice and jam it would be of interest to note that self sufficiency was achieved within three years 1955 to 1958 once we produced around fifty percent of our paper requirements during the divisional development councils programme of mrs bandaranayake in 1971 1977 we established many successful industries there was a paper making industry established in kotmale a mechanised boat making industry was established at matara the crayon factory established in morawaka is well known for its success the art of making crayons was unearthed at the rahula college science lab at matara after three month long experiments under my personal direction a crayon is a sophisticated product and if we could have produced crayons and successfully marketed it which we did achieve we can be dead certain of being able to spearhead a programme of import substitution that to me is the only method of economic development available to us over to our new leaders hope the message in this paper reaches our leaders garvin karunaratne former g a matara author of how the imf ruined sri lanka alternative

last year s strong equity market returns were a welcome rebound from the gloomy end to 2018 optimistic sentiment at year end represented a stark contrast to the gloom of a year ago there are multiple reasons to be optimistic the phase one trade agreement between the u s and china de escalates a destructive trade war and should provide a boost to global growth in 2020 the decisive u k election victory for boris johnson s conservative party over the jeremy corbyn led labor party provides the majority in parliament needed to get brexit done investors are relieved that corbyn will be replaced as leader of the labor party positive news on trade also emerged in north america with republicans and democrats agreeing on the terms of a free trade agreement to replace nafta bipartisan support for the u s mexico canada agreement paves the way for an early 2020 ratification federal reserve policy heading into 2020 is also dramatically different than was the case a year ago the fed is likely to stay on hold until after the 2020 election in contrast to the tightening bias in place entering 2019 chinese economic stimulus should contribute to global growth in 2020 however the message from china s central economic work conference is that china s leaders are prioritizing stability and sustainability of economic growth over reflation consequently the boost to global growth may fall short of prior reflation cycles it is good news that chinese policymakers will place less of an emphasis on deleveraging than was the case in 2018 implying a more relaxed outlook for credit growth banking sector reform long overdue is under way monetary policy is also constructive for global economic growth the fed is likely to remain on hold during the election year and central bank policy is expansionary in much of the world however central banks have more influence on the short end of the yield curve the long end of the curve drifted higher in response to improved geopolitical and growth outlooks while the short end remains anchored by monetary policy the steepening yield curve resulting from higher long term rates is a positive development for banks but less so for many borrowers story continues the overall economic outlook is moderately positive the u s consumer continues to be a source of growth with unemployment low consumer debt largely under control and wages and asset values rising corporate earnings growth should rise in some cases from depressed levels blackrock s rick rieder sets some realistic expectations projecting that 2020 will be a 1 8 ish kind of year rieder s expectation is for u s real gdp growth of approximately 1 8 inflation of about 1 8 and 10 year treasury yield of 1 8 that scenario of not too hot not too cold creates expectations of positive but unspectacular growth for equities and a mixed outlook for bonds unfortunately investors may be overly optimistic about the 2020 outlook elevated valuations among u s growth stocks leave little room for disappointment bullish sentiment may fade quickly if reality falls short of expectations in the words of j p morgan s david kelly the phase one trade deal with china represents a fragile cease fire rather than a durable peace tensions between the u s and china are likely to resume after the 2020 election business spending may rebound to a lower degree than expected if corporate ceos view the trade truce as temporary with tensions with china temporarily on hold president donald trump could turn his ire toward other countries european trade imbalances and underinvestment in nato may be trump s next target as it seems unlikely that he ll abandon trade issues entirely during an election year the latest developments in iran and iraq are examples of the unexpectated geopolitical issues that could cause an interruption in the latest stage of the bull market some of the left behind segments of the market should stage a recovery in 2020 the significant valuation disparity between value and growth stocks seems unsustainable manufacturing stocks which are a major component of value indexes should benefit from chinese stimulus measures and the easing of trade tensions financial stocks also a major component within value indexes would benefit from a steeper yield curve and moderate economic growth there may be a greater potential for a positive surprise from europe than has been the case in recent years export centric european stocks which trade at a higher than normal discount to u s stocks would benefit from a manufacturing rebound german consumer spending appears to be improving in response to rising wages a weaker dollar would also help european stocks selectivity in emerging markets is increasingly important as there is no longer a rising tide that lifts the entire emerging markets asset class consequently distinct winners and losers are likely to emerge among emerging markets countries and companies short term bond yields are likely to be restrained by central banks while longer term bond yields are likely to drift upward the risk reward trade off in longer term bonds is less attractive than was the case a year ago but a well diversified allocation to bonds remains a necessary counterweight to equity risk investors should maintain enough portfolio liquidity to address known cash needs over the next six to 12 months heightened volatility is likely to be an unfortunate reality for 2020 particularly as election related headlines mount during the second half of the year pervasive disruption in the global economy and investment markets will continue to influence which companies will be market winners and losers a t rowe price study last year estimated that more than 30 of the s p 500 was undergoing disruption a number that surely will rise in coming years as fidelity s anne richards says this time isn t different but is faster the time tested value investment approaches of benjamin graham and warren buffett are likely to pay off in the long run however a strategy of simply buying cheap stocks may not be a sustainable approach to value investing the pace of change in large part because of technology is such that many of today s value companies may be cheap for a reason it is increasingly important to identify companies that are resistant to disruption or are effectively responding to disruption consequently investors should consider investing in funds that go beyond simple price metrics to determine company value oaktree capital s howard marks provides some timeless wisdom move forward but with caution the outlook is not so bad and asset prices are not so high that one should be in cash or near cash the penalty in terms of likely opportunity cost is just too great to justify being out

why 2020 could be a big year for international stocks over us equities eased trade tensions between the united states and china and signs of a strengthening global economy could be good news for international equities and european stocks in particular according to market strategists some analysts and strategists have been urging clients to move more of their portfolio into international stocks that advice follows a strong run for the u s market that widened the gap between domestic and foreign equities and capped a dominant decade for u s stocks since 2010 the s p 500 rose more than 188 an annualized rate of about 11 2 the msci world ex us index saw much more modest gains climbing 50 5 overall or roughly 4 2 per year if your asset allocation has significant domestic exposure and little to no international equity exposure we think now is an excellent time to make a shift bespoke investment group said in a note to clients last month 20200102 us v intl stocks last year was strong for stocks around the world but the u s still took the lead the international index rose 18 1 but the s p 500 jumped more than 28 the global stock market got a negative shock in the first trading days of 2020 equities slipped following the u s airstrike that killed a top iranian military leader however oil prices have moderated and stocks have avoided a multi day selloff global rebound much of the optimism about international markets comes from global economic data where both hard and soft indicators suggest that the global slowdown may have bottomed out measures of manufacturing and global trade have ticked up in recent months we have reasons to believe that this improvement in manufacturing and trade can be sustained morgan stanley chief economist chetan ahya said in a note to clients the eurozone is one area where investors should increase their exposure according to mark luschini chief investment strategist at janney montgomery scott in part due to positive signs about the chinese economy the european stock market is more sensitive to the global economy than the u s market luschini said similar to equities in emerging markets because chinese growth has such a large impact on the world s economy even a slight improvement could spill into international markets luschini said if china merely stabilizes its growth from the deceleration that it s had the last couple years that ll go a long way to putting a positive impulse into these equity markets luschini said europe was home to a few countries where stocks saw better years than the united states in 2019 including russia and greece italy was one of the best performing g 7 countries last year with the ftse mib roughly matching with the s p 500 last year with a 28 3 gain measured in euros the stoxx 600 a major european index gained 24 last year investors can gain exposure to all of europe through total market exchange traded funds for the region such as vanguard s ftse europe etf or individual countries through a more targeted funds like ishares msci germany etf foreign exchange another opportunity for return from international markets comes from the relative strength of the dollar if investors buy international stocks and the dollar weakens against that foreign currency the total return could be more than the stock return once the currency is converted back to dollars the dollar index is currently about 2 off its 52 week highs but is roughly 9 above its recent lows in early 2018 the so called real broad dollar surged in 2015 and 2016 with another decent rally in 2018 but not much change in 2019 bespoke said as a result the dollar looks relatively strong but not dramatically by any means the strength of the dollar is determined in part by the purchasing power of other countries so global growth could mean that other currencies strengthen against the dollar if you do see emerging growth abroad that should lead to a relatively weaker dollar which would feed into the returns for u s based investors that are earned in overseas markets luschini said central banks iran remain risks tensions in the middle east and the potential for elevated oil prices is one of several risks that world markets face in 2020 the risks to the recovery will be if trade tensions between the us and china escalate again a rise in geopolitical tensions in the middle east or if late cycle challenges in the us result in a more pronounced rise in inflation ahya said another risk could be a change in interest rate policies from the world s central banks sweden s riksbank bucked the trend of easing last month when it raised rates back to zero the global average for policy rates is expected to rise to 2 06 this year from 1 92 at the end of 2019 according to bespoke however luschini said it is unlikely that many central banks follow sweden s lead in tightening monetary policy i think there s going to be a generally shared reluctance to raise interest rates luschini said source cnbc
the san diego union tribune editorial board interviewed four candidates in the 50th congressional district race ahead of the march 3 2020 primary election in which the top two vote getters will advance to a runoff election in november below is the transcript of our dec 9 2019 interview with democratic candidate ammar campa najjar who is running to succeed duncan hunter in a district that represents residents in a large swath of san diego county including el cajon escondido alpine julian borrego springs and some of riverside county this interview was transcribed using the digital transcription service temi and checked for accuracy by a staffer to call any errors to our attention or to ask any questions about our interviews please email matthew hall sduniontribune com with the subject line election interviews union tribune thanks for joining us ammar tell us why you decided to throw your hat in the ring again and how this time will be different ammar campa najjar yeah i mean my reason for running hasn t changed too much from last time but just to kind of get a refresher obviously i was born in east county i was raised by my working class christian mom dad left when i was young growing up with a single parent i had to work at a very young age as the groundskeeper and a janitor to help my mom at my church to make ends meet um and it was my faith in my mom who really inspired me to go to sdsu finish my degree and commit my life to service um so before running for office i worked at the white house i worked at the u s hispanic chamber of commerce and i worked at the u s department of labor helping people working people like the ones i grew up with and you know growing up seeing the way we struggled i realized that you know people like my mom took responsibility never got public assistance for anything worked multiple jobs um took responsibility but were shortchanged in opportunity and later on in life i realized it was because there are politicians in office who looked down at the very people that i ve looked up to my whole life um and for me it s about making sure that they have real representation um and i m just i m fed up with that and i think there are some people who are even running in this race who just don t know what it s like to live on a dirt road to live the way we lived to struggle the way we struggled so for me it s about honoring my mom her sacrifices her generation s sacrifices um bringing some east county grit to a washington that doesn t know how to work properly um and making sure people could live work and retire with dignity that s why i m running and i think i m uniquely positioned given that nearly half the district entrusted me to be their congressman in this district i think that uniquely positions us to pick up the pieces move forward and bring the entire district together not just one party over the other but put country over party and i think i m the only candidate who has that message in this race advertisement meet other candidates in the race below commentary meet the candidates for the 50th congressional district these are four of the major candidates seeking to succeed congressman duncan hunter in the 2020 primary election q how do you do it this time around when you have some big republican names who don t have the damage of hunter and hunter s um you know then indictment now a right well i think obviously nobody also has the 40 year dynasty name right so there s good and bad leaving um but i think for us it s about you know we learned in this last race everywhere that we went we won we won el cajon we won parts of fallbrook that nobody ever thought was in play and everywhere we went we won everywhere we didn t go enough and really communicate enough we fell short so our goal is to pick up the pieces and see the places where we fell short and keep getting our message across and i think look in this race in this district people you know a handshake matters and looking someone in the eye your word is your bond trust takes time in this district and i ve built that trust over three years we had two years to fly this plane take it off and we nearly won last time this time i think people know who i am they know i lost this race and i m still fighting for them i didn t lose a race or resign from a district and go pick up and run somewhere else that was more beneficial to me i m running in this district and i think that kind of commitment goes a long way for folks and if you just look at the numbers if you look at my opponents they re all saying we want to run this race not because we re from here not even because we could even vote in this race two of them can t even vote in this district and they re asking people for their votes um but they re running because they want to keep this seat in control of one party over the other and the math isn t there if you re just speaking to 40 percent of the district there s 60 percent who don t identify as republicans and there are a lot of republicans who don t think that s enough just to say we re going to keep this seat in control of one party and business as usual will work that s why they voted for trump they want something different um so for us i think the fact that i am the only one saying i want to represent everybody put country over party and i know where i stand i will be the most conservative congressman in san diego and i d make no qualms about that i know where i stand i know my role and i m comfortable with that role because i m from here so i think we have a message that speaks to the masses and not just a vocal minority on either side of the political aisle i will be the most conservative congressman in san diego and i d make no qualms about that ammar campa najjar q i don t think i heard you use that phrase last time around i will be the most conservative politician a just so it s quick and palatable it s true i will be the most conservative i mean the bar is pretty low if you look at the others right i mean um and they re all great i mean they do good things but for me i know that my job will be to honor the traditions and values of our founders to protect our freedoms i own guns i have a gun at home i m in the middle of getting a ccw no one s taking my guns away i understand the need to secure the border i ve been saying it for three years there s a way to do it i think that actually gets it done um so i know my role but in the end it s not just trying to placate one party or the other it s getting things done getting some forward movement hopefully working with juan vargas and scott and whoever wins susan seat and mike levin to get some things done in our county advertisement q the previous campaign saw some of the most nasty character attacks we ve witnessed in years in this region is there going to be some holdover from that and are you ready to address it a i think that it lost shock value for people they re like man that was shocking to hear that in october or whenever it happened but i think it s lost its shock value i think it s been asked and answered ad nauseum i think we ve all talked about it i think all of you have done a great job as just the free press objectively laying out how that was just inaccurate um you know we had j street with the jewish organization a pro israel pro peace organization endorsed us last year this body s endorsement the tribune s endorsement those were all my coats of armor that really i think help blunt the worst of it because think about it if it was really a salient argument i would have lost by like 10 20 points that s just such a big claim that you don t get within you know you don t get within like a couple of percentage points with that being levied at you so i think we were able to blunt that um and i don t think that s as i wrote in the op ed for the tribune i don t think that s why we came up short i think it was because we were taking on 40 years with two years of campaigning so i think people know that and this time around i m going to focus more about who i am and not let my opponents claim the narrative but where i come from how i was raised by my mom and let people know i m also latino you know and people don t know that they just know my dad s side of the family um but focus about who i am what i m about and keep this race about real people real issues and not kind of get into the mudslinging of it all and i don t think i don t know if these candidates are willing to go that direction as much as the others so there s some of that that is an advantage towards me q your federal jobs would you describe it as involving policy because we faced some criticism a couple of years ago for not going more critically at you about the perception that you had inflated your responsibilities within the obama administration and the labor department a no i mean my job at the department of labor was to work in public affairs and to promote these programs policy s important but if no one hears about them and none of it happens right um so my job was to communicate to the public the availability of these programs and uh that s what i did i didn t personally go out there and give people jobs but i did do an important role in making sure that we doubled and diversified the number of apprenticeship jobs they re not just federal they re federally funded and in partnership with corporations um but those are things that you know we were proud of as an administration to be able to carry forward um so yeah i don t think there was an inflation at all of what it is that i did i worked as a federal official in the obama administration q did you work in the white house or the executive office building a i worked in both so i worked in the eob and the white house and the department of labor building advertisement q medicare for all obviously a huge issue this campaign you were supportive of it last time around has your position changed or evolved in any way a i have to look back at the transcripts so when we were talking about it i said how i believe that we should start with 50 and older in the last interview that we did and for me it s about looking at how we could make healthcare affordable and accessible for everybody whatever you want to call it is fine with me but let s take a step back and think about the importance of healthcare it s one fifth of the economy it s also for most of us probably everybody in this room it s how we enter this world through the healthcare system for most of us it s going to be how we exit this world through the healthcare system and the time between those two moments really depends on the quality of healthcare that you have and the access that you have um i don t think healthcare should be free but i don t think the cost of healthcare should be your life something between those two extremes i think is reasonable um and i don t think that people who are you know have preexisting conditions we had a time before 2008 where if you were a woman who suffered from domestic violence that was considered a pre existing condition and you could not get healthcare from your insurance provider that is ridiculous um there are people that we ve heard of who you know were waiting pinching their pennies holding onto that next paycheck waiting to get that paycheck so they could purchase their insulin and they didn t get it in time and they died the cost of doing business should not be your life healthcare insurance providers ceos the people who profit off of our insurance company there s nothing wrong with profiting off of it because there s a motive the profit motive does create um some ingenuity and advancement in the industry which is good but the costs of doing business should not be well that person didn t get treatment therefore i m able to get more of a paycheck because we re not treating at risk people there s something wrong about that and if that s the mentality of ceos and the people who are calling the shots who are saying that you know at risk people should not get healthcare coverage that s criminal and someone should suffer the consequences i think that s a criminal act it s letting somebody die so you could make a better bonus and we know ceos the lifespan of a ceo is like five years usually and so they re trying to buy back stock and make a profit and do all that stuff but it can t be at the expense of patients so for me looking at that backdrop what s the best way that we can make sure everybody has access to affordable healthcare first i think one part that doesn t get focused enough on is the pharmaceutical companies taking them on um and i said this last time taking on the pharmaceutical companies which is i think one fifth of the healthcare overall costs um allowing medicare to purchase uh prescription drugs in bulk just like when you go to costco if you buy something in bulk the individual unit s cheaper so doing that letting them purchase it in bulk and negotiate the cost of drugs opening up our markets to well regulated advanced countries like canada and others um to spread the cost more evenly and recognizing that we as americans we subsidize the rest of the world s medications because we are the ones who are paying for the r d and everything else and the same medication that is being sold here by the same company costs more than south or north of the border that s ridiculous so we have to fix that we do that we narrow a lot of the costs for people the second thing i would do is for me campacare for me what i believe is it s about choice i don t think it s about taking people s choices away um my iteration of medicare for all would have been a medicare for all who want it i don t believe in taking 160 million people off of their private healthcare insurance i also don t think that you should eliminate private insurance companies because even medicare today when i go to town halls not in the abstract but talk to even progressives who love medicare for all until i tell them how many of you have medicare advantage or supplemental healthcare they all raise their hand i m like well under medicare for all that would be gone they re like oh no can t do that um and medicare for all is a misnomer it doesn t apply to the military or to veterans or people from native american tribes so it s a misnomer and for me what i want is to give choices we ll have a public option where you could buy into it it s not free we ll have um a nonprofit option kind of like a kaiser i think we should have something that s accessible and nationwide because there s some that s worked that models worked for a lot of people and then have the current private options and the more you give choices i think the more you have those those three kind of entities competing against each other and i think competition is what drives down costs and increases the quality of care so if we did those things um and protect the laws that we have on the books for people with pre existing conditions if you re you know trying to finish school at the age of younger than 26 you should stay on your parents healthcare and i think those ideas would take i think pressure away from small business owners like me who are trying to i don t have employees right now but it s hard to provide healthcare for your employees if you re a small business it s a difficult thing to do so um you know those are the kinds of things that i think if we put in place would reduce the cost of healthcare and then also look at members of congress get right they have the gold standard obamacare 72 percent of their healthcare costs is subsidized by the federal government including duncan hunter who calls what i talk about socialized medicine what he has is more socialized medicine than what i m suggesting it s 72 percent of taxpayers pay for 72 percent of members of congress healthcare so um we re okay when we talk about subsidizing members of congress healthcare or giving corporate welfare to the corporations but we re somehow not okay with and can t find the money to help kind of even the playing field and it s because this system is built for the well off and well connected um and we need to kind of i think re establish some balance and make sure that working people aren t being locked out of the healthcare that could extend their lives um my iteration of medicare for all would have been a medicare for all who want it i don t believe in taking 160 million people off of their private healthcare insurance ammar campa najjar q economists believe the competition drives down costs in almost every field but they don t believe in healthcare name a country in the world where competition has driven down healthcare there are so many fixed costs there s so many extreme expenses that the argument that it pushes down healthcare where s the proof a well i don t know i think you know if there s hybrid systems like in france and other countries hybrid systems work where you have a combination of public and private uh option advertisement q right the best private system in the world is in taiwan where they have a medicare for all that provides basic level of services and rich people can buy additional services in the private market but that ain t competition that s the government providing a baseline in services that are subsidized and rich people being able to buy more elaborate care a well that s a form of just having choice and options and a diverse portfolio of healthcare so what i would propose is when if i get into congress i would support um you know launching a nonprofit type of health care and i would also open up a public option and i think if you started at people who are 55 and older because they re the ones who cost the most in the system um we try that out if it works you know fdr said if something works good if it doesn t admit it plainly and try something else so i would start with 55 and older and then work my way down for people to have access to that it s not automatic it s not free nothing s free someone s paying for something let s be honest and also we re america we re not other countries so i don t like to look at other countries as an example of what we do here if that were true we d be looking at australia for some things and britain for other things america has unique needs q that s not true mckinsey stays in business the think tank stays in business simply by pointing out that government doesn t follow the best practices why are americans different fundamentally than others in providing health care a so wait what was the question that you re asking q you re saying that americans should not copy what s worked well elsewhere this is the exact kind of thinking about government that has let mckinsey make billions of dollars for all these years and puts out reports every year that says best practices you re not following best practices why shouldn t we copy what s worked elsewhere in the world starting with france and taiwan a because we re not like those countries i think we could we have well within our wheel house to figure out how to fix healthcare here and it has to do with the fact that big companies are not held accountable in this country that s the biggest problem there s 100 billion a year that goes towards corporate welfare every year and that s um that s from the cato institute which is a very libertarian organization they re not progressive types and they see 100 billion a year is going towards corporate welfare and it s not trickling down to the taxpayers the people who are giving their hard earned taxpayer money so in our country what we have is i think just corporate greed and corporate power run amok i don t believe in you know there s certain countries that have health care better than us but maybe they re on the side of you know more socialists or social democratic or whatever i don t believe we should live in a country where the government controls corporations but i don t believe we should live in a country where corporations control our government and that s the problem today with healthcare and a whole bunch of other things if we were able to crack down on that i think we d see a lot of funds freed up for people to use to drive down the cost of housing and healthcare and education and i do concede your point that other countries might have good ideas it might be ok to turn and wander and take a look um but i think it s well within our wheelhouse uh to fix this problem the healthcare problem you probably would agree in america is unique because we do this to ourselves this system is rigged against patients and it favors the profit motive of ceos who are looking for hundreds of millions of dollars of bonuses we caused this problem we could fix this problem because it is from here and it is of here and i don t think we have to look towards other countries to figure out a problem that we created that s unique to america in terms of the greed that exists with corporate america advertisement q the united states pays more in government spending per capita than britain and canada which have single payer healthcare systems so we re paying more the government pays more per capita than we do in countries with single payer so how can we not copy some other places who have better health outcomes at cheaper costs a yeah we spend one fifth of our economy but where does it go i mean 20 of private insurance 20 of it goes to overhead costs medicare is 2 percent so we have to look at where the actual costs lie and it really does lie in lining up the pockets of uh the wealthy and corporations and those big ceos so if we brought that and rein that in um that s what i would do if it just so happens that other countries are doing that and that s what they re doing that s great but i think we know the problem the systemic problems of our healthcare system here without having to pontificate about what s happening across the pond we know the problems we just don t have the political will to do anything about it and i think that s what makes me unique as a candidate in this race is you know tragically we saw what happened with congressman hunter but it s not unique it s not special there s not he s not the only person who s done this stuff and i think it s what happens when you are in bed with corporate lobbyists when you re trying to impress them or live that lavish lifestyle it takes a hold of you and that won t happen to me because i have sworn off corporate money i haven t done it or needed it at all and we ve had successful cycles of fundraising and that ll give me the ability to be freed up when i go to congress in america there s nine pharmaceutical lobbyists per congressman knocking down your door that doesn t happen across the pond that s unique to this country and it s because we take the bait the system is set up in such a way that that actually is a good way for them to get their agenda passed the corporate lobbyists the pharmaceutical companies whoever it is we have to fix that and so for me one of the first things i would focus on is finishing that h r 1 for the people act which reigns in you know unaccountable campaign finance funding coming from these corporations that deals with ethics reforms the kind of which if we had implemented before hunter would not have done what he did and then also making sure that people have the ability to vote if they re citizens and expanding that access and that right so those are the systemic problems that are unique to america and there are best practices across the pond that we could look at but there s also things that are so uniquely systemically problematic about our system that we have to fix here um so yeah this file photo shows border patrol agent michael jimenez looking at a tijuana colonia in the shadow of otay mountain john gastaldo san diego union tribune q let me ask you about border security the other candidates in the race support building a wall you said that your border security position puts you to the right of the existing san diego congressional delegation so what is your border policy a i support building the wall in certain places where it makes sense i defer to the experts in the border patrol agents who tell me first of all like i need to see through the thing so i can know what s coming down the pike but for me it s a combination of uh infrastructure wall where you need it of personnel and technology in a world where we have 5g you know we have to have technology we have to have personnel and we have to have a physical barrier i get the rhetoric and the vitriol surrounding this has made it very polarized and partisan but the wall that we have was advocated by hunter sr and supported by president bill clinton so i just wish we could decouple the partisanship and the vitriol from what actually works and what s needed um and so i would support building the wall i would we have two tiers three tiers of it now we could uh you know fortify it but i don t think we should have from sea to shining sea a wall and when you get president trump on the good day he says that himself too right um but it s become this campaign slogan that s become very divisive and charged but i would support it and i think look the gang of eight bill that we were talking about maybe a decade ago had 40 billion in border security that s twice as much as what the wall would cost so it s not about cost for democrats because they were fine with it when it was not the trump administration and we were fine with it when it was a suite of options you know not just the wall but also personnel technology um and i would do a mile by mile assessment of what we need and i supported the bipartisan um bill that didn t get passed of course because congress doesn t doing anything um between congressman will hurd a republican from texas and pete aguilar from california and it was called the usa act the uniting and securing america so what they proposed was border security which i m talking about which would include a physical wall but also giving permanent status to those dreamers those young people who served in our military who are going to school who are maybe educators themselves lawyers who are contributing to america s economy and way of life who love america giving them a permanent residence and a pathway to earn citizenship i think if we did that it s a practical solution so we have to secure the border we have to prevent you know drugs and criminals and human trafficking and guns from coming in from our southern border really the biggest concentration that we should be focusing our resources on are ports of entry as well because commerce flows through there um so border security is one thing i believe in expanding legal immigration and if you do that properly you could cut down on illegal immigration you could crack down on it and then deal with the 12 million people who are here already in a realistic way i mean you can t just say we re going to deport everybody you have to start by prioritizing those who really need to be deported i don t think you should be prioritizing you know somebody who was undocumented served in our country in uniform but doesn t have citizenship that s not the person i would prioritize or the person who is getting an education here in america i wouldn t deport that person to go compete against us in another country it doesn t make sense i would focus on those criminals who are you know the rapists the killers the drug dealers they so happen to be the ones who are actually the biggest victims of those undocumented criminals are other undocumented people and if we gave status to the ones who are doing the right thing they would report those criminals quicker than ice could round them up and throw them back um so i think we have to have a holistic approach and again my republican opponents all they talk about is wall wall wall and they know in their hearts that that s not the only thing that s going to fix it because there s a 25 ladder that could overcome that wall unless that was 40 000 feet in the air people are going to fly over overstay their visas and we ll still have them here illegally so um we need to do that and then also i ve seen it work in other parts of the world and we need to do like bunker busting those tunnels just blow them up and make sure that the drug dealers and the gun smugglers can t do that anymore um so i don t know if that s to the right of my opponents that if none of them have said you know blowing up bunkers but i m all for that and we ve seen across the world that that s worked and sadly but it does so that s the comprehensive plan i support building the wall in certain places where it makes sense ammar campa najjar advertisement q you touched on the military what do you what was your take on the way that the eddie gallagher case has played out and the role duncan hunter played in that and the president played in that a well i think that there was an overstating of what eddie gallagher did we found out and then it got rolled back um it s tough i mean anyone who thinks that war is something that s black and white um i think is kidding themselves it s not living in the real world there s codes of conduct there s ways to comport yourself absolutely um and do members of our military uh sometimes not live up to that code absolutely but think about what we re asking them to do we re asking them to go shed some of their humanity to go defend our freedoms and sometimes i mean sometimes you have to become something that you don t believe in and turn it off when you come to civilian life um sometimes people don t do that effectively that s why you know 22 veterans a day you know lose their lives because they can t turn off that switch but when you are going abroad to go kill people to defend our freedoms um a part of you has to die off for a little bit and i m sure that s what s happening when eddie gallagher did what he did so i can t get in his head i can t i have a hard time personally um casting judgment on people who willingly go serve our country and put themselves in harm s way and live in a war zone as someone who has had to live in a war zone not by choice but growing up that s where i was put um it s hard for me to look at somebody who went through that willingly to defend our country and cast a lot of judgment so um hopefully you know in the future that we learned from this and we could be more strict about how we conduct ourselves because i do believe as a country we don t just lead by the example of our power but the power of our example and how we you know conduct ourselves and there are certain rules in war but i just don t know if um i could be the kind of person that that goes after our military folks for doing the unspeakable doing things that are better left imagined than described for us to luxuriate in the shade of freedom that they ve given us and then us to turn around and blame them for how they went about it i think it s wrong and then there s people like congressman hunter who served in the military who is in congress um who should be able to hold his members uh to a higher standard to his fellow men and women in uniform and it just sends it seems like sometimes he i don t know if he has the right intentions i mean he s a thing of the past now but um talk about someone who also should ve lived up to certain standards the things he said about um how he conducted himself when he was serving and um also using the marine emblem to use hate mail against me those are the kinds of things that i feel like he knows better he should know better and i didn t have to be the one to condemn the commandant of the marines did it for me and i think that s appropriate i m glad that the military stepped in and made those judgments on him and they ve made judgments about trump going to i think a fundraiser in florida with eddie gallagher last week and the military advised that he didn t do that so i hope those voices continued to speak up because they have more authority than a candidate running for congress navy special operations chief edward gallagher celebrates with his wife andrea after being acquitted of premeditated murder at naval base san diego july 2 2019 in san diego gallagher was found not guilty in the killing of a wounded islamic state captive in iraq in 2017 he was cleared of all charges but one of posing for photos with the dead body of the captive photo by sandy huffaker getty images getty images q if you were in congress the last two years and the gallagher family comes to you and says help us you would have done exactly what duncan hunter did a i would have said let s see if you have a case and make sure look if you did something wrong you ll fess up to that but if they re over stating what you did then we re going to fight against that so i definitely would look at their situation with some measure of compassion but also just say look what is it you did is it breaking any codes or any laws or any rules fess up to those don t put them under the rug but if there is if some of your colleagues are you know against you about something then you ll fight that and i would be there for his family even if he was guilty i d be there to support his family if he was in my district or just came to me for help um i don t think my mentality had been like he deserves exoneration without me looking at the facts he s just a brother he needs to be exonerated i wouldn t look at it from that lens i think that s the lens that hunter went through for me it d be well let s see what you did right what you did wrong is it being overstated and move on from that i m not sure about the pardon either um i wouldn t go that far but i definitely would be there for him if he needed me him and his family q would you support the president taking the steps that he did to bump him back up and all the efforts that trump did to intervene advertisement a you know i d have to look at the case more closely honestly because it just there s so much being thrown in our direction but um i d have to look at why he got his trident taken away why he was had all that happen again um i just don t think we should be making examples of people who did bad things and saying then it s ok everyone else can do it too so i d have to take a look at like why was his trident taken away why was he uh demoted basically and then look at the reason the things that kinda did not stick on him in the final verdict and kind of go from there q so speaking of pardons at least one of your opponents has suggested that clemency should be considered for duncan hunter given that it would be easier on the taxpayers to go that route is that you were feeling on the subject a i don t know if congressman this candidate you re speaking of believes that about everybody or just this individual i dunno if he believes in like actual criminal justice reform uh i don t think he believes in um you know leveling the playing field and all of that i m pretty sure he s probably taking money from private prisons so i think we all know what this was he was trying to angle for an endorsement that would help his political purposes and i think that this person probably doesn t even see what s wrong with it because it s self interest and we just got rid of a congressman who admitted to or were going to because he s not running again and is resigning but this idea of being self interested it all comes from and i have said this before if you are in bed with special interests and lobbyists literally or figuratively um it goes from special interests to self interest to self destruction and that s the path the hunter went on it appears the same path that issa is trying to encourage but they re kind of uh when it comes to corruption when it comes to ethical problems i m not surprised that this is what congressman issa said i mean um but i don t agree with that at all i don t think that that s the way he should be the last thing we need is for this to become the new normal hunter himself said i ll take the hit i ll take responsibility for the president to exonerate hunter for something that he pled guilty to and said he ll take the hit it just gives everybody just excuse to not follow the rules on both sides right um today duke cunningham would still be congressman if that was the case can you imagine and jesse jackson jr would be in congress so there have to be rules and if you break the law you pay your dues and you have to follow you know pay the consequences so i think that issa is just angling politically once again and not holding people accountable and that s the problem in washington and that s why people hate washington because they live by a different set of rules whether it s healthcare or the law and everything in between um they live by a different set of rules and issa is a product of that he was there for 20 years and he created the system we re living in he spent 20 years there doing that so of course he s pedaling that it s not surprising to me um but it s unacceptable and we have to change the status quo and this is the time when i actually agree with carl demaio that we have to drain the swamp these swamp creatures they re the reason that we have this problem and it does two things to our system one voters lower the bar we don t hold our elected officials to a higher standard so then we elect knuckleheads and two we let them be the ones who make the rules and then people just kind of are complacent and they re like you re all corrupt and so it s disheartening to have issa say that and i don t think voters are with him on that they believe in the law file cattle graze among wind turbines near stanton texas on feb 21 2019 brandon thibodeaux the new york times brandon thibodeaux nyt q what do you think of the green new deal a i don t think a lot about it and i ll tell you why its a nonbinding resolution it s not legislation there s no like appropriations to it there s no financial aspect to it it s just a list of aspirational ideas aspirations that i think are well intentioned um and i do think that climate change is a big issue but i don t think that the green new deal s anything that s serious it s not it s not a it s a nonbinding resolution meaning it has as much legislative power there s another nonbinding resolution that stipulates that congress must congratulate whoever wins the super bowl every year that s how much power this green new deal nonbinding resolution has and i think it has a lot of things in it that have nothing to do with the environment directly ubi and a bunch of other stuff um that make it i think impractical well intentioned impractical um i do think that climate change is a big problem i mean the military the pentagon has said that climate change is the biggest national security threat that we face in this world and if we don t get it under control in 12 years we won t even be able to breathe a breath of fresh air so we have to take it on seriously and it s not just because you know it s not if you don t love trees and you re not a tree hugger that s fine climate change still affects you it s the you know the drought that happened in syria that triggered the arab spring in part because of climate change there s about i think 50 military facilities in the u s two thirds of which are not fully combat ready because of rising coastlines because of mudslides and fires and other things that are caused because of extreme weather events because of climate change so it is hurting our ability to protect our country um and it s causing a lot of issues and even if you didn t believe in climate change this is what i tell people if you don t believe in climate change what if you just assumed that climate change was real and just operated on the uh solutions we re seeing that you know renewable energy the more we use it the cheaper it is the more you use oil the more expensive it is so eventually it s going to become cost effective and you re starting to see that transition happen just because consumers are choosing it and they re becoming more affordable options so for me you know bringing everybody along for the fight even farmers who could do carbon capture and take out the methane and the manure and use it for energy production we re starting to see that in rural areas throughout the country and so we could have climate change become a huge opportunity for us to really uh innovate and be pioneers of ingenuity again so i do think we have to take on climate change it is a healthcare issue it is a housing issue ask our friends who ve lost their homes in fires we ve lived there for 30 years because the hots are getting hotter um it s a national security issue it s an environmental issue and it could be a great boon for creating jobs as well and helping people have that just transition from traditional means of energy to these new uh you know sustainable energy options so i do think we have to have a big mobilization towards combating climate change i just don t think the green new deal is that all realistic if i m being honest advertisement i do think we have to have a big mobilization towards combating climate change i just don t think the green new deal is that all realistic if i m being honest ammar campa najjar q the trumpification of the republican party has been something that everybody s focused on but social scientists say that the left has also undergone a transformation basically since 2010 the left has moved much farther left a agreed q a good quarter of the democratic party now believes in free college free student loans free medicine free everything where are you a well you know why because they look at other countries that s why i don t believe anything s free um it just you can t spend the same dollar twice not everything is free i think i m an east county democrat just like we have west virginia democrats i think that we um you know it s finding the best solution it s making sure people could live work and retire with dignity you re not giving them a handout you re going to give them a hand up look i m a small busines owner so i m fed up with a lot of the unnecessary government red tape even obama worked to cut a lot of red tape when he was in office he consolidated the um the sba the small business administration and he consolidated a lot of things with outdated regulations whether it s the environment or different kinds of sweeteners that were going to be taken off the market all this stuff so i believe in you know condensing the role of government in some things when i m in congress i want to fight to cut middle class taxes taxes for veterans for small businesses that create two thirds of all american jobs you don t talk you don t hear from liberals talk about cutting taxes especially for the middle class or for small businesses i think all business is bad and that s just not true i just don t want to cut taxes for the wealthy or corporations that send our jobs abroad i don t think that s a good thing um i talked about lowering the cost of prescription drugs i talked about holding pharmaceutical companies accountable i talked about protecting medicare and social security um i talk about the border i said i m going to be the most conservative congressman in san diego i support building the wall i support promoting legal immigration and cutting down cracking down on illegal immigration dealing with the people who are here already in a realistic fashion i don t hear a lot of i wish i heard more people talking about it that way but you re not um and dealing with the cost of living and housing and healthcare in a way that makes sense i mean a quick example to talk about bureaucracy not doing people good i think san diego is the fourth biggest homeless population in the country and we re 20th in terms of hud funding because the formula is outdated so if we just fixed that and put ourselves in the fourth place bracket and put whoever s in 20th in 20th that ll be more federal funding that ll be coming down to the county to help us with our housing issue uh so i think you don t hear a lot of progressives talk about how do you make sure things are being done in a revenue neutral way they want us like you said free housing healthcare education all that stuff you can t do it so you know and i don t think you should be paying for education for like to make it free for the kids of rich parents and all that stuff you shouldn t like why should we be on the hook for that um so those are the things that and i m a gun owner like i said i own a gun um and even sheriff gore was like you should get a ccw you probably need one to be honest so um i m just a common sense local guy who will put country over part to deliver results that s just who i am and not selling out to corporations and you know honoring our values our traditions that made this country what it is the reason people the world over come here and defending our freedoms you know i think that a lot of progressives have problems with the fact that i own a gun the fact that i talk about immigration the way i do the fact that i m christian i have to apologize for my faith because they think it s an affront on their way of life and my mentality is live and let live and it seems like both extremes on both parties want to dictate to everyone how to live their lives and that s just not that s not we have to defend our freedoms sometimes from the right sometimes from the left and i think sometimes the left and the right look you know shockingly very similar in their tenor but also in the way that they talk about you know i think that a lot of progressives have problems with the fact that i own a gun ammar campa najjar advertisement q the u s is running a trillion dollar deficit this year and we re on track in about seven or eight years for the interest on the debt to be the third biggest part of the budget after entitlements and the military and it s unsustainable people say so we had two of your possible future colleagues in here scott peters and mike levin and mike levin voted for the trillion dollar deficit and scott peters said he couldn t in good conscience vote for it so where are you on this a i mean uh what s funny is that a lot of people lost their jobs in congress when we tried to i think in 95 deal with the deficit in a real way democrats q it was 94 a uh yeah so we that was the only time we honestly tried to do something about it so democrats do try to do something about this um mainly because my generation is going to be the one on the receiving end of all this stuff we re the ones who are going to get our so called entitlements but they re earned benefits you earn them um we re the ones who are going to get those cut down so we do have to deal with that and you know you know a 1 5 trillion tax break for the 84 of which goes to the top 1 2 that s not how you reduce the deficit um you know expanding our defense spending beyond what the pentagon is asked by a couple percentage points also doesn t make a whole lot of sense when they re asking us telling us this is what they need and we overshoot it so i think there are things like that that we have to bring into kind of rein in but the way i would do college is a couple things one i would really promote trade schools and apprenticeship programs because there s a lot of and we know them there s a lot of kids who go to college they don t even have the slightest idea what they re doing it s a sabbatical for two years they go to college and they re like i don t want to do this anymore and they ve sucked up tuition from those other kids who maybe do want to go to school have an idea of what they want to do and then they ended up saying the kids who don t end up finishing school saying i just want it to work in the trades or something else make a good honest living making 70 000 a year or more we need to promote trade schools more get people funneled into that away from just sucking up resources from college that way we have more resources spread across people who want to go um and then the second thing is look since reagan we ve doubled the amount of tax loopholes for the wealthy it was 800 billion now it s 1 6 trillion uh if we cut down some of those and get more federal funding out of that to lower the cost of education that d be a good step there s something called a stepped up basis i think for anyone who makes a certain amount of money let s say 10 million a year and up we should get rid of the stepped up basis which basically means if you have an asset or something uh if you die your kids basically pay inherit that at a different tax rate than they would have 10 seconds ago because it s now based on the tax plan of before um so we do that i think you would get like i think it was 800 billion over the next 10 years or something like that if you do all those things and also keep in mind that you know when you re i think we talked about this last time when you re 18 years old you have three options right usually you could get a job you go to college or you join the military and you re seeing every industry even the military the number of recruits are going down because of things like darpa and automating a lot of what we used to do you re still going to have specialized positions where you need you know a human being doing it but you re starting to see even that industry become automated and if we see that happening and it is happening then we need to look at the budget for defense and see where is the money that we used to spend on housing clothing and training deploying a person that s no longer being used because now we have automation and move that money either to our job training or college cause that third bracket s becoming a little bit more narrow if we did those things we could find a better way of making college affordable and debt free not tuition free but debt free in the end i think if you did those things and i think i would look at some kind of i don t know how it would work but i ve heard this idea and i liked the idea in theory and i d explore it um this is like a civilian uh gi bill kind of thing where if you do some kind of service even if it s not military service you re able to afford college so those are the kinds of things i d look at and not blow up our deficit because then we have to deal with it right so um it s like helping the idea of spending money that we don t have to increase our debt to pay for college on the front end it basically means it s going to hurt our retirement towards the end of our lives because maybe we ll have less medicare or less social security as a result because it s usually entitlements that are the things that we talk about getting rid of not defense spending or anything else so i think it s shortsighted and i think there s a better way that these members of congress could uh take care of my generation and those are some of the ways that i would do it q what do you think about the trump administration s handling of uh the middle east particularly in syria pros and cons of things that he s done a i think with syria and i ve talked to a lot of people in the community middle eastern folks who live in the community they liked that president trump would draw red lines and do something about it like with the biggest bomb it s not a nuclear bomb that they used a couple of years ago they liked that they did something about it but i think his did you call it his strategy in the middle east advertisement q just handling a yeah because strategy is i think too much of a compliment it s an overstatement but i think he s not listening to people who know the region he s firing them when they don t listen to him i think it s really dangerous i think he said when he first got elected and he was he said you know it s really being president is a lot harder than having a real estate empire yeah it is so i think when it comes to foreign policy especially when it comes to the middle east he s a little bit over his head and i think the way he dealt with the kurds was really really unfair they were fighting alongside us with our troops and our troops know that those who served in that area they know um the contributions that the kurds had in fighting alongside them to take out isis and so i ve even talked to republican veterans who served in that area who said that was not the high point in his presidency when it came to that region so um i don t think he s done a great job when it comes to what we re doing in terms of working with our traditional allies abroad they think that we re a joke but also his handling of the middle east i think um has been i mean this idea of a peace plan between the israelis and palestinians has been a joke it s been postponed and postponed and postponed and it s not been honest and um i don t think that people see him as an honest broker and trust is a really important commodity when it comes to foreign affairs and he doesn t seem to have it uh with a lot of people um so i think his handling of the middle east has been uh i think maybe a little bit more um professional than his interaction with north korea but not a whole lot not a whole lot i m trying to think of one thing that he s done that he s accomplished that s been uh substantial or meaningful towards that region and i can t think of one right now q impeachment yes or no and i wonder about your stepfather who voted for trump has his position changed a yeah i think he just doesn t talk as much anymore cause he s like just looking at his shoes all the time he s still my stepfather that hasn t changed um for me i think and even hunter said like it s going to impeachment was going to happen with or without the 50th vote it was going to happen i think uh when i m there it s not going to matter it s going to happen so it s over i think that if i had to vote it would have been divisive so i m glad i don t have to vote q what would you vote if you had to vote advertisement a um right now i think the impeachment through the house was going to happen regardless of the 50th vote i think me voting for impeachment would make it very hard for me to legislate and keep people together in this district so i probably wouldn t vote on it um doesn t mean i don t believe in still investigating what happened having it be a fair investigation a transparent investigation it s a matter of national security but i don t think that i don t think i would vote on that q you would abstain or you would vote no a i d probably abstain q is that fair to the process to abstain a i mean yeah because i think it would still go through i mean when you said process principals different but on process the process was going to go through anyways pelosi doesn t need my vote on that q is that a cop out though not to take a position advertisement a see here s the thing that s a question do people believe it s the most important vote i think in my district they think it s a waste of time and a waste of money q in 1997 1998 nobody abstained in the house or the senate a i think one thing that could be clear that i m not trying to be like everybody else so maybe that s the past but i don t believe it s prologue for me i just don t think uh if i was there right now my staff was there and we were sitting there i d say we need some extraordinary proof extraordinary evidence for this extraordinary claim um and then the implications it will have on me being able to serve my district q why not vote no if you say we need extraordinary evidence a because right now i would say i want to see more of it right i ll be honest with you there are things that i ve seen cause i watch cnn and i ve seen the way they talked about this impeachment there are things that are clearly not true like his chief of staff i was watching live when his chief of staff said quid pro quos they happen all the time it s conditional aid to foreign countries is conditional we all know that s true like we all know that s true and they said we were talking about things that were retroactive uh like investigating what happened in the dnc things that had no implications in the future but on the past and corruption and all that stuff is how we do things with other countries it s not a quid pro quo for personal political gain um and the funding was already provided i don t think that ukraine s going to do anything on the bidens or whatever so it s not going to materialize i read also that the ukrainians didn t know that they weren t getting the funding so if they didn t know it was a quid pro quo how could it be a quid pro quo so those are the things i d have to be with my staff saying let me follow the chronology and see if like all these things add up i mean the thing about the trump administration is that they don t do things in a very conventional way it s very loose ended so things might look worse than they are sometimes and sometimes they re just that bad um so knowing that s the kind of chaotic environment i d have a very hard time saying let s impeach this president and divide our country even more when we don t know if we have conclusive proof of whether it was intentional or even if it materialized the president tried to work with a foreign country to obstruct justice or try to rig an election so for me i would right now not knowing everything i would abstain if i was there i probably would be more leaning towards saying no if this was all the information someone said well they got the funding and you know they never agreed to investigate the bidens or whatever to me it d be like that s really ridiculous that we have a president that would try to solicit but if it never materialized um then i wouldn t i don t think i would go for impeachment it s just such a big thing that s so divisive and i don t think we ve met that threshold just yet and if you want to get rid of this president go vote there s no shortcut go vote him out of office i haven t seen anything enough for me to say that it is critical that i would vote yes on impeachment if that s clearer than saying abstaining or voting no i m just not in the yes column i don t think out of necessity for the process because it s going to happen regardless um and i think on principle i think that it needs to be such a high threshold and not political theater um that to do it otherwise would be a waste of time and money and that s kind of how i feel right now q yeah any other questions give us your close about why voters should choose you in this district advertisement a i think because i will focus on them and putting them first no matter what and i ll have the tough conversations on both sides i ve had to look my party last year on certain taxes for california and some say that came at a political cost for me uh with certain organizations i did it because i didn t think it was gonna help my district um i don t that supporting this president on everything that he does i don t believe i want to repeal the tax plan i think that he was wrong to hurt california this way i don t support that he wants to threaten to remove funding for fire prevention and fire relief uh for california there s a lot of things that don t support in president trump and also just don t support the very extreme left wing of my party for me i m going to be very focused on the people of my district and no matter what no matter how unpopular it is anywhere else i m not running to be popular i m running to serve my district in a way that it hasn t been served um and i m going to put country over party and i m going to focus on the things that i care about which is making sure that again people can live work and retire with dignity make sure that you could defend the border but also the american dream make sure that you know i m not going to open up the border take everyone s guns away or rack up the deficit like some people on the very far left have intimated i m going to be someone who s measured and do the right thing by my district as the most conservative congressman in san diego but leading with my values um and looking at things in a realistic way there are things that are so divisive in our country that you don t have to just be part of and i m frustrated that everybody tries to push members of congress into the national spotlight whether it s on impeachment whether it s on a whole host of issues i want to be a neighborhood congressman to deal with the issues that we face in our district whether it s housing or healthcare education infrastructure wildfire relief the opioid crisis that s not getting done and a lot of things i just ticked off have bipartisan solutions and sometimes talking about impeachment talking about how trump is whatever talking about nancy pelosi that gets in the way of actually delivering results and that s a more impeachable offense of having decade over decade over decade of people going to congress not serving the american people lying beginning in their bipartisan bickering and doing nothing trump is going to be gone whether it s in two years or six years and the fact that my party is fixated on him is a disservice to this country we need to focus on recapturing the narrative not being the opposition party but being the opportunity party being the majority party that represents that the majority of people and getting things done and getting fixated on these long drawn out fights with president trump i think in the end it s a disservice to our country and i think we need to recapture who we are as a nation and not let this country be at the mercy of one person or one president it s about all of us coming together fighting for our country and moving our country forward in a way that s bipartisan and that s civil and keeps the constituents top of mind not your own political interests we need to focus on recapturing the narrative not being the opposition party but being the opportunity party ammar campa najjar q thank you a thank you appreciate it

published sunday 12 january 2020 print disqus mike gleason coming up we ll hear an eye opening interview with craig hemke of the tf metals report hear from the man who accurately predicted a year ago that 2019 would be the best year for gold and silver since 2010 and we ll hear his new call for 2020 craig also takes serious issue with some of the gold naysayers and perma bears and calls them out for being blinded by their agendas so don t miss my conversation with craig hemke coming up after this week s market update a wild week for markets as the u s and iran come to the brink of war before both sides apparently decided it would be wiser to pull back after iranian missiles hit a u s military base tuesday night gold prices surged above 1 600 an ounce as gold headed toward a 7 year high even the mainstream media had to take note jim cramer and his fellow stock market pumpers on cnbc took time to lament the fear driven buying of gold cnbc anchor all right jim what s caught your attention this morning beyond citi in terms of the key to this market obviously we see broadly speaking a down market jim cramer it s gold gold gold gold when i see this endless buying of gold it makes me think for the first time maybe people are just saying i am really fearful it s not just treasures the gold buying has been endlessly over and over and over there are only a few growth gold companies the main one is agnico eagle people want to buy that s the one to buy but it s relentless and it feels like gold wants to go to 1 700 1 800 that would be very negative for the market cnbc anchor uh yeah fear buying of gold and other safe havens ended up being short lived after u s officials reported there had been no casualties and iran stood down fears of world war iii suddenly turned into hopes for a quick end to hostilities wall street celebrated as metals markets sharply reversed mid week as of this friday recording gold is now relatively flat overall for the week to trade at 1 560 per ounce the silver market shows a slight weekly gain of 0 2 to bring spot prices to 18 16 an ounce platinum is off 0 4 last friday s close to come in at 982 and finally palladium pushed through the 2 000 level for the first time ever it currently trades at 2 129 on the heels of a 6 5 advance this week well while we can all take comfort in the tamping down of tensions between the u s and iran it would be na ve to believe that the threat of further conflict in the region is over it appears that iran was in fact responsible for shooting down a ukrainian passenger jet if it instead had been an american airlines jet loaded with u s citizens we d likely be seeing much more of a reaction from president donald trump and perhaps our military forces as well iran or iranian backed terrorists could be planning other forms of retaliation as i speak the assassination of iran s top general has stoked extreme new levels of anti american resentment it won t abate anytime soon especially as the trump administration is vowing to impose tougher economic sanctions to punish iran america is also struggling to keep iraq from forging closer relations with iran iraqis increasingly want u s forces out of their country democracy in the middle east never quite works out the way the foreign policy central planners in washington envision after so many years since 9 11 after so many trillions of dollars invested and ultimately wasted in iraq and afghanistan president trump at this point is looking for an honorable way to cut our losses but his neo conservative advisors still cling to grand notions of re making the region in our own image and the pull of the israeli lobby and military industrial complex is perhaps the most powerful force in washington d c as all presidents come to learn of course precious metals markets will need more than occasional geopolitical flare ups to drive a long term bull market advance the fundamentals are turning in favor of higher gold and silver prices from fiscally reckless trillion dollar deficits in washington to a federal reserve obsessed with generating higher rates of inflation to mining supplies of gold and silver looking tight the ingredients for a big bull market are in place however safe haven demand from investors has yet to pick up in a big way we saw some of it this week but it will likely be fleeting until the general public sees good reason to pull assets out of the stock market as stocks hit record highs last year gold and silver coin sales at the u s mint plunged to multi decade lows the u s mint sold just 152 000 ounces worth of gold american eagles in 2019 that marks the lowest total on record going back to 1986 meanwhile sales of silver american eagle coins came in at their lowest level since 2007 now granted a robust secondary market as a result of hordes of retail investor selling supplied the market with a cheaper alternative to the newly minted coins and that explains part of those low numbers for 2019 u s minted product australia s perth mint however saw an increase in coin demand from its more internationally based buyers many sought physical bullion as a refuge from negative interest rates in their home countries as u s investors realize that they too face the prospect of negative real interest rates on savings and bubble valuations in equity markets they too will increasingly find a compelling value proposition in gold and silver well now for some predictions on what 2020 will look like for the metals and the other markets let s get right to this week s exclusive interview mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome in craig hemke of the tf metals report craig is a well known name in the metals industry and runs one of the most highly respected websites in our space and provides some of the best analysis you will find anywhere on banking schemes global macroeconomics and evidence of manipulation in the gold and silver markets happy new year to you craig thanks for coming on and welcome how are you craig hemke mike it s always a pleasure new year s started off with a bang man i hope it s not indicative of how crazy this entire year is going to be we ll see mike gleason yeah certainly this week sparking action itself lots going on both geopolitically and in the markets and we ll get to a lot of that well craig here we are entering another new year the conflict with iran and the potential for an escalation there spurred some safe haven buying in recent days but the rally in metals started last month i d like to open by getting your thoughts on what you believe will be driving metals prices this year yes we expect the forces of evil to continue doing their best to manage prices and we ll get to that topic of price manipulation in a moment but talk about what you re seeing in the metals here recently and discuss some of the themes you anticipate people will be talking about this year when it comes to the metals craig hemke well i think it s critical that people try to have a longer memory than 48 hours as we record this today i m seeing all kinds of garbage i saw garbage from some group that is always a perma bear always talking about how gold has topped out and going down has a clear agenda just like some of the short sellers that are always anonymously pound the mining stocks with fake research reports and stuff like that and i m seeing these things today about how oh yeah gold look at that look how terrible that candle looks on the daily chart and how come hold s not going up when all this war stuff and it s like do you not understand i mean gold went up prior to the war starting beginning last thursday gold closed on the comex last thursday january the 1st at about 15 30 so the whole move from 1 530 to 1 580 was war premium if you will really short term war premium then the spike to 1 610 was when we seemed to be on the verge of what could even have been a nuclear war in the middle east the fact that it s pulled back to 1 550 shouldn t surprise anybody i mean we hadn t even worked out all the war premium yet despite what is some pretty cheery economic news this week service sector pmis the adp jobs report that kind of thing so jeez louise i sure hope people keep their perspective you are correct in pointing out mike that the metals rallied strongly into the year and it had nothing to do with war that wasn t on anybody s mind prior to about six o clock in the evening on january the 2nd gold rallied 3 from december the 20th through that date silver rallied 8 5 from december 9th at 16 60 up to 18 40 on january the 2nd the hui the gold bugs index which everybody s freaking out because the shares went down yesterday the hui is up 15 still since the middle of october for a while it was up 20 and why is this happening because the fed whether they want to call it qe or not began this direct monetization of the debt program in october everything s going up stock market you name it and that is going to continue this year it s only going to get worse a lot of people missed last friday the 3rd the minutes for the december fed meeting were released first of all everybody was on vacation still on friday january the 3rd and second of all those are always released on a wednesday three weeks after the fed meeting so no one s looking for them on a friday afternoon at two o clock but here they came and buried within the minutes anybody can pull these up is admission that what s very likely to happen in the months ahead is the fed will start monetizing not just t bills but notes longer term duration notes two years three years five years seven years ten years there s no other option they cannot afford the stock market to go down they cannot afford the money supply to contract and thus they will constantly be printing all through this year more and more dollars and everything is going to go up for the reasons that were driving them last year please don t get caught up in what happened and how the chart looks based on these extraordinarily rare events that we saw back on tuesday mike gleason there s been a bit of a pattern in recent years where the metals start perking up in december and perform well in the first half of the year any thoughts about what s behind that and are you looking for that pattern to repeat this year craig craig hemke yeah we were talking about it on my site all the way through december it was logical to expect first in november you expected the metals to trade lower because the december contract is always the most heavily traded all year long and the december contracts both gold and silver had massive open interest and they were both going off the board at the end of november which meant all the speculators that were long were going to have to sell and if they don t completely roll over their positions into february then that effect is a selling pressure the price went down i told people all through november i thought 1 440 that d about do it we re already so extremely oversold i couldn t see a waterfall down i think we saw 1 445 i thought we d rally into the end of the year because as you said mike that s typically been the pattern especially since the bear market lows were put in back in 2015 the shares performed well especially in the back half of december because they re subject to so much tax loss selling particularly in canada and that usually concludes around 18th 20th people want to get that done before they go on christmas holiday and so once again we got that behind us and up with the metals let me just point this out to you mike because this is a lot like last year you remember last year the stock market crashed remember that in december of 2018 mike gleason sure worst december in decades craig hemke yeah it was crashing and basically the stock market was catching down to the contraction of the money supply that the fed was doing by trying to normalize whatever that means their balance sheet and the stock market finally caught on to that disappearance of liquidity and so what happened on christmas eve treasury secretary steven mnuchin and anybody can look it up i m not making this stuff up mnuchin called a meeting of what s called the plunge protection team the president s working group on financial markets they came up with a strategy to float it back higher the day after christmas after the holiday the dow went up a thousand points and never looked back now this was when gold first started to move higher was in december last year because interest rates had peaked in november and this is what all caused me to issue a forecasting saying 19 was going to be the best year for the metal since 2010 well why because the fed was going to be reversing course and they were going to be printing cash because they don t have any choice but to liquefy and continue to liquefy all these markets they can t have deflation they can t have crashing stock markets they can t have higher interest rates none of that stuff so in december of 2018 gold starts to rally and everywhere everybody s like well this is just a safe haven deal gold s going to 1 100 in 2019 and all this crap harry dent stuff anyway that s not what happened it wasn t what was going to happen it s not what did happen and so now here we are gold rallying again anticipating what s going to be happening this year and it s the same thing well the only reason gold went up is because of the safe haven stuff as if gold rallying in december and the shares railings since october had something to do with the idea that the u s was going to whack this soleimani character on january the 2nd it didn t have anything you do with that gold is simply looking ahead looking over the horizon as it always does sees all this liquidity coming from the central banks around the world because it can t afford to do anything else and it s moving higher and people need to understand that and they need to plan for that as they make their investment allocations for 2020 mike gleason now let s talk about price manipulation nobody does a better job than you when it comes to covering what the crooked bankers are up to in the paper markets for gold and silver they sold a boatload of futures contracts last year in both metals you observed that open interest in gold was up a whopping 70 said another way the supply of paper gold rose by 70 yet the amount of gold in the vaults backing that paper barely budged it s quite the racket so while gold itself is actually scarce and hard to produce futures contracts are exactly the opposite the supply is essentially unlimited last year 33 million new ounces of paper gold were dumped into the market despite that gold prices still managed to rise by 18 or so so what do you make of that craig hemke yeah i mean how the world and i guess i don t know too many people get their beaks dipped in this or just simply don t care but how the world allows how the mining companies allow their product to be priced not off of the exchange of the actual commodity but off the exchange of these derivative contracts that have nothing to do with anything it s like i look at you and i say mike here we ll call this contract between you and i gold and i promise at some point that i got the gold behind it and if you want it i ll deliver it to you and then you promise that you re actually interested in it and you go borrow a bunch of money from your broker dealer to buy it on margin and then we just pretend that that contract is actually there s going to be some physical exchange between us at some point but that never happens and at the end of the day you just say well i liked my exposure and i sell my contract you sell your contract and i taking the other side of it buy it back and there was never any gold exchange at all there was just some weird promise that there was a backing to it and it s a trading of those things that is allowed to determine prices it s just ridiculous yeah let s backtrack to that open interest thing that you said because here s a great way to look at it everybody knows or at least should know that 2018 was the largest year of global central bank gold purchases since 1969 the year after the london gold pool 651 metric tons projections are run rates i haven t seen the actual final numbers yet but the projections are the 2019 was even greater probably about 670 metric tons so there is what 25 of global mine output actually demanded i guess as far as we can tell physically delivered to the central bank 670 metric tons of physical demand offset by as you said the creation of over 1 000 metric tons of digital pretend paper gold contracts it s like a two headed monster i mean you ve got the actual physical product which as you said is scarce being priced by the trading of derivatives which can be created infinitely because no one ever calls any of these people to the carpet so it s ridiculous it s outlandish yes gold managed to rise 18 last year even while the supply of derivative contracts increased by 73 imagine if there was some forced linkage between the ability to create contracts and the amount of actual gold on deposit in the vaults and you couldn t have increased it by 73 what if the supply only increased by 10 well then all that money around the planet looking for gold exposure would have had to find it through acquisition of existing contracts this is how the stock market that allegedly works but that s not how it works in the pricing of precious metals the banks just create more contracts taking the opposite side taking the short side and figuring they can out last the speculators eventually maybe forced them out and cover their shorts it s disgusting and again at the end of the day what s really astonishing are these dopey rock breaking geologist ceos of the mining companies that think it s a valid pricing structure and they fall for it that s what s really mind blowing mike gleason i want to ask you about the possibility of whether or not the bullion banks will lose control of prices anytime soon that 70 jump in open interest is extraordinary the department of justice is prosecuting several people and they have secured some guilty pleas it s interesting that they are using rico laws perhaps they actually see the bank activity for what it truly is organized crime officials in london are asking some pointed questions about the fraudulent use of efps exchange for physical an optimist would say that some of these developments will lead to reforms but i think we ve all learned that you should never overestimate bureaucrats ability or willingness to do the right thing we may have to wait for the market to solve the problem which will happen right after confidence in the futures markets the banks and or the dollar collapses what are your thoughts about how much longer this crooked price discovery system will persist craig craig hemke well mike you ve said a mouthful there let me pick off a couple of things you mentioned the regulatory agencies you got the rico investigations here in the u s it s pervasive the fraud is pervasive the former head of jp morgan s precious metals desk who is also on the board of the london bullion marketing association the lbma why would he be on both why would he be a jpm trader and on the board at the lbma but anyway he s now been indicted the rico statutes allow you to not just go after the goon but allow you to go after the don so we ll see how far it reaches however it does reach across the pond my friend andy mcguire has been telling me this now for over a year that the fca which is the english british equivalent of the sec i guess or department of justice whatever has been looking into the risks that are being taken by the english banks and what that might pose the system andy has told me about a meeting he had with a couple of members of parliament and this guy andrew bailey who at the time was the head of the fca this was back in maybe august and this bailey had no idea because the lbma s so opaque i mean you don t get these stats every day all the unallocated gold and all this stuff and the risk that the bullion banks are taking there so andy laid it out for him and he said this guy s jaw dropped and he s like look we can t afford a second financial crisis off of this i mean the people we already shafted them once they ll never let us get away with it again we have to put a stop to this somehow and andy told him about the efps and we ll get to how that continues in a second so anyway this guy bailey who according to andy said we got to somehow put a stop to this this guy bailey was just nominated and confirmed to be the head of the bank of england by boris johnson so what s he going to do does the buck stop when he leaves there leaves the fca and now he s got to be a servant to the bank of england and stop paying attention or maybe he s going to call the banks on the carpet i know what direction i think any cynical or non cynical person would think that that s going to go but i digress these efps that i ve been writing about for a couple of years this is an arcane process that s a part of every futures market but i just can t even describe the degrees to which it is abused i guess that s the right word within golden silver i ve kept track of i don t even know what it is over the last two years something like 14 000 metric tons of gold contracts each comex gold contract is a hundred ounces allegedly of gold well enough contracts that are the equivalent of 14 000 metric tons had been moved off the comex and exchanged for physical efp through london andy says they have this process where they swing them into these 13 day little contracts that are off the books and just keep rolling them over and over and over trying to kind of hide it and pretend that it s not there but this process continues mike let me lay this on you it s just that we ve had as we speak five trading days in the year 2020 in those five trading days there have already been 67 713 comex contracts shifted off of the exchange and exchanged for physical as they say again in london 67 000 mike again every contract is a hundred ounces that s 6 7 million ounces that s 210 metric tons of gold the whole comex vaults only holds 8 million ounces and they shifted 210 metric tons 6 7 billion ounces off exchange in just five days this is the scam of the greatest order and like i said again the amazing thing is that it still exists that people in 2020 when the world is all interconnected and everybody knows everything and i can watch missiles take off in iran five minutes after they re shot just by following twitter it s amazing that this continues it s just mind boggling that this is allowed to continue mike gleason yeah well put you beat your head against the wall trying to figure out when it s going to finally end and why there s not more talk about it well craig before we wrap up i d like to get any final thoughts i know you ve got a lot to say here early in the year if you could give metals investors an idea of what it is that you re going to be watching most closely what they should be watching most closely over these first few months of the year and then maybe a sign that perhaps the powers that be are losing control or any other comments you want to make here as we wrap up craig hemke yeah i don t know mike since i ve been doing this and i have to admit kind of fallen forward a little bit and getting excited about it myself back in 2009 and 10 that kind of thing this hyperbole of the comex is going to fail come on that ll all happen in a blink of an eye someday or overnight but to sit there and these people that say it s going to fail above 22 silver i mean come on we ll see the banks are going to keep it going as long as they possibly can and i don t think anybody can come up with a time table for it the only thing it that will end is a run on the banks for physical metal and this kind of thing gains momentum and it snowballs and finally that realization of what a scam at all is sinks in and people panic to get their hands on actual mental while they can again i can t stress this enough ignore the perma bears with an agenda they re trying to talk down the market they re trying to talk down the shares or trying to talk down the individual shares because they have some massive short position the fed is going to continue with the repo crisis it s not going away the u s is going to have at least a 1 2 trillion deficit every year this decade that s what the congressional budget office says that money s got to come from somewhere the central banks cannot afford a deflationary collapse they will be printing and printing and printing even absent that argument about what that does to the dollar and all this other stuff that cash goes someplace and it goes everywhere again it s not a mistake that the hui was up 20 since october 15th is now up 15 what happened on october 15th that s when this whole new not qe debt monetization program kicked in everything s going up okay so everything s going to continue to go up the banks are going to throw up roadblocks we ve already got 800 000 contracts of open interest comex gold so i don t know how far gold will go 1 650 maybe if it kind of gets rolling it can go to 1 750 this year that d be a pretty good year from where we are where i think the real interest should be for people that want to either have some fun make some trading fiat currency that then they can buy more physical metal that kind of thing i mean start looking into whether or not you have exposure to the mining shares not just the big companies but the medium juniors and the explorers that kind of stuff because as global asset managers who have all this cash and they re always looking for a place to go once the gdx the ddxj the hui begin to make new highs versus 2016 the floodgates are going to open and money s going to come pouring into the sector and it all has to pass through a little tiny funnel because there s only so many places it can go it s just simple economics you get twice the cash chasing the same handful of stocks and they re going to go up in price so i think it s going to be a very good year again for the metal just like last year was and i was right when i predicted it last year but i think the real outsize gains will probably be in the shares more than in the physical metal i wrote that up i kind of make an annual forecast every january i posted it to my site it s a free link maybe i ll send it to you mike you can put it on this page i always try to come up with a catchy name so this year s title is 2020 foresight instead of 2020 hindsight kind of clever huh anyway 2020 foresight is what it s called you can go to my site or like i said click the link if you can put it on this page and it will just explain to you the basis for why i think it s going to be a good year if you ve got time i think it s worth a read mike gleason yeah it would be time well spent for sure i always say we spend a lot of time looking at your site here in this office it s money well spent for anybody that wants to get on board there with tf metals report and before we let you go here craig tell people a little bit more about your site how they can get signed up and maybe some other tidbits they should know craig hemke well really the best thing about my site i mean i do analysis every day and we try to keep people locked into the big picture not the tick by tick stuff but the site is i mean the people that populate it are from all around the world all different political views but we realize we re all in the same boat and so instead of bickering at each other and name calling and all that kind of stuff rule number seven in the community guidelines is treat others the way you want to be treated come on your mother taught you that why do you think just because it s an anonymous website you can be rude and mean like twitter things like that so anyway the community itself is what s worth it it s only 12 bucks a month so it s not like i m getting rich off of it 40 cents a day to give you access really keep you on top and grounded of where we re headed and again i just can t emphasize enough i mean mike the old line is a rising tide lifts all boats right think of the rising tide being all of the cash it has to be created from nothing you must understand this is direct monetization of the debt by the fed primary dealers they get the treasury bills soon to be treasury notes from the treasury the primary dealers are the ones responsible for making that market and getting them filled they buy them themselves and anybody can zerohedge has been great about writing this the fed then buys these directly from the primary dealers about 72 hours later okay so there s an intermediary in between but basically the fed is buying the treasury bills soon to be notes directly from the treasury how that isn t direct monetization of that i don t know just because there s a step in between so this is happening modern monetary theory all that stuff that the politicians daydream about that s coming and whether you are going to want to talk about gold standard and system reset and all that kind of stuff whatever yeah sure but all of that cash is going to be sloshing around stock market s going to go up everything so gold and silver are going to go up and the shares are going to be particularly advantageous to own in the next few months and so again i just want to keep everybody grounded and not be thinking about the events of tuesday and i mean that was a real you want to talk about one off that was a one off that was hopefully something that you ll never see again in your lifetime this on the brink of maybe nuclear war in the middle east ignore the reaction to it the run up to it and look at the bigger picture and i think you ll see that physical gold and silver and maybe some mining shares must be a part of a portfolio in 2020 going forward mike gleason yeah well put it s going to be a great time to kind of focus more in on this if you re not already doing that and it s going to be an interesting maybe tumultuous year ignore the blips or don t pay as much attention to them we do have a trend in place here and craig and tf metals report is a great way to follow that hopefully right here on this podcast as well well very good thanks again craig have a great weekend i wish you a happy and prosperous new year and we look forward to catching up with you again soon keep up the good work my friend craig hemke all the best mike go chiefs mike gleason yeah good luck to your

the year 2020 looks promising for the philippine stock market given the numerous opportunities facing the country these include the following timely passage of the budget the government s p4 1 trillion budget for 2020 was passed on time moreover president duterte extended the shelf life of the unused portion of the p3 7 trillion 2019 budget until the end of this year these developments should help boost gdp gross domestic product growth back above 6 percent recall that gdp growth in the first half of 2019 slowed to 5 5 percent this was largely due to the delayed passage of the 2019 budget that resulted to the weaker growth of government spending low interest rates interest rates are expected to stay low in 2020 as inflation is expected to stay benign although inflation should increase from only 2 5 percent in 2019 given the absence of the high base effect it is expected to stay within the ideal 2 4 percent range as the country continues to benefit from the effect of the rice tariffication law and weak global economic growth given the benign inflation outlook bsp bangko sentral ng pilipinas governor benjamin diokno already said the central bank might reduce benchmark rates by another 50 basis points this year after cutting it by 75 basis points last year advertisement low interest rates are good for the stock market as this makes riskier assets more attractive it also reduces corporate borrowing rates which should help encourage more investments improving global economic outlook although global growth is expected to stay weak the threat of a global recession in 2020 has diminished significantly numerous factors are responsible for the improving outlook of the global economy for example in 2019 central banks around the world adopted looser monetary policies by cutting interest rates reducing reserve requirements and buying back bonds these include the us fed the european central bank and the people s bank of china several countries also implemented fiscal stimulus by cutting taxes and increasing spending as governments recognize that lower interest rates are not enough to fight a recession there is also less uncertainty on brexit after the snap general election in the united kingdom last december allowed the conservative party to win a majority of the parliamentary seats paving the way for the united kingdom to leave the european union by the end of january under the terms of the deal renegotiated last autumn finally and most importantly the united states and china are scheduled to sign the phase one trade deal this week lifting the uncertainty on how high tariffs could increase this in turn is expected to encourage more businesses to pursue investments attractive valuations philippine stocks are trading at very cheap valuations at 7 800 the psei is trading at only 15 0x 2020 p e during the past five years the index traded at a higher valuation more than 84 percent of the time in fact 23 out of the 30 stocks that are part of the index are currently trading below their historical average p e multiples despite the numerous opportunities facing the philippine stock market there are some challenges that are preventing the market from performing better these include the following heightened geopolitical risk on jan 3 the united states killed one of iran s highly respected commanders qassem soleimani on jan 8 iran retaliated by firing missiles at two us bases in iraq oil prices increased as a result and will most likely stay elevated if tensions between the united states and iran continue to escalate higher oil prices will push up inflation hurting economic growth in the philippines heightened tensions between the two countries is also expected to hurt sentiment for all risk assets including philippine stocks and increase demand for safe haven assets such as gold and us dollar bonds heightened regulatory risk late last year the philippine government decided to revoke the extension of manila water and maynilad s water concession from 2022 to 2037 advertisement the president also threatened to sue the water firms for economic sabotage and to nationalize the water concessions if the water firms do not accept a new contract that the government will prepare as a result even though the philippines economic growth prospect is very attractive and valuations of stocks are cheap concerns that the government can change regulations and provisions of contracts anytime is causing investors to stay away given the attractive fundamentals of the philippine economy and the improving outlook of the global economy all eyes will be focused on developments in the middle east and on the local water concessions a successful de escalation of tensions between the united states and iran and the signing of a new contract that is mutually beneficial for the philippine government and the two water concessionaires are the catalysts needed for risk appetite to return to the philippine stock market allowing it to resume its uptrend inq
what a start to 2020 it s been a rather eventful first week of the year for financial markets and while next week may not be quite so action packed when it comes to the current climate who knows what s around the corner as far as the coming week goes politics will continue to dominate but there are some interesting central bank meetings as well as a few interesting economic releases that will certainly draw attention the signing of the us china phase one trade deal will naturally be all over the front pages next week let s face it it s about time but it s this week s events in iraq and iran that people may be more interested in at this stage both sides may have shown a willingness to de escalate but when it comes to these two countries who knows country uk it s been rather quiet by uk standards boris johnson s strong majority in parliament has enabled a more peaceful and straightforward process when it comes to getting his brexit withdrawal agreement through parliament now it s over to the lords but unlike on previous occasions this is unlikely to pose any problems focus now shifts to phase two trade negotiations ursula von der leyen president of the european commission was in london this week and while much of the talk was very cordial it s clear she believes the end of year deadline is tight and a lot has to be achieved in that time we may not see the same kind of volatility in the pound in the near term though of course should we get closer to the end of the year if no deal looks possible the panic will once again set in us the focus next week will shift back to the us china trade war beijing has given the all clear that for vice premier liu he to sign the phase one deal in washington dc on january 15th markets are anxiously awaiting the release of the details of the phase one trade deal which could start to leak a couple days before signing ceremony the week ahead will see a plethora of data that should highlight the us economy remains resilient inflation data should confirm the fed s decision to be on hold and the first couple regional surveys in january should so pointedly strong rebounds much of the focus will fall on retail sales which should paint a picture of very strong holiday season despite poor reports from macy s kohl s and jc penney earnings season also begins with the big banks reporting first all signs point for the financials to indicate the us consumer remains strong key quarterly updates will be followed by fastenal alcoa taiwan semiconductor and trucking giant jb hunt with trade tensions simmering wall street will look to see if corporate america will have improved guidance for 2020 us politics democrats are slowly abandoning trump s impeachment saga as they turn their focus back towards the presidential election the iowa caucuses are on february 3rd and we will see if joe biden can hold off the other candidates iowa will be key for mayor pete buttigieg and if we see the two progressives candidates show they can continue their movement despite almost bringing the us into a war with iran president trump still has a strong economy and had the general consensus believing he will get re elected in november mexico as trade tensions ease and the us iran conflict simmers down emerging markets could see the mexican peso become the favored carry trade mexico s banxico has their key rate at 7 25 extremely high when compared to the g10 currencies inflation decelerated and still remains near the midpoint of the central bank s target range and with that in mind we could still see mexico have one of the best interest rates out there with usmca slowly getting finalized we could continue to see the peso have a supportive macro economic environment taiwan taiwan elections this weekend

be detrimental to local equities and the aud positive for bonds market oil oil prices have more that reversed the spike in prices that came in the aftermath of the soleimani assassination brent is trading back around 65 and is looking pretty stable at this point barring any further escalation in the middle east we could see oil prices stabilize around these levels in the near term with global growth prospects having improved the us and china preparing to sign a trade deal and opec committed to re balancing gold safe haven gold has found some stability towards the back end of the week around 1 550 not far from the levels we were trading at around at the start of the year gold will remain susceptible to safe haven dashes although the tragic airliner accident may force people to reconsider their actions and encourage a sustained de escalation the dollar has rebounded over the course of this week which may keep the downward pressure on the yellow metal although it s worth remembering that prior to the events of the last week the dollar was coming under a little pressure and supporting gold it will be interesting to see whether that continues going forward bitcoin like a slow puncture the bitcoin rally is slowly deflating but there s clearly some resilience there the cryptocurrency faces a test around 7 500 which provided strong resistance throughout the latter part of december a hold around here could put further pressure on 8 500 where bitcoin ran out of steam earlier this week

earlier this week the world s flagship crypto asset saw its value surge from around the 8 000 mark to just over 8 430 within an hour s time this latest price action came after the iranian government decided to launch a missile attack on an iraqi military base housing american troops however it bears mentioning that iran s actions were prompted by united states president donald trump s decision to eliminate iranian general qassem soleimani a controversial figure in the west but loved by the masses in his home country the overall value of bitcoin btc is now up by around 15 this year but since president trump recently downplayed the situation in iran at a white house press conference saying that the middle eastern power is ready to stand down the currency s price slid back down to under the 8 000 mark with that being said a whole host of prominent figures including galaxy digital s mike novogratz and digital asset capital management s joshua green seem to agree with the notion that the aforementioned rally was definitely linked with the events that recently unfolded in iraq also worth exploring is the fact that bitcoin s price increase has followed an increase in the value of other safe haven assets such as gold and oil to put things into perspective the yellow precious metal is trading close to its highest levels since march 2013 meanwhile the price of brent crude is up by 2 5 to around 70 per barrel which could possibly be in relation to concerns over the global oil distribution being disruption because of the u s and iran s escalating military tensions providing his thoughts on the matter mati greenspan the founder of quantumeconomics io was quoted as saying the resemblance between digital gold and the physical stuff is uncanny they ve basically been moving in a very similar pattern throughout most of last year do iranians really believe in the power of bitcoin with all of the news stories recently floating on the internet that claim people in iran are scurrying to get their hands on bitcoin especially in the wake of the recent geopolitical tensions that have been rising in the region cointelegraph reached out to hadi nemati an iranian digital currency specialist and chief operating officer of bitfolio capital an open end crypto hedge fund he pointed out the following after the summer of 2019 many iranians came to know about bitcoin because of all the mining news and the use of electricity associated with the same which was vastly covered by various state media outlets and newspapers bitcoin on a mass scale is being seen as a speculative alternative asset and digital money when asked about which section of people among the local masses are actively making use of bitcoin the most nemati pointed out that a threefold categorization can be made miners this in nemati s opinion is the most dominant group of the three both on an industrial and retail scale however miners are forced to liquidate their btc holdings regularly in order to meet their operational costs this in nemati s opinion is the most dominant group of the three both on an industrial and retail scale however miners are forced to liquidate their btc holdings regularly in order to meet their operational costs investors these individuals as per nemati are mostly buying bitcoin for long term investment purposes and are using the asset to hedge their capital against the inflation of the iranian rial additionally in his opinion even though bitcoin is not as popular as many other foreign currencies or precious metals such as gold or silver adoption has been increasing steadily in recent years these individuals as per nemati are mostly buying bitcoin for long term investment purposes and are using the asset to hedge their capital against the inflation of the iranian rial additionally in his opinion even though bitcoin is not as popular as many other foreign currencies or precious metals such as gold or silver adoption has been increasing steadily in recent years active traders this group operates mostly in the local crypto market at the corporate and retail levels because according to nemati bitcoin rarely gets used for day to day transactions due to a lack of infrastructure not only that even the central bank of iran has yet to issue clear regulatory guidelines regarding the use of digital currencies in regard to why the popularity of btc has surged so dramatically in iran over the past 24 months cointelegraph reached out to mahyar a tehran based crypto miner and investor he pointed out that since many iranians do not possess international accounts they are able to use bitcoin as a means of receiving cross border payments in a seamless hassle free manner on the subject mahyar added people send bits to a currency exchange and receive cash most bits also come from farms and the dollar revenue is very important to people i think big companies are doing their best to avoid taxation as well another reason he believes bitcoin s popularity has increased so much in recent years is because of the anonymity benefits that most cryptocurrencies bring to the table not only that owing to the fact that btc can be used by anyone irrespective of their financial background more and more people are willing to make use of this novel asset class on the subject of whether there currently exist any easy conversion avenues for people to liquidate their btc holdings mahyar told cointelegraph that there are a lot of folks who are willing to facilitate peer to peer exchanges because they believe btc is destined for big things in the near future additionally he also highlighted that more traditional routes such as localbitcoins are quite popular among the masses iran s relationship with crypto seems to be constantly evolving since being faced with severe economic sanctions by the u s government back in 1979 the value of the iranian rial has been on a steady decline with the downturn becoming especially blatant during the 2000s as a result of this many iranians have tried to look for novel ways in which to transfer their wealth to different stores of value including other fiat currencies precious metals etc related five countries where crypto regulation changed the most in 2019 additionally many wealthy iranians have taken refuge in banks based across dubai and other friendly middle eastern countries however with inflation constantly on the rise the rial has been facing a lot of devaluation especially after president trump reinstated certain economic sanctions against the islamic nation last year to further elaborate on this topic cointelegraph spoke with jeremy joo the ceo of unicoindcx and member of the malaysian blockchain conglomerate g1 joo frequently deals with crypto firms and startups based in and around iran and in his personal view many locals who up until now did not have the means nor the volume to move their money out of the country have started to turn toward bitcoin at a rapid pace especially the younger generation he added the younger population started small mining operations electricity costs are next to nothing in iran and in 2017 the customs were not familiar with mining machines thus many came into the country especially s9s and other equivalents as of late 2018 the government is finally aware of these mining machines which has resulted in their prices going up however this has not deterred the masses joo also aligned with mahyar s stance that a number of iranian miners and crypto holders are currently making use of localbitcoins as well as a host of local over the counter groups that have strong overseas connections to facilitate their crypto transactions in an off exchange fashion joo also pointed out that while there exist small pockets of crypto traders in the country iranians are not known for their financial market knowledge but rather their engineering skills which is highlighted by the fact that most of these traders are also involved in some sort of ether or bitcoin based mining activity joo added iranians use crypto as a store of value very much like in venezuela where their currency has been rapidly devalued also no merchants accept bitcoin openly as payments in iran and e wallets are nonexistent bound for cryptocurrencies political views aside the sad reality of iran is that since the revolution of 1979 the country has been faced with a myriad of economic sanctions as well as other destabilizing issues such as constant currency devaluation and high inflation people living in countries like iran who face constant economic and social turmoil are bound to turn toward cryptocurrencies at some point or another in order to safeguard their assets especially since digital currencies cannot be controlled or manipulated by governments or any other centralized financial banking institution in this regard younger folks especially those with international exposure seem to be hopping onto the crypto bandwagon at an extremely fast rate simply because crypto seems to be a better option when compared to the nation s sovereign currency
us stocks finished a volatile week close to record highs fluctuating with the risk of war in the middle east and economic data a mixed jobs report the chances of further escalation in us iran tensions and the laws of financial gravity are likely to keep a lid on gains this week despite the prospect of a phase one trade deal with china us president donald trump s decision to assassinate iranian military commander qassem suleimani prompted vows of revenge from iran s leadership and an initial stock market selloff after iran s measured response striking american bases in iraq without any apparent attempt to inflict casualties the stock market quickly rebounded last thursday the dow jones industrial average came within inches of the 29 000 level roughly 30 per cent higher than it stood a year ago but the dow fell by more than 100 points a day later after the us labor department reported that the us added a relatively modest 145 000 jobs in december and that wages grew at the slowest rate in more than a year the shaky jobs report could be a one off but economists have warned that it could be too late to reverse the global slowdown triggered by the trade war even with supportive us federal reserve policies and a truce in the trade war for now markets are discounting the risk of further warfare between the us and iran oil futures which could be weaponised by the iranian government briefly traded above us 70 a barrel in the wake of the us strike but fell back below us 60 after mr trump gave a speech saying iran appeared to be standing down further attacks the price of gold which is particularly sensitive to conflict hit the highest level since 2013 after the suleimani strike trading above us 1 600 an ounce but has since retreated to around us 1 550 shares of boeing which had weakened in the immediate aftermath of a plane crash in iran on fears that there was yet another fatal technical issue with boeing s planes recouped losses after reports that the plane could have been accidentally shot down by an iranian missile the iran attack was a jarring start to the new year but there is a possibility that it could set the tone every new year strategists send clients greeting cards in the form of annual outlooks this year many of the notes sounded ominous the surest path to a bust is after all a boom and 2019 was a boom year by any standard on the us stock market not only did us indexes post some of the highest returns in living memory the companies that comprise the standard poor s 500 paid a record us 485 billion in dividends last year according to data analysis firm s p global the decade long bull market recalls another era of seemingly limitless stock prosperity warned michael arone chief investment strategist for the us spdr unit of state street global advisors in his annual outlook for most of us the term roaring twenties conjures up the world that f scott fitzgerald wrote about in the great gatsby said mr arone in a piece entitled the big what if of course the giant lawn party came to a screeching halt with the stock market crash of 1929 he said the 1920s saw comparable rates of economic growth and innovation with the 2010s but also saw comparably inflated stock market valuations said mr arone just like today s market the 1920s bull market had three key drivers low inflation tax cuts and an accommodative federal reserve he said even if there is not an outright bust in 2020 strategists say there will almost certainly be an interruption of the recent surge in stocks few expect stocks to continue delivering superior returns during the next decade said jim paulsen chief investment strategist at money manager the leuthold group in a note to clients the economic expansion and bull market are simply too long in the tooth and valuations too extended for another decade of solid results one factor counting against stocks mr paulsen said is the statistical law of mean reversion which says that short term spikes are often followed by corrections that bring medium term index gains back in line with long term trends the main source of optimism last year a ceasefire in the trade war could soon be old news with a signing as soon as this week the yuan hit its highest level since the summer against the dollar last week amid high expectations that the us and china will formalise their trade pact there were reports that chinese vice premier liu he who has spearheaded the chinese end of the talks is preparing for a trip to washington for a signing ceremony in an uncanny echo of his some time enemy former president bill clinton mr trump is directing attacks on the middle east while facing the congressional attack of impeachment the odds that mr trump will be impeached are shrinking as his economic and foreign policy gambits appear to be paying off house of representatives speaker nancy pelosi the leader of the democratic party in that chamber formally referred the case to the senate clearing the way for the first trial of a sitting president since mr clinton was cleared back in 1999 the impeachment trial is one of many risks that make the relatively smooth ride in markets in 2019 unlikely to continue this year
ohio valley outlook expect a slower regional economy in 2020 the ohio valley s economy could see slower growth in 2020 amid continued anxiety about trade and possible downturns in both energy and manufacturing according to analyses and forecasts by regional economists michael hicks directs the center for business and economic research at ball state university in indiana where he forecasts the health of the manufacturing sector hicks expects manufacturing to slow down and he blames the tariffs levied under president donald trump s administration hicks said the costs imposed by the trade war are playing out in markets across the region and he predicts the ohio valley s economic growth to slow dramatically in 2020 you will see layoffs certainly lower hours less generous bonuses both this year and next year less demand for power which is going to be important particularly in kentucky and west virginia as manufacturing firms both use less metallurgical coal and less coal for electrical power hicks said one tweet away a report hicks co authored shows the impact of manufacturing employment on the overall health of the united states economy has diminished production is still a large share of the economy but he said the economies of kentucky ohio and west virginia are heavily dependent on exports which is why the trade war has and will continue to have a large impact alexandra kanik ohio valley resource the trump administration has made some recent moves to improve trade relations the united states mexico canada agreement or usmca would replace the north american free trade agreement or nafta usmca has passed the house and is still pending in the senate but hicks said that trade deal doesn t offer much assurance the usmca passage is essentially for your typical manufacturing firm it improves the confidence that we re not going to have a trade war with our big partners in canada and mexico hicks said but to just speak candidly we re always one tweet away from a new adversary in the trade war he said if european firms are less interested in buying higher priced american products it s enough to cause a significant decline in the demand for goods produced in the u s hicks said that could have a bigger effect in the region than in the country as a whole which is enough to push kentucky and west virginia ohio indiana illinois into a localized recession he said it s not enough for a national recession but it s enough to give us the feel and taste of what a recession would be like of the three states ohio s larger economy is also more diverse and follows national trends more closely zach schiller is an economist with policy matters ohio an economic research institute ohio is not an island you know our economy is closely integrated into the national and international economies schiller said schiller said the largest employers in ohio are either national or international companies and he expects any change in the state s economy to be similar to what happens nationally still recovering in kentucky manufacturing plays a significant role in the state s economy jason bailey director the left leaning kentucky center for economic policy he said manufacturing has grown in large part because of the auto industry but carmakers are seeing a slowdown we ve lost a lot of manufacturing over the last couple decades across the state and industries like apparel or furniture manufacturing or computer parts manufacturing that has often been to cheaper locations like china and in latin america bailey said bailey said kentucky still hasn t fully recovered from the last recession and it s facing a tough year ahead with state budget cuts likely west virginia is in a similar position with even fewer signs of economic recovery west virginia university s college of business and economics is predicting the economy will expand by about point two percent annually for the next five years the executive director of the left leaning west virginia center on budget and policy ted boettner said that s the lowest growth rate wvu has predicted for the state in the past seven years you know since our last economic recession that began in 2007 west virginia has seen less than a 1 percent increase in job growth over that time boettner said larry dowling west virginia public broadcasting boettner said the state s economy has always been on a roller coaster ride based on energy markets the downturn in coal has hit hard of course but that was somewhat offset recently by a boost from natural gas and pipeline construction work now however one major pipeline project is complete and some others have been halted by legal challenges boettner said that focus on natural resource extraction can hamper other kinds of growth a lot of other industries especially ones based in the knowledge based economy don t really want to be around extractive industries boettner said they don t want to be around a lot of pollution and things like that so you really are choosing one over the other in some sense boettner said the state has never had big urban centers to build a diversified economy around but he thinks investment in education could help with that i mean unfortunately it s gotten to the point where i think the only way that west virginia is going to really thrive potentially thrive over the coming decades will be unless there s massive federal investment in the state he said deficits despite growth the u s is in the longest period of economic recovery in modern history hicks said normally that would mean the country would be running a budget surplus and could start paying off debt or taking on big projects we would have made some long term investments in infrastructure highways roads particularly with transfers to local governments that are you know facing a lot of aging infrastructure hicks said instead hicks said the federal budget has a deficit of more than a trillion dollars after tax cuts and what he calls unsustainable federal spending including the trade bailouts for farmers and he said those economic policies are not having the degree of stimulus they should largely because of the negative effects of the trade war a report from ball state notes the trump administration s 2018 tax cuts and jobs act was meant to spur private non residential investment but whatever effect could have been expected was muted by a similarly large tax increase due to tariffs associated with the trade war we are running a budget deficit of 1 1 trillion which is considerably more than the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 hicks said that was obama s large stimulus package passed in february 2009 that was only 856 billion as economists across the region watch for signs of the next recession they also look to infrastructure investment as an area for potential growth the ohio valley has massive funding needs for its roads broadband internet access and aging water systems

how is it that some millennials making six figures still feel broke this cohort known as henrys typically earn over 100 000 are largely millennials and struggle to balance their saving and spending habits henrys fall victim to lifestyle creep preferring a comfortable and often expensive lifestyle that leaves them behind when it comes to building wealth but their situation is also indicative of an economy that seems bright on the outside but dull on the inside they are part of a generation facing an affordability crisis and 100 000 is no longer what it used to be visit business insider s homepage for more stories advertisement some millennials feel that their six figure paychecks are stretching thin as melkorka licea reported for the new york post in october they are known as henrys the acronym short for high earner not rich yet was invented by shawn tully in a 2003 fortune magazine article and has come to characterize a certain group of six figure earners who are mostly millennials licea wrote according to the experts the typical henry earns over 100 000 is in their early 30s and struggles to balance their spending and savings habits as a result they re behind in wealth building and are not inching closer to their financial goals their comfortable if not lavish lifestyle is partially to blame for feeling broke but so too is an economy that seems good but has a lot of tensions bubbling under its surface advertisement high earning millennials fall victim to lifestyle creep one of a henry millennial s biggest financial issues is that they typically live above their means and fall victim to lifestyle creep gideon drucker a certified financial planner at drucker wealth and the author of the upcoming book how to avoid h e n r y syndrome previously told business insider lifestyle creep occurs when one increases their standard of living to match a rise in their discretionary income but just because a henry s income keeps going up doesn t mean they have to spend more money drucker said in fact they shouldn t spend more if they get used to living off 3 000 or 4 000 a month they might wake up a decade later and find they re spending 10 000 a month he added henrys like a comfortable lifestyle edward berthelot getty images licea spoke to several henrys with expensive habits like staying at luxury hotels taking international vacations owning and or renting two homes and signing up for classpass a gym pass that can cost as much as 180 a month henrys won t sacrifice this lifestyle according to licea even if it requires budgeting in other areas they ll shop at budget stores like forever 21 or tj maxx and vacation using credit card points if it means more money for travel advertisement these lifestyle choices contradict one of the golden rules of experts avoiding lifestyle creep is a key way to build wealth but there are forces beyond a henry s control that are also holding them back financially millennials are facing an affordability crisis the economy may seem like it s riding a high right now the stock market has rallied since fears of an impending recession abounded last year and the us unemployment rate has maintained its half century low of 3 5 but that doesn t paint the whole picture it ignores that income increases simply have not kept up with an exponential increase in living costs consider this a supermoney analysis last year found that income for young adults grew by just 29 adjusted for inflation from 1974 to 2017 meanwhile the median price of a home has increased by 39 and national healthcare costs per person have increased by 9 000 since 1970 advertisement the cost of education has also more than doubled since then leading students to borrow more than ever the national total student loan debt is now a record 1 5 trillion and the average student debt per 2018 graduate who took out student loans was 29 800 henrys are also dealing with student loan debt 10 000 hours getty images even though henrys typically have high paying jobs those who took on student loans to get them owe about 50 000 more than the national average priya malani the founder of stash wealth a financial firm that bills itself as home of the henrys previously told business insider that 40 of her clients had student loans they owe 80 000 on average it s all a bad formula for a generation that s already financially behind from the great recession older millennials got a rough start in the job market and were left playing financial catch up younger millennials watched the financial crisis unfold and became more cautious and risk averse with their money studies have found that millennials are the most financially conservative generation since the great depression and that most are wary of investing so even if the stock market is good it s likely that millennials are still scared to put their money in it and are thereby missing an opportunity to build wealth advertisement 100 000 isn t rich as living costs surpass income increases a six figure salary is no longer what it used to be in today s economy 100 000 is considered middle class in the us the pew research center defines the us middle class as people earning two thirds to twice the median household income which was 60 336 in 2016 that means middle class american households were earning about 40 425 to 120 672 that year it helps explain why a 2019 insider and morning consult survey found that 38 of millennials earning 100 000 or more a year thought they were middle class about 23 thought they were in the upper middle class and only 6 thought they were affluent henrys tend to live in areas with a high cost of living edward berthelot getty images a family in the us needs an annual income of 421 926 to be in the top 1 of earners but the minimum income needed to be in the top 1 varies by state ranging from 255 000 in arkansas to more than 700 000 in connecticut advertisement it all comes down to location where a person lives affects how far their dollar stretches how much they re taxed and how they re influenced by their peers and while henrys can live anywhere malani who has worked with clients across 32 states said they re predominantly in states home to cities with a notoriously high cost of living like new york california and washington dc for millennials who feel broke despite making six figure salaries the situation is affected by internal and external factors since 100 000 doesn t go as far as it once did they need to be picky when allocating their money learning how to balance living for the now and setting money aside for the future will indeed mean they have less cash to burn which can contribute to feeling broke but these same millennials are also dealing with economic circumstances beyond their control highlighting the consequences that have largely affected their generation as a whole even with careful personal spending habits that 100 000 salary does seem a lot smaller in the scheme of today s higher cost of living an astronomical student debt load and the ongoing fallout from the recession
new york u s stocks fell from their record heights on friday after a report showed hiring was a touch weaker than expected last month employers added 145 000 jobs across the country in december short of the 160 000 that economists forecast but the growth was solid enough to bolster wall street s view that the job market is holding up and households can continue to spend preserving the largest part of the economy the bond market also rallied after the report showed workers wages aren t rising much which lessens the threat of inflation the s p 500 fell 9 35 points or 0 3 percent to 3 265 35 from its record set thursday the dow jones industrial average briefly topped the 29 000 level for the first time but it ended at 28 823 77 down 133 13 or 0 5 percent the nasdaq composite dropped 24 57 or 0 3 percent to 9 178 86 i don t think today s report was a big needle mover for the market or for fed policy said liz ann sonders chief investment strategist at charles schwab the economic environment looks fine in 2020 but the risk is that sentiment may have gotten overly complacent and we need earnings to step up even with friday s loss the s p 500 closed out a 0 9 percent gain for the week it s a sharp turnaround from earlier when the s p 500 seemed to be heading for just its third weekly loss in the last 14 as worries rose about a possible u s iran war but stocks rallied after comments from president donald trump and iran made markets believe a military escalation isn t imminent that put the focus back on the economy and corporate earnings the s p 500 returned a stellar 31 5 percent last year even though earnings likely fell for big companies and sonders said investors will need to see profit growth in 2020 to help justify the records that stock prices are setting earnings reports will begin in earnest next week with jpmorgan chase bank of america and other big banks on the schedule to tell investors how much profit they made in the last three months of 2019 many will also give forecasts for 2020 companies across the s p 500 have been able to squeeze plenty of profit from each 1 in revenue because wages for their workers aren t rising very quickly even when the unemployment rate is at a half century low average hourly earnings for workers were 2 9 percent higher in december than a year earlier friday s jobs report showed that s the weakest growth since july 2018 stubbornly low wage growth isn t good for workers but it removes a threat of higher inflation that could erode corporate profits and push the federal reserve to raise interest rates markets see low rates as fuel for markets and the fed s three rate cuts last year were a big reason for the surge in stocks after the jobs report the yield on the 10 year treasury fell to 1 82 percent from 1 85 percent late thursday treasury yields fall when their prices rise falling rates can pressure banks by limiting the amount of profit they make on mortgages and other loans and financial stocks in the s p 500 alone accounted for about a third of the index s loss jpmorgan chase fell 1 percent and bank of america slipped 0 8 percent six flags entertainment plunged 17 8 percent after the theme park operator warned investors that it may have to have to nix development plans in china after its partner in the country defaulted on payments it also said it expects to report a drop in revenue for the latest quarter in overseas markets japan s nikkei 225 rose 0 5 percent south korea s kospi gained 0 9 percent and the hang seng in hong kong added 0 3 percent germany s dax lost 0 1 percent france s cac 40 and the ftse 100 in london both dipped 0 1 percent in commodities trading benchmark u s oil fell 52 cents to settle at 59 04 per barrel brent crude the international standard fell 39 cents to 64 98 a barrel wholesale gasoline rose 1 cent to 1 66 per gallon heating oil fell 2 cents to 1 93 per gallon natural gas rose 3 cents to 2 20 per 1 000 cubic feet gold rose 5 80 to 1 557 50 an ounce silver rose 17 cents to 18 03 per ounce and copper rose 1 cent to 2 82 per pound the dollar rose to 109 54 japanese yen from 109 52 yen on monday the euro rose to 1 1122 from 1 1106
u s job growth slowed more than expected in december but the pace of hiring likely remains sufficient to keep the longest economic expansion in history on track despite a deepening downturn in a manufacturing sector stung by trade disputes the labor department s closely watched monthly employment report on friday also showed the jobless rate holding near a 50 year low of 3 5 a broader measure of unemployment dropped to a record low last month but wage gains ebbed the mixed report will probably not change the federal reserve s assessment that both the economy and monetary policy are in a good place there is nothing here that changes the picture of an economy that is continuing to expand at a pace that exceeds its potential growth rate said conrad dequadros senior economic advisor at brean capital in new york the fed should be very comfortable with this report nonfarm payrolls increased by 145 000 jobs last month with manufacturing shedding jobs after being boosted in november by the return to work of about 46 000 production workers at general motors gm n after a strike the government s survey of establishments showed but milder than normal temperatures in december boosted hiring at construction sites and employment at retailers surged last month some of the slowdown in overall job growth in december is likely due to seasonal volatility associated with a later than normal thanksgiving day economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 164 000 jobs in december roughly 100 000 jobs per month are needed to keep up with growth in the working age population data for october and november was revised to show 14 000 fewer jobs added than previously reported the economy created 2 1 million jobs in 2019 down from 2 7 million in 2018 reports on housing trade and consumer spending have suggested that the economic expansion now in its 11th year is not in immediate danger of being derailed by a recession worries that a downturn might be triggered by the trump administration s trade war with china spurred the fed to cut interest rates three times in 2019 indeed economic growth did slow last year throttling back to 2 1 in the third quarter from 2018 s brisk pace of nearly 3 now though with a phase 1 deal with china set to be signed next week policymakers are more confident in the outlook and last month signaled borrowing costs could remain unchanged at least through this year economists are pegging growth at the end of last year around a 2 3 rate the dollar fell against a basket of currencies after the data while u s treasury prices rose u s stock index futures pared gains tight labor market the labor market has continued to churn out jobs at a healthy clip despite anecdotal evidence of worker shortages which economists had feared would significantly restrain hiring there are however concerns the labor department s bureau of labor statistics bls which compiles the employment data may not be fully capturing the impact on payrolls of president donald trump s 18 month long trade war with china which has pushed manufacturing into recession and led to company closures the government last august estimated that the economy created 501 000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through march 2019 than previously reported the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade that suggests job growth over that period averaged around 170 000 per month instead of 210 000 the revised payrolls data will be published next month the projected massive revision has attracted the attention of some fed officials minutes of the u s central bank s dec 10 11 policy meeting published last week showed a couple of officials viewed the anticipated downgrade as an indication that payroll employment gains would likely show less momentum coming into this year economists say downward revisions of that magnitude suggest that the model the government uses to calculate the net number of jobs from new business and closings is faulty some expect payrolls growth beyond last march could also be revised down for now the labor market is on solid footing with the unemployment rate declining by five tenths of a percentage point in 2019 there was little impact on the jobless rate from annual revisions to the seasonally adjusted household survey data going back five years which were incorporated in december s employment report a broader measure of unemployment which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment fell to 6 7 in december the lowest since the series started in 1994 from 6 9 the prior month the labor force participation rate or the proportion of working age americans who have a job or are looking for one was steady at 63 2 last month the tight labor market however has struggled to generate strong wage inflation average hourly earnings rose three cents or 0 1 last month after increasing 0 3 in november that lowered the annual increase in wages to 2 9 in december from 3 1 in november manufacturing employment dropped by 12 000 jobs in december after jumping 58 000 in november as the gm strike ended the institute for supply management s measure of national factory activity dropped in december to its lowest level since june 2009 manufacturing added only 46 000 job in 2019 compared to 264 000 in 2018 hiring at construction sites increased by 20 000 jobs in december there were increases in leisure and hospitality professional and business services financial activities education and healthcare retail and wholesale trade employment last month but the transportation and warehousing industry lost 10 400 jobs and mining and logging shed 9 000 positions government employment rose by 6 000 jobs it is expected to accelerate in the coming months amid increased hiring for the 2020 census

as a supervisor a well nobody in this race has my experience i was born and raised in this city i was uh you know i ve i ve lived here my entire life and and then i you know i ran a business in the

and delivered the paper and not only was it a job that helped me raise money to pay for my clothes and school and different things but it also kept me abreast of everything happening in my city every

incorporates everyone who lives there in a way that they can be a part of every transformational change that happens in their neighborhoods q democrats dominate state government and have for a long time even in the later years of arnold he was basically aligned with many democratic priorities and democrats are more popular than ever so plainly something s going right for you in the political sense but on the other hand california has the worst poverty rate in the nation when you include cost of living and the new audit of shows that california education is failing to deliver promised help to english language learners poor kids foster kids so what do you say about the idea that this is you know california democrats own this picture and should be accountable for some profound failings on poverty and education a that sounds like a loaded question but uh i can tell you this um since i joined the state government we developed a new funding formula that uh increased uh how we invest in the most underserved areas and we re not going to turn the state around in one year or two or three when we ve had many many years of some districts getting 14 000 per pupil and others getting 9 000 per pupil in my school in my elementary school when i first got elected in the first year uh 32 teachers when when we were looking at uh district cuts the the my neighborhood school perkins elementary in barrio logan saw 32 pink slips be delivered guess how many teachers they had at that school 32 well other other districts didn t have that you re looking at some underserved areas under the old system were being punished more harshly than others there are numerous issues facing our constitution and the way we fund school districts that currently still needs to be addressed to ensure that every single student across the state is getting equal funding and in anywhere in this part of the state if there are affluent school districts they should be getting the same per pupil funding than the underserved communities or the more impoverished areas currently we don t have that in the state we have worked to bridge that gap and we have reduced the disparity enormously but there are still some disparities we need to invest more in our underserved populations i have been that vote that has constantly sought to target the hardest to educate population putting more money in we put more money to foster children california does have bigger challenges in how to educate our public we have more kids in schools we have more crowded classrooms and we do need more funding for our schools that is a fact ben hueso q right but we just had an audit that came out and said this didn t work that this money isn t going where it s supposed to go that it s being used for general uses we just had an audit that says whatever the state intended with this bill it is not what s happening a and we don t run the districts we gave the districts more flexibility to improve education the state doesn t run the school districts they have their own elected boards and we provided them those that have more challenges more resources so they have less excuses uh to provide to us in terms of uh why they re failing but california does have a very uh uh has bigger challenges in how to educate our public we have more kids in schools we have more crowded classrooms and we do need more funding for our schools that is a fact advertisement q assemblywoman shirley weber has introduced bills repeatedly in recent years to try to make sure that the lcff money goes to the people who are supposed to go to this spring patrick o donnell didn t even let her present testimony on her latest reform bill and anthony rendon said that s fine by him so you can t blame it on districts when the legislature is refusing to try to make them accountable a uh well i m not entirely blaming it on the districts i told you that we need more parody in terms of funding per pupil and i have been that vote that supports that and any way we could move forward to accomplishing that i have always supported that um you need to have a conversation with o donnell and rendon on that issue regarding weber bottom line for me i mean we need to invest more money and resources and provide excellent teachers and support and you know a lot of these teachers are spending money out of their own pockets to get these kids you know notebooks and pencils and pens and in some cases i mean i represent some school districts that are very impoverished that have 100 free lunch that have uh most of the people below poverty in those districts those are very hard challenges for the state to bridge without the adequate resources i m proud to say that every single year that i ve been on the legislature we ve increased funding uh for our schools this year we introduced the budget that includes the largest per pupil funding in the history of the state when i first got elected we re looking at 35 billion in cuts uh one of the questions that we re faced was with taking people out of dialysis what i m proud to say is that we didn t do that but no 2 that we also did not dip into educational funding because i thought it would ve been immoral to cut education funding the problem was with the draconian cuts that we faced we we couldn t increase the budget of our schools and we needed to and we are still recovering from a very devastating recession that devastated our state s ability to educate people maintain our roads in almost every category we were uh facing major cuts that put us behind so one of the strategies was to find ways to solve those problems and there were big problems so they re not going to be solved overnight students at lennox middle school irfan khan los angeles times and so we re looking at how to better educate the people of the state funding is part of it but also making sure that we support an education curriculum that that creates critical thinkers and that was the other step that we made at the state we re changing the way we educate our public our kids we re creating scientists instead of indoctrinating them i feel when i was a kid there were a lot of parts of the educational curriculum that was more about indoctrination than teaching critical thinking and uh my kids go to public school and i see uh the material that they re educating i mean this is very advanced stuff that they re teaching these kids i look at my kids homework and say wow this is really advanced work for a 10th grader 11th grader the curriculum is getting uh harder every year and that s part of the you know we re putting our kids through a an educational process that s more uh rigorous than than when i was raised and than when you were raised uh the the focused i think has changed a little bit i still believe we need to uh press our school districts to include more cultural learning music uh art uh but it s education is one of those things that is always going to be a tough area and i think we ve seen major improvements it is going to take some time for the districts to learn the new system but it s also critical to get our parents part of formulating the curriculum understanding the dashboard that has been i think a big problem getting parents to understand something that is very complex in terms of how they have a responsibility in shaping uh the spending plan of every district because that s part of our process we included parents in formulating that plan which i think is aspirational you know we need parents to be part of that and it only worked with their involvement and and we have to find a way to continue to improve on that q i ll ask one more education question then i ll shut up for awhile in 2014 the new york times did an editorial that said california s teacher protection laws which have the effect of funneling the best teachers to the richest schools were a civil rights abomination the aclu has won repeated lawsuits against l a unified over its treatment of minority students so when are california democrats going to address the gap between their rhetoric and between reality what we actually have in public schools because what we actually have in public schools is a system that values adult employees starting with teachers over kids and this isn t me saying this this is the new york times the most liberal newspaper in america saying this and this is the aclu saying this that we have a school system that values teachers and students what do you say a look i have kids in school here and i can tell you that the teachers uh i mean i have a child with autism that i can really say i owe his uh development and his current performance based on what the teachers were able to do for him and i can tell you that when my kid was very young i never thought he d integrate into a regular classroom environment he s a 4 4 student now in a baccalaureate program and both of my uh children went from being considered challenged learners to now having a 4 4 gpa part of this process requires parental involvement i think there s got you know i think generally speaking every aspect of any organization s personnel profile has some bad actors and some bad apples and i favor some of the things that are happening with uh uh san diego unified and chula vista in terms of they re creating peer groups that help build capacity in a teacher s ability to educate if a teacher just wants to show up and not do anything i believe they should be removed i believe they should be removed i believe any district should have the power to remove bad teachers uh i believe there should still be a process because i also understand that when it comes to teaching parents are very passionate about that issue they do want the best teachers but they also want the kids to get good grades and oftentimes they can mistakenly pass judgment and force the removal of good teachers so it s a hard issue to wrestle with when is it appropriate to remove teachers when are they really bad i believe teachers should be evaluated i believe teachers should be tested but also we should put some money into the budget to help build training and capacity and support for teachers that have often a very difficult job my brother s a teacher and i hear it from him he says there s bad teachers and we have a a teacher s jail in l a that s so bad because they can t remove teachers that they send them to a room and they say you ve been called to spend the rest of the year in what they call the jail i think that s preposterous how are we paying people to sit in a room and do nothing all day show up to work everyday on time and sit in a room they have in la they haven t found a better use for those teachers other than to put them in a room they re not even i mean clean a window i mean give a lunch i think that s ridiculous i m glad we don t do that here but that is definitely emblematic of a severe problem in our state that happens in that district in l a that i hope never comes to san diego and the day it does i think the people here should be very concerned that their taxpayer dollars are not being spent on educating their kids but simply paying a salary and because they don t have a process of removing teachers because they ve gotten so friendly to that process i don t think we re here yet but i ve also met with various school districts that san ysidro has a very low tax base they don t have enough money to fund the quality of teachers that they need and every time people say the problem is not money i go to the highest performing schools and see what they re getting per pupil funding for the schools and what they re paying for their teachers and how they take the best teachers to those programs and get the best results and say maybe money is a part of it maybe just compensation is part of ensuring we get the best people in our schools advertisement i think generally you know we have to provide these teachers an excellent working environment and the support that they need to provide the best instruction to our kids and we have to find a way to pay for it ben hueso q yeah you know i think we ve got a story coming sunday that they tracked a fourth through eighth graders across all the major school districts the big majors that are there and the san diego kids improved strikingly more than their peers so i m not quite sure it s like true that like nothing s happening it s a pretty vexing problem there s interesting arrows pointing in different directions a but there are also reports that show the curriculum is also getting more difficult year after year and our children at an earlier age are tasked with solving more complex problems than they were before and i think that just comes with our society being more complex and just to us being exposed to information overload on a daily basis so you know there s part of that that s figured in um is there a silver bullet do i think if we fire more teachers that would improve education i don t know because there s also studies that show that inexperienced teachers aren t always the best solution as well i think generally uh you know we have to provide these teachers an excellent working environment and and the support that they need to provide the best instruction to our kids and we have to find a way to pay for it q speaking of money the county has always prided itself on its financial footing yes it s got a big budget but it also has a big reserve a lot of politicians pointed that out and said why aren t we spending a little bit more of that money on the needed services including some of the candidates in your race how do you feel about the county s reserve system and are they saving too much or not using too much a well i ll just remind you in terms of my own experience and my itinerary on the subject when i came to san diego we were called enron by the sea and a lot of people asked me why are you running why would you want to go into that mess it s a fiscal nightmare and it was when we came in we found money that was being used that was uh allocated for one thing being used for something else that brought in the federal government to threaten us with fines we had um sewer pipes were breaking and sewer was going into the streets uh we had sewer breaks going into the ocean it was a nightmare and we worked systematically to correct those problems to fix the books but while we did that we developed a reserve and we had goals of creating a 14 reserve and we got pretty close when i left the city we were at about 10 reserves when i got to the state we were facing a 35 billion deficit we had a structural deficit where we owed school districts a ton of money where we owed other departments a ton of money our recycling program was bankrupt i mean i really came in at a really tough time when i got elected to the city when i got elected to the state i ve only really known bad times in government until recently where now we have a you know if i leave the state in the next year we will i will leave the state with a 22 billion reserve i will leave the state uh in a much better uh footing uh revenue wise if we do see a downturn that money will be prioritized to make sure that education is kept solvent and kept functioning to make sure that we don t develop a generational problem where some kids get a quality education and others don t i intend to ensure that the county uh keep a reserve that s going to be it s part of the recipe of everything that i ve ever been a part of it s going to be very important that we have an excellent credit rating because governments do borrow a lot and it s part of the formula of ensuring that we can maintain our infrastructure and keep up uh the services that are so important but last year i uncovered that the county had hidden 42 million that should have been going into health programs and that was state money that if it had been invested locally it not only would have created jobs but it also would ensured that we would have reduced these hepatitis outbreaks that we had i had a lot of my friends saying i m not going to downtown restaurants anymore because i m afraid i might get hepatitis and that really hurt our business community locally when we had the money to address the issue and their only strategy to deliver uh services was to say we have a policy of no new hires that is not a strategy to improve health in san diego it s it s a conservative strategy designed to lash out at government as the problem i don t think government is a problem we together as a country as a nation have put our collective minds together to create a government that ensures for our prosperity and our safety and our health and that s what we should be spending money on we don t have to break the bank and if we do need revenues you also know me as somebody who has supported taking ballot measures to the voters for them to support uh revenues for important programs that affect them and sometimes we ve been successful and sometimes we haven t but the idea is that we should be honest with the people and say look we are facing challenges we need your help and we ask that you be involved in this process that we should be honest with the people of our communities say you know government can t solve every problem we re going to endeavor to do our best to get behind the biggest issues and as long as we focus on the biggest issues we ll be okay flames whip around utility power lines as winds drive towards town in sycamore canyon threatening structures in montecito california on dec 16 2017 marcus yam los angeles times advertisement q speaking of big issues you re chair of the senate committee on energy utilities and communications a lot of people talking about utilities at this moment uh it s a nightmare what personal responsibility do you have in your position uh for these planned power outages is there something you should have seen coming and could have done to sidestep this in any way whether through utilities or some other vehicle a unfortunately and uh we re in a very tough position to get a utility that s in bankruptcy to perform 100 of its responsibilities and that s been the largest challenge we developed a policy that increased investor confidence in putting money behind our utilities to make sure they stay in business i think that was one of the biggest accomplishments of this year and it was a very important action to ensure that our public utilities uh stay in business first and foremost i mean these power outages without that could have been much worse but we implemented power outages in san diego going back to 2009 when i was on the council and i supported power outages back then because i saw that it was important at preventing fires and and it has been an enormous success here in san diego because it has helped to prevent fires and we have to come to grips with something that s very important california has chosen to allow people to live in areas that have been traditionally prone to fires historically even before human development and a big presence i mean fires have been burning in the forest for thousands of years and we have decided to allow people to live there and in combination with a very robust brush management program that has created more fuel we re now seeing the consequences of that of putting power lines in areas that are now being affected by climate change we never saw climate change coming 40 years ago and 50 years ago and now we re dealing with climate change and how do we harden the grid without increasing rates to our ratepayers how do we put money into brush management without increasing uh the cost to rate payers we re facing a perfect storm it s just a combination of things that have happened with uh a drought a very prolonged drought that has put about 20 million trees in jeopardy has killed 20 million injuries so we re talking about an enormous amount of fuel that s out there combined with a beetle that has killed more trees combined with climate change we re facing a perfect storm and the state has only so many resources and these utilities have only so many resources available to them but what we did with sdg e back then when we were confronted with these horrific fires early on showed us that putting some resources into predicting the weather into cameras that is our early warning system uh planned power power outages that are part of the solution we can do a better job at maintaining uh this this or managing this problem we re not going to solve it i don t think we re ever going to solve it we ve got to find a way to keep our utilities in business minimize our losses and increase our response rates this past year we put 700 million from our budget to help combat these fires we re buying equipment helicopters airplanes fire trucks uh very advanced equipment that will help us combat these fires it s not enough it ll help us be more prepared for the next event but we re also reaching out to the federal government and say you have very advanced satellite systems that will really help us prevent these fires we could respond within minutes if we knew that a fire was breaking out and sending an airplane full of water to a small fire would do a lot at dousing that fire and preventing it from spreading we have to develop technology that s going to help us be more responsive but we also have to little by little harden the grid there will be some places where we have to underground uh wires and unfortunately there are going to be some places we re going to have to not permit uh development in the future q but the best practices question is one that amazes me calfire had an executive director who had his home burned down three years ago we had a report in july by joshua emerson smith it said 17 000 different times that there had been home inspections found that people weren t doing defensible space and they weren t even find whereas in all of america when you fine people they then do their thing and they clean up or they do the right thing so i just find the gap between newsom s rhetoric and legislature s rhetoric and how calfire behaves to be unbelievable a and i m going to tell you that that s not the case anymore you re talking about a scenario three years ago we have talked about building defensible space but we also have written into our legislation and we have also uh talked about who will be responsible for uh putting pressure on homeowners to create that defensible space it s not just going to be calfire because calfire can only do so much we have to involve the insurance companies that have potential losses that could lose lots of money if one of their insured uh customers is involved in creating a fire uh they have a stakeholder interest in reaching out to their policy holders to say you have to build a defensible space calfire has to do that the county of each state has to do that and we have put our state on a path to hold all those entities more accountable to make sure that we do develop defensible spaces in the future firefighters quickly extinguish a small vegetation fire in lakeside sentinel file photo q let me ask you about a specific bill senate bill 615 which you introduced and which would ve created a higher bar for the release of public records you pulled that back pretty quickly after our board and others criticized that why did you introduce that bill advertisement a well first of all it s real simple uh a city that i represent said that it was a problem and so we investigated and we reached out to stakeholders of all levels and said ah can we improve on this law and they said yes you could and i wouldn t have moved forward with a bill if stakeholders beyond just the cities and local governments said yes this law is being abused and it s leading to to um losses of money so i introduced the bill no bill ever finishes up in the form it s introduced it goes through a rigorous process of getting input and i knew that was going to happen with this bill but i opened up a conversation about you know uh the importance of maintaining transparency but ensuring that our money is not going to the same old firm that just wants to file a lawsuit on every decision and we do have locally and statewide some firms that just specialize in finding the lawsuits the city lost over 600 000 to these lawsuits it seemed like a serious problem at the time until the city came out and said no the law is not a problem that s what caused me to retract that bill but it left the standing question that i don t think anybody responded to who was you know okay if the law is not the problem than the city is the problem and why wasn t that raised and that s still i think a conversation worth having about making sure that every single local government is fully transparent providing information if the law s a problem then why wasn t the city of san diego providing this information i think that question still stands and it hasn t been answered q so mara elliott offered a mea culpa on that even before we asked the question she said that maybe it might be the single biggest i have to be careful i don t mischaracterize what she said but it might be the single biggest uh mistake she made in her first term do you apologize for that do you think that was a mistake or do you think that you are are you pleased with the conversation a i mean if it was her mistake then it was my mistake to have trusted that she thought it was a problem with the law uh you know but i think no damage was done i think i pulled back the law saying it s not necessary i don t think we should run a bill that s not necessary at the time it seemed like it was and i think i managed the situation correctly and you know it never ever hurts to raise an issue or ask a question or introduce a bill with the hope of solving a problem if there was no problem there was no bill so i don t see at the end of the day there having been an issue and that s still i think a conversation worth having about making sure that every single local government is fully transparent providing information ben hueso q but the context of it is what was kind of interesting you introduced this bill at a time when police agencies across the state were resisting a state law that said they had to disclose records and so your law has a premise that government agencies want to do the right thing and that they shouldn t be subject to these onerous requests well why assume government agencies want to do the right thing when in real time we re seeing police agencies defined a plainly written state law a you re assuming that my bill did not require disclosures it did it did full disclosures my bill required full disclosures it didn t give them any kind of exemption or any kind of out so i think that s where you re you know i think you you misunderstand the bill because the bill did not uh give them an exemption or lessen a requirement on them to provide that information and it had nothing to do with the police advertisement q but it ended up putting up obstacles to achieving the release of the information that didn t exist before a i don t think it was an obstacle because uh you can also argue that having to go to court to get information as an obstacle and it s very costly and most of the people uh that don t understand that process or that law would never hire an attorney if they were getting that information they would have to be advised to do that q well it did create a higher bar a i don t think so q for the release of information it did a i think well okay and it might have i didn t think it did because all it did was require one step and that was having a conference having a conference was one step and i think through a conference people communicate people understand each other and that s much easier to do than to go to court right advertisement q you had to prove that they were like knowingly or willingly withholding information it created an extra step in that process a there was never an expectation that that part of it was going to stay in the bill and and it should have never been part of it that s the language she requested we had no intention of moving forward with that specific language we had already discussing amending that within my office to remove that part of the bill but that s what she requested and that would have most certainly not been a part of the bill in its final version q let me say integrity is a big part of a candidate and politics just looking back voice of san diego had fact checked you six times in 2010 when you were leaving the city council presidency three false statements two misleading statements and one mostly true statement more than any of your colleagues uh they said that and i quote run into trouble while citing historical trends in defense of your position on city affairs at one point citing what the voice of san diego called non existent research to back up a point do you remember these examples do you think a i only remember one and i ll tell you which one it was when our revenues went down i basically and this is it s all in how you communicate an issue when our property tax revenue went down what does that mean to you that people are paying less property taxes and the comment that i made was one of our issues is people are paying less property taxes i didn t say the rate went down i didn t say the property tax rate has gone down i just basically said people are paying and they fact checked me on that saying you know he said that property taxes went down when they hadn t i never said that and we got into it in an exchange and of course they decided to take the position that i said that property taxes went down you can look up the tape and interpret it how you want but that s not what i meant all i meant was locally people are paying less property taxes because we re getting less tax revenue it s simple math and how they turn that into a debate i don t know and then they went on to say that at the local government level i took a position that a redevelopment agency should stay in business and there was something associated with that and i ve always been very consistent on my position regarding redevelopment uh agencies and protecting local tax dollars again they focused on very very minor issues that i just think it was not entirely accurate what they said and how they said it and even if i explain myself following that it didn t change the position they took and you know you can fact check me in this conversation and see how many times some inaccurate or not q in terms of truth telling and fact checking this is an incident that came up in 2013 four years prior you said uh in 2013 that four years prior you had walked in in the bathroom saw carl demaio masturbating in the bathroom at city hall a yeah advertisement q no one s talked about that for a few years he s running for congress you re running for county supervisor talking about integrity it seems like this is a valid issue to bring up he says it never happened says that it s character assassination a wow q did it happen and why did you decide to bring it up a i d rather not comment on that q but did it happen that goes to your word a i mean uh there s an article about it and and i was asked if the article s completely accurate and that s as far as i ll say that it was and i wasn t the only witness advertisement q but why bring that up why a look i you know i ll be real honest with you i didn t intend for that information to get out i talked to a reporter about it with the condition that he would not publish that story and that reporter decided to publish it anyway and that was my mistake that uh you know i i did share factual information i it wasn t my intent that it would become public and that s where i m filled with regrets q so when carl says that you re lying he s lying a no i don t want to get into it q uh another issue uh in your past is uh that you had funneled 25 000 to your brother s campaign when he ran for office advertisement a right q uh you admit that that was a mistake why did that happen a uh because we got a legal opinion that it was possible believe it or not in today s campaign finance rules it s legal now it was legal prior there was a change in the law that made it illegal i regret that it happened but i got uh it was based on a legal opinion that i received and i have a letter to show that uh where a bona fide uh lawyer said it was possible and i often rely on people that have an expertise in certain areas and that s where i think we all made a mistake it was lamentable i regret that it happened but like i said uh sometimes the laws regarding campaign finance change and it s often not just hard for me and the general public but even experts in their field to keep up with those changes q the county has a pension system that s badly underfunded and yet it indulged for a while this guy named lee partridge this svengali type figure from houston to do these dangerous strategies and investments and at the time only some supervisors seemed to be concerned about it do you think that you guys should be more actively if you are elected more actively look over what s going on with this pension system and try to make sure it s doing things that are in the best interests of the voters because for years it didn t feel that way a that s always very important our pension system is an enormous public expense it s something that uh could potentially bankrupt our government and and that wouldn t serve nobody s interest it would not serve the employees or the people they serve so uh you know i was part of the city and that went through a process of of evaluating our pensions understanding what happened to our pension uh that caused so much problems so many problems to our city and i think that s what makes me uniquely qualified for this seat as well i ve been dealing with pensions now for the last 14 years in a way that most people in politics don t and i know uh the our pension system and how it operates very well and that s one of the things i also intend to be very active and make sure that our our uh pension system achieves its objectives the county has a very generous pension system it probably is one of the best in the county and in the state and in that way they ensure that they get quality employees and that they keep them retention of employees is also very important but we also have to make sure that we keep our pensions funded one thing did happen across america though that has been lost in this conversation that there have been lessenings of rules in wall street that have uh created uh less regulation in how uh investments are made are one thing that we did did see when san diego s pension system went down the state s pensions went down the county s pension went down everybody in the entire country suffered pension losses because of a downturn in wall street and we really have to evaluate how much we depend on wall street to fund our pensions because it can be a very dangerous formula if we decide as a country to deregulate wall street and how investments are made i kind of call it one of the biggest ripoffs of the middle class in our century and all this money where did it go it got lost to people that were investing in junk bonds and and uh very risky stocks and sometimes selling the same stock twice uh that s something that we have to address as a nation but understanding that and understanding that we cannot rely entirely on wall street we have to be very careful how we fund our pension and what contributions we make every year to ensure that we start to make an inroad at fully funding our pensions year after year q but that s akin to the steve moviglio argument that the problem isn t the size of pensions 80 of last pay but the fact that we had the great recession that hurt calpers and hurt calstrs advertisement a that s not the argument i m making q well but isn t the problem the fact that we pay people 80 of their final pay as opposed to something closer to what social security pays as opposed to the fluctuations in the stock market a it s not a problem if you fully fund it but if you can t afford it you know when i was in the city of san diego we made changes reforms to the pension and i was and we worked very hard as a council to get a unanimous vote on some very deep pension cuts and some reforms that saved the system a lot of money you know that i m willing to do that i ve done it in the past and i ve also done it at the state level as well so it s something that s part of our country s new normal we have to fully fund our pensions but we also have to find a way to afford our pensions but we also have to find a way to stay competitive with the regular market making sure that we bring quality personnel to our county and that s part of a formula that we have to work on on a year to year basis but we also have to project where we want to be in the future and how we re going to get there sheriff deputies check on an inmate returning from his court appearance nelvin c cepeda san diego union tribune q did you guys i m sorry did you talk about the sheriff at all a not yet advertisement q ah so there was this uh project that uh we did about deaths in the jails a yes yes i m familiar with that q and if you watch the video that goes along with that that s where you really get to see what s going on super upsetting the sheriff s in a tough spot because you know it s super difficult to manage that kind of thing but his response uh has not been entirely forthright a little bit running away from the problem trying to create a big smokescreen with some confusing numbers that are that are not honestly correct so i don t know if you followed this what are your thoughts on what can be done there how can we help out the criminal justice side and get a handle on what s going on there so we re not like the worst in the state a and i did see the report that came out that showed a dramatic increase in deaths and that s lamentable and it shouldn t be happening and uh we have to get to the root of what is causing that what is the culture of the staff is it the facilities um or is it a combination of things you know it probably is a combination of things but i also know that you know uh some of the staff are some of the better paid in our county as well so we have to um in our state for that matter in other parts of the state for that matter i meant the state uh so we have to look at this issue and i would bring an independent uh entity to evaluate this and study this and see what is really contributing to that they promised an investigation i don t know what that investigation has resulted in uh it hasn t been released but i think it should be made public you know you q they re investigating themselves a look sometimes you make mistakes and sometimes you re embarrassed but that shouldn t stop you from releasing information because you re really gonna need the help of experts and the general public to fix a problem but we re not equipped as politicians to fully fix those problems we need support from our community to do that and they should really reach out they should reach out to the professionals and employ the best practices in our state to ensure this doesn t happen but how would they know how to employ those if they don t know what the problem is advertisement q no i agree but it s like we ve got this situation the sheriff independently elected a yup q uh so yeah he s investigating himself i wonder how that s going to go whereas the board which controls his budget could bring pressure to bear or good to have its own investigation where you feel like there s some independence a but you know a matter like this requires a grand jury to be convened q yeah a and i don t know why it hasn t happened but that should be the first step there should be an investigation we should convene a grand jury we should uh also meet directly with the sheriff and say okay what do you know has happened and we want full transparency why has this happened why is our city being dinged with this uh horrific statistic we don t want anybody to die in the hands of people who they have no ability to protect themselves from advertisement q but the sheriff s response is part of a long history in the san diego county whether it s foster care or food stamps where the county authorities especially under walt ekard would just say hey no you re simply wrong we re doing a great job look at our blood and surplus and in 2017 we had the hepatitis crisis and incredibly the county put out a report that basically said we did a great job so are you worried that there s something culturally wrong at the upper levels of county government where they forever are excusing away their behavior or their lackings as oh no that s a perception problem and your problem a but you know that s always going to happen and i hope it doesn t i hope people don t just hide behind oh we re doing a great job but we should expect that they re going to be defensive and protect themselves that s why i got involved on the hepatitis issue and i did an audit and found that they no that they were not properly funding those programs that they did not have a proper program and that information needs to make it to the public and people need to know and in fact they did respond to that audit as soon as i filed for that audit they started putting money into the system and responding so when the auditor did come in they said oh they already started programs and see we just need people that are willing to put in the work and the time to address these important issues and it s going to be a combination of of you know the local council and the state legislators and the governor and the attorney general everybody needs to do their job and if somebody does take a defensive posture we could work through that by going through the proper motions to do the studies and they show that look maybe they re not doing such a good job but not in there let s talk about how we can improve this as a community and they need to reach out if they need additional resources or help i mean that s why i ve always tried to be responsive to my local governments when they need when i go to them and say let me know i can support your work at the local level because all politics is local and they respond with their priorities with me and that s usually what i run with at the state level and that s kind of what i see my job as a local senator to support the work of my local governments i have a history of taking on some of the toughest issues facing our region i think somebody needs to do that ben hueso q but it s one thing for a county bureaucrat to say oh no so what if we re taking forever to process food stamps and it s another thing for them to say we did a great job when people died hundreds of people were sick and san diego s reputation was hurt nationally and internationally and yet walt ekard s self appointed successor endorsed the report that said we did a great job a and maybe you should do a story uh i answered it but maybe you should do a story on all the times we ve audited the county and found uh problems with the way they re delivering services and that s you know having some insight into that is one of the reasons i like to run and and and i think i can do it better and i think i have a track record uh of making things better wherever i ve gone uh on almost every issue and and i think no one in this race can show that they can uh solve problems to the degree that we have and that have taken on really tough issues uh the way we have and i have a history of taking on some of the toughest issues facing our region i think somebody needs to do that q where are you on the sos ballot measure advertisement a on the sos ballot measure q what position do you take on that the notion that a i haven t taken a position on that yet q what s your thought process what do you see as pros and cons a generally look i believe our region belongs to the voters and there should be a process by which the voters get to weigh in on how uh their community is developed i think that s very important i think it s important to the future of our region that we maintain quality neighborhoods and people s you know everybody that comes here makes an investment to come here and everybody that lives here has some kind of investment and it s important that we have a mechanism by which they can protect that investment so i look at it and say there s some good things about it but also see that once they are involved in planning a community it doesn t remove the lawsuits and i favor community plans that the community supports so when somebody decides to develop under that framework that they re not challenged with a lawsuit for whatever reason because for whatever reason and this initiative doesn t do that and that s where i think we re falling short because we do need to uh improve our community i served on the coastal commission sometimes people wanted to add a bathroom to their home where they had to pay 350 000 in legal fees that s on the coast you know i just what how s that even possible and there s something broken in a system where you have to do that to add a bathroom to your house and there s something broken that should not work that way and and uh this ballot measure would be much better if it could ensure that if there is a public vote on a land use plan that that land use plan has some weight uh through the permitting process trolley comes eastbound towards the elevated station east of mission gorge road john gibbins the san diego union tribune advertisement q where are you on the sandag and mts sales tax proposal use for more money for transit a are the details on that proposal out yet q no a and that s the thing i really like to see uh a ballot proposal in its final form before i take a position but generally i also understand that you know having supported sb1 with the promise that it would bring transportation funds to our county knowing that locally having uh our local source of revenue helps us get more state and federal dollars for projects that s a very important selling point to any of these ballot measures but we really have to uh understand how these ballot measures are designed first and what they re going to accomplish and what we re going to get for our money q how about the issue of economic development it s come up in the campaign what are your thoughts on uh trying to uh develop parts of the district a you know i worked for the city s economic development division bringing those companies to our region that provide better paying jobs i understand how incentives are very important to bringing important companies but i also know that if you want to bring the best companies to san diego they want to come to a city that s beautiful that has wonderful schools that has beautiful homes beautiful parks beautiful libraries beautiful beaches san diego has been very good at bringing those kinds of companies because they can offer their employees a very good place to live part of bringing these companies to san diego is going to be ensuring that we can provide a great place for their employees to live because these companies pay their employees a lot of money those employees want to come here because they have a high quality of life so we need to ensure first and foremost that we have beautiful neighborhoods and that we have safe neighborhoods with great schools and wonderful amenities and san diego has so many wonderful amenities that we ve promised them beginning with our beaches and our public golf courses and our balboa park and seaworld the zoo we have so many wonderful things that are part of what makes san diego a wonderful place to live we need to continue to make san diego a wonderful place to live and attract those quality paying jobs that will ensure people can afford to live in san diego but also bring that money from the global economy to our city we ve been really good about doing that i m very proud of all the work that i ve done over the years to continue to do that and i m very proud of the work i ve done in my district to ensure that we develop job creation clusters industry manufacturing in otay mesa i wanted to bring biotech biotech didn t want to go there because of you know some of the reasons i talked about they wanted more amenities in that area but we were able to bring food manufacturing to a cluster that really built up and is creating great jobs and businesses there that are contributing to our county s economy we need to work on reducing wait times on the border i have worked on that year after year after year with lots of success bringing federal dollars into our border crossings to ensure that we reduce border wait times because we know every time we reduce border wait times it increases our economy enormously advertisement i m very proud of the work i ve done in my district to ensure that we develop job creation clusters industry manufacturing ben hueso and especially in san diego our proximity to mexico and building trade routes with mexico is going to help us to continue to build our economy and we have to look on that very favorably and find ways how we can uh contribute to that when i joined the council immediately i started working and supporting the cbx the pedestrian border crossing that has been a huge success because it makes it easier uh to visit san diego as well and when we can t expand our airport here locally because of our geographical challenges we can invest in solutions that make sense that bring people to our county that help us travel more cost effectively and efficiently throughout the world and tijuana helps us connect with tokyo with south america with all parts of mexico it s been a wonderful addition to our transportation infrastructure in addition to creating jobs on this side of the border and helping travelers uh uh travel more conveniently across the world so i m very proud of that as well proud of adding pedestrian crossings at the sany ysidro border proud of working on creating a toll road that s going to be an additional border crossing at the border with sr 11 we need to complete that project it s going to add to our portfolio making san diego a very competitive place to do business because we are becoming more and more an international city because of our transportation infrastructure and our connection to mexico which is the 15th largest economy in the world given their challenges and given their high poverty rates they also have a very big economy and one thing we can t ignore that when we create jobs in mexico we re also creating jobs in california because now this new global economy shows all the data is showing us that as we partner with mexico we re helping to create jobs in california and we re starting to build things together our products are both made in california and mexico and where we can provide them uh products they re also providing us and it s a agreement that makes sense it s a relationship that is also investing in our own community and that s something that i ve also worked very hard to foster through my work q i agree with you on the positives of that relationship but let me ask you about an issue that we ve editorialized on plenty and i know you ve been involved in and that s tijuana sewage a yes q as a supervisor would you have joined the lawsuit of the communities down here from the get go and what do you do going forward a yes i would have and i would also have declared uh an emergency uh i would have declared uh an emergency uh because it would also help to draw state funds toward the problem and bring attention from the state level to this issue that s why i introduced a bill this year to establish an emergency because it substituted the county s position which was no position you know we have tried meeting with ibwc and the state department and the federal government on solving this problem and that hasn t worked and when you are getting short on results you have to try everything every tool available in your toolbox to get results i don t regret it i think it was the right decision but also getting 15 million from the state government uh to solve this problem was a very important part of this process because now uh we can go to the federal government of both countries and say the state who has no responsibility in fixing this problem has put forth 15 million what are you going to do and it s putting pressure on both governments to be part of the solution uh the uh andrés manuel lópez obrador administration in mexico recently announced that they have allocated 10 million toward this solution this is a president who has promised to reduce federal spending who has a promise to uh introduce a very uh austere uh budget approach to running the country and working on transparency and internal reforms uh first this is a big victory for us for a government that has taken a very conservative spending put forth a very conservative plan to be the first ever to allocate money to solving this problem which now will put a lot more pressure on our federal administration to come up with money so the state achieving 15 million is an enormous victory we i have been meeting with officials from mexico i have made several trips to mexico to meet with leaders there and in baja california to speak on this issue uh an organization was formed in tijuana called tijuana verde which was a citizens group of stakeholders that are embarrassed about their own government that are putting pressure locally on their government to solve this problem the new incoming governor has announced that he s going to solve the problem in six months and he s going to solve a portion of the problem he s going to solve the sewage outflow problems advertisement signs barring swimming at imperial beach k c alfred ut san diego zuma press i ve seen the plan and it s a very viable plan but it doesn t solve the wastewater treatment problem that s why the federal government has taken over the operation of the wastewater pumping and conveyance system uh unprecedented move on their part which shows me that they re serious about solving this problem when the federal government comes in and takes it over and takes it away from the locals you guys are not doing this we re going to do it that gives me hope and it comes after years and years of pressing and pressuring and meeting and pleading and uh begging them to fix this problem now we re sitting results from this administration and this governor and i feel i have to tell you it s an emotional experience for me having worked on this so much but i feel energized i feel excited i feel i mean i can t wait to work on the next stage of this and and look i can tell you uh that lawsuit was only intended we don t want money from the federal government for us in our state and we don t want them to pay fines we want them to fix this problem the lawsuit is intended for them to fix this problem it ll go away when they do or at least make a pledge to do or you know what make a financial allocation and say we re going to fix this problem start by taking action do something and the lawsuits will go away but right now it s our leverage to put pressure on them and to put our state in a position to negotiate not with not only the federal government but with mexico in a position where we can ensure that should we make these investments in fixing this problem that they will uh make the commitment to not raid the funds that are supposed to be used to operate the system and divert them for another use that can happen they can make a commitment and our treaties can be attached to the promise of the mexican government to fund the operational aspect of these improvements that will be made no one has a better understanding of the challenges facing san diego or how to better solve the problems facing the city or the energy to really take up a lot ben hueso q thanks for that thoughtful and thorough answer any other questions no go ahead and give us your elevator pitch your closing statement a where s the elevator music i should have brought a little recorder look this is my city i m never moving and i was born here and this city is in my heart and soul and my neighborhood i m never moving from there and this is where i m raising my family and my kids are in public schools and i hope that in the future they never leave san diego and they find a beautiful city to live in where they can raise their families and have a quality job and get to enjoy beautiful clean beaches and beautiful parks in a city that is safe i want that for my kids i want that for your kids i want that for all kids i want that for all of us no one has a better understanding of the challenges facing san diego or how to better solve the problems facing the city or the energy to really take up a lot and you know every time you take on you make a promise you say i m going to fix it you take a risk you may fail and i m very proud of my track record of taking those issues up and solving them and bringing better resources to my community projects supermarkets libraries parks everything i m very proud of that and i want to continue to work on that for the benefit of not only me and my family but all the people of san diego i think we can do it and i m up to the task q thanks for coming in advertisement a thank you
the financial markets were feeling a bit giddy tuesday as better than expected data show the u s economy might be improving faster than anticipated among other things new housing sales shot up in april and the dollar is gaining strength these positive signs come on the heels of the recently released minutes from the federal reserve meeting in april that show the fed could raise its benchmark interest rate for the second time in six months at its next meeting in june thanks to our sponsors view all sponsors economist diane swonk founder of ds economics thinks there s more than a 50 percent chance that an interest rate hike will come during the june meeting the last time the federal reserve increased interest rates was in december 2015 and that was by a quarter point what we re looking at is another quarter point increase swonk said the fed has been waiting patiently to see when they can move again the important context here is that the fed is looking to ease up on the gas rather than hit the brakes meaning the federal reserve feels confident that the conditions are right to raise rates the fed has a checklist and they ve sort of met their checklist now swonk said the economy looks like it s reaccelerating after a first quarter lull it looks like consumers are doing ok and the housing market in particular is starting to show some signs of real life which is something they want because that has sustainability traction to it though the economy is improving the fed is still treading as if we re on thin ice she said we re still coming off of a very low base and the economy still has a lot of healing to do from the great recession particularly individuals regaining ground lost in terms of their living standards individuals though could benefit from a rate hike i think that it s really important to understand that access to credit cards access to mortgages things that were very difficult during the crisis and frankly for many years now are now starting to pivot swonk said even as rates go up consumers may find they have more access to credit it s only slightly more expensive on the flip side of it savers get a little bit more in their saving although not much we re still talking about extremely low rates uncertainty in global markets and their reactions to a rate hike could impact the u s economy the federal reserve whether they like it or not they re the central bank to the world and many emerging markets particularly in latin america asia south africa all those economies they face a lot of external pressure when the fed starts to raise rates swonk said and the fear is that if things got unstable enough abroad it could come back and haunt us in our own backyard we saw an example of that last august when china surprised and imploded and we saw that effect our financial markets while the federal reserve can t discount the global economy it must prioritize the u s which is why it waited until now for another rate hike according to swonk the federal reserve hopes this rate hike will have a very little impact on the u s economy the hope is that they re able to do this because it s really such a negligible amount that we weather it and we don t trigger too many spillover effects that these emerging markets have had time to prepare and whatever s going to happen abroad is already happening she said it won t make it all that much worse and that our own economy will be able to weather it the discussion continues on chicago tonight joining host eddie arruza to talk about the upcoming meeting and anticipated rate hike are edward

obadiah mailafia in 2019 the global economy witnessed a significant downturn growing by an average of 3 3 per cent during the year down from 3 7 per cent in 2018 average brent crude prices fell from an average of us 71 0 per barrel in 2018 to us64 0 per barrel in 2019 the fall in oil prices reflects not only slow growth in the global economy and demand but also more aggressive production of shale by the united states american shale production rose from 36 4 million barrels in july 2010 to 5 6 million barrels in january 2019 europe accounts for 46 per cent of the nigerian oil market while india accounts for 18 per cent of that market american shale exports have expanded considerably into the european market with all that this implies for nigeria the trade war between the two biggest economies the us and china continued unabated the trump administration continued its sabre rattling in the persian gulf while maintaining its indifference if not hostility towards multilateralism global governance and international policy coordination in the uk boris johnson and the conservatives won the elections by an overwhelming majority in the end of year elections brexit is therefore a foregone conclusion both europe and britain will be competing to enter into trade deals with nigeria to ensure they have a place in our lucrative market for us in nigeria the year 2019 featured the decline of the boko haram insurgency unfortunately it has been obviated by the rising menace of murderous herdsmen militias rural banditry and criminal activities by kidnappers armed robbers and highway gangsters nigeria continues to exhibit the symptoms of a failed state with government showing itself to be either incompetent or incapable of addressing those security challenges the year was yet another landmark in the electoral political cycle in which the ruling apc won with an overwhelming majority in parliament it was one of the worst elections in the history of our fledgling fourth republic if judged by the level of thuggery violence and voter apathy on this occasion the electoral umpire did not convince us that like caesar s wife he was beyond reproach such failings could lead to what political scientists would term a crisis of legitimacy in the emerging political order the overwhelming preponderance of the apc lawmakers in the national assembly has however meant that we can expect a smoother the geopolitical uncertainty accompanying the elections led to some capital flight which led to a downward spiral on the stock exchange during the course of the year the nigerian stock exchange all share index fell by 14 per cent to 27 002 15 inflation fell from 11 44 per cent in december 2018 to 11 31 per cent in february 2019 average inflation for the year stood at 11 3 per cent no doubt a marked improvement although short of the single digit target during the 2019 the mpc cut the monetary policy rate in july by 50 basis points from 14 00 to 13 5 per cent as a means to bolster growth and enhance lending to the real sector the central bank of nigeria continued to reposition itself as a developmental central bank with a more aggressive interventionist policy in the economy intervening robustly in the forex market to stabilise the exchange rate it has also reaffirmed its commitment to enforcing rigorous adherence to the list of items banned from access to the official forex window it also raised the loan to deposit ratio ldr from 60 to 65 all in the effort to release more liquid cash in the commercial banks for the purpose of lending to the smes and to the retail and mortgage industry the 2020 budget was passed in record time on december 5 2019 this would be salutary for budget implementation and for public investments in infrastructure the budget of n10 49tn us 35bn has a deficit of n2 18tn us 7 2bn which is to be financed by internal and external borrowing towards year end the federal government wrote to the national assembly for permission to borrow a staggering us 29 96bn ostensibly to finance infrastructure some of us have warned that such a hefty loan without effective fiscal expenditure controls would only compound the debt repayment challenge which already swallows up 50 per cent of all government revenues the year also saw two telecoms giants mtn nigeria and airtel being listed on the stock exchange but the nse has remained in the doldrums registering a 3 5 in the second to a 12 1 per cent fall in the second and third quarters of the year the year also witnessed the decision by the federal government to increase the national minimum wage from n18 000 to n30 000 several states have however complained that they do not have enough resources to implement it when fully implemented the national minimum wage can be expected to provide a boost to consumer spending while at least cushioning some of the worst effects of poverty on those on the lowest rung of the income bracket in july 2019 nigeria signed up to the afcfta which is expected to boost regional trade in august however we also we went ahead and closed down our land borders it has been estimated that this singular decision has led to a contraction of 1 45 cent in our external trade volume it has also had an inflationary impact on such local staples as rice and stockfish the impact on neighbouring countries has been considerable particularly benin republic togo ghana and niger republic there has been a palpable increase in hostility against nigeria and nigerians among our neighbouring countries it has been estimated that more than 50 per cent of the beninois economy depend on illicit trade across the border with nigeria the local economies of border communities on the nigerian side have also taken a big hit nigeria s customs authorities have claimed that ever since the decision was taken to close the borders they have been making a monthly average of between n4 7bn and n5 8bn more than in previous years the border closure has also meant that nigerian rice farmers will breathe a sigh of relief while local industries will enjoy a respite from smuggling and other illicit trade activities that hamper the local industrial sector in reaction to these events president emmanuel macron of france and alassane ouattara of côte d ivoire announced that the cfa will be transformed into a new eco for west africa this is likely to prove divisive in west africa nigeria will have to be prepared to go it alone if need be the world bank reports that nigeria s growth rate stood at 2 1 per cent for 2019 on account of a defective macroeconomic framework that was not conducive to confidence it forecasts the same figure of 2 1 per cent for 2020 leading up to 2023 unless we take bold steps to improve the business climate bolster national competitiveness and deepen institutional reforms poverty inevitably will worsen the year 2020 may prove to be a difficult one geopolitically for our country the divisions within the ruling party will come to the fore as ambitious politicians jostle to succeed the president major general muhammadu buhari retd in 2023 the opposition pdp is an old whore that is likely to become irrelevant a situation where the government operates a system of exclusion and sinister under handed agenda can only lead to a deepening crisis of legitimacy we also hear that well armed radical islamists are trying to break through a cordon sanitaire in southern mali to gain entry into northwestern nigeria this can only intensify geopolitical tensions while forcing local communities to arm themselves in self defence in imitation of amotekun in the south west nigeria the omens are bad to echo the german sociologist max weber ahead of us is not the bliss of summer but a dark and icy winter we must

the coming decade will show whether the bonds keeping the twenty seven member states together are able to endure a new geopolitical setting and help them define a common vision the european union finds itself in the most perilous quandary sine the immediate post world war ii period the risk is a split between the central european and eastern european member states and the majority of the others over a diverging interest the changing u s world outlook in particular its european policy may play a decisive role to weather the storm five major challenges calling for determined leadership clear visions and statecraft must be overcome brexit the first one is to negotiate the future relationship between britain and the eu the eu will reject a deal with a neighboring country using low taxes low labor standards lavish state aids and subsidies and a soft regulatory framework for the environment safety etc to enhance its competitive position in reality access to the single market with seven of its ten top export markets requires britain to shadow eu rules without participating in decisionmaking that will be hard to swallow as the obvious question is why did we leave if we have to apply the eu ruleset anyway britain says prices on its products sold in the eu will go up and barriers may arise for its financial sector which accounts for 10 percent of its total export to the eu concluding free trade agreements with other countries will be more difficult as they may ask for less stringent rules than applied by the eu forcing britain to choose between the eu rule set and what third countries demand that is likely to happen for agriculture and food in a free trade agreement with the united states the eu will not allow american agriculture and foods with lower standards to enter its market via britain inside britain devolution means that a trade deal with the eu might have to be approved by the british parliament and by the scottish parliament the door opens for exacting concessions about more powers to be transferred from westminster to edinburgh or even a second referendum about seceding from great britain the border between northern ireland and the republic of ireland will take up time and attention for the first time ever nationalists got more votes than the unionists pro britain raising the prospect of northern ireland following the scottish example carbon neutral and recycling the second one is the plan for a european green deal the basic idea is to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and not to emit more greenhouse gasses than is absorbed for all twenty seven member states the eu is already on its way as greenhouse gas emissions in 2018 were 23 percent lower than the 1990 level closing in on the interim target of halving emissions by 2030 several of the central european and eastern european countries that depend on coal for energy supply will struggle to meet this target getting there will be expensive an additional investment of euro 260 billion equal to 1 5 percent of eu gross domestic product gdp is necessary to meet the interim 2030 target and much more looking to 2050 it is envisaged to mobilize the private sector through a forthcoming green financing strategy there may be a repercussion on trade issues as the eu has let it be known that its energy intensive industries might be protected against imports from other countries with less stringent emission rules by a border tax these ambitions do not however stop with a green deal some years ago the eu launched a program about a circular economy which in its first phase introduces strong incentives to recycle waste aiming at getting to a point where the eu will be able to recycle all waste or close to all waste multiannual financial framework mff 2021 2027 the eu s annual budget follows seven years of multiannual financial frameworks the next one covers 2021 2027 its negotiating and approval constitutes the third challenge currently the budget amounts to about 1 percent of eu gdp for the next mff the european commission asks for an increase to 1 114 percent while the european parliament proposes 1 3 percent these two institutions take part in the decision process about the mff and the annual budget but ultimately the member states decide eu has cut expenditure on traditional policies with agriculture as the prime example its share will be reduced to 30 percent compared to 37 percent for 2019 and 70 percent in 1985 despite economies however the new programs about competitiveness economic social and territorial cohesion and the carbon neutral program can hardly be squeezed in without an increase of the total budget basically it is a question of how much the richer member states in northwestern europe is willing to pay for a reorientation of the eu the poorer member states in southern europe and most of the central european and eastern european member states recognize that the richer member states are net contributors to the budget but point out that they benefit much more from the single market than they do the snag is that a net contributor or net recipient is clearly visible while the benefits flowing from the single market is much more difficult to quantify common foreign and security policy and common foreign trade policy the fourth one is to turn the embryonic common foreign and security policy cfsp into a genuine common policy president donald trump has been busy demanding renegotiations of trade deals or launching trade wars so far the eu has escaped his wrath but for how long with boris johnson regarded as a political twin as prime minister of britain and the lull in the trade war with china there are considerable risks that trump will shift his attention to the eu he thrives by crisis and few things are more popular in america than blaming other countries for economic difficulties the different attitudes towards climate change may raise a fire on trade especially if the eu implements a border tax against the united states pointing to its less stringent environmental regulation eu member states are trying to confront the problem of how to react inside the framework of the common foreign trade policy the united states will undoubtedly try to play member states against one another by introducing tariffs against sensitive sectors in some member states and keeping others out of the foresight those escaping tariffs will be told that the price is to stop the eu from retaliating the central european and eastern european countries may be targeted the majority see the united states and not the eu as guaranteeing their security vis à vis russia who they fear still harbor dreams of reestablishing a degree of influence if not control over this part of europe they are not prepared to run the risk of antagonizing the united states after russia annexed crimea march 2014 the eu adopted sanctions and maintains a common attitude towards russia but not without costs for some member states being traditional exporters to russia experience shows that over time sanctions suffer from fatigue and there are signs that some member states feel the time has come to loosen up and test whether some kind of living together with russia is possible if such efforts are launched and they probably will in the not so distant future then solidarity will be tested this was visible when the gas pipeline nord stream 2 under the baltic sea was negotiated its purpose is to transport natural gas from russia into europe and in particular germany by circumventing the land routes via central and eastern europe including ukraine central european and eastern european countries fear that russia might use the new pipeline to cut them off from traditional supplies over the last five to ten years a seminal change has been visible in the u s stance towards china from seeing its involvement in economic globalization as almost exclusively positive there is now an emerging consensus that china is a competitor and a potential threat that gained access to u s high tech on the cheap a threat that must be stopped european leaders now voice similar concerns only a few days ago a plan surfaced to look into state owned companies read chinese ones investment in the eu investigating whether they enjoy state aids a number of member states primarily in central europe and eastern europe have attracted large investments from china which has helped stimulate economic growth they may resist measures which china will perceive as questioning the future relationship deepening the integration the fifth challenge is to strengthen the eurozone a common defense protect the external border and ensure that all member states adhere to the principles underpinning the integration the eurozone is for the time being doing quite well and a considerable strengthening has taken place since the outbreak of the global financial crisis 2008 09 it is however clear that it has still not found a shape where it is beyond doubt that it can further economic growth and withstand a new financial crisis should it come europe still depends on the united states for its defense as most nations only spend between 1 and 1 5 percent of gdp on defense what s more is that despite strenuous efforts over many years no european structure has been built to frame a common defense

mcc agreement clauses how detrimental are they to sri lanka by shenali waduge mcc has been in the news for all the wrong reasons it is important that we are all aware of the clauses and demands as well as commitments made by govt and officials and question some of these assurances completely overlooking the concerns of the public the future interest of the nation as well as future generations no agreement can or should be signed overlooking long term repercussions that will impact on future generations and the sovereignty of a nation millennium challenge compact signatories are us govt gosl mcc acting on behalf of us govt min of finance acting on behalf of sl govt mcc agreement has 8 articles as contents goal objectives funding resources implementation communications termination suspension expiration compact annexes amendments governing law entry into force additional government covenants there are 5 annexes program description multi year financial plan summary compact monitoring evaluation summary conditions precedent to disbursement of compact cdf definitions preamble this millennium challenge compact compact is between the usa acting through the millennium challenge corporation a us government corporation mcc and the gosl acting through the ministry of finance the government individually party and collectively the parties comment does this mean that all interests of sri lanka are to be undertaken by the ministry of finance the finance minister recitals recalling that the government consulted with the private sector and civil society of sri lanka to determine the priorities for the use of mcc assistance and developed and submitted to mcc a proposal for such assistance to achieve fasting economic growth and poverty reduction comment why didn t the ministry of finance consult line ministries impacted by mcc in particular the defense ministry the armed forces police heads and their senior legal officers as well as land law experts article 1 section 1 1 b to increase the availability of information on private land and under utilized state lands in order to increase land market activity comment increase land market activity for whom why information on private land article 2 section 2 2 compact cdf upon the signing of this compact mcc shall grant to the government under the terms of the compact and in addition to the program funding described in section 2 1 an amount not to exceed thirty two million five hundred thousand united states dollars us 32 500 compact cdf under section 609 g of the mcc act of 2003 as amended mca act for use by the government to facilitate implementation of this compact including for the following purposes financial management procurement activities administrative activities staff salaries administrative support rent computers it or capital equipment monitoring and evaluation activities feasibility design and other project preparatory studies activities to facilitate compact implementation as requested by government approved by mcc comment mcc is giving the funds to mca not the gosl mcc is going to directly administer funds and it is going to be directly audited by us what is the role of the gosl in this bilateral agreement section 2 2 f without limiting the generality of section 2 2 a the government agrees that mcc shall directly administer and manage a portion of the compact cdf for the purpose of undertaking one or more feasibility studies for the transport project as may be agreed in writing by the parties mcc contracted compact cdf activities notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this compact or the program implementation agreement mcc shall utilize applicable united states government procurement rules and regulations in any procurement it administers and manages in connection with mcc contracted compact cdf activities and shall disburse compact cdf from time to time for the mcc contracted compact cdf activities directly to the relevant providers upon receipt of value invoices approved by mcc comment on what basis is the gosl agreeing to allow mcc to directly administer and manage compact cdf how much is this portion which is not mentioned how compatible is us govt procurement rules with procurement rules applied by sri lanka sri lanka follows standard fidic procurement rules regulations is fidic compatible with us procurement or vice versa has sri lanka studied us procurement procedures before accepting that us procurement procedures would apply to mcc compact agreement if sri lankan team did study us procurement against fidic procurement where is that report what is this program implementation agreement pia why is that not made available how can an agreement be signed without first looking at pia clauses which may either conflict or incorporate detrimental acts that must first be looked into before signing a bilateral agreement section 2 4 disbursement in accordance with this compact and the program implementation agreement mcc shall disburse mcc funding for expenditures incurred in furtherance of the program each instance a disbursement subject to the satisfaction of all applicable conditions precedent the proceeds of disbursement shall be made available to the government at mcc s sole election by deposit to one or more bank accounts established by the government and acceptable to mcc each a permitted account or direct payment to the relevant provider of goods works or service for the implementation of the program mcc funding may be expended only for program expenditure comment if this is supposed to be a mutual agreement why is it that gosl has to simply agree to all that the us govt through mcc private corporation demands selection of bank amounts disbursed etc why is the money going to a private bank why is it not being designated in the agreement us govt is disbursing this amount directly to mca account in a private bank in a foreign country but according to the agreement the finance ministry on behalf of the gosl has to be accountable though the funds are directly sent by us govt to the mca account what is the role of the central bank is the money coming through the central bank of sl page 6 section 2 6 a why is gosl committing to providing all funds other resources and to take all other actions necessary to carry out the government s responsibilities when the grant is supposed to cover entire project our questions what does gosl imply by agreeing to provide all funds what does the gosl imply by agreeing to provide other resources what does the gosl imply by agreeing to take all other actions necessary what are the gosl s responsibilities under taken by mcc are gosl s responsibilities that which the citizens of sri lanka requested the parliament of sri lanka has requested the judiciary of sri lanka has approved of or are these responsibilities that the mcc officials have pushed through various government officials and subject ministers as well as private lobby groups tasked to somehow push mcc into reality shouldn t the gosl demand the entire program activity and the powers of the new company before it agrees to consider signing the mcc it doesn t matter what the govt in power is can any govt consider signing an agreement with a foreign govt without examining the documents and considering the legal implications of signing such section 2 7 limitations to the use of mcc funding the government shall ensure that mcc funding is not used for any purpose that would violate united states law or policy as specified in this compact or as further notified to the government in writing including but not limited to the following purposes for assistance or training of the military police militia national guard or other quasi military organization or unit for any activity that is likely to cause a substantial loss of us jobs or a substantial displacement of us production comment this means that mcc or the united states government over a period of 5 years in which the compact is valid can issue demands in writing to which the government of sri lanka is bound to adhere but does not know can gosl sign such an open ended agreement though 2 7a says that mcc funding cannot be used for national army police etc it is contradicted in the transport project details where gosl has to compensate as per 2 7 b gosl that is the tax payer has to end up paying for loss of us jobs and us production and it is not even specified how many jobs lost or how much of loss of production section 2 8 taxes unless the parties specifically agree otherwise in writing the government shall ensure that all mcc funding is free from the payment or imposition of any existing or future taxes duties levies contributions or other similar charges but not fees or charges for services that are generally applicable in sri lanka reasonable amount and imposed on a non discriminatory basis taxes of or in sri lanka including any such taxes imposed by a national regional local or other governmental or taxing authority of or in sri lanka specifically and without limiting the generality of the foregoing mcc funding shall be free from the payment of any tariffs customs duties import taxes export taxes and other similar charges on any goods works or services introduced into sri lanka in connection with the program sales tax value added tax excise tax property transfer tax and other similar charges on any transactions involving goods works or services in connection with the program taxes and other similar charges on ownership possession or use of any property in connection with the program taxes and other similar charges on income profits or gross receipts attributable to work performed in connection with the program and related social security taxes and other similar charges on all natural or legal persons performing work in connection with the program except in the case of this clause iv 1 natural persons who are citizens or permanent residents of sri lanka 2 legal persons formed under the laws of sri lanka c if a tax has been paid contrary to the requirements of section 2 8 a or annex v the government shall refund promptly to mcc or to another party as designated by mcc the amount of such tax in us dollars or the currency of sri lanka within sixty 60 days in writing whether by mcc or mca sri lanka that such tax has been paid failure to refund such amount within the specified time shall result in interest accruing on the unpaid amount in accordance with section 5 4 comment our understanding is that mcc is giving 480m to improve our land and transport system while it is natural that a grant amount is not charged any taxes levies why is there such an in depth detail that sri lanka shall ensure that mcc funding shall be free from payment of a series of taxes once signed as well as in the future so far every clause has restrictions limitations only on gosl though this agreement looks simple enough what about the other cabinet papers passed all linked to the mcc pre conditions ex 160m parcel fabric map land surveying given to trimble navigation us firm for 154m there are likely to be many more cabinet approved projects already rolled out as part of mcc preconditions which the public are not privy too the former prime minister minister of finance has to be held responsible for these secret provisions using tax payers money why is 2 7 c mcc s environmental guidelines also mentioned in limitation to mcc funding does mcc funding not fund environmental issues d under limitation to mcc funding referring to paying for abortions why should such be included article 3 implementation section 3 1 program implementation agreement the parties shall enter into an agreement providing further detail on the implementation arrangements fiscal accountability and disbursement and use of mcc funding among other matters the program implementation agreement or pia and the government shall implement the program in accordance with this compact the pia any other supplemental agreement and any implementation letter comment this means the mcc agreement is not an exclusive agreement but is linked with 3 other sets of agreements program implementation agreement other supplemental agreements implementation letters does the gosl know what these separate agreements their contents are why are the contents of these not made public section 3 2 government responsibilities the government has principal responsibility for overseeing and managing the implementation of the program the designation of mca sri lanka to act on behalf of the government contemplated by section 3 2 b below does not relieve the government of any obligations or responsibilities hereunder or under any related agreement for which the government remains fully responsible with the prior consent of mcc the government shall designate an entity to be established as a company limited by guarantee under sri lanka s companies act no7 of 2007 as the accountable entity to implement the program and to exercise and perform the government s right obligation to oversee manage and implement the program including without limitation managing the implementation of the projects and their activities allocating resources and managing procurements such entity shall be referred to herein as mca sri lanka and shall have the authority to act on behalf of the government with regard to all program activities any provision of this compact obligation mca sri lanka to take any action or refrain from taking any action as the case may be means that the government shall cause mca sri lanka to take such action or refrain from taking such action as the case may be the government hereby also designates mca sri lanka to exercise and perform the government s right obligation to oversee manage and implement the activities described in the amended and restated grant implementation agreement date june 18 2018 as amended between the government and mcc cdf agreement mcc hereby acknowledges and consents to the designation in this section 3 2b d the government shall take all necessary or appropriate steps to achieve the project objectives during the compact term including without limiting section 2 6 a funding all costs that exceed mcc funding and are required to carry out the terms hereof and achieve such objectives unless mcc agrees otherwise in writing comment this reads like a treasury operating within a treasury wherein sri lanka s finance ministry is giving full power of attorney to a us governmental company registered as a company in sri lanka which is superior to a sovereign government or rather the sovereign government is abdicating sovereignty to a us governmental company in sri lanka is this not a violation of article 1 4 of the constitution where is this 28 june 2018 agreement what are the changes in that agreement how can mca sri lanka a company be given authority to act on behalf of a government according to 3 2 d the gosl has to even fund anything exceeding the mcc funding and how is gosl going to generate any income if everything coming into sri lanka and going out of sri lanka under this project is tax free and without levies while state land ends up privatized leaving gosl no source of income from sovereign land section 3 3 policy performance in addition to undertaking the specific policy legal and regulatory reform commitments identified in annex 1 the government shall seek to maintain and to improve its level of performance under the policy criteria identified in section 607 of the mca act and the selection criteria and methodology used by mcc comment what is this section 607 of the mca act who in the gosl or ministry of finance has seen this before agreeing to sign any agreement section 3 5 implementation letters from time to time mcc may provide guidance to the government in writing on any matters relating to this compact mcc funding or implementation of the program the government shall use such guidance in implementing the program the parties may also issue jointly agreed upon writings to confirm and record their mutual understanding on aspects related to the implementation of this compact the pta or other related agreements both type of writings are referred to herein as implementation letters comment so in other words mcc agreement is an open ended agreement because gosl has to be dancing to the tune of something called implementation letters which binds the gosl to act upon them whether these letters come daily weekly monthly we do not know section 3 6 procurement and grants the government shall ensure that the procurement of all goods works and services by the government or any provider to implement the program shall be in accordance with mcc s program procurement guidelines mcc program procurement guidelines accordingly neither the government procurement guidelines 2006 nor any other laws or regulations of sri lanka regarding procurement shall apply to procurements to implement the program comment what are mcc program procurement guidelines are they the same as us govt procurement guidelines that sri lanka was asked to follow in an earlier clause why should sri lanka govt procurement guidelines be totally abolished simply to satisfy a grant project how can sri lanka have parallel procurement procedures section 3 7 records accounting covered providers access government books records the government shall maintain and shall use its best efforts to ensure that all covered providers maintain accounting books records documents and other evidence relating to the program adequate to show to mcc s satisfaction the use of all mcc funding and the implementation and results of

representatives engaged by mcc or the government to conduct any assessment review or evaluation of the program the opportunity to audit review evaluate or inspect facilities assets and activities funded in whole or in part by mcc funding comment a if mcc is setting up a company in sri lanka where funding is directly coming shouldn t this office be keeping a track of all matters related to its program funding why should mcc private company have any right to look into government books b what is this accepted accounting principles prevailing in the united states do these contradict with sri lanka c why should the gosl permit a private company to inspect its facilitites d if mca is delegated powers why should mcc appoint a inspector general of mcc how can a us state entity be broaching through records of a sovereign country section 3 8 audit reviews government audits except as the parties may agree otherwise in writing the government shall on at least a semi annual basis conduct or cause to be conducted financial audits of all disbursements of mcc funding covering the period from signing of this compact until the earlier of the following march 31 or september 30 and covering

government chooses as auditor have the sri lankan negotiators looked and studied the audit guidelines program implementation agreement before agreeing even in principle to the project what are these audit guidelines and do they conflict with the government audit guidelines b why so much of us audit guidelines when money is being disbursed not to gosl but to mca sri lanka a private company have all these areas been studied and looked at by sri lankan officials well the national economic council have made it clear that the sri lanka government should not sign the mcc for socio economic political reasons d if mca is set up to channel funding why should mcc arrange audits of the government e how much of mcc funding is allocated for audits and what is the likelihood of gosl having to

national security interests of us vi if sri lanka is ineligible for foreign assistance due to foreign assistance act of 1961 vii if govt is engaged in activities inconsistent with mca act viii if govt or person or entity receiving mcc funding is convicted of narcotic offences or engaged in drug drufficking comment a while it says either party can terminate compact giving 30 days written notice mcc only can terminate giving 30 days notice b why is all the obligations and commitments on the part of sri lanka only section 5 2 consequences of termination suspension expiration if compact or mcc funding is suspended or terminated in whole or part provisions of pia shall govern the post suspension post termination or post expiration treatment of mcc funding any related disbursements program assets if compact mcc funding pia or any other supplemental agreement is not suspended or terminated it remains in full force effect mcc may reinstate any suspended or terminated mcc funding comment this means sri lanka if terminating or suspending any mcc related agreement it must ensure all docs are terminated otherwise those agreements remain in force what are the provisions in the programme implementation agreement why has this not been made public section 5 4 late payment interest if the government fails to pay any amount under this compact or the program implementation agreement when due including amounts under section 2 8 c and 5 3 a the government shall pay interest on such past due amount interest shall accrue on such amount at a rate equal to the then current us treasury current value of funds rate calculated on a daily basis and a 360 day year from the due date of such payment until such amount is paid in full any such payment shall first be credited against interest due and once the interest due amount is extinguished then payments shall be credited against outstanding principal comment firstly we are all under the impression that this 480m was an absolute grant with no strings attached a gift horse we are told but now section 5 4 says otherwise this is what the us envoy told the ceylon chamber of commerce in june 2019 the united states has offered the government and people of sri lanka a 480 million grant a gift not a loan but a gift from the people of the united states this is not a loan that might mortgage the future of the country what is this amount the govt is due to give under mcc compact pia section 2 8 c says mcc funding cannot be used by the govt that violates mcc environmental guidelines what are these guidelines have the govt looked at these before agreeing to them section 5 3 a says if mcc funding interest or earnings any program asset is used for any purpose in violation of terms of compact gosl may have to repay mcc in usd the value of misused mcc funding interest earnings or asset plus interest in accordance with section 5 4 within 30 days after mcc makes formal request from the gosl mcc funding or program asset cannot be used to make such payment section 5 5 survival this section lists out govt s responsibilities which also covers sections 2 7 limitations on use of mcc funding section 2 8 taxes section 3 7 records accounting covered providers access section 3 8 audits reviews section 3 9 intellectual property section 5 2 consequences of termination suspensions or expirations section 5 3 refunds violation section 5 4 late payment interest and section 6 4 governing law the govt is thus bound by section 6 4 comment section 6 4 says this compact is an international agreement shall be governed by international law what does this mean does sri lanka need to amend its laws to be on par with all international laws there s a list of international treaties that us has not signed or ratified are us laws compatible with international laws if not which applies in case of mcc vis a vis sri lanka section 6 4 governing law mcc agreement is an international agreement and shall be governed by international law comment mca sri lanka the company to be set up after signing mcc is to be legally immune from all wrong doing but sri lankan government is not immune mca sri lanka can go to courts against sri lanka govt citizens but sri lankan govt citizens cannot take mca sri lanka to court how can a locally registered company not be subject to sri lankan laws but international laws simply because an agreement states so there is all possibility of sri lanka being taken to international court tribunal if mcc is signed and gosl backs out of any commitments or assurances given most of which are revealed earlier are unclear undisclosed should any govt be allowed to commit sri lanka to such future international arbitration which will be borne not by govt making the mistake or by officials signing but ordinary tax payers footing millions of dollars as compensation when international law is being applied and sri lanka by signing mcc commits to that no amount of political drama and theatrics will allow sri lanka s government to renegade from the agreement it will be subject to international law and sri lanka if going back on its word will end up in an international court and charged heavily do we want to go through with all this just for a paltry 480m when we are likely to end up paying millions more after realizing the dangers or rather facing the dangers once mcc is signed section 6 6 references to mcc website references in compact pia or any other agreement entered into in connection with compact document information notified by posting on mcc website shall be deemed reference to such document or information as updated or substituted on mcc website from time to time comment does this mean that sri lanka will have to place someone 24 7 to be looking at the mcc website to see what updates have been placed as that is deemed as latest updated information section 6 8 mcc status mcc is a us govt corporation acting on behalf of the us govt in its implementation of this compact mcc the us govt assume no liability for any claims or loss arising out of activities or omission under this compact the govt waives any and all claims against mcc or the us govt or any current or former officer or employees of mcc or the us govt for all loss damage injury or death arising out of activities or omissions under this compact and agrees that it shall not bring any claim or legal proceeding of any kind against any of the above entities or persons for any such loss damage injury or death the govt agrees that mcc or the us govt or any current or former officer or employees of mcc or the us govt shall be immune from the jurisdiction of all courts and tribunals of sri lanka or any claim or loss arising out activities or omissions under this compact comment section 6 8 clearly establishes that mcc is a us govt entity and forming mca would be allowing us to open a us govt office in sri lanka allowing it to even audit sri lankan govt what s more as per this section mcc us govt are immune from all liabilities including loss damage injury or death in any court or tribunals in sri lanka so where is the law of reciprocity as applicable under international law which section 6 4 refers to this immunity taken together with immunity given to us troops personnel and contractors under acsa and sofa mean that us can do anything in sri lanka and sri lanka cannot take any legal action against it for 480 is this worth it see unfair contract terms act 26 of 1997 imposes limits on the extent to which civil liability for breach of contract or for negligence or other breach of duty can be avoided by means of contract terms and otherwise article 7 entry into force 7 1 domestic procedures the government shall proceed in a timely manner to complete all of its domestic requirements for this compact and pia to enter into force the parties understand that consistent with sri lankan law prior to the government sending the letter described in section 7 3 this compact is to be submitted to and enacted by the parliament of sri lanka comment we are under the impression 480 is a gift by us to the people of sri lanka if so why does the gosl have to complete all of its domestic requirements to enforce compact pia what are these domestic requirements what is this letter that the gosl has to send described in section 7 3 if mcc is giving a gift of 480m why should the mcc agreement have to be enacted by parliament according to the congressional notification transmittal sheet dated 25th april 2019 requests funds to be made ready in 15 days this was days after easter sunday terrorist attacks 480m is to be given across 5 years land project the government has prepared two draft legislative acts that seek to 1 convert permits and grants to state lands to absolute land grants that allow permit holders to sell or lease their land or use it as collateral with few restrictions and 2 create a data base that gathers information on state lands and facilitates investment in underutilized state lands prior to enactment of these acts the government must address legislative gaps focused on decentralizing authority for the approval of absolute land grants simplifying procedures and ensuring gender equality in the issuance of absolute land grants among other issues clearly indicates what mcc plan is further observations is the circulated map of an economic corridor which had been part of a mcc presentation shown by mcc in temple trees where in the said economic corridor 5miles to left 5 miles to right of railway line gives extent of 1 2million acres 200miles x 10miles is to cover the very districts that the mcc is proposing to digitalize and where the state is said to be currently rolling out accelerated title registrations in with railways leased out via state land bank act through the megapolis ministry the mcc or us allies can lease area for 100 100 years the previous government has already given 1million title deeds to people and in their poverty and loan hardship the opportunity and risk to sell their lands to foreign investors is a threat to sri lanka s national security agriculture and livelihood leaving all of the detrimental clauses and concerns aside what is even more worrying is sri lanka s own land laws still subject to colonial statutes sudden and impulsive cabinet changes circular approvals provincial council malpractices etc all of which are undermining sri lanka s ability to uphold its sovereignty vis a vis foreign agreements that seek to establish ventures in sri lanka should sri lanka not address these internal issues first before going and landing up with bigger issues and international litigation ignoring such shenali d waduge

mcc agreement clauses how detrimental are they to sri lanka by shenali waduge mcc has been in the news for all the wrong reasons it is important that we are all aware of the clauses and demands as well as commitments made by govt and officials and question some of these assurances completely overlooking the concerns of the public the future interest of the nation as well as future generations no agreement can or should be signed overlooking long term repercussions that will impact on future generations and the sovereignty of a nation millennium challenge compact signatories are us govt gosl mcc acting on behalf of us govt min of finance acting on behalf of sl govt mcc agreement has 8 articles as contents goal objectives funding resources implementation communications termination suspension expiration compact annexes amendments governing law entry into force additional government covenants there are 5 annexes program description multi year financial plan summary compact monitoring evaluation summary conditions precedent to disbursement of compact cdf definitions preamble this millennium challenge compact compact is between the usa acting through the millennium challenge corporation a us government corporation mcc and the gosl acting through the ministry of finance the government individually party and collectively the parties comment does this mean that all interests of sri lanka are to be undertaken by the ministry of finance the finance minister recitals recalling that the government consulted with the private sector and civil society of sri lanka to determine the priorities for the use of mcc assistance and developed and submitted to mcc a proposal for such assistance to achieve fasting economic growth and poverty reduction comment why didn t the ministry of finance consult line ministries impacted by mcc in particular the defense ministry the armed forces police heads and their senior legal officers as well as land law experts article 1 section 1 1 b to increase the availability of information on private land and under utilized state lands in order to increase land market activity comment increase land market activity for whom why information on private land article 2 section 2 2 compact cdf upon the signing of this compact mcc shall grant to the government under the terms of the compact and in addition to the program funding described in section 2 1 an amount not to exceed thirty two million five hundred thousand united states dollars us 32 500 compact cdf under section 609 g of the mcc act of 2003 as amended mca act for use by the government to facilitate implementation of this compact including for the following purposes financial management procurement activities administrative activities staff salaries administrative support rent computers it or capital equipment monitoring and evaluation activities feasibility design and other project preparatory studies activities to facilitate compact implementation as requested by government approved by mcc comment mcc is giving the funds to mca not the gosl mcc is going to directly administer funds and it is going to be directly audited by us what is the role of the gosl in this bilateral agreement section 2 2 f without limiting the generality of section 2 2 a the government agrees that mcc shall directly administer and manage a portion of the compact cdf for the purpose of undertaking one or more feasibility studies for the transport project as may be agreed in writing by the parties mcc contracted compact cdf activities notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this compact or the program implementation agreement mcc shall utilize applicable united states government procurement rules and regulations in any procurement it administers and manages in connection with mcc contracted compact cdf activities and shall disburse compact cdf from time to time for the mcc contracted compact cdf activities directly to the relevant providers upon receipt of value invoices approved by mcc comment on what basis is the gosl agreeing to allow mcc to directly administer and manage compact cdf how much is this portion which is not mentioned how compatible is us govt procurement rules with procurement rules applied by sri lanka sri lanka follows standard fidic procurement rules regulations is fidic compatible with us procurement or vice versa has sri lanka studied us procurement procedures before accepting that us procurement procedures would apply to mcc compact agreement if sri lankan team did study us procurement against fidic procurement where is that report what is this program implementation agreement pia why is that not made available how can an agreement be signed without first looking at pia clauses which may either conflict or incorporate detrimental acts that must first be looked into before signing a bilateral agreement section 2 4 disbursement in accordance with this compact and the program implementation agreement mcc shall disburse mcc funding for expenditures incurred in furtherance of the program each instance a disbursement subject to the satisfaction of all applicable conditions precedent the proceeds of disbursement shall be made available to the government at mcc s sole election by deposit to one or more bank accounts established by the government and acceptable to mcc each a permitted account or direct payment to the relevant provider of goods works or service for the implementation of the program mcc funding may be expended only for program expenditure comment if this is supposed to be a mutual agreement why is it that gosl has to simply agree to all that the us govt through mcc private corporation demands selection of bank amounts disbursed etc why is the money going to a private bank why is it not being designated in the agreement us govt is disbursing this amount directly to mca account in a private bank in a foreign country but according to the agreement the finance ministry on behalf of the gosl has to be accountable though the funds are directly sent by us govt to the mca account what is the role of the central bank is the money coming through the central bank of sl page 6 section 2 6 a why is gosl committing to providing all funds other resources and to take all other actions necessary to carry out the government s responsibilities when the grant is supposed to cover entire project our questions what does gosl imply by agreeing to provide all funds what does the gosl imply by agreeing to provide other resources what does the gosl imply by agreeing to take all other actions necessary what are the gosl s responsibilities under taken by mcc are gosl s responsibilities that which the citizens of sri lanka requested the parliament of sri lanka has requested the judiciary of sri lanka has approved of or are these responsibilities that the mcc officials have pushed through various government officials and subject ministers as well as private lobby groups tasked to somehow push mcc into reality shouldn t the gosl demand the entire program activity and the powers of the new company before it agrees to consider signing the mcc it doesn t matter what the govt in power is can any govt consider signing an agreement with a foreign govt without examining the documents and considering the legal implications of signing such section 2 7 limitations to the use of mcc funding the government shall ensure that mcc funding is not used for any purpose that would violate united states law or policy as specified in this compact or as further notified to the government in writing including but not limited to the following purposes for assistance or training of the military police militia national guard or other quasi military organization or unit for any activity that is likely to cause a substantial loss of us jobs or a substantial displacement of us production comment this means that mcc or the united states government over a period of 5 years in which the compact is valid can issue demands in writing to which the government of sri lanka is bound to adhere but does not know can gosl sign such an open ended agreement though 2 7a says that mcc funding cannot be used for national army police etc it is contradicted in the transport project details where gosl has to compensate as per 2 7 b gosl that is the tax payer has to end up paying for loss of us jobs and us production and it is not even specified how many jobs lost or how much of loss of production section 2 8 taxes unless the parties specifically agree otherwise in writing the government shall ensure that all mcc funding is free from the payment or imposition of any existing or future taxes duties levies contributions or other similar charges but not fees or charges for services that are generally applicable in sri lanka reasonable amount and imposed on a non discriminatory basis taxes of or in sri lanka including any such taxes imposed by a national regional local or other governmental or taxing authority of or in sri lanka specifically and without limiting the generality of the foregoing mcc funding shall be free from the payment of any tariffs customs duties import taxes export taxes and other similar charges on any goods works or services introduced into sri lanka in connection with the program sales tax value added tax excise tax property transfer tax and other similar charges on any transactions involving goods works or services in connection with the program taxes and other similar charges on ownership possession or use of any property in connection with the program taxes and other similar charges on income profits or gross receipts attributable to work performed in connection with the program and related social security taxes and other similar charges on all natural or legal persons performing work in connection with the program except in the case of this clause iv 1 natural persons who are citizens or permanent residents of sri lanka 2 legal persons formed under the laws of sri lanka c if a tax has been paid contrary to the requirements of section 2 8 a or annex v the government shall refund promptly to mcc or to another party as designated by mcc the amount of such tax in us dollars or the currency of sri lanka within sixty 60 days in writing whether by mcc or mca sri lanka that such tax has been paid failure to refund such amount within the specified time shall result in interest accruing on the unpaid amount in accordance with section 5 4 comment our understanding is that mcc is giving 480m to improve our land and transport system while it is natural that a grant amount is not charged any taxes levies why is there such an in depth detail that sri lanka shall ensure that mcc funding shall be free from payment of a series of taxes once signed as well as in the future so far every clause has restrictions limitations only on gosl though this agreement looks simple enough what about the other cabinet papers passed all linked to the mcc pre conditions ex 160m parcel fabric map land surveying given to trimble navigation us firm for 154m there are likely to be many more cabinet approved projects already rolled out as part of mcc preconditions which the public are not privy too the former prime minister minister of finance has to be held responsible for these secret provisions using tax payers money why is 2 7 c mcc s environmental guidelines also mentioned in limitation to mcc funding does mcc funding not fund environmental issues d under limitation to mcc funding referring to paying for abortions why should such be included article 3 implementation section 3 1 program implementation agreement the parties shall enter into an agreement providing further detail on the implementation arrangements fiscal accountability and disbursement and use of mcc funding among other matters the program implementation agreement or pia and the government shall implement the program in accordance with this compact the pia any other supplemental agreement and any implementation letter comment this means the mcc agreement is not an exclusive agreement but is linked with 3 other sets of agreements program implementation agreement other supplemental agreements implementation letters does the gosl know what these separate agreements their contents are why are the contents of these not made public section 3 2 government responsibilities the government has principal responsibility for overseeing and managing the implementation of the program the designation of mca sri lanka to act on behalf of the government contemplated by section 3 2 b below does not relieve the government of any obligations or responsibilities hereunder or under any related agreement for which the government remains fully responsible with the prior consent of mcc the government shall designate an entity to be established as a company limited by guarantee under sri lanka s companies act no7 of 2007 as the accountable entity to implement the program and to exercise and perform the government s right obligation to oversee manage and implement the program including without limitation managing the implementation of the projects and their activities allocating resources and managing procurements such entity shall be referred to herein as mca sri lanka and shall have the authority to act on behalf of the government with regard to all program activities any provision of this compact obligation mca sri lanka to take any action or refrain from taking any action as the case may be means that the government shall cause mca sri lanka to take such action or refrain from taking such action as the case may be the government hereby also designates mca sri lanka to exercise and perform the government s right obligation to oversee manage and implement the activities described in the amended and restated grant implementation agreement date june 18 2018 as amended between the government and mcc cdf agreement mcc hereby acknowledges and consents to the designation in this section 3 2b d the government shall take all necessary or appropriate steps to achieve the project objectives during the compact term including without limiting section 2 6 a funding all costs that exceed mcc funding and are required to carry out the terms hereof and achieve such objectives unless mcc agrees otherwise in writing comment this reads like a treasury operating within a treasury wherein sri lanka s finance ministry is giving full power of attorney to a us governmental company registered as a company in sri lanka which is superior to a sovereign government or rather the sovereign government is abdicating sovereignty to a us governmental company in sri lanka is this not a violation of article 1 4 of the constitution where is this 28 june 2018 agreement what are the changes in that agreement how can mca sri lanka a company be given authority to act on behalf of a government according to 3 2 d the gosl has to even fund anything exceeding the mcc funding and how is gosl going to generate any income if everything coming into sri lanka and going out of sri lanka under this project is tax free and without levies while state land ends up privatized leaving gosl no source of income from sovereign land section 3 3 policy performance in addition to undertaking the specific policy legal and regulatory reform commitments identified in annex 1 the government shall seek to maintain and to improve its level of performance under the policy criteria identified in section 607 of the mca act and the selection criteria and methodology used by mcc comment what is this section 607 of the mca act who in the gosl or ministry of finance has seen this before agreeing to sign any agreement section 3 5 implementation letters from time to time mcc may provide guidance to the government in writing on any matters relating to this compact mcc funding or implementation of the program the government shall use such guidance in implementing the program the parties may also issue jointly agreed upon writings to confirm and record their mutual understanding on aspects related to the implementation of this compact the pta or other related agreements both type of writings are referred to herein as implementation letters comment so in other words mcc agreement is an open ended agreement because gosl has to be dancing to the tune of something called implementation letters which binds the gosl to act upon them whether these letters come daily weekly monthly we do not know section 3 6 procurement and grants the government shall ensure that the procurement of all goods works and services by the government or any provider to implement the program shall be in accordance with mcc s program procurement guidelines mcc program procurement guidelines accordingly neither the government procurement guidelines 2006 nor any other laws or regulations of sri lanka regarding procurement shall apply to procurements to implement the program comment what are mcc program procurement guidelines are they the same as us govt procurement guidelines that sri lanka was asked to follow in an earlier clause why should sri lanka govt procurement guidelines be totally abolished simply to satisfy a grant project how can sri lanka have parallel procurement procedures section 3 7 records accounting covered providers access government books records the government shall maintain and shall use its best efforts to ensure that all covered providers maintain accounting books records documents and other evidence relating to the program adequate to show to mcc s satisfaction the use of all mcc funding and the implementation and results of the program compact records in addition the government shall furnish or cause to be furnished to mcc upon its request originals or copies of such compact records accounting the government shall maintain and shall use its best efforts to ensure that all covered providers maintain compact records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles prevailing in the united states or at the government s option and with mcc s prior written approval other accounting principles such as those i prescribed by the international accounting standards board or ii then prevailing in sri lanka compact records must be maintained for at least 5 years after the end of the compact term or for such longer period if any required to resolve any litigation claims or audit findings or any applicable legal requirements access upon mcc s request the government at all reasonable times shall permit or cause to be permitted authorized representatives of mcc the inspector general of mcc inspector general the united states government accountability office any auditor responsible for an audit contemplated herein or otherwise conducted in furtherance of this compact and any agents or representatives engaged by mcc or the government to conduct any assessment review or evaluation of the program the opportunity to audit review evaluate or inspect facilities assets and activities funded in whole or in part by mcc funding comment a if mcc is setting up a company in sri lanka where funding is directly coming shouldn t this office be keeping a track of all matters related to its program funding why should mcc private company have any right to look into government books b what is this accepted accounting principles prevailing in the united states do these contradict with sri lanka c why should the gosl permit a private company to inspect its facilitites d if mca is delegated powers why should mcc appoint a inspector general of mcc how can a us state entity be broaching through records of a sovereign country section 3 8 audit reviews government audits except as the parties may agree otherwise in writing the government shall on at least a semi annual basis conduct or cause to be conducted financial audits of all disbursements of mcc funding covering the period from signing of this compact until the earlier of the following march 31 or september 30 and covering each six month period thereafter ending march 31 or september 30 through the end of the compact term as well as the one hundred twenty 120 day period following the expiration of the compact term in addition the government shall ensure that such audits are conducted by an independent auditor approved by mcc and selected in accordance with mcc s guidelines for financial audits contracted by the millennium challenge corporation s accountable entities the audit guidelines audits shall be performed in accordance with such audit guidelines and or other processes and procedures directed from time to time by mcc each audit must be completed and the audit report delivered to mcc no later than ninety 90 days after the applicable audit period or such other period as the parties may otherwise agree in writing any changes to the period to be audited shall be included in an audit plan developed and implemented by mca sri lanka in accordance with audit guidelines and program implementation

profit organization on the other hand state that the us non profit organization is subject to the applicable audit requirements contained in the uniform administrative requirements cost principles and audit requirements for federal awards issued by the us office of management budget ii a us for profit covered provider on the other hand state that the us for profit organization is subject to audit

that the non us covered provider is subject to an audit in accordance with audit guidelines d audit by mcc mcc shall have the right to arrange for audits of the governments use of mcc funding e cost of audits reviews or evaluations mcc funding may be used to fund the costs of any audits reviews or evaluations required under this compact comment a how can a private company demand how a sovereign government chooses as auditor have the sri lankan negotiators looked and studied the audit guidelines program implementation agreement before agreeing even in principle to the project what are these audit guidelines and do they conflict with the government audit guidelines b why so much of us audit guidelines when money is being disbursed not to gosl but to mca sri lanka a private company have all these areas been studied and looked at by sri lankan officials well the national economic council have made it clear that the sri lanka government should not sign the mcc for socio economic political reasons d if mca is set up to channel funding why should mcc arrange audits of the government e how much of mcc funding is allocated for audits and what is the likelihood of gosl having to pay additionally for audits from its pocket since it has to be a us approved auditor page 12 13 were missing from document released to public two pages have later been inserted and improper alignment shows that it is not part of original document page12 section 3 9 intellectual property the government grants to mcc a perpetual irrevocable royalty free worldwide fully paid assignable right and license to practice or have practiced on its behalf including the right to produce reproduce publish repurpose use store modify or make available any portion or portions of intellectual property as mcc sees fit in any medium now known or hereafter developed for any purpose whatsoever comment are we insane to give a foreign our entire intellectual property right current and future article 5 termination suspencion expiration also part of missing page 12 section 5 1 termination suspension either party may terminate compact without cause by giving the other party 30 days prior written notice mcc can terminate compact or mcc funding without cause in part by giving gosl 30 days prior written notice mcc may after written notice to gosl suspend or terminate compact or mcc funding in whole or part and any obligation related due to but not limited to the following i gosl failure to comply with obligations and commitments under compact or any other agreement in relation to compact or program ii if the gosl has made any incorrect or misleading data in the compact pia or supplemental agreement iii an event or series of events that shows project objectives are not going to be achieved during compact term or that the gosl is not able to perform its obligations under compact iv mcc funding violating us policy v gosl or any other person receiving mcc funding acting against national security interests of us vi if sri lanka is ineligible for foreign assistance due to foreign assistance act of 1961 vii if govt is engaged in activities inconsistent with mca act viii if govt or person or entity receiving mcc funding is convicted of narcotic offences or engaged in drug drufficking comment a while it says either party can terminate compact giving 30 days written notice mcc only can terminate giving 30 days notice b why is all the obligations and commitments on the part of sri lanka only section 5 2 consequences of termination suspension expiration if compact or mcc funding is suspended or terminated in whole or part provisions of pia shall govern the post suspension post termination or post expiration treatment of mcc funding any related disbursements program assets if compact mcc funding pia or any other supplemental agreement is not suspended or terminated it remains in full force effect mcc may reinstate any suspended or terminated mcc funding comment this means sri lanka if terminating or suspending any mcc related agreement it must ensure all docs are terminated otherwise those agreements remain in force what are the provisions in the programme implementation agreement why has this not been made public section 5 4 late payment interest if the government fails to pay any amount under this compact or the program implementation agreement when due including amounts under section 2 8 c and 5 3 a the government shall pay interest on such past due amount interest shall accrue on such amount at a rate equal to the then current us treasury current value of funds rate calculated on a daily basis and a 360 day year from the due date of such payment until such amount is paid in full any such payment shall first be credited against interest due and once the interest due amount is extinguished then payments shall be credited against outstanding principal comment firstly we are all under the impression that this 480m was an absolute grant with no strings attached a gift horse we are told but now section 5 4 says otherwise this is what the us envoy told the ceylon chamber of commerce in june 2019 the united states has offered the government and people of sri lanka a 480 million grant a gift not a loan but a gift from the people of the united states this is not a loan that might mortgage the future of the country what is this amount the govt is due to give under mcc compact pia section 2 8 c says mcc funding cannot be used by the govt that violates mcc environmental guidelines what are these guidelines have the govt looked at these before agreeing to them section 5 3 a says if mcc funding interest or earnings any program asset is used for any purpose in violation of terms of compact gosl may have to repay mcc in usd the value of misused mcc funding interest earnings or asset plus interest in accordance with section 5 4 within 30 days after mcc makes formal request from the gosl mcc funding or program asset cannot be used to make such payment section 5 5 survival this section lists out govt s responsibilities which also covers sections 2 7 limitations on use of mcc funding section 2 8 taxes section 3 7 records accounting covered providers access section 3 8 audits reviews section 3 9 intellectual property section 5 2 consequences of termination suspensions or expirations section 5 3 refunds violation section 5 4 late payment interest and section 6 4 governing law the govt is thus bound by section 6 4 comment section 6 4 says this compact is an international agreement shall be governed by international law what does this mean does sri lanka need to amend its laws to be on par with all international laws there s a list of international treaties that us has not signed or ratified are us laws compatible with international laws if not which applies in case of mcc vis a vis sri lanka section 6 4 governing law mcc agreement is an international agreement and shall be governed by international law comment mca sri lanka the company to be set up after signing mcc is to be legally immune from all wrong doing but sri lankan government is not immune mca sri lanka can go to courts against sri lanka govt citizens but sri lankan govt citizens cannot take mca sri lanka to court how can a locally registered company not be subject to sri lankan laws but international laws simply because an agreement states so there is all possibility of sri lanka being taken to international court tribunal if mcc is signed and gosl backs out of any commitments or assurances given most of which are revealed earlier are unclear undisclosed should any govt be allowed to commit sri lanka to such future international arbitration which will be borne not by govt making the mistake or by officials signing but ordinary tax payers footing millions of dollars as compensation when international law is being applied and sri lanka by signing mcc commits to that no amount of political drama and theatrics will allow sri lanka s government to renegade from the agreement it will be subject to international law and sri lanka if going back on its word will end up in an international court and charged heavily do we want to go through with all this just for a paltry 480m when we are likely to end up paying millions more after realizing the dangers or rather facing the dangers once mcc is signed section 6 6 references to mcc website references in compact pia or any other agreement entered into in connection with compact document information notified by posting on mcc website shall be deemed reference to such document or information as updated or substituted on mcc website from time to time comment does this mean that sri lanka will have to place someone 24 7 to be looking at the mcc website to see what updates have been placed as that is deemed as latest updated information section 6 8 mcc status mcc is a us govt corporation acting on behalf of the us govt in its implementation of this compact mcc the us govt assume no liability for any claims or loss arising out of activities or omission under this compact the govt waives any and all claims against mcc or the us govt or any current or former officer or employees of mcc or the us govt for all loss damage injury or death arising out of activities or omissions under this compact and agrees that it shall not bring any claim or legal proceeding of any kind against any of the above entities or persons for any such loss damage injury or death the govt agrees that mcc or the us govt or any current or former officer or employees of mcc or the us govt shall be immune from the jurisdiction of all courts and tribunals of sri lanka or any claim or loss arising out activities or omissions under this compact comment section 6 8 clearly establishes that mcc is a us govt entity and forming mca would be allowing us to open a us govt office in sri lanka allowing it to even audit sri lankan govt what s more as per this section mcc us govt are immune from all liabilities including loss damage injury or death in any court or tribunals in sri lanka so where is the law of reciprocity as applicable under international law which section 6 4 refers to this immunity taken together with immunity given to us troops personnel and contractors under acsa and sofa mean that us can do anything in sri lanka and sri lanka cannot take any legal action against it for 480 is this worth it see unfair contract terms act 26 of 1997 imposes limits on the extent to which civil liability for breach of contract or for negligence or other breach of duty can be avoided by means of contract terms and otherwise article 7 entry into force 7 1 domestic procedures the government shall proceed in a timely manner to complete all of its domestic requirements for this compact and pia to enter into force the parties understand that consistent with sri lankan law prior to the government sending the letter described in section 7 3 this compact is to be submitted to and enacted by the parliament of sri lanka comment we are under the impression 480 is a gift by us to the people of sri lanka if so why does the gosl have to complete all of its domestic requirements to enforce compact pia what are these domestic requirements what is this letter that the gosl has to send described in section 7 3 if mcc is giving a gift of 480m why should the mcc agreement have to be enacted by parliament according to the congressional notification transmittal sheet dated 25th april 2019 requests funds to be made ready in 15 days this was days after easter sunday terrorist attacks 480m is to be given across 5 years land project the government has prepared two draft legislative acts that seek to 1 convert permits and grants to state lands to absolute land grants that allow permit holders to sell or lease their land or use it as collateral with few restrictions and 2 create a data base that gathers information on state lands and facilitates investment in underutilized state lands prior to enactment of these acts the government must address legislative gaps focused on decentralizing authority for the approval of absolute land grants simplifying procedures and ensuring gender equality in the issuance of absolute land grants among other issues clearly indicates what mcc plan is further observations is the circulated map of an economic corridor which had been part of a mcc presentation shown by mcc in temple trees where in the said economic corridor 5miles to left 5 miles to right of railway line gives extent of 1 2million acres 200miles x 10miles is to cover the very districts that the mcc is proposing to digitalize and where the state is said to be currently rolling out accelerated title registrations in with railways leased out via state land bank act through the megapolis ministry the mcc or us allies can lease area for 100 100 years the previous government has already given 1million title deeds to people and in their poverty and loan hardship the opportunity and risk to sell their lands to foreign investors is a threat to sri lanka s national security agriculture and livelihood leaving all of the detrimental clauses and concerns aside what is even more worrying is sri lanka s own land laws still subject to colonial statutes sudden and impulsive cabinet changes circular approvals provincial council malpractices etc all of which are undermining sri lanka s ability to uphold its sovereignty vis a vis foreign agreements that seek to establish ventures in sri lanka should sri lanka not address these internal issues first before going and landing up with bigger issues and international litigation ignoring such shenali d waduge

by gail tverberg energy forecast for 2020 overall i expect that oil and other commodity prices will remain low in 2020 these low oil prices will adversely affect oil production and several other parts of the economy as a result a strong tendency toward recession can be expected the extent of recessionary influences will vary from country to country financial factors not discussed in these forecasts are likely also to play a role the following are pieces of my energy forecast for 2020 oil prices can be expected to remain generally low in 2020 there may be an occasional spike to 80 or 90 per barrel but average prices in 2020 are likely to be at or below the 2019 level figure 1 average annual inflation adjusted brent equivalent oil prices in 2018 us 2018 and prior are as shown in bp s 2019 statistical review of world energy value for 2019 estimated by the author based on eia brent daily oil prices and 2 expected inflation figure 2 shows in more detail how peaks in oil prices have been falling since 2008 while it doesn t include early january 2020 oil prices even these prices would be below the dotted line figure 2 inflation adjusted weekly average brent oil price based on eia oil spot prices and us cpi urban inflation oil prices can temporarily spike because of inadequate supply or fear of war however to keep oil prices up there needs to be an increase in demand for finished goods and services made with commodities workers need to be able to afford to purchase more goods such as new homes cars and cell phones governments need to be able to afford to purchase new goods such as paved roads and school buildings at this point the world economy is struggling with a lack of affordability in finished goods and services this lack of affordability is what causes oil and other commodity prices to tend to fall rather than to rise lack of affordability comes when too many would be buyers have low wages or no income at all wage disparity tends to rise with globalization it also tends to rise with increased specialization a few highly trained workers earn high wages but many others are left with low wages or no job at all it is the fact that we do not have a way of making the affordability of finished goods rise which leads me to believe that oil prices will remain low raising minimum wages tends to encourage more mechanization of processes and thus tends to lower total employment interest rates cannot be brought much lower nor can the terms of loans be extended much longer if such changes were available they would enhance affordability and thus help prevent low commodity prices and recession world oil production seems likely to fall by 1 or more in 2020 because of low oil prices quarterly oil production data of the us energy information administration shows the following pattern figure 3 quarterly world crude oil and natural gas liquids production based on eia international data through september 2019 this is a fairly broad definition of oil it does not include biofuels because their production tends to be seasonal the highest single quarter of world oil production was the fourth quarter of 2018 oil production has been falling since this peak quarter to examine what is happening the production shown in figure 3 can be divided into that by the united states opec and all other figure 4 quarterly world crude oil and natural gas liquids production by part of the world based on international data of the us energy information agency through september 30 2019 figure 4 shows that the production of all other seems to be steady to slightly rising more or less regardless of oil prices opec s oil production bobs up and down in general its production is lower when oil prices are low and higher when oil prices are high this shouldn t be a surprise recently its production has been lower in response to low prices effective january 1 2020 opec plans to reduce its production by another 500 000 barrels per day figure 4 shows that oil production of the united states rose in response to high prices in the 2010 to 2013 period it dipped in response to low oil prices in 2015 and 2016 when oil prices rose in 2017 and 2018 its production again rose production in 2019 seems to have risen less rapidly recent monthly and weekly eia data confirm the flatter us oil production growth pattern in 2019 putting the pieces together i estimate that world oil production including natural gas liquids for 2019 will be about 0 5 lower than that of 2018 since world population is rising by about 1 1 per year per capita oil production is falling faster about 1 6 per year a self organizing networked economy seems to distribute oil shortages through lack of affordability thus for example they might be expected to affect the economy through lower auto sales and through less international trade related to automobile production international trade of course requires the use of oil since ships and airplanes use oil products for fuel if prices stay low in 2020 both the oil production of the united states and opec will likely be adversely affected bringing 2020 oil production down even further i would expect that even without a major recession world oil supply might be expected to fall by 1 in 2020 relative to 2019 if a major recession occurs oil prices could fall further perhaps to 30 per barrel and oil production would likely fall lower laid off workers don t need to drive to work in theory the 2019 and 2020 decreases in world oil production might be the beginning of world peak oil if oil prices cannot be brought back up again after 2020 world oil production is likely to drop precipitously even the all other group in figure 4 would be likely to reduce their production if there is no chance of making a profit the big question is whether the affordability of finished goods and services can be raised in the future such an increase would tend to raise the price of all commodities including oil the implosion of the recycling business is part of what is causing today s low oil prices the effects of the recycling implosion can be expected to continue into 2020 with the rise in oil prices in the 2002 2008 period there came the opportunity for a new growth industry recycling unfortunately as oil prices started to fall from their lofty heights the business model behind recycling started to make less and less sense effective january 1 2018 china stopped nearly all of its paper and plastic recycling other asian nations including india have been following suit when recycling efforts were reduced many people working in the recycling industry lost their jobs by coincidence or not auto purchases in china began to fall at exactly the same time as recycling stopped of course when fewer automobiles are sold demand for oil to make and operate automobiles tends to fall this has been part of what is pushing world oil prices down related why pirates are giving up on oil sending materials to asia for recycling made economic sense when oil prices were high once prices dropped china was faced with dismantling a fairly large no longer economic industry other countries have followed suit and their automobile sales have also fallen companies operating ships that transport manufactured goods to high income countries were adversely affected by the loss of recycling when material for recycling was available it could be used to fill otherwise empty containers returning from high income countries fees for transporting materials to be recycled indirectly made the cost of shipping goods manufactured in china and india a little lower than they otherwise would be if containers needed to be shipped back empty all of these effects have helped reduce demand for oil indirectly these effects tend to reduce oil prices we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the recycling industry has not yet shrunk back to the size that the economics would suggest is needed if oil prices remain low there may be a few kinds of recycling that work well sorted materials recycled near where the materials have been gathered for example but it probably does not make sense to send separate trucks through neighborhoods to pick up poorly sorted materials some materials may better be burned or placed in landfills we are not yet through the unwind of recycling even the recycling of materials such as aluminum cans is affected by oil prices a march 2019 wsj article talks about a glut of used cans because some markets now prefer to use newly produced aluminum the growth of the electric car industry can be expected to slow substantially in 2020 as it becomes increasingly apparent that oil prices are likely to stay low for a long period electric cars are expensive in two ways 1 in building the cars initially and 2 in building and maintaining all of the charging stations required if more than a few elite workers with charging facilities in their garages are to use the vehicles once it is clear that oil prices cannot rise indefinitely the need for all of the extra costs of electric vehicles becomes very iffy in light of the changing view of the economics of the situation china has discontinued its electric vehicle ev subsidies as of january 1 2020 prior to the change china was the world s largest seller of electric vehicles year over year ev sales in china dropped by 45 6 in october 2019 and 45 7 in november 2019 the big drop in china s ev sales has had a follow on effect of sharply lower lithium prices in the us tesla has recently been the largest seller of evs the subsidy for tesla is disappearing in 2020 because it has sold over 200 000 vehicles this is likely to adversely affect the growth of ev sales in the us in 2020 the area of the world that seems to have a significant chance of a major uptick in ev sales in 2020 is europe this increase is possible because governments there are still giving sizable subsidies to buyers of such cars if in future years these subsidies become too great a burden for european governments ev sales are likely to lag there as well ocean going ships are required to use fuels that cause less pollution as of january 2020 this change will have a positive environmental impact but it will lead to additional costs that are impossible to pass on to buyers of shipping services the net impact will be to push the world economy in the direction of recession if ocean going ships use less polluting fuels this will raise costs somewhere along the line in the simplest cases ocean going vessels will purchase diesel fuel rather than lower more polluting grades of fuel refineries will need to charge more for the diesel fuel if they are to cover the cost of removing sulfur and other pollutants the catch is that the buyers of finished goods and services cannot really afford more expensive finished goods they cut back in their demand for automobiles homes cell phones and paved roads if oil prices rise this reduction in demand is what pushes commodity prices including oil prices down evidence that shipowners cannot really pass the higher refining costs along comes from the fact that the prices that shippers are able to charge for shipping seems to be falling rather than rising one january article says the baltic exchange s main sea freight index touched its lowest level in eight months on friday weighed down by weak demand across all segments the index posted its biggest one day percentage drop since january 2014 in the previous session so higher costs for shippers have been greeted by lower prices for the cost of shipping it will partly be shipowners who suffer from the lower sales margin they will operate fewer ships and lay off workers but part of the problem will be passed on to the rest of the economy pushing it toward recession and lower oil prices expect increasingly warlike behavior by governments in 2020 for the primary purpose of increasing oil prices oil producers around the world need higher prices than recently have been available this is why the us seems to be tapering its growth in shale oil production middle eastern countries need higher oil prices in order to be able to collect enough taxes on oil revenue to provide jobs and to subsidize food purchases for citizens with the us as well as middle eastern countries wanting higher oil prices it is no wonder that warlike behavior takes place if somehow a country can get control of more oil that is simply an added benefit the year 2020 is likely to bring transmission line concerns to the wind and solar industries in some areas this will lead to cutbacks in added wind and solar a recent industry news item was titled renewables hit a wall in saturated upper midwest grid most of the material that is published regarding the cost of wind and solar omits the cost of new transmission lines to support wind and solar in some cases additional transmission lines are not really required for the first additions of wind and solar generation it is only when more wind and solar are added that it becomes a problem the linked article talks about projects being withdrawn until new transmission lines can be added in an area that includes minnesota iowa parts of the dakotas and western wisconsin adding transmission lines may take several years a related issue that has come up recently is the awareness that at least in dry areas transmission lines cause fires getting permission to site new transmission lines has been a longstanding problem when the problem of fires is added to the list of concerns delays in getting the approval of new transmission lines are likely to be longer and the cost of new transmission lines is likely to rise higher the overlooked transmission line issue once it is understood is likely to reduce the interest in replacing other generation with wind and solar countries that are exporters of crude oil are likely to find themselves in increasingly dire financial straits in 2020 as oil prices stay low for longer rebellions may arise governments may even be overthrown oil exporters often obtain the vast majority of their revenue from the taxation of receipts related to oil exports if prices stay low in 2020 exporters will find their tax revenues inadequate to maintain current programs for the welfare of their people such as programs providing jobs and food subsidies some of this lost revenue may be offset by increased borrowing in many cases programs will need to be cut back needless to say cutbacks are likely to lead to unhappiness and rebellions by citizens the problem of rebellions and overthrown governments also can be expected to occur when exporters of other commodities find their prices too low an example is chile an exporter of copper and lithium both of these products have recently suffered from low export prices these low prices no doubt play a major part in the protests taking place in chile if more tax revenue from the sales of exports were available there would be no difficulty in satisfying protesters demands related to poverty inequality and an overly high cost of living we can expect more of these kinds of rebellions and uprisings the longer oil and other commodity prices stay too low for commodity producers conclusion i have not tried to tell the whole economic story for 2020 even the energy portion is concerning a networked self organizing system such as the world economy operates in ways that are far different from what simple common sense would suggest things that seem to be wonderful in the eyes of consumers such as low oil prices and low commodity prices may have dark sides that are recessionary in nature producers need high prices to produce commodities but these high commodity prices lead to finished goods and services that are too expensive for many consumers to afford there probably cannot be a one size fits all forecast for the world economy some parts of the world will likely fare better than others it is possible that a collapse of one or more parts of the world economy will allow other parts to continue such a situation occurred in 1991 when the central government of the soviet union collapsed after an extended period of low oil prices it is easy to think that the future is entirely bleak but we cannot entirely understand the workings of a self organizing networked economy the economy tends to have more redundancy than we would expect furthermore things that seem to be terrible often do not turn out as badly as expected things that seem to be wonderful often do not turn out as favorably as expected thus we really don t know what the future holds we need to keep watching the signs and adjust our views as more

the earlier protest movement took place in the middle of the world s energy center amid increasing military tensions hidden and open warfare in syria yemen the persian gulf and a while further the war for the domination of libya s oil wealth when the riots crossed borders from iraq to iran the possibility arose that in iran the struggle would once again pass from the streets to the factories in this way the working proletarians would take the lead just as they did at the end of 2018 the workers can bring to the struggle what is currently lacking an organization an organization of struggle run by those fighting themselves by deciding on their struggle in mass meetings in the factory or on the streets by electing delegates to committees and a workers council like at the sugar cane factory haft tapeh as the protests reached iran growing tensions of the inter imperialist war in the middle east eased after the invasion of turkey in northern syria after the search for another boss by the mercenaries of the kurdish ypg after the regrouping of the usa in northern syria to defend the oil fields there was a real threat of confrontations between russian and turkish troops turkey is still part of nato so that america can get involved in such a conflict all these tensions between larger and smaller imperialist powers decreased during the riots in iran all imperialists from the axis china russia that after having incorporated syria now tends to incorporate iran to the opposing regional block the usa saudi arabia and israel as well as turkey and europe who have not yet decided which side to take all held their breath for what could develop into a new february and october 1917 russian revolution a new november 1918 german revolution which would put an end to the imperialist war once the danger of revolutionary upsurge against capital had passed the resumption of the bombing of idlib marked the beginning of a new phase in increasingly destructive imperialist confrontations is an impending civil war transforming into an inter imperialist war after russia s participation in bombing raids on the last stronghold of the resistance against assad of syria now totally framed and militarized by bourgeois forces it trump s turn to flex his muscles in the run up to the presidential elections trump cannot afford to appear to his voters as weak in the face of small scale attacks by iran on the usa s allies in the region saudi arabian oil installations are being hit by drone attacks actions against oil tankers in the persian gulf attacks on military bases in iraq after all the iranian inspired storming of the american embassy in baghdad on new year s eve was the drop that makes the bucket overflow trump was reminded of the humiliation the usa suffered during the occupation of the us embassy in tehran in 1979 which cost carter his re election as president of the usa unlike previous us actions against iran trump decided purely for domestic political reasons to go big this time eliminating a top general whereas everyone knows that the ayatollah regime in iran can t stand to lose its face in public and in turn has to strike a heavy blow the usa saw a reason to send more ground troops to iraq contrary to trumps election promises and not for the first time when us troops withdrew from kurdish territory in syria to give way to the turkish advance they did not return home but regrouped around the oil fields in northern syria behind this erratic behavior of the president hides the growing influence of hawks and the military in his government the harbinger of a new and bigger war but in this case it is not just a further step in imperialist war the archenemy of imperialism the international proletariat at least the fear of it also played a role the moment of the attack on soleimani is extremely instructive namely at the dead end of the protest movements of the population in lebanon iraq and iran because of their lack of perspective for a society without exploitation and oppression as is the case with the protest movements in south america the protests in the middle east were in political terms limited to the demand of other people in government of a different electoral system of a change of government system in iran of a fall of the ayatollah regime whether the demonstrators are aware of this or not it means the preservation of the bourgeois state and in particular of its repressive core the army and the secret services thus a repetition of exactly what happened in 1978 when with the consent of the army and secret services the shah regime was replaced by the ayatollah regime and the mullahs disarmed the workers however a fall of the regime in 1978 as well as now is impossible without workers strikes paralyzing the oil industry from the inside and not from the outside like the blockades in iraq which can be eliminated by military means without destroying the installations this explains why left bourgeois iranian opposition groups in particular which all seek only a change of regime called for strikes to bring down the regime in vain the workers in iran did not move as they did in 2018 despite a rumor by one source in farsi and certainly not on a much larger scale than in 2018 with this the perspective that a movement of workers in the factories could have given to the street protests that of a society without capital without state without war also disappeared the november riots in iran were brutally crushed 1 500 dead are currently reported with this the power relations between the proletariat and capital were reversed and the bourgeoisie lost its fear both the usa and russia understood that once the danger of massive workers struggles had passed the imperialist wars could be resumed the protest movements of the people could now continue to be drowned in the false anti imperialism of iraqi nationalism on one side and iranian nationalism on the other side of the border both of which with much acclaim are mainly directed against american imperialism meanwhile the imperialist block that is forming around russia and china is increasingly succeeding in binding iran to itself what threatened to become a civil war between the working class in the middle east on the one hand and all the states on the other threatens to turn into yet another inter imperialist war on the territory of weakened and unstable iraq and over the occupation of its rich oil wells two scenarios for imperialist war at the time of writing the widely announced escalation between iran and america is not taking place one of the reasons is that it is not yet certain how the young unemployed in iraq and iran will react to the changed situation so far nothing is known about this other than that demonstrators in iraq just like the previously despised parliament are demanding the withdrawal of all foreign troops a goal that can only be achieved by a workers revolution meanwhile iran has demonstrated with a missile attack from its own territory causing minimal and only material damage that it has compensated its wing lam air force consisting of old soviet mig fighters with precision missiles that it has developed with the help of north korea and china perhaps the conflict between the us and iran will proceed as usual in the short term a spectacular air action by the us serves to mask its loss of control on the ground in the region meanwhile the usa are trying to maintain control by maintaining superiority in the air and playing off regional powers in the region against each other with varying alliances in the long run however the decline of the usa as a world economic power compared to china and the rise of a sino russian imperialist block are unacceptable to the usa for their part russia china cannot accept economic and military decline either thus behind every local conflict as long as emerging workers struggles do not stop the trend towards war lurks the danger of a third world war between what remains of an american block and a sino russian block what is fight for peace against the aggressor as in the first and second world wars each of the warring camps tries to present its struggle as a peace mission directed against the aggressor as self defense in the reality of the imperialist war there is no distinction between attack and defense and the peace prepares the next war and the war the next peace again left wing bourgeois groups and parties join what are in fact war campaigns with demonstrations they try to put pressure on the government in their own country to pursue a different foreign policy usually more anti american while keeping silent about the sino russian axis as usual the trotskyists do this with more or less pseudo radical slogans against the authoritarian leaders of iran or the iranian regime thereby restricting the street protests to the purpose of a change of regime while preserving the state the departure of american ground troops from iraq fits into a scenario that as we have seen above the americans have previously applied because it does not affect their superiority in the air iran however will not easily withdraw its shiite militias from iraq because it would mean giving up its imperialist ambitions the tendency towards a third world war can only be stopped by consistently continuing the struggles of the working class in all countries to defend their lives against the consequences of imperialist war and economic crisis in this struggle the working class can change the balance of power between labor and capital to its advantage building its own struggling organization of industrial and street general assemblies of elected and re electable committees and councils to finally destroy the repressive organs of the state as happened in october 1917 in russia the beginning of the end of the first world war the working class affected by the consequences of crisis and war it is now clear that the capitalist economic crisis that caused a worldwide recession in 2008 is re emerging first of all the national capitals that exist mainly as suppliers of raw materials have been affected russia the oil and gas exporting countries in the middle east and north africa brazil chile and the suppliers of cheap labor china and india now it is also europe s and north america s turn with car factories and steel at the forefront since 2008 central banks have pumped more money into the stagnating global economy than ever before this medicine now appears to have made the suffering patient even sicker banks and states are on the verge of collapse again where can capital still find a solution in all countries it means more of the same cutting back on health care care for the elderly youth care education reducing various benefits especially for the elderly and pensions for those in work less and less if you work more than 1 hour per week you no longer count in the unemployment statistics more and more precarious contracts lower wages compared to prices and more and more stress the billions of euro s and dollars saved by the state in this way are transferred to the corporations via the so called stimulation of a green economy and increase of defense spending against the talk of peace missions the facts speak the response of capital to the crisis of its economy is intensification of exploitation and oppression trade war and more and more imperialist wars to control energy resources raw materials markets no country can do without these imperialist policies in the current world situation a crumbling and relatively regressing american imperialist block and in contrast a russian chinese imperialist block is emerging the struggle of the working class of all countries against the consequences of crisis and wars can only be carried out in a consistent manner with the unification of the struggle to defend living conditions across the borders of employed and unemployed of factories and industries of different employment contracts of language beliefs gender and nationality against any sabotage of class unity by bourgeois political parties and trade unions by its own independent organization of struggle action committees general meetings at the working place and on the street elected and re elected committees and workers councils against all states against both the imperialism of the large states on the one hand the usa on the other hand china and russia against all regional imperialist powers such as iran syria and iraq on the one hand saudi arabia and israel on the other hand against the middle sized imperialisms that doubt or switch alliances such as turkey the eu as a whole the smaller imperialisms such as italy and france opposing each other in libya and finally also against founding states such as catalonia isis daech and non states such as the mercenary supplier rojava non exhaustive list aliases may change to the proletarians in uniform turn your weapons against our exploiters and oppressors who chase the young generation into ever changing imperialist conflicts no confidence that a rebellious army unit or any

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire santiago reuters chile s economy is expected to start expanding again in 2020 in the wake of intense social unrest in the final months of last year edging up by 0 50 in the first quarter according to a poll of analysts released on friday analysts expect growth to hit 1 20 by december and 2 50 by december 2021 according to the poll by the chilean central bank in line with the bank s latest projections of a range of 0 5 to 1 5 in 2020 and between 2 5 to 3 5 in 2021 related stories the analysts saw mildly better days ahead for economic activity too which they said would be down 1 in december 2019 compared to the 3 3 reported for november when the protests were at their height they projected a firming in the chilean peso which plunged to successive historical lows during the unrest with a recovery to 760 per dollar in the next two months and reaching 725 within the next two years the 57 people polled saw the interest rate remaining unchanged for the foreseeable future at 1 75 only reaching 2 in 23 months the bank said last month that recently announced fiscal stimulus measures and a depreciating peso would help push long lagging inflation in the south american nation to its target inflation hit the bank s 3 target this week protests started in chile in october over a hike in public transport fares and raged for successive months leaving at least 27 people dead thousands injured and arrested and president sebastian pinera with a 10 approval rating for his handling of the crisis the chilean economy has been hit hard by the unrest which wrought billions of dollars in damages to public infrastructure and private business and saw economic activity paralyzed reporting by aislinn laing editing by catherine evans
while denizens of the world s wealthiest economies debate the fate and fortune of the middle class over 800 million people worldwide have no access to electricity and more than two billion have no clean cooking facilities forcing them to use toxic alternatives such as animal waste as their main cooking fuel furthermore per capita carbon dioxide emissions in europe and the united states are still vastly higher than in china and india what right do americans in particular have to complain as china increases production in smokestack industries to counter the economic slowdown caused by its trade war with the us to many in asia the inward looking debate in the west often seems both tone deaf and beside the point even if europe and the us deliberately stall their capitalist growth engines as some of the more radical policy proposals might do if implemented it would not be nearly enough to contain global warming if emerging economies stay on their current consumption growth trajectory the most recent united nations data suggest that the world has already reached a tipping point where there is little chance of limiting the increase in global temperature to what climate scientists consider the safe threshold of 1 5 c above pre industrial levels in fact a significantly larger rise is likely according to a recent international monetary fund report limiting global warming even to 2 c would require a global carbon price of at least 75 100 per ton of co2 more than double its current level by 2030 any solution to the problem requires two interconnected parts the first and more important is a global tax on co2 emissions which would discourage activities that exacerbate global warming and encourage innovation equating the price of co2 emissions globally would eliminate distortions whereby say a us based firm might choose to relocate its most carbon intensive production to china moreover a worldwide carbon tax would achieve in one fell swoop what myriad command and control measures cannot easily replicate the second critical component is a mechanism that impels emerging and less developed economies to buy in to emissions reduction which can be very costly in terms of foregone growth in recent years the biggest contributor to the global increase in co2 emissions has been fast growing asia where roughly one new coal plant is being built every week for advanced economies where the average coal plant is 45 years old phasing out such facilities is low hanging fruit in terms of reducing co2 emissions but in asia where the average age of coal plants is only 12 years the cost of taxing plants into oblivion makes doing so virtually impossible without outside aid yes europe and the us can impose carbon border taxes on developing countries that do not comply with their standards but beyond the associated technical challenges this would raise issues of fairness given profound global energy inequality one promising idea which i have suggested previously would be to establish a world carbon bank that would specialize in energy transition issues and provide technical and financial assistance to poor and middle income countries in principle either a carbon tax or a quota system such as the one europe has instituted can work but as the late economist martin weitzman showed in pathbreaking work in the early 1970s there are important subtleties depending on the nature of uncertainty for example and greatly oversimplifying if scientists have a fairly precise idea of the amount of cumulative co2 emissions that the planet can handle between now and 2100 and if economists are not so sure what price trajectory would induce countries and firms to adhere to those limits then the case for tradable quotas is strong under other assumptions about the nature of cost and benefit uncertainties a carbon tax is preferable one issue weitzman did not consider is that carbon tax agreements are likely to be more transparent and easier to monitor than quotas this is particularly important in international trade there are good reasons why a succession of multi country tariff reduction agreements after world war ii sought to strip away regulatory and quantity constraints and replace them with relatively simple tariff schedules in addition carbon taxes could generate significant revenues to support green research compensate low income households within countries for transition costs for example by giving car owners incentives to trade in old clunkers and buy more fuel efficient vehicles and fund transfers from rich to poor countries through a mechanism like the world carbon bank quotas could in principle be auctioned to achieve the same goal but they are often given away in practice almost all of the 40 countries that have established national carbon prices have done so indirectly via quotas european policymakers are particularly enthusiastic about this approach arguing that it is much more politically palatable than introducing a carbon tax but it is not at all clear that the same is true for a global system where transparency carries a premium as the cost of distorting taxes and quotas increases it makes sense to align across the most efficient possible system the scientific evidence increasingly indicates that the world may soon reach a point of no return regarding climate change so rather than worrying almost exclusively about economic and political inequality rich country citizens need to start thinking about how to deal with global energy inequality before it s too late
the difficulty of predicting key developments in this new decade can be brought into better focus by understanding how some of the more widely shared expectations about the last one turned out many of the surprising and important developments in that period foreshadow some of the challenges and changes we are likely to face in the 2020s most americans entered the 2010s assuming u s leadership of the liberal global economic and political order and of post war western centered alliances and international institutions would continue though less robustly than in the past with domestic support or at least broad political acquiescence observers generally took for granted that increasing globalization was a fait accompli it was after all a powerful source for economic growth it dramatically increased international sales of many u s industries and farmers increased availability of low cost consumer goods and components for americans and sharply boosted living standards around the world through trade and investment economists asserted globalization would create a rising tide that lifted many if not all boats new forms of global cooperation were emerging to address climate change the u s and china were narrowing their differences and an international action plan was soon to be adopted but that order also faced considerable stress more and more communities workers businesses and political leaders saw it as a source of disruption the world still struggled to lift itself out of a global financial crisis and europe shakily tried to overcome internal threats to its financial and currency systems the world trade organization stalled in efforts to update dispute settlement procedures and address new types of trade issues related to e trade government support for state enterprises and protection of trade secrets china already was offering alternative international institutions politically there was a general assumption that russia was a growing problem evidenced by its annexation of crimea incursion into eastern ukraine and frozen wars on its other borders yet few expected it would pose serious internal challenges to u s and other western democratic institutions or play a major strategic role elsewhere china was a rapidly rising political military and economic power but hardly considered a formidable technological competitor to the u s nor was it seen as a political challenger globally although a strong one regionally america s biggest security threats appeared to emanate from the middle east and isis in particular new technologies and emerging social media were widely recognized as central to our economic future most observers assumed they would be dominated by american companies drive the democratization of information and draw the world and societies closer their political and security implications received little high level attention those of cyber espionage election interference and terrorism received virtually none the decade ended somewhat differently than expected on a positive note the u s experienced a robust recovery from recession the european economy did not collapse and the eurozone did not fracture despite brexit many emerging economies experienced strong growth and the global economic system proved resilient but the uneven recovery benefitted some sectors of society far more than others it thus raised doubts about the fairness of the capitalist market system and the consequences of rapid globalization populist forces and authoritarian minded leaders fed on the discontent they capitalized on growing feelings of national identities lost to global forces such as immigration this fed support for nationalist policies that rejected the more traditionally centrist political and economic leadership political leaders and powerful factions in many countries notably the united states espoused strong xenophobic policies but support for such policies also arose in the united kingdom france germany italy hungary brazil and poland in numerous cases the u s supported these more extreme forces and their leaders against established liberal democratic ones generally supportive of u s interests and values the country that had shaped and led the global order pulled back at times it seemed determined to undermine alliances values and institutions that constituted its main pillars and served the u s well for 70 years threats or actual measures to withdraw from alliances treaties and agreements badly weakened the global order and confidence in its leader and there appeared to be no broad strategy to address serious global challenges and changes america s pullback divisions and confusion left the playing field increasingly open to countries seeking to influence or alter that order russia fomented political divisions in the u s and other western democracies and sought to undermine nato emboldened by some western leaders who did little or nothing to oppose it the weapon of choice often was social media russia also boldly inserted itself in the middle east china proved much more adept at projecting its influence globally than most had anticipated not by following the american model of building alliances but by the magnetic pull of its formidable economic strength and the appeal to numerous nations of a strong government led by a strong leader competing head to head with the world s greatest military power and largest market economy china aimed to shape global institutions and rules to conform more closely to chinese interests china has used its economic power to strengthen political and security ties with a wide range of countries on all continents most of america s closest allies now trade more with china than with the u s they depend on china s market and incorporate its advanced technologies increasingly countries find themselves wanting to maintain close military ties with the u s but also to strengthen political trade and investment links with china and fear being pressed by one country to reject ties with the other some of the vaunted technologies that advanced at breathtaking speed and benefitted billions of people in the 2010s now evoke controversy in the wrong hands they have been mobilized to disrupt or influence western elections and many have significant security implications cyber terrorism cyber financial crime and cyber espionage that can penetrate democratic foundations through manipulation of information and voting systems all told the 2010s despite considerable economic positives and transformational technological advances might be summarized from a western prospective as a decade characterized by a weakening of collective wellbeing and common values because of excessive focus on short term political and nationalistic considerations and a weakening of american and western leadership social cohesion and resiliency all with profound foreign policy and national security implications foreign trust in the u s has deteriorated our alliance system has been weakened and its ability to coalesce in a crisis is more problematic global economic institutions are weaker and washington s advocacy of america first raises doubts about whether its leadership can be counted on the climate crisis grows worse america s domestic debt has dramatically increased constraining the availability of resources to respond to foreign policy or military crises the health and retirement needs of an aging population potentially fueling social divisions and in a more competitive world america has not met the rise of china with a u s strategy to accelerate training of scientists technologists engineers and mathematicians or to attract and retain the best and brightest from around the world increase government support for cutting edge research or rebuild decaying infrastructure threats to our democratic institutions from within our own country and a generalized global perception that we may have lost confidence in them and don t much care about the need to defend others who share our values are one of the decade s saddest legacies and pose a danger that requires major attention in the 2020s robert d hormats vice chairman of

but the transformation extends beyond economic policy tenets within the discipline there is finally a reckoning with the hierarchical practices and aggressive seminar culture that have produced an inhospitable environment for women and minorities a 2019 survey carried out by the american economic association aea revealed that nearly half of female economists felt discriminated against or treated unfairly on account of their gender nearly a third of non white economists felt treated unfairly based on their racial or ethnic identity these failings may be related a profession that is less diverse and less open to different identities is more likely to exhibit groupthink and hubris if it is to generate ideas to help society achieve inclusive prosperity it will have to start by becoming more inclusive itself the new face of the discipline was on display when the aea convened for its annual meetings in san diego in early january 2020 there were plenty of panels of the usual type on topics such as monetary policy regulation and economic growth but there was an unmistakably different flavour to the proceedings the sessions that put their mark on the proceedings and attracted the greatest attention were those that pushed the profession in new directions there were more than a dozen sessions focusing on gender and diversity including the headline richard t ely lecture delivered by the university of chicago s marianne bertrand the aea meetings took place against the backdrop of the publication of anne case and angus deaton s remarkable and poignant book deaths of despair which was presented during a special panel case and deaton s research shows how a particular set of economic ideas privileging the free market along with an obsession with material indicators such as aggregate productivity and gdp have fuelled an epidemic of suicide drug overdose and alcoholism among america s working class capitalism is no longer delivering and economics is at the very least complicit a panel named economics for inclusive prosperity efip organised by a network of the same name which i co direct discussed several strands of new thinking taking over the discipline one is the need to expand economists focus from average levels of prosperity to distributive aspects and to non economic dimensions that are equally fundamental to well being such as dignity autonomy health and political rights how economists talk about say trade agreements or deregulation may well change when they take such additional considerations seriously this will require new economic indicators one proposal that goes part of the way is for government agencies to produce distributional national income accounts as samuel bowles and wendy carlin argued in a paper presented in the same session every policy paradigm embeds a set of ethical values about what the good life entails along with a view of how the economy works neoliberalism presumes individualistic amoral individuals and a free market that delivers efficiency thanks to complete contracts and a relative paucity of market failures what we need according to bowles and carlin is a new paradigm that integrates egalitarian democratic and sustainability norms with a model of the economy as it really operates today this paradigm would place community alongside the state market dichotomy and would include policies such as wealth taxes broader access to insurance to reduce risk exposure workplace rights and voice corporate governance reform and a substantial weakening of intellectual property rights speaking in the same session luigi zingales faulted economists for foisting their own preferences on the body politic this happens because economists tend to place greater value on certain outcomes such as efficiency than others such as income distribution and because they fall prey to groupthink and fetishise particular economic models over others part of the solution is to value diversity and exhibit greater modesty another part according to zingales is to pay more attention to research in other social sciences including history sociology and political science the implication of all these perspectives is that economics must be open to institutional alternatives and to institutional experimentation fostering such thinking is one of the major aims of the efip network the institutional basis of a market economy is largely indeterminate we can stick with institutional arrangements that sustain privilege and restrict opportunity or we can devise institutions that in the words of bowles and carlin are consistent with the pursuit of not only shared affluence but also an expanded concept of freedom empirical methods especially of causal inference will help and they have become much more central to the profession in recent decades this is a very good thing insofar as real world evidence with all of its necessary messiness displaces ideology but the focus on evidence also risks creating its own blind spots evidence about what does and does not work can be obtained only from actual experience we necessarily lack data on alternative institutional arrangements that are distant from our current reality the challenge for economists is to remain true to their empiricism without crowding out the imagination needed to envisage the inclusive and freedom enhancing institutions of the future bm copyright project syndicate 2020
there are far too many political pundits who still use the old canard that if the economy is good the incumbent is reelected ignoring all the historical exceptions to this supposed rule and by economy these lazy political pundits mean the stock market which is not the economy the wall street fluffers at cnbc and fox business are the worst since you can t fix stupid you will continue to hear this canard this year let s take a look at some recent economic reporting for a reality check on the economy the december jobs number came out on friday and showed us job gains slowed in december to 145

of hiring plenty of jobs but raises are tiny one discouraging piece of the labor department s monthly report was anemic wage growth it s easier to get a job than a raise in this economy said diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton consumer spending is a pillar of the economy and it depends on income growth over the past 12 months wages grew just 2 9 percent that was substantially below the 3 3 percent average in 2018 something that the fed has been humbled by is how little wage acceleration there s been ms swonk said referring to the federal reserve limp wage growth is puzzling when the jobless rate has settled at 3 5 percent a half century low the economic policy institute reported inequality is rising as workers are increasingly cut out of the economic returns to productivity

grew in one third of counties despite strong national economy the poverty rate grew in 30 of counties between 2016 and 2018 according to a stateline analysis of u s census bureau county estimates released this month the counties with the biggest jumps in poverty ranged across the political and demographic spectrum from 97 white and solidly republican voting carter county in kentucky to black majority democratic bullock county in alabama most of the biggest increases were in areas both rural and southern those areas generally had residents who lacked job training and skills and industries

snake s belly for corporations there is a floor below which they will not charge a lower rate for consumers said david robertson publisher of the nilson report an industry newsletter even if the fed lowers rates again consumers aren t going to get relief despite president trump s repeated insistence that the u s is taxing the hell out of china the truth is american consumers not china are paying for trump s tariffs american businesses and consumers not china are bearing the financial brunt of president trump s trade war new data shows undermining the president s assertion that the united states is taxing the hell out of china u s tariffs continue to be almost entirely borne by u s firms and consumers mary amiti an economist at the federal reserve bank of new york wrote in a national bureau of economic research working paper the other authors of the paper were david e weinstein of columbia university and stephen j redding of princeton examining the fallout of tariffs in data through october the authors found that americans had continued paying for the levies which increased substantially over the course of the year their paper which is an update on previous research found that approximately 100 percent of import taxes fell on american buyers the findings are the latest evidence that voters and american businesses are paying the cost of mr trump s penchant for using tariffs to try to rewrite the terms of trade in favor of the united states the united states and china have reached a trade truce and are expected to sign an initial deal this month but tariffs on 360 billion worth of chinese goods will remain in place president donald trump s trade war and his unprecedented increase in tariffs on foreign imports hurt the very sector he intended to boost manufacturing and cost american jobs concludes a new paper by federal reserve board economists trump tariffs hurt u s manufacturing cost american jobs federal reserve economists the academic paper also suggests the trade war approach fails to recognize the sophisticated interconnection of global supply chains that also benefits u s companies we find that tariff increases enacted in 2018 are associated with relative reductions in manufacturing employment and relative increases in producer prices the economists concluded while the longer term effects of the tariffs may differ from those that we estimate here the results indicate that the tariffs thus far have not led to increased activity in the u s manufacturing sector according to the research the paper noted that u s manufacturing employment and output increased at a robust pace in 2017 through much of 2018 but since late last year manufacturing output declined noticeably and manufacturing employment growth has stalled the institute of supply management s index of manufacturing activity released january 3 hit its lowest level since the end of the great recession in december u s manufacturing activity hits worst level since 2009 the index came in at 47 2 in december worse than the 49 economists expected falling 0 9 points from the prior month s reading any reading below 50 suggests the manufacturing sector is in contraction respondents to the survey which manufacture goods in 18 different industries noted sluggish demand for products as well as suppliers passing tariff related costs on to manufacturers preliminary job numbers released friday show that the year over year shift in manufacturing jobs was lower in december than in the first two years of trump s administration it was the second slowest year of growth for manufacturing since the great recession magic wand or not manufacturing employment is at its lowest density on record the number of jobs still grew up by 46 000 relative to december 2018 but the economy overall grew faster since the end of the recession the density of manufacturing jobs in the economy has been flat but from october to december that density was lower than it has been at any other point on record dropping below 8 45 percent of all employment in december it was 8 44 percent higher only than october s 8 43 percent when the gm strike temporarily pushed manufacturing numbers down since trump took office the economy has added 6 7 million jobs 487 000 of them in manufacturing that s 7 percent of the total a higher density than the last three years of obama s administration when 262 000 of about 8 million jobs were in manufacturing regardless the density of manufacturing in the economy is still sliding the lower graph above shows the problem there was a resurgence of the density of manufacturing jobs as a percentage of the workforce from mid 2017 to the beginning of 2019 but as employment in manufacturing stalled last year adding only 46 000 jobs that density has slipped this was obama s point the american economy has broadly shifted away from manufacturing and there isn t much trump could do to resuscitate it with or without a magic wand for the same reason the american economy is broadly shifting towards renewable sources of energy away from coal america s shift from coal to renewable energy has begun earlier this month a study found that the u s had more capacity installed for renewable energy than coal for the first time data from the energy information administration showed that wind solar and hydroelectric generated nearly 68 5 million megawatt hours of power in april while coal only generated 60 million bloomberg news reported that s 23 percent of total electricity from renewables vs 20 percent from coal according to the guardian the fate of coal has been sealed the market has spoken university of texas energy expert michael webber told the guardian the trend is irreversible now the decline of coal is unstoppable despite donald trump s rhetoric president trump had promised to boost coal and under his watch the u s environmental protection agency epa has worked to ease regulations impacting the industry most recently by replacing the obama era clean power plan even so at least 50 coal plants have shut since trump took office in 2017 the guardian reported the clearest sign yet that america s coal county is headed for widespread job cuts the amount of coal being produced per u s miner is at the lowest level in eight years the u s coal industry is expecting another wave of widespread job losses productivity has slid 11 this year alone the last time it was this low was in 2011 when coal companies ended up cutting almost half their workers in a downturn that lasted more than four years lower production means u s coal workers will each produce an average of about 12 700 tons this year based on an analysis of production estimates from the u s energy information administration and employment figures from the bureau of labor statistics that s the second lowest production rate in two decades the looming downturn comes as trump who vowed to rescue the coal industry by easing environmental regulations begins his re election campaign winning a second term will hinge in part on mining strongholds he carried in 2016 including west virginia and pennsylvania people are going to have to get laid off said andrew cosgrove a mining analyst for bloomberg intelligence they re going to have to close mines the moves reflect the confluence of woes pummeling the industry electricity producers are shunning the fuel in favor of cheaper natural gas wind and solar global prices for coal shipped to power plants have plunged by more than one third in the past year in both europe and asia met coal prices fell last month to the lowest since january 2017 and there s little sign of a recovery so get a clue pundits the stock market is not the economy or predictive of election results these are the

by andualem sisay gessesse hawassa ethiopia in summary following the economic growth of asian and far east countries that resulted in an increase of wage of the employees global textiles giants have been considering africa as their next destination ethiopia has emerged as one of the countries in africa showing great interest in hosting these companies with a vision of becoming the continent s manufacturing hub as the country celebrates the production commencement of hawassa industrial park on tuesday employees of some of the textile factories in the park say they are having difficulty to make a living with less than 1 5 a day wage the world bank considers people who earn less than 1 90 per day as living under poverty line andualem sisay investigates whether ethiopia s emerging textiles industry which relies on workers living under poverty line is sustainable on sunday june 18 2017 addis ababa based journalists are invited by the government to visit some of the new textiles factories in ethiopia s first environment friendly hawassa industrial park hip the park is named after one of the fastest growing city of ethiopia hawassa which is located 270 kilometers south of the capital addis ababa it was a few months back that etagu amsaro 27 was first informed by the people in the wereda a government structure at a lower level about the availability of a job for her in hawassa after passing through the screening and selection process she is selected as the candidate for the job at hip she then relocated to hawassa leaving her family in bensa daye of sidama zone which is 120 kilometers from hawassa i am not the only one there were many girls who came with me but they are now working in different factories she says she is among some 30 000 youth who are registered from the surrounding towns for screening to get a job at hip but after she is relocated life was not easy as for her the 1 002 birr around 43 at the prevailing exchange rate monthly wage she earns from one of the 18 textiles factories in the park is far too small it can t cover at least the cost for her meals house rent and transportation our salary is actually 650 birr around 28 per month they give us a total of 1 002 birr adding for transport and lunch this is not enough for me to make a living renting a house in hawassa she says indicating that she and her two friends are sharing rent cost for a small one room tesfanesh lemesa is another female employee working in the next door shed in hip which is co owned by chinese and u s investors she began working in jp textile ethiopia private limited company about two months ago like silver spark this factory has also not yet started production at its full capacity she gets paid 850 birr around 37 per month but unlike etagu she gets free lunch at the factory she came from durame town area some 50 kilometers and settled in hawassa city next door hip tsega sells foods coffee and tea in one of dozens of plastic shed restaurants some of hip employees eat their lunch here and in other similar restaurants next door she says boiled potato sauce with three small flat pieces of bread made of corn kitta is the cheapest meal most of hip employees go for according to tsega whose clients also include daily laborers in construction sector who earn between 40 50 birr over 1 7 close to 2 2 per day the cheapest rent for a small house ranging between 650 800 birr between 28 around 35 per month is only available in chefe and monopol area which are located at the outskirt of hawassa city as these places are 3 to 5 kilometers away from hip the taxis charge five birr for one way because most of them can t afford that they walk and at times get their mobile phones snatched by street vagabonds says one of the security guards recruited by an agency for 2 000 birr around 87 a month many of them report to us about this frequently we ask them why they are late for work and why they look exhausted he says stating that he and many of hip employees live in monopol area while others also are in chefe area if an employee of hip such as etagu spends 3 birr for a bread and tea breakfast daily and is forced to eat the cheapest meals available for lunch and dinner like the one tsega sells in the plastic sheds she he needs 390 birr close to 17 a month she he also needs around 300 birr 13 per month for transportation from hip to chefe monopol and back to the factory and if that individual pays the cheapest room available in the city 650 birr 28 she he needs to earn at least 1 340 birr 58 per month this is of course if the house rent includes water and electricity bill and that person never takes tea or coffee people who earn less than 1 90 per day are considered as living below poverty line according to the world bank that increased the amount from 1 25 per day a few years ago we rented a house in hawassa city with other female employees because i can t afford to rent a house alone but since i had no job before but now i have one i have not much to complain about at this stage tesfanesh says hoping that salary may get improved as the factory goes fully operational now the wage in asia is getting more and more expensive as people have other avenues of livelihood says vishal bist business head at silver spark apparel ethiopia private limited company the price of a shirt with a specific brand you bought ten years ago may not change that much if you buy that shirt today meanwhile the salaries of the employees will definitely be increasing during those ten years so that is why the industry is constantly trying to find the right balance says mr bist who noted that the suits his company is now producing in ethiopia with brands such as raimond and esperante are exported between 30 40 while the retail price in the united states or the european union can usually be four times this price the wages that we pay are going to be in line with the global market the forces of economics do not allow to disproportionately high or disproportionately low he argues stating that ethiopia has still to go 20 25 years to reach where the countries that increased their wages for textiles sector because the people have got other better paying alternatives in search of cheap labor destinations like ethiopia relocating their factories from one country to another has been one of the major strategies of textile factories for the past several decades after two years when all the 18 textiles factories fully commence operation hip is expected to create jobs for 60 000 youth and generate one billion u s dollars export revenue just like hip within two years period the government also hopes to have a total of 15 different industrial parks across the country and create two million jobs for the youth it is argued that the benefits of providing jobs for the likes of etagu and tesfanesh and tens of thousands of youth who had no prior experience in the textiles industry at all has much more benefits for the country and the society than just monetary value but the issue also needs immediate attention by the government before the frustration in the making in the minds of hip employees grows and infects the attitudes of the emerging generation and the society in general towards ethiopia s industrial parks as well as those who are forced to work and live below poverty line i suggest they should cover our house renting cost at least or increase our salary etagu says responding to what she would like to be improved at the factory prime minister hailemariam desalegn of ethiopia who spoke at the inaugural of hip this morning said indeed one can say construction of sheds in industrial parks is fairly easy the complicated and the challenging job is to turn our vision into concrete result and full success at the end of this month the total number of jobs created at hip by the textiles factories is estimated to reach 10 000 our vision is to become africa s manufacturing hub by 2025 said prime minister hailemariam desalegn speaking at the inauguration of hip we aim is to create millions of jobs in labor intensive light manufacturing industries he said all hip employees have gone through a job screening by the association of the textiles factories and got both soft and skills training before employment before they become employees they got one week soft training on such as work ethics and discipline as well as one month skills training in the factories says dr belachew mekuria head of industrial park development section at ethiopian investment commission ethiopia which is a nation of young generation with some cities unemployment rate reaching as high as 24 has long been trying to develop job intensive industries close to hawassa airport and an electric railway that links to port of djibouti hip has a total of 52 sheds constructed on a land of 26 000 square meters it also has 1 000 houses built for the expats who work in the factories while two in addis are already operational three more are expected to be inaugurated in the coming few months the country plans to complete the construction of the sheds of in all the 15 special industrial parks within two years period the initiative has three main objectives among others speeding the transformation of ethiopian agrarian economy to industrialization boosting the export revenue of the country and reducing the trade balance deficit as well as creating millions of jobs in the light manufacturing industries this is the beginning we need to change and bring suitable business environment in our country dr arkebe okubay advisor to the prime minister hailemariam desalegn said mentioning that it is a disgrace for the country to continue receiving food aid and see its citizens migrating illegally risking their lives while ethiopia has the potential and opportunity to change its history for good trained in china before the construction of hip commences jp textile ethiopia plc a joint venture of chinese and american investors selected 25 ethiopians who are graduated in textiles from a university and trained them mandarin chinese language in addis ababa for eight months they then went to shanghai to get on job skills training on weaving and making textiles and garment for six months coming back from the training they took part in the installation of machineries for jp textiles in hip they are now instrumental in teaching other ethiopians jp textiles is recruiting for its new garment factory though we study the science at a university here what we have seen during our stay is very new to us and practical we learned new techniques we are now sharing this knowledge with other colleagues in this factory said wossen niguse who is graduated in textile from bahir dar university in ethiopia and one of the 25 trainees went to china for practical knowledge the construction of hip which provides all the government facilities for the factories including visa issuing customs services power substation with a waste water treatment and recycling plant has taken 11 months what is required from the companies is to bring their machineries duty free install train their employees for few weeks then start production the government believes that the new plugin and play industrial park is much more efficient and reduces the several years an investor spends before starting production to six months securing land building a factory on their own getting other government services by moving from agency to another were among the major headaches investors were complaining about like hip which took 11 months to complete construction the government is planning to inaugurate two parks mekele industrial park and kombolcha industrial park in the coming september according to dr arkebe who briefed journalists on sunday in hawassa a day ahead of the inauguration of hip unlike the previous model of industrial zones in which ethiopia tried to create industrial zones for all sort of industries in one place and or for one nation such as chinese industrial zone turkish and the like the new approach focuses on one specialized industry park that focuses one sector industry most of the factories in hip will be exporting to the united states and european markets where ethiopia can access export duty free privileges with retail stores across the united states pvh corporation which owns some of best global brands such as calvin klein is also at the forefront of the establishment of hip and is engaged for the first time in the manufacturing of textiles environment friendly industries the new model though targets the already priority focus industries of the country textiles pharmaceuticals chemicals leather and agro processing it aims to attach each park to raw materials and logistics such the railway route that ease import and export of the factories most of all it also aims to make all the future industries of the country climate friendly and non environment pollutant the zero liquid discharge plant installed in hip treats recycles and uses 90 of the industrial water the water treatment plant has the capacity of treating 11 million liters of water daily the fact that we reuse the 90 of the water means saving that much amount of water from being pumped from the ground every day says lalit kewalramani chief project manager of arvind an indian company which installed the water treatment system and handles the operation for the coming two years the cost for such water treatment facility including construction may reach 2 5 million for installation of a plant with a capacity of treating one million liters water per day according to mr kewalramani he estimated the total cost for hip water treatment facility to be around 27 5 million had it been done by arvind which signed mou to implement the same water treatment for all the remaining 14 industrial parks on the pipeline including the water sewerage treatment plant the ethiopian government has invested a total of 300 million dollars for hip
it s that time of year when investment analysts break out their crystal balls and issue predictions for what the upcoming year will bring for financial markets this year i ve decided to throw my hat in the ring by answering the top financial questions about 2020 from my clients and cbc listeners will there be a global recession in 2020 i don t think we will see a recession as long as the central banks around the world keep interest rates low and continue expanding their balance sheets they are kicking the can down the road by printing more money and throwing it at the economy conditions that are positive for stocks and stave off recessions forecast no recession in 2020 how will the stock markets fare in 2020 stock market investors were treated very well in 2019 with both north american and international markets experiencing double digit gains u s stocks were up by almost 30 per cent while canadian chinese and european stock indices returned approximately 20 per cent forecast stock markets will be higher than they are today but returns will be less then they were in 2019 mid to high single digit returns for the north american markets how will the u s election affect the stock markets during a u s election year markets typically trend higher and finish the year with high single digit gains they also tend to be quite volatile so i m expecting a couple of inter year market corrections of at least 10 per cent these corrections often occur when the political mud slinging intensifies during the summer months leading up to the election however once a winner is declared markets typically stabilize before finishing the year strong forecast increased market volatility with several inter year corrections which i would treat as buying opportunities how will the u s iran conflict affect our economy and stock markets entering 2020 investors were feeling comfortable but that all changed when a u s drone killed a senior iranian military figure and iran vowed to retaliate following the attack oil prices the canadian dollar and gold rose while stocks sold off since the attack markets have recovered most of their losses and some i e the toronto stock exchange are at new all time highs forecast while the middle east conflict is upsetting and worth monitoring i believe that other international factors such as u s china trade negotiations brexit and the u s and china s central banks willingness to stimulate their economies will have more of an impact on global stock markets and economies should i be making changes to my investment portfolio since 2019 was a great year for global stock markets now is a good time to trim some profits and re allocate them to investments that are more defensive as 2020 is expected to be quite volatile speak to your advisor about your portfolio s downside protection strategy as well as how it is positioned to benefit from an increase in market gyrations consider tweaking the geographic asset allocation of your portfolio do not be afraid to add to u s and international positions forecast canada will under perform compared to the u s and international stock markets overall i m expecting slow growth to continue for most of the world economies and i believe that stocks will outperform bonds this column is part of cbc s opinion section for more information about this section please read our faq
the san diego union tribune editorial board interviewed four candidates in the 50th congressional district race ahead of the march 3 2020 primary election in which the top two vote getters will advance to a runoff election in november below is the transcript of our dec 4 2019 interview with republican candidate brian jones who is running to succeed duncan hunter in a district that represents residents in a large swath of san diego county including el cajon escondido alpine julian borrego springs and some of riverside county this interview was transcribed using the digital transcription service temi and checked for accuracy by a staffer to call any errors to our attention or to ask any questions about our interviews please email matthew hall sduniontribune com with the subject line election interviews union tribune thanks for coming in and tell us uh why you threw your hat in the ring for this congressional seat brian jones well as you all probably remember i ran in 08 when the last time it was an open seat wasn t quite exactly in an i mean legally it was an open seat but functionally it wasn t an open seat with duncan jr taking duncan sr s place so but i did come in second at that in that race we ran a really good race then which really kind of prepped me for winning the assembly seat in 2010 that was a tough republican primary and i was the top vote getter obviously and that was one of the that was the last you know regular primary uh was 2010 then we switched to the top two after that uh for this race in particular um you know i just feel like i m the most qualified to represent this district and i ve got two challengers that don t live in the district that uh for whatever reason think that they re better positioned to represent east county north county and riverside and i ve represented this area for almost 20 years if you count my service on the santee city council originally elected there in 2002 uh but i served in other various capacities uh since 2000 in santee elected six times in this district the district the congressional district overlaps my current senate district by 87 i just won election 13 months ago the voters in this district are used to voting for me they know me they trust me um i know them i trust them i think we have i ve got a great relationship with my constituents and i look forward to continuing to represent them now in washington d c advertisement the voters in this district are used to voting for me they know me they trust me brian jones q most people don t even know the state senate districts are way bigger than congressional districts a most people don t that s right yeah they re uh congressional districts are around 600 000 people senate districts around 900 000 some states have less people than my senate district meet other candidates in the race commentary meet the candidates for the 50th congressional district these are four of the major candidates seeking to succeed congressman duncan hunter in the 2020 primary election q because it came up yesterday with issa i was going to ask you the same question um first the general thought about duncan hunter and then what about the thought advanced by issa that president trump should consider commuting his sentence a uh well i ll start with the second i don t have an opinion on that um i don t uh that s up to the president and conversations that he has with the hunter family if he did i wouldn t um make a big stink about it i don t think uh that s a political thing that those two parties have to figure out i wouldn t advocate for it or advocate against it uh in that case uh specifically you know the hunters have been a institution in san diego county now duncan sr originally representing south bay which a lot of people don t remember but then as things got redistricted transitioned out to east county and north county um and they ve done a great job standing up for traditional family values they ve done a great job of standing up for the pro life movement they ve done a great job of supporting our military and those are all uh traditions that i hope to continue and i ve done those same things in the state assembly and the state senate so i have a track record that shows that ideologically i m aligned with their legacy and would hope to continue on that type of representation for this district in addition to that i you know i would love to have a cooperative transition uh duncan jr kind of opened that salvo the other day uh in one of his uh speeches that you know he wants to have a smooth transition i would hope to have a smooth transition as well my current staff works very well in cooperation with his staff uh we have great communications great cooperation on constituent services so i think that that would be uh i think i would offer the smoothest transition of the three of us actually uh into this office advertisement rep duncan hunter u t q when do you think if at all he should step down a you know that s a weird interesting question uh and i hadn t really given it much thought until somebody else asked yesterday and i just kind of assumed it was all gonna be in one package that uh he announces he s not running and then announces the resignation so it really doesn t matter functionally when he resigns it s going to be a mess regardless you know regarding a special election so does he resign now and the special election is combined with the march 3 special election we re running out of time for the governor to be able to combine those two things um you know there s positives there s advantages and disadvantages to that uh if he waits until longer and then the special election s after the primary there s certainly advantages to that in that you know whoever wins the primary in march uh for the republicans uh i would hope uh the others would sit out the special election um i certainly would and um and if i win and i expect to win the primary in march i hope that the other two or everybody else would commit to that as well because we don t need two um well that would be a fiasco that there were the regular election in march is not a fiasco um but that we could potentially have a political fiasco but i can only i can only control my behavior q if his sentencing isn t until march 17 went off memory uh that s obviously after a right i don t think he s obligated to stay in office until march 17 um my understanding from your all reporting is that he s back in d c right now discussing with mccarthy and pelosi on you know transitioning obviously i think they should include the governor in that conversation and the republican leadership in california um you know we all have an interest in this so q in hindsight would you have supported it if he had stepped down earlier like well before today given the charges that he plead guilty to advertisement a sure my intention was never to run against him i wanted to give him the space and uh the time to get all of his legal issues worked out you know originally we thought the election was or not the election the um trial was going to be in september so i was fully prepared to you know get going after that we had you know stuff in order and ready to go um but then when the trial got delayed and then you know the filing deadline is this week and the party moved up their endorsement process to october we had no choice but to get in and start running right away so yeah my personal preference would have been for him to have stepped down earlier but um it is what it is again like i said i can only control my behavior in these types of situations and hope that everybody else uh chooses to do what s best for the district q given where we are now i read let me know if this is accurate that you missed out on the gop endorsement by two votes a two votes and that s a supermajority that s a two thirds majority yeah i had 31 votes you needed 33 and duncan had 18 q do you wish that he wasn t a factor in that then a if he hadn t been a factor i would have gotten the endorsement absolutely q that would have made a huge difference advertisement a absolutely yeah q so does that then weaken your campaign or hurt your campaign that you don t have that a uh it would have helped it to have it it doesn t hurt it to not have it it would have only yeah it s only positive to have gotten it so uh the campaign is what it is without it it would have certainly helped to have had it q the dean of american conservative pundits george will says he s never seen anything like the abasement of republican elected officials in how they treat trump and they look the other way so where are you on a scale of one to 10 are you maga all the way are you a man with many reservations or are you off the reservation a oh that s a good question i like how you put that um i would say and then they asked me downstairs too i support the results that he s getting that s helping america do better and do great and uh the economy obviously is humming right now uh unemployment is as low as it s ever been across the board across the spectrum um those are all good things that i absolutely support you know some of his tactics and and i guess personality traits you know i have differences i would manage things personally a little bit different than he does but the bottom line is he went to washington d c to drain the swamp and the swamp doesn t want to be drained so whenever you go into a situation like that no matter your personality or no matter your background and you re trying to upset the political and power structure of an area you re going to get pushback uh from his own party from the obviously the opposite party uh so we shouldn t be surprised that he s taken the hits that he s taken uh across the board on this because he really is i think trying to restore the power structure of washington d c back to the people and the power over the last 30 or 40 years has been concentrated and centralized both in the republican party and absolutely in the democrat party to washington d c and that s not how our country functions best our country functions best when politics is closest to the people and the people are in charge advertisement q but what about trump s use of executive orders to take thing to do things that no president s ever done before i mean it started 15 years ago with bush and signing statements was merely saying i don t like this law and won t enforce it and then obama rewrote uh the affordable care act and he also wrote the schools initiative and now we ve got trump saying i can even build infrastructure without congress blessing is this a positive thing a i think that there s a lot of um criticism that can be levied on the executive order uh program and i apologize i don t know any specific executive order that he s written that i ve uh that i m familiar with at this point in time actually q to build the wall 6 8 billion was diverted from the pentagon and from other sources a well some of the security stuff i might be persuaded that an executive order is proper um you know some of the other things you you can t write policy the president should not be able to write policy and or a law by executive order and so we do need to return some of that influence and power back to congress we got the same thing going on in sacramento the majority party legislature has abdicated a lot of their authority to the governor especially when gov brown was governor and i think the legislature did not hold the departments accountable to the taxpayers as much as they should have and i think that same thing is actually happening in washington d c right now too and so uh to try to be more specific to your question i think and i agree with you that obama is kind of the one that started us down this road um we need to we need to pull that back we need to pull that executive order authority back too and increase the authority of congress on that q what do you see as the biggest threat to america a uh i right now i think it s internal um i think that the leftist ideology that has taken over the democratic party right now in america and especially in california is um if that catches hold and the young people of america today grow up thinking that socialism is okay and that we re going to promote socialism and we re going to embrace socialism as the future of america that s our biggest threat i think uh the external threats we re going to handle those currently i think we re prepared enabled to handle the external threats from around the world as far as militarily and other things um but you know i have democrat colleagues in sacramento that are as concerned about this leftist ideology as i am uh taking over their party and they re all scrambling trying to find ways of you know how do we counter this within our own party advertisement rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y speaks with other lawmakers during a break from testimony from facebook ceo mark zuckerberg before a house financial services committee hearing on capitol hill in washington wednesday oct 23 2019 ap photo andrew harnik associated press q what specifically when you use the word socialism or leftist ideology are you talking about a well when you look at a lot of the coverage on social media of the um college campuses today that when a conservative speaker or even a libertarian speaker comes to campus to just give a speech the uh violence that they re met with and the animosity and the resistance of the administration that are scared oh if this person comes and speaks our campus is going to blow up well control your campus you know and have the speaker so that s one thing specifically uh aoc and the green new deal uh i don t i can t think of a time in history maybe when john kennedy was a freshman he might be the example historically but as a freshman congresswoman from the east coast on the west coast we shouldn t even know who she is or what she s promoting or pushing and that a function of obviously social media instant news and the media i think building her up because she s a good story but 20 30 years ago she would ve gotten no traction you know nationally and i think that s you know the way it should be um you know the founding fathers they were more concerned about the state legislature s having the influence on our day to day lives than they more so than congress but because of media and press uh again that power and influence is centralized to washington d c and um i think the american people need to recognize that realize it and try to take that influence back q but aren t you fighting kind of a losing deal i mean ever since teddy roosevelt and they passed the laws governing slaughterhouse foods the federal regulation of the economy has expanded and expanded and expanded and in the 1930s it was repeatedly upheld by the supreme court and the money is at the federal level now so that s why the federal influence is so great it gathers much more taxes than all the states combined a right q so what are you fighting for a return to pre 1906 advertisement a well no not that you know we we ve got to be smart about this right so you look at my legislative package over the last seven years in uh sacramento and of the 26 bills that i ve gotten signed by either governor uh the majority of my packages regulatory reform that helps people either live better or do business better in california i would like to take that same perspective to washington d c and and start looking for ways to uh tame the beast i guess so to speak uh and if i was in the majority party in sacramento there s lots of more things you know i would do as far as tax reform and regulatory reform i ve done what i can from the position i m in and you know as leadership as caucus chair for the republicans uh in sacramento and getting common sense reforms passed obviously bipartisan cause i needed you know democrats to vote for my bills so um i would hope to take that uh success uh to washington d c and get some good stuff done there as well and start no and we re not going to go back to 1906 but can we start you know taming it a little bit i think we can q california s leaders have had a vastly different position on how the border should be handled compared to the federal government a right q wondering what do you think as a california representative where do you come down and how we re handling the border a well i support intelligent immigration meaning we know who s coming across the border back and forth and um when we ve got criminal elements uh sneaking across our border we need to do everything we can to shut that down why my democrat colleagues don t understand that as well i m at a loss to explain and i ve asked them and they don t have an explanation either i think for right now it s just political for them if there was a democrat in the presidency they might have a different tone they definitely would have a different tone towards the border um and i think they would be more cooperative with the federal government doing the law enforcement that it needs to do to protect our border so that s my best answer you d have to ask the democratic leadership why they re so and why there s so much animosity towards the federal government on protecting our border a mcallen k 9 police officer walks past rebar that will make up the border wall before dhs acting homeland secretary chad wolf tours and speaks to the local media at the border wall under construction on thursday nov 21 2019 south of donna texas the monitor via ap associated press advertisement q but do you support diverting money from the military to building the wall a i think if it s done intelligently and it s not a large uh if it doesn t negatively impact the current mission of our military then maybe it s appropriate uh this is a security issue um so i think it falls in line with that q in 1994 after the contract with america the house went republican and two years later we began having a series of budget surpluses basically because the congress was pretty tight on the budget and clinton to his credit didn t get in the way of some things that other more liberal presidents might have as far as economy goes but since then things have gone to hell we re on track to spend 25 of our budget on interest on the debt and the old republican restraint that was billed as core to the party is long gone and so uh what is your view of of the spending problem and how would you address it a well again you can look at my track record in washington d c area and sacramento um on on on the budget i sit i ve sat on the budget committee several times i do my very best uh through the committee process to trim down the spending uh of whatever department that i m overseeing at that point in time in obviously cooperation with the chair uh when i was in the assembly the budget chair that i the subcommittee i sit on he and i uh cooperated quite well on a lot of things so i was able to uh scale back some of the spending in the state at that point in time when the final budget comes uh you know it s up or down vote on the full budget in california i ve always been a no vote because there s lots of things in the budget i don t agree with we need to get that same discipline principle principled spending discipline back to washington d c and um that s not sustainable 25 on debt no american home can support that no american business can support that there s no way that the american economy can support that long term i think one of the good things that s happened recently is the president has grown the economy so that uh we re better prepared to deal with uh some of that uh debt but at the end of the day it s congress s responsibility is trim back the spending and ronald reagan had that problem when he was president he tried to trim back the spending he had tax cuts that got uh approved and passed the economy started to grow and the democratically controlled congress at that point in time outspent him and uh grew the debt again so the the packages there the know how how to do it is there grow the economy reduce spending and that s how we we need to get that same discipline principle principled spending discipline back to washington d c brian jones q but trump has ruled out making any changes in entitlement programs and he s ruled out any cuts to the military budget so what s left domestic programs that are already getting their lowest level of funding pretty much since the 1960s so i just i don t i don t hear an explanation to how you get to significant reductions if you start by taking the three biggest items off the table and the fourth biggest item is interest on the debt advertisement a sure well he s the president right he s not congress so um now and i get it you know congress can pass a package and he can veto it but so a couple of steps is republicans need to get back in the majority republicans need to be disciplined republicans need to pass a spending bill and put it on the president s desk and if the president signs it great we all win if president doesn t sign it then it s on the president at that point in time my job as a congressman is to go control spending and put a bill on the president s desk for him to sign or not sign and that s what i m going to work towards doing q so would you rule out cuts to the military medicare and medicaid at this a at this point in time i m not familiar enough with the details of each uh item but i gotta believe there s probably some areas that can be trimmed back changed or uh altered to uh control the spending a little bit more q what d you think of trump s tax cuts and his idea being floated you know in some circles that maybe it s time for another tax cut a well so do you want to start with the last tax cut or the one coming up or where do you want to okay so on the last one in this particular district that would have been a tough vote uh that tax cut and especially since it hit california you know it impacted californians right because of the uh salt uh deduction i think uh if i was the congressman at the time i would have held a bunch of town halls i would have wanted to get to the point where i could support the bill and have the support of my constituents which is important right and one of the things that i ve always uh tried to do is when i m taking a tough vote that i think is right for the state for the city or in this case the country is communicate that early so that the constituents understand where we re going with this i think overall it was a good vote uh to support the tax reforms the folks that were negatively impacted through the salt uh were probably positively impacted by the economy growing and hopefully for those business owners their businesses grew and they were able to make more money that made up some of the difference uh for the deductions that they lost for the country as a whole i think it was a good package and i think it s borne itself out that it s been a good package um and i would ve done my very best to have some town halls do some communicating with my constituents to get their feedback and uh hopefully all of us walk that path together to get to that point q you mentioned the coming tax cut is that something you would support or is it not the right time advertisement a well i you know unfortunately i don t know enough about the the package that s being proposed right now so um i guess i ll have to abstain from answering that one until i can study it some more q the economy you mentioned the economy is doing well it s doing well in some areas the stock market stuff the job numbers are looking good but they re the manufacturing numbers that are doing terribly farmers are struggling because of the the tariffs um and just this week the president said uh he s willing to wait until after the election to finish negotiations with china should should these be political mechanisms to use in an election cycle a well let s go back to manufacturing is doing terribly i mean it s it s not it may have come down a little bit from when he was took over as president but i think it s better than it was before he was president so i i d have to quantify you know manufacturing is doing terrible uh you know what that means to the whoever s opining that um the the negotiations with china we ve been nixon you know i was part of this you know he s kinda one that got the ball rolling on this right 50 years ago 45 years ago and we ve gotten where we ve gotten it whatever messaging donald trump is taking out of this and presenting to us that s one thing what he s doing behind the scenes is probably another thing that i m not privy to um and are we gonna change things with china in three and a half short years that has been building for 40 years or does he need some more time to do it i think he probably needs some more time to do it um the political question though is on messaging how s he messaging it um and you know maybe that s one of the things i would message different than than how he messages it he s the one responsible for it so um you know i i would be as a congressman i d be paying attention i d be you know it impacts california we re a major trade partner with china california has trade missions from the legislature as a matter of fact i sat one out i was invited to go uh this fall on a trade mission to china and i opted not to go because uh you know running a race um but uh i would go and find out what s going on over there and and get some firsthand knowledge on how we trade better with china protect american businesses and interests and intellectual property and uh help build our economy and we build america s economy the other economies get built too q what do you think of tpp a t uh advertisement q the trans pacific partnership the trade deal that trump kind of scuttled with china which a lot of people paint as a positive and others side with the president a again i don t know the details enough on that one to um give a good response this minute q the president s had a big problem with nato and the way the extent to which the united states participates and other countries don t do you think he s on the right track here is nato becoming obsolete or already obsolete a i don t think nato is obsolete um maybe the way they ve done things for the last 40 50 60 years might need to be updated but certainly getting the other countries to pull their fair share of the cost i think i support that 100 um look they re not going to like that several of these countries have gotten free rides for you know decades of course they re going to be upset with the president when they re having to open their checkbook and start paying their fair share uh that criticism should be expected and i i think he s handling it well and i think he was prepared for that criticism q but that s not the only complaint he makes about nato he suggests that he will only decide whether or not to honor nato s obligations that the u s come to the defense of another country on an a la carte basis which kind of destroys the whole point of having a treaty in which each side promises itself the other is that an intellectually serious position that the president has to say oh this treaty that s been in place for 50 years i ll do i ll decide on whether i ll live by depending on which country is involved a i was actually going to throw that same question back at you is it intellectually serious um you know i i think sometimes the president uses rhetoric and um you know to to make a point or to put people on edge or you know he s a businessman he s he s used to negotiating business deals he s not a politician so he s not going to have the smooth um you know foreign service language of dealing with these countries and again i think it goes to some of his success is because he s not traditional politics he s able to get some things accomplished that other presidents wouldn t have been able to get accomplished on this point specifically i can t answer for him whether that s intellectually serious or not um you know i think you ve got to look at his track record you know he s threatened tariffs that he didn t actually put in place he threatened tariffs that he did put in place um you know those are that that might be an issue where i have uh some challenges as i become more familiar with tariffs and and their proper use i might have some challenges with the president on some of his tariffs but on nato uh it s okay with me that the president s going in there and shaking it up and then let s see uh how as as the congress the u s house of representatives along with the senate and the foreign service professionals um redesign it so that it s more effective for america and our closest allies advertisement q but that gets to the whole critique of trump s critique trump in 2016 said we ve been getting ripped off by everybody in the world and we have been for decades and decades over the last 70 years like 3 billion people have been lifted out of poverty in general because we have a stable world where we ve got trading rules have agreed on a rising tide lifts all boats blah blah blah so trump s criticism is based on the idea that we haven t had a successful 75 years of these institutions after world war ii well we have a well i guess uh i haven t heard him say that but if trump is saying that nato is not successful i would disagree with that i think it s had some success but the majority of that success has been on america s checking account the other countries need to do it it was the way it was set up the way it was chartered the other countries need to do their fair share q the george w bush george h w bush argument is that america benefits from a very stable world so if we re paying more we re also benefiting from from our overall framework a sure but if we can get the other countries to pay more and we pay less why is that not better if we re having the same result q let me ask you about uh you ve run run a lot of elections won a lot of elections uh as a congressional leader what should be done to ensure election integrity if anything california s system voting system is absolutely not the example the rest of the country should be following we re are the example you should do the opposite of what california is doing as far as voter integrity brian jones advertisement a well one of the things easiest one right off the bat is uh identification uh voter id uh it s been proven one of the arguments against voter id is that it suppresses minority voter turnout it s been proven in the other states that have put it in place that it absolutely does not do that in fact some states have shown that minority turnout actually increases because they trust the system more than uh than a non voter id system california s system voting system is absolutely not the example the rest of the country should be following we re are the example you should do the opposite of what california is doing as far as voter integrity um the democrat leadership uh in california has in my in my opinion devalued and devalued the voting experience to where people in california now a lot of people in california at the point now where they just don t trust it and i ve had constituents tell me why do i even bother voting because i go vote and then it gets turned over in the courts or the the legislature turns it over or does whatever the so for example rent control was an initiative last year and the voters overwhelmingly turned it down and the legislature took five weeks from the november election six weeks from the november election what however many weeks it is to january to start introducing bills to do exactly what the initiative did and uh that the voters didn t want so that s actually two answers one is the voter id and then one is the legislature being responsive to what the voters vote for and the gas tax one too um you know we we got a attorney general that wrote a uh you know a a bogus uh title and summary that s and but i m not and i m not gonna make any excuse for the failure of the gas tax because as proponents of initiatives we should know that we should be prepared so the people that ran that gas tax should have been ready for that and ran a proper campaign to do a better job with that gas tax repeal q so that s a dig at one of your opponents in this race a well i you know he took a bunch of money and spent it in the 50th congressional district and he didn t spend it in the 53rd so um you tell me yes q what are your thoughts on uh marijuana descheduling it legalizing it a i ve been very careful with my votes in sacramento on marijuana and so a couple of um as a recreational item i have a really hard time getting there uh as a medicinal value so i voted for a bill that jim bartell carried or uh juan vargas carried the bill i m sorry not juan vargas ben hueso carried the bill um that jim bartell uh asked to be carried for his son who died of pancreatic cancer and he died in seattle and in the last six weeks of his life i mean he had pancreatic cancer you know you re you re not gonna make it i mean that s the most deadly cancer i think right now and he was on opioids and you know everything else and all that does is put you to sleep you can t function um your your it impacts your cognitive abilities he had a uh not a medical doctor but a doctor of some sort that had was able to mix up a marijuana thc based pain reliever that he was able to administer in the hospital under controlled circumstances and the last four or five weeks of his life had some quality of life time with his family awake cognitive able to communicate um if there are legitimate examples of that and uses a obviously i supported that opening it up um you know i believe the science it says it has a negative impact on children has a negative impact on adolescents it has a negative impact on on a young twenties when their brains aren t fully developed by the age of 25 and so i have a hard time you just making it completely available advertisement q what about the banking bill a so thank you i q only two house republicans from california voted for it a i think i voted for it q no no no i m talking about in the u s house passed a federal bill what we need is a federal bill right because a state bill would be open to vulnerability a yes so that s one of the other things i m trying to be careful about on my votes as far as the you know the it s law it s legal obviously recreational use is legal in california that s the law i disagree with the law but it s the law that has had a lot of unintended consequences one of them is banking one of them is management you know process one of his tax collection uh i every and we ve had a big package of those bills come across our desk in 2016 when i was in the assembly and this year in the senate and i evaluate each one of those on its own merits sometimes i vote for them sometimes i don t and um so i d have to get back to you on my specific votes because i apologize it i don t have them all memorized um and i m happy to do that if if you re interested advertisement q what do you think in general of the concept of banking and letting uh the industry be regulated so that you don t have crime and a well it s a lot i get that no that s my point it s law in california so we ve got to get it regulated so that it s uh you know get it out of the shadows and um you know get it get it regulated and get it controlled so as a city council member uh you know i m one of the nice things about the way the law is currently written is that as a city councilor i don t have to approve dispensaries in my city which we didn t and i i support that if another city wants to have dispensaries in their city then they need to have a mechanism to tax it regulated and uh have the proper um security and public safety that goes along with it q did you vote for the california data privacy act that takes effect on january 1st a i wasn t in the legislature for the original package there was a bunch of um uh redo packages or bills this year i voted for some and didn t vote for others q in congress republicans are being lobbied by the giant tech companies to pass a federal law that would supersede california s law and that would be significantly weaker in california s law in terms of allowing the tech companies to continue to have access to and to use for marketing individual data what do you think a well i the the specifics of the bill i don t know uh having a federal bill i would i mean if it s the right bill with the right ideas i would support a federal bill because uh where we re at now is we ve got california and two or three other states you know attack you know addressing this um california some of the stuff we did is good and some of the stuff we did is not good that s why i voted for some of it and against other pieces of it um but we can t you know i don t think in the in the global economy the market that we have now i don t think we can have 50 different states having 50 different regulations um we we need uh common sense uh data package for the entire country advertisement q but it was reagan who saw it and got an exception for california on clean air rules because california had uniquely bad emissions california still has probably the worst emissions of any state so it shouldn t california still have a waiver to allow it to deal with this problem or do you support the trump s effort to say one national standard a so are we segueing from from privacy to emissions or q no it s the idea of federal standards versus state standards a well sure i and i i it s a legitimate question but uh you re commingling them i i think you got to look at them at individual topics you know and just because i agree with with privacy federally um you know does that mean i on emissions standards i was we moved to california i was 10 i lived in santee that s a valley i remember smog days we didn t have very many but i remember a couple and i remember several days uh exercising and uh being in little league and i don t have asthma and losing my breath so the air s a lot better now than it was in 1978 and um california has done a good job of setting the standard but again i think it s you know i think we could have a national standard whether that s what california s doing or whether it s different than that s a debate that s a political debate right but um i you know i i think we have to look at each item individually as to whether it deserves federal regulation or not traffic crawls along a san diego county freeway hayne palmour iv the san diego union tribune q where d you come down on that issue because obviously automakers are bifurcating you know some are siding with trump s standards which are lesser than california s and which which do you think should be the path forward advertisement a i m not sure at this point in time it needed to be upset um but if it did need to be upset i would probably lean towards uh trump s uh ideas on this one uh because if if california s was uh the gold standard then all the other states would do it automatically q thirteen states with a third of the population do a sure so at this point in time it was a really a conversation that needed to be start get started i don t know i mean i uh obviously he look a lot of this is um i think can be argued as rhetorical as well i mean there there is a legit not illegitimate ideological debate between california leadership and trump administration and i believe that the california leadership is harming california by continually poking the federal administration on every little thing that they can come up with now fortunately this year uh it wasn t as bad as previous years the the the pro tem this year has tamped that way down she s done a great job i support her efforts in doing that the prior pro tem was out of control and uh challenging the trump administration on every little thing so we ve got a i think it s responsible for the media it s responsible for me as an elected representative to make sure we re cutting through the b s and what s the real issue and let s debate the real issue i believe that the california leadership is harming california by continually poking the federal administration on every little thing that they can come up with brian jones q so we ve talked about picking your battles from california and trump and saying california probably is picking too many battles but climate change may be the battle right i mean do you think the u s should be in the paris climate accord a no advertisement q why not a i don t i think that uh america has shown that it can control and regulate its own pollutants and efforts in this area we don t need an accord with whatever other countries are over polluting and not paying attention to these policies if other countries just did what we did the world would automat would quickly become cleaner than it is now one of the arguments i ve been making since 2012 in the assembly is the 1990 uh clean air standard well and every bill that deals with climate change and uh emissions in california is we gotta get back to the 1990 standard or 1990 condition of air and i ve asked somewhat rhetorically but somewhat seriously where is this jar of 1990 air being stored so that when we take our air samples we know we re there there is no jar it s all based on regulating the economy taxing producers and very little to do with actual uh changes in emissions and or cleaning up the environment q that s not what they say at the scripps institute the scripps institute has measured the composition of the atmosphere for 80 years they know exactly what the levels of the greenhouse gas emissions were in 1990 and the whole reason why a well why don t my colleagues tell me that when i ask them obviously they don t know that either q well anyway but the whole point of the attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is that the one scientific theory that a concentration of gases would lead to higher temperatures is no longer a theory it s no longer a theory of where we re going through the hottest years and measured human history seven of the last eight years have been a month you know the hottest years in history and it s getting worse and in australia you re seeing like the climate is like four weeks different like summers a month longer now so the argument that this is all theoretical or trump s argument that it s all b s what do you say a well the fact that the earth is getting warmer i agree with you it probably is um but is it human caused and that s not proven that s not settled science um if it is human caused can we change the course of it now uh can america uh alone can california alone change that course no absolutely not we cannot because we re not the biggest polluters in the world if california shut down every single emitter in the state every car every factory every industry that emits greenhouse gas emissions it would have i think the number and this is from memory from awhile ago 0 0004 effect on the globe so why aren t we talking to china and india and these other countries that are grossly polluting their environments and start there and let america continue to do what it s doing that it s already doing advertisement q but that was the point of the paris climate accord a okay great but are they complying with it are they making changes are they no they re not i think beijing in the last olympics they almost had to cancel the olympics because the air is so bad in beijing we ve never had air that bad en in los angeles in the worst days of the 70s q oh actually in the 40s they did in the 40s los angeles had emergency rules because they were like melt they had like a metals facility right on figueroa in los angeles that was pumping pollution into the air and people were in fact getting sick a well i know i m just saying it s yeah i m not saying it wasn t bad i m saying it wasn t as bad as beijing is now q but isn t the science settled though i mean 99 out of 100 scientists including government scientists will tell you that humanity is causing a no i don t think it s settled i think it s a matter i know like i m not a i m not a if we want to get into a climate change debate and i need to you know bone up a little bit on my research on this but um no there s serious scientists that are now questioning that conclusion and questioning that um conference of scientists that the 99 of that s one conference of scientists there s multiple conferences of scientists that study this stuff and have differing opinions i m not one of those scientists but i ve been exposed to some of them advertisement q but to your point it s called global warming not california warming right it s not like i mean wouldn t it take a okay that s one of my points but that s yeah that s one of my points but here s the other point uh it started off as it s not even called global warming anymore that was that was so five years ago and then it became climate change and that s so two and a half years ago now what you hear and most of the arguments uh by by uh politicians is a global sea rise now you re the seas are rising the sea the oceans are rising and they don t even use climate change anymore uh because q the rising sea level is a subset of climate change a but you re seeing that more and more used rather than climate change and global warming is barely used anymore because there has been some science that shows over the last 17 years the earth hasn t warmed that much up to the 17 years ago yes and then it leveled off and there s actually been a couple of dips in a couple of those years q do you think the people in your district agree with that assessment a i think that s a good question and um i think a lot of the my constituents in my district just want to go to work make a living pay their taxes and raise their families in a safe neighborhood and that s my primary focus there s going to be people in those districts it s a broad district it s you know uh from el cajon to riverside republicans democrats no party preference voters people who don t vote opinions are going to be as broad as the voters are so i m answering for what my priorities are going to be is protecting the economy and protecting my voters ability to survive in california and if there s reasonable environmental concerns that are brought that have real effects on the environment that we can make a positive impact i m probably going to support them if the science is weak or it s inconclusive or it s just more regulation or more taxes i m probably not going to support them advertisement i think a lot of the my constituents in my district just want to go to work make a living pay their taxes and raise their families in a safe neighborhood and that s my primary focus brian jones q how would you uh you ve been in politics a long long time uh one of your opponents darrell issa has been in congress a long long time uh until recently how do you how do you why wouldn t voters looking at the two of you say well he s been there he should go back there he s been there a long time a right i think uh this district is kind of peculiar and i ve uh coined the term it s a little bit ornery uh regarding politics and politicians and government uh even though it s very republican it s mostly i think the republicans lean libertarian and they just want government out of their business do what government s supposed to do protect my property protect my interests let me go to work do my job and government just do the minimum that it s supposed to do so i don t think the constituents in this district are particularly impressed by uh longterm service in congress actually and i don t think that they re impressed that he had an opportunity to stay in congress and didn t and retired and then unretired and wants to come back to this district rather than fighting for the district that he left so i think that s what s resonating with the constituents in the 50th congressional district q the president has hinted at the federal government taking a greater role in homelessness california is obviously ground zero for the homeless problem in this country or one of the ground zeros for a homeless problem what would you agree with that and if so what form would that possibly take a i wish i didn t agree with it but uh in california right now we re at i believe an epidemic crisis situation and regarding homelessness and the democratic leadership in california refuses to take it serious and pass policies that actually make a difference in the homeless population and one of the things i m trying to uh really get across right now is we need to stop calling it homelessness because homeless the term homelessness puts um not a positive term on it but it improperly paints the entire community population as down on their luck and um just temporarily out of their homes there is an element of that of course there are single moms with kids living in their cars uh there s single dads doing the same thing those people aren t what we see as far as the challenges on the streets of urinating defecating drug junkies so let s separate it right let s draw a line between the people that are truly homeless down on their luck lost their job um made a bad investment whatever got them into that situation let s do everything we can to help those people get off the street and back into a home and be productive because they want to be productive members of society what s happened in california over the last 10 years since ab 109 prop 47 and prop 57 is we have reduced the sentencing we ve reduced the time in uh custody we ve reduced the seriousness of the offense for drug abuse and these other things and it s impacting in a negative way people s lives on the street in san diego city of san diego right now today even with the rain coming down people s property values are are coming down their safety is coming down their comfort level of just walking down the street is coming down in san diego and we re not the worst l a san francisco uh this is a crisis and if the state government s not going to fix it yeah the federal government needs to come in and do something what they do i have no idea does the federal government come in and lock all these people up maybe uh but you can t have 20 30 40 year old drug addicts putting needles in their arm and throwing them on the street and then have school aged kids walk on that same street an hour later and expect that kid to be safe it s not acceptable and so uh my my first answer to that question is this the state legislature needs to step up and start changing some of our policies to address the vagrancy the junkies and the and the uh lawbreakers and let s deal with them on a different level than we deal with the people that are truly homeless file in this sept 25 2017 file photo police officers remove a tent left by homeless residents in san diego during efforts to sanitize neighborhoods to control the spread of hepatitis a ap photo gregory bull file associated press advertisement q do you support the concept of conservatorship a yes absolutely and uh with for me the goal of getting them healthy so they don t have to be in that position you know um once your re strung out on drugs and you re living on the street that s your existence and until somebody comes in and abruptly interrupts that cycle most people don t have the ability to fix that on their own they need to be in that type of situation to start getting on a pathway of healing q speaking of drugs the opioid crisis obviously a huge national issue thoughts on how to stem the tide on that a well i think california s done some good stuff legislatively actually on that and you know one of the things the trump administration did a couple of years ago is i think he sent california 95 million specifically to address the opioid abuse here in california and help the state recover from that so there are it s obviously on the uh people are paying attention to it um i m not on any pain relievers so that s good um but i m you know i m conscious of that because i ve had not family members but close friends family members just on pain relievers uh go down that road and it is scary and um i m glad that people are starting to pay attention to it and work on it q any other questions want to give us your close and tell us why voters should choose you over the two republicans and the democratic challenger a thank you uh i m from the district you know i ve grown up in this district i represented this district i moved here in 1978 my wife moved in 1981 her family has lived in valley center escondido and san marcos my family has lived in santee um i ve represented parts of riverside when i was in the assembly it s a great district i understand the district i know the district i m from the district and i think that that s going to resonate with voters uh traditional values uh is a big deal in this district some of the largest churches in california are in this district i used to be on staff at one of them uh 20 years 25 years ago and so i have that faith background that a lot of the republican actually not just republican across the board i mean yeah that was a dumb thing to say um across the board you know voters in this district and so um so i understand that as well they ve seen my track record in sacramento fighting to keep taxes uh you know as i fight every tax i can up there and we ve had some successes um i ve fought for family values and i ve fought for the sanctity of life in sacramento and those are all issues that are uh big in this district next year i m going to take on homelessness and i told my staff my capitol staff last year as i was leaving as the session was winding down next year we re putting together a bill package to start dealing with this i don t know what kind of success i ll have with that but i m going to work hard at getting something done and passed through this legislature advertisement q thanks for coming in a you bet thank you i appreciate it

exporters receive nearly 40 percent lower prices than their foreign peers as they do not have the leather working group lwg certification a vital accreditation needed to receive fair prices from buyers only three local leather and leather goods companies have the certification at the moment and they are helping the sector grow gradually if all the 155 tanneries housed at the leather industrial park in savar can obtain the certification they will be able to receive proper prices from international buyers said saiful islam president of the leathergoods and footwear manufacturers and exporters association of bangladesh he spoke at the launch of a report styled building competitive sectors for export diversification opportunities and policy priorities for bangladesh published by the international finance corporation ifc the private sector lending arm of the world bank group the event took place at the amari hotel in dhaka the cetp is not fully functional yet to get the lwg certification as a result local leather and leather goods manufacturers have to sell goods to some limited non compliant chinese manufacturers at cheaper rates so the target to export 5 billion worth of leather and leather goods by 2021 might not be possible islam said currently the sector is the second largest foreign currency earner after ready made garment it fetched 1 02 billion in exports in the last fiscal year we must do something for value addition bangladesh has comparative advantage as the leather and leather goods sector has its own raw materials islam said bangladesh s competitors such as vietnam indonesia and cambodia have the advantages of diversified products the entrepreneur added islam called for special allocation for product and market diversification and innovation as the private sector has hardly had any innovation recently because of higher cost of funds cement steel and pharmaceutical exports should be boosted to diversify the export basket because they have the capability to earn a lot if facilitated properly said ma razzaque research director at the policy research institute of bangladesh pri higher demand for some goods in the local market can also draw higher investment and higher export he said for instance per capita consumption of plastics in bangladesh is five kg against the asian average of 36kg domestic demand can help expand the market and ultimately boost exports razzaque also said some 600 million worth of plastic goods are exported from bangladesh every year mainly as dimmed export items like hanger plastics has good potential at both home and abroad he said to the researcher it does not make any sense why the government does not allow bonded warehouse facility to the companies that manufacture products both for local and international markets this is really a challenge for some sectors he added the government is working to develop particular products in the areas of leather and leather goods plastic footwear and light engineering under a special scheme so that the goods can be exported in the near future commerce secretary mohammad jafar uddin said as part of an initiative to diversify markets bangladesh is trying to grab more market shares in latin american countries like brazil mexico and argentina moreover bangladesh has targeted the central asian countries for market diversification apart from traditional markets namely the eu the us and canada he said however bangladesh will need to diversify skills along with market and product diversification he said a diversified export portfolio comprising competitive sectors such as leather and footwear plastics and light engineering will help create greater access to international markets for bangladeshi products the report said it recommended policymakers develop strategies in order to integrate priority sectors with the global value chain to sustain its growth trajectory and reduce overdependence on any single item bangladesh needs to build a strong manufacturing ecosystem and develop new products while paving the way for large scale job creation and poverty reduction said wendy werner country manager of the ifc for bangladesh bhutan and nepal the ifc publication compared bangladesh s export performance with several comparator countries including vietnam cambodia malaysia china and india to identify areas for the country to improve economic factors such as employment generation women s employment growth of small and medium enterprises and foreign direct investment are needed in seven potential sectors for export diversification it said bangladesh s economy is moving forward at a stable pace said mashiur rahman adviser to the prime minister on economic affairs the government has initiated a concerted effort to diversify exports he said
recently the u s supreme court issued a ruling that sent a campaign finance case regarding the constitutionality of alaska s campaign finance laws back to the ninth circuit that case is called thompson et al v hebdon et al and is primarily focused on whether alaska s individual to candidate contribution limit of 500 per year is consistent with the first amendment which prohibits congress and state legislatures through the fourteenth amendment from making any law abridging the freedom of speech a few weeks earlier in a different lawsuit taking place in alaska state court alaska superior court judge william morse ruled that the alaska public offices commission apoc had wrongfully stopped enforcing alaska s 500 per year contribution limit to independent expenditure groups created to support particular candidates for political office in patrick et al v interior voters for john coghill et al judge morse ruled that apoc was incorrectly refusing to enforce alaska s 500 per year limitation on contributions to independent expenditure groups apoc has not enforced this limitation since 2012 when apoc concluded that the contribution limitation to independent expenditure groups could not withstand the u s supreme court s decision in citizen united v fec but in his recent ruling judge morse reasoned that the ninth circuit s hebdon decision confirmed the opposite by upholding the contribution limit judge morse ordered apoc to restart its enforcement of the contribution limit to independent expenditure groups to understand these disputes and the legal landscape on which these disputes are taking place a discussion of the famous u s supreme court decision citizens united v fec is necessary it is also helpful to understand some definitions campaign contributions are the monies goods or services donated to a campaign independent expenditures are monies spent by someone other than the candidate or the candidate s campaign and without coordination with the candidate or his or her campaign citizens united v fec in 2010 the u s supreme court issued its famous citizens united decision setting off a firestorm of debate about the first amendment s interaction with political campaign activities in citizens united the court held that a federal statute that prohibited unions and corporations from using their general treasury funds their normal walking around money revenues and not money solicited from others to engage in campaigning during times close to primary and general elections violated the first amendment s prohibition on laws that prohibit speech during the democratic primaries of the 2008 election citizens united corporation released a 90 minute film entitled hillary the movie hillary was released on dvd and on video on demand streaming services citizens united was not operated or managed by anyone campaigning for office and it did not coordinate with any candidate or campaign it was a group engaged in independent expenditures that advocated against candidate hillary clinton but federal law specifically the bipartisan campaign reform act of 2002 bcra pronounced bik rah in political and legal circles prohibited unions and corporations from engaging in any broadcast cable or satellite communication that could be received by 50 000 or more people and refers to a clearly identifiable candidate for federal office within 30 days of a primary election or 60 days of a general election citizens united filed a lawsuit seeking a declaration from the court that the federal law was unconstitutional because it impinged on its first amendment rights and seeking an injunction prohibiting the federal election commission from enforcing the prohibition the court was particularly troubled by the penalty for violating the prohibition federal prison bcra made it a felony for all corporations to advocate the election or defeat of candidates or to expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election the court noted the following situations could result in felony charges under bcra s prohibition the sierra club runs an ad within the crucial phase of 60 days before the general election that exhorts the public to disapprove of a congressman who favors logging in national forests the national rifle association publishes a book urging the public to vote for the challenger because the incumbent u s senator supports a handgun ban and the american civil liberties union creates a web site telling the public to vote for a presidential candidate in light of that candidate s defense of free speech these prohibitions are classic examples of censorship the citizens united court then spent pages citing all of the cases in which the u s supreme court had held the first amendment protection extends to corporations for instance the anchorage daily news is actually the anchorage daily news llc a registered alaska limited liability corporation the adn and its employees do not lose their first amendment rights to publish reports and commentary about politicians and campaigns because the media entity they work for is a corporation the court also noted that corporations had long contributed to the discussion debate and the dissemination of information and ideas that the first amendment seeks to foster therefore with the fundamentals laid down that the first amendment protects corporations like everyone in the united states from government censorship by the first amendment the court turned to the government s arguments in favor of upholding the statute prohibiting unions and corporations from spending general fund monies within a certain amount of days of primary and general elections as for the bumper sticker argument that money does not equate to speech the court explained that all speakers use monetary resources to get their message out all speakers including individuals and the media use money amassed from the economic marketplace to fund their speech the first amendment protects the resulting speech even it was enabled by economic transactions with persons or entities who disagree with the speaker s ideas the court then turned to the three interests the government offered to support bcra s restriction on corporate and union speech 1 anti distortion interest 2 anti corruption interest and 3 shareholder protection interest the court rejected the argument that the prohibition was warranted to prevent the distortion of speakers voices in the informational marketplace in other words the government s desire to reduce the influence of speakers who have more resources to spread their messages to others is not a valid basis under the constitution to limit speech for a long time wealthier and more popular individuals have had an outsized voice and the court reasoned the first amendment does not permit the government to seek to equalize the voices of every speaker in the united states for example the new york times has a wide readership and it would be dangerous to limit its reach because it is popular and has a wide circulation this is particularly true because anyone can be a member of the press in the united states even jeff landfield as to anti corruption the court noted that since its watershed decision in buckley v valeo in 1976 it had become widely accepted that people and entities spending their own money to advocate for or against a candidate does not mean there is corruption or that there is an appearance of corruption independent expenditures are just that a voice independent from a candidate advocating a position finally as to the shareholder protection interest the government was caught flat footed the government s argument was that there was a valid interest in protecting shareholders of companies engaged in political speech from the company spending corporate funds on speech the shareholder may not agree with but this argument could not survive the reality that bcra only prevented corporations from spending general funds 30 days before a primary and 60 days before a general election the court was not persuaded that bcra protected shareholders from misusing corporate funds for political speech because the law only cared about 90 days total in every election cycle the court ended its opinion by striking down as unconstitutional the provision of bcra that prohibited unions and corporations from spending their general treasury funds to advocate for or against a candidate it then issued a reminder to readers of the unintended consequences of giving the government the power to control corporate speech when word concerning the plot of the movie mr smith goes to washington reached the circles of government some officials sought by persuasion to discourage its distribution under austin though officials could have done more than discourage its distribution they could have banned the film after all it like hillary was speech funded by a corporation that was critical of members of congress mr smith goes to washington may be fiction and caricature but fiction and caricature can be a powerful force modern day movies television comedies or skits on youtube com might portray public officials or public policies in unflattering ways yet if a covered transmission during the blackout period creates the background for candidate endorsement or opposition a felony occurs solely because a corporation other than an exempt media corporation has made the purchase payment distribution loan advance deposit or gift of money or anything of value in order to engage in political speech speech would be suppressed in the realm where its necessity is most evident in the public dialogue preceding a real election governments are often hostile to speech but under our law and our tradition it seems stranger than fiction for our government to make this political speech a crime yet this is the statute s purpose and design some members of the public might consider hillary to be insightful and instructive some might find it to be neither high art nor a fair discussion on how to set the nation s course still others simply might suspend judgment on these points but decide to think more about issues and candidates those choices and assessments however are not for the government to make the first amendment underwrites the freedom to experiment and to create in the realm of thought and speech citizens must be free to use new forms and new forums for the expression of ideas the civic discourse belongs to the people and the government may not prescribe the means used to conduct it citizens united was a divided opinion with five members of the court voting to strike down the statute and four members voting to uphold the statute justice paul stevens wrote a strongly worded dissent that readers should read if they are interested in this area montana fights the citizen united decision and loses following the citizens united decision individual states bans on corporate and union political speech were struck down state by state across the country but not every state gave in montana refused in 2011 the washington post reported only montana still wages a lonely court battle to maintain the ban on december 30 2011 the montana supreme court issued a ruling in western tradition partnership v attorney general of the state of montana that upheld montana s ban on corporate speech as a means of protecting its elections from corruption or the appearance of corruption in part the montana supreme court rested its decision on montana s experience with the corrupt copper kings of the mining boom town of butte who bribed judges to get rulings they desired and in the case of w a clark bribed the entire legislature to be appointed as u s senator back before the 17th amendment was ratified making senators elected by the public and not appointed by each state legislature the court s discussion is worth reading in full in the fight over mineral rights between entrepreneur f augustus heinze and the anaconda company then controlled by standard oil heinze managed to control the two state judges in butte who routinely decided cases in his favor the butte judges denied being bribed but one of them admitted that anaconda representatives had offered him 250 000 cash to sign an affidavit that heinze had bribed him in response to the legal conflicts with heinze in 1903 anaconda standard closed down all its industrial and mining operations but not the many newspapers it controlled throwing 4 5 of the labor force of montana out of work its price for sending its employees back to work was that the governor call a special session of the legislature to enact a measure that would allow anaconda to avoid having to litigate in front of the butte judges the governor and legislature capitulated and the statute survives w a clark who had amassed a fortune from the industrial operations in butte set his sights on the united states senate in 1899 in the wake of a large number of suddenly affluent members the montana legislature elected clark to the u s senate clark admitted to spending 272 000 in the effort and the estimated expense was over 400 000 complaints of clark s bribery of the montana legislature led to an investigation by the u s senate in 1900 the senate investigating committee concluded that clark had won his seat through bribery and unseated him the senate committee expressed horror at the amount of money which had been poured into politics in montana elections and expressed its concern with respect to the general aura of corruption in montana in a demonstration of extraordinary boldness clark returned to montana caused the governor to leave the state on a ruse and with assistance of the supportive lt governor won appointment to the very u s senate seat that had just been denied him when the senate threatened to investigate and unseat clark a second time he resigned clark eventually won his senate seat after spending enough on political campaigns to seat a montana legislature favorable to his candidacy after the anaconda company cleared itself of opposition from heinze and others it controlled 90 of the press in the state and a majority of the legislature by 1915 the company after having acquired all of clark s holdings as well as many others clearly dominated the montana economy and political order local folks now found themselves locked in the grip of a corporation controlled from wall street and insensitive to their concerns even at that time it was evident that industrial corporations controlled the state thus converting the state government into a political instrument for the furthering and accomplishment of legislation and the execution of laws favorable to the absentee stockholders of the large corporations and inimical to the economic interests of the wage earning and farming classes who constitute by far the larger percentage of the population in montana in 1900 clark himself testified in the united states senate that any people have become so indifferent to voting in montana as a result of the large sums of money that have been expended in the state this naked corporate manipulation of the very government governor and legislature of the state ultimately resulted in populist reforms that are still part of montana law in 1906 the people voted to amend the state constitution to allow for voter initiatives not long thereafter in 1906 this new initiative power was used to enact reforms including primary elections to choose political candidates the direct election of united states senators and the corrupt practices act part of which survives as 13 35 227 mca at issue in this case internal citations to books and cases omitted for clarity the court also noted that because of montana s small population and large geographic area corporate expenditures had a large impact on montana elections and therefore should be prohibited this was merely a repackaged anti distortion argument that the citizens united court rejected as an invalid reason to prohibit corporate speech the montana supreme court concluded that based on this unique history of corruption surrounding the copper kings extraction of natural resources in butte learly montana has a unique and compelling interests to protect through preservation of this statute the western tradition partnership decision was immediately on a collision course with the citizens united decision and it did not last very long less than six months after the montana supreme court s decision the u s supreme court granted review of the western tradition partnership judgment although by now the corporation had changed its name to american tradition partnership and reversed the montana supreme court s decision in a single paragraph a montana state law provides that a corporation may not make an expenditure in connection with a candidate or a political committee that supports or opposes a candidate or a political party mont code ann 13 35 227 1 2011 the montana supreme court rejected petitioners claim that this statute violates the first amendment in citizens united v federal election comm n this court struck down a similar federal law holding that political speech does not lose first amendment protection simply because its source is a corporation the question presented in this case is whether the holding of citizens united applies to the montana state law there can be no serious doubt that it does see u s const art vi cl 2 montana s arguments in support of the judgment below either were already rejected in citizens united or fail to meaningfully distinguish that case the petition for certiorari is granted the judgment of the supreme court of montana is reversed and with that montana s prohibition on corporate political speech was struck down as violating the first amendment this background is important to understand because alaska s campaign finance laws are currently being scrutinized in both state and federal court and the state appears to be making the same arguments that montana used to unsuccessfully defend its ban on corporate political speech in the western tradition partnership case thompson v hebdon u s district court for the district of alaska in 2015 three individual alaskans who were registered republicans and district 18 of the alaska republican party represented by then private attorney and now attorney general kevin clarkson sued in alaska federal court the members of the alaska public offices commission seeking rulings from the court that the following provisions of alaska s campaign finance laws were unconstitutional abridgments of the first amendment alaska s 500 per year limit on contributions from an individual to a candidate for office and to a group that is not a political party this law prohibited alaskans from donating more than 500 per year to any candidate or to any group that is not a political party such as a political action committee this law prohibited alaskans from donating more than 500 per year to any candidate or to any group that is not a political party such as a political action committee alaska s 3 000 limit on contributions from non residents to a candidate when a candidate reached 3 000 in contributions to her campaign she could not accept any further non resident donations 3 000 for house and 5 000 for senate when a candidate reached 3 000 in contributions to her campaign she could not accept any further non resident donations 3 000 for house and 5 000 for senate alaska s 5 000 limit on contributions from a political party to a candidate this law prohibits a political party such as the alaska democratic party or the alaska republican party from donating more than 5 000 to any candidate s campaign on november 7 2016 united states district judge timothy m burgess upheld all of the challenged campaign finance laws as to the 500 per year limit on contributions to individual candidates or non party groups judge burgess reasoned that alaska s unique reliance on natural resource development and the widely publicized veco public corruption scandal provided sufficient justification for alaska to limit these contributions to prevent quid pro quo corruption or its appearance in alaska politics as to the 3 000 aggregate limit on non resident contributions to a house candidate judge burgess held that the state had shown that the limit was a valid exercise of its anti corruption interest by preventing the appearance of a candidate being indebted to outside interests judge burgess upheld the 5 000 limit on contributions from a political party to a candidate because plaintiffs have not explained how alaska s political party aggregate limit interferes with first amendment free speech and associational freedoms plaintiffs appealed to the ninth circuit ninth circuit on november 27 2018 in thompson v hebdon the three member panel of the ninth circuit upheld judge burgess s decision on the first bullet point 500 per year limit on individual contributions to candidates and non party groups and third bullet point 5 000 limit on contributions from a political party to a candidate the ninth circuit agreed with judge burgess that the testimony elicited by the state and alaska s unique history of corruption made its contribution limits acceptable to the first amendment for example senator john coghill testified that he was approached by a lobbyist demanding his vote saying this is why we gave to you now we need your help similarly anchorage assembly member bob bell testified that an executive offered to hold a fundraiser for him if he would support a private prison project when he refused the executive held a fundraiser for his opponent instead these examples demonstrate attempts by individuals to affect public officials voting behavior through the prospect of financial gain thereby giving rise to a risk of quid pro quo corruption finally there is alaska s veco public corruption scandal which came to light shortly after the 2006 initiative passed that scandal snared roughly 10 of alaska s legislature in a scheme of accepting money from veco and oil services firm in return for votes and other political favors under we are compelled to conclude that the state s evidence suffices to show that the individual to candidate limit furthers the important state interest of preventing quid pro quo corruption or its appearance the ninth circuit was picking up on an important distinction between independent expenditures and contributions to a candidate under citizens united the court reasoned that political advocacy without coordination with a candidate is every individual s union s and corporation s right under the first amendment but in thompson judge burgess and the ninth circuit were dealing with direct contributions to a candidate the ninth circuit reasoned based on the testimony of senator john coghill assemblyman bob bell and general testimony on the veco scandal that direct contributions to candidates give rise to quid pro quo corruption and the appearance of that corruption but the ninth circuit struck down the 3 000 aggregate limit on contributions from non residents to a house candidate the state s reason for having the limit to prevent corruption did not make any sense the court reasoned because there was no evidence that the first dollar a candidate received from non resident mr a was not corrupting but that the 3 001 dollar a candidate received from a different non resident mr b was corrupting the court concluded that the 3 000 aggregate limit was a poor fit for the state s alleged interest in fighting election corruption u s supreme court plaintiffs appealed the ninth circuit s upholding of the 500 per year limit on individual contributions to a candidate or non party group to the u s supreme court on november 25 2019 in thompson v hebdon the u s supreme court vacated the ninth circuit s judgment on the 500 per year contribution limit and sent the case back to the ninth circuit to analyze whether alaska s 500 per year limit was consistent with its decision in randall v sorrell randall involved the state of vermont s 400 limit on individual contributions to candidates for governor lieutenant governor or other statewide office 300 to a candidate for state senator and 200 to a candidate for state representative the randall court struck down those limits as unduly harmful to the very electoral fairness it seeks to promote the u s supreme court noted that randall had identified several danger signs about vermont s limits that warranted closer review and that were also present in alaska s limit first alaska s 500 individual to candidate contribution limit is substantially lower than the limits we previously upheld the lowest campaign contribution limit the court has upheld was missouri s limit of 1 075 per two year election cycle for candidates back in 1998 in 2019 dollars the court noted that missouri s limit translates to over 1 600 in today s dollars accordingly the court stated alaska s limit is less than two thirds of the contribution limit we upheld in second alaska s individual to candidate contribution limit is substantially lower than comparable limits in other states unlike most states which have limits on a per election basis which allows a donor to contribute the same amounts twice one for the primary election and two for the general election alaska s contribution limit applies simply to 18 months preceding the general election moreover alaska s 500 per year contribution limit applies uniformly to all state office candidates unlike most states that distinguish gubernatorial and lieutenant governor races and set a higher contribution for those races third alaska s contribution limit is not adjusted for inflation the randall court critiqued vermont s limit on the basis that its failure to index the limit meant that over time it would inevitably become too low the thompson court noted that alaska s law had the same flaw notably justice ginsburg did not dissent from the thompson ruling but provided a separate statement that alaska s 90 reliance on the oil and gas industry made it highly if not uniquely vulnerable to corruption in politics and government the u s supreme court sent the case back to the ninth circuit remanded in legal lingo with orders for that court to revisit whether alaska s contribution limits are consistent with our first amendment protections patrick et al v interior voters for john coghill et al meanwhile in alaska state court another battle over a 500 per year limitation on contributions was taking place on november 4 2019 alaska superior court judge william morse issued an order reversing apoc s dismissal of two complaints against independent expenditure groups apoc had applied its 2012 advisory opinion that concluded in the wake of citizens united that alaska s 500 per year limitation on individual to independent expenditure groups violated the first amendment judge morse said this was error given judge burgess s and the ninth circuit s decision in thompson v hebdon that the limitation prevented circumvention of the individual to candidate limits the limit the ninth circuit reasoned prevented contributors from evading the limit on contributions to candidates by channeling funds through a multicandidate political committee because the ninth circuit upheld the individual to groups limit judge morse reversed apoc dismissal of the complaint against two independent expenditure groups who had accepted individual contributions exceeding the 500 per year limit thoughts the u s supreme court appears to have telegraphed to the ninth circuit that alaska s contribution limits do not pass first amendment muster under the court s 2006 decision in randall in randall the court invalidated vermont s individual to candidate contribution limits as unduly harmful to the political process vermont had to permit its residents to contribute more to candidates the most likely outcome seems to be the ninth circuit rules that alaska must increase its contribution limit to 1 600 per candidate per 18 month period instead of the current limit of 1 000 per candidate 500 per year allowing a donor to make two maximum contributions during the 18 month period leading up to the general election over the same period do you think this will increase corruption lessen corruption or have no effect on corruption there could be no contribution limits during 2020 campaign season if the ninth circuit strikes down alaska s individual to candidate contribution limit of 500 per candidate per year as unconstitutionally restrictive under randall and the alaska legislature does not quickly pass a replacement statute that raises the limit of contributions to around 800 per year per candidate then there will be no limit under alaska law to amount of contributions an individual can make to a candidate during the 2020 campaign season but look for incumbents in the legislature who are prohibited from campaigning during the session to work very quickly to impose new contribution limits otherwise their opponents who are not in session and remain free to campaign would be at a significant advantage do elected officials think the 500 per person per year contribution limit is too restrictive or do they agree with it it may be hard to get a straightforward honest answer on this question from politicians it is politically unpopular for politicians to voice support for raising campaign limits and it is politically popular to be in favor of limits expect politicians especially incumbents with deep constituencies to draw many donations from to be in favor of limits and expect political newcomers that may have rely on a few big donations and not a high number of donors to campaign to be more disposed to raising the limit what role should history of corruption in alaska play in analyzing whether a limitation on political speech comports with the first amendment s prohibition on laws that abridge speech in lawsuits both montana and alaska have pointed to eras of actual bribery in their state histories as reasons why contribution limits to politicians are important but bribery is already illegal the u s supreme court rejected montana s citation to the copper kings corruption of montana politicians as a reason to prohibit corporations from engaging in political advocacy that was in the context of independent expenditures not direct contributions to a candidate does this distinction make a difference to you judge morse s decision appears to be correct despite the whiplash of the thompson v hebdon case and the u s supreme court s recent remand of that case to the ninth circuit administrative agencies are required to defer to court interpretation of the federal and alaska constitutions as well as court interpretations of state statute the courts say what the law is not administrative agencies here judge burgess and the ninth circuit have both ruled that alaska s 500 per year limit on individual to independent expenditure groups contributions meet first amendment muster therefore apoc is not free to decide the 500 per year limit is unconstitutional and unenforceable if the courts says it is constitutional and enforceable judge morse s decision correctly directs apoc to follow the law as interpreted by the courts lee baxter is a practicing anchorage attorney he provides periodic legal analysis for the landmine in his spare time when he is not fishing
cambridge responding to pressures from within and without the economics profession is gradually changing for the better not surprisingly the populist backlash sweeping advanced democracies in recent years has produced some soul searching in the discipline after all the austerity free trade deals financial liberalisation and labour market deregulation that caused it rested on the ideas of economists but the transformation extends beyond economic policy tenets within the discipline there is finally a reckoning with the hierarchical practices and aggressive seminar culture that have produced an inhospitable environment for women and minorities a 2019 survey carried out by the american economic association aea revealed that nearly half of female economists felt discriminated against or treated unfairly on account of their gender nearly a third of non white economists felt treated unfairly based on their racial or ethnic identity these failings may be related a profession that is less diverse and less open to different identities is more likely to exhibit groupthink and hubris if it is to generate ideas to help society achieve inclusive prosperity it will have to start by becoming more inclusive itself the new face of the discipline was on display when the aea convened for its annual meetings in san diego in early january there were plenty of panels of the usual type on topics such as monetary policy regulation and economic growth but there was an unmistakably different flavour to the proceedings this year the sessions that put their mark on the proceedings and attracted the greatest attention were those that pushed the profession in new directions there were more than a dozen sessions focusing on gender and diversity including the headline richard t ely lecture delivered by the university of chicago s marianne bertrand the aea meetings took place against the backdrop of the publication of anne case and angus deaton s remarkable and poignant book deaths of despair which was presented during a special panel case and deaton s research shows how a particular set of economic ideas privileging the free market along with an obsession with material indicators such as aggregate productivity and gdp have fuelled an epidemic of suicide drug overdose and alcoholism among america s working class capitalism is no longer delivering and economics is at the very least complicit a panel called economics for inclusive prosperity efip organised by a network of the same name which i co direct discussed several strands of new thinking taking over the discipline one is the need to expand economists focus from average levels of prosperity to distributive aspects and to non economic dimensions that are equally fundamental to wellbeing such as dignity autonomy health and political rights how economists talk about say trade agreements or deregulation may well change when they take such additional considerations seriously this will require new economic indicators one proposal that goes part of the way is for government agencies to produce distributional national income accounts as samuel bowles and wendy carlin argued in a paper presented in the same session every policy paradigm embeds a set of ethical values about what the good life entails along with a view of how the economy works neoliberalism presumes individualistic amoral individuals and a free market that delivers efficiency thanks to complete contracts and a relative paucity of market failures what we need according to bowles and carlin is a new paradigm that integrates egalitarian democratic and sustainability norms with a model of the economy as it really operates today this paradigm would place community alongside the state market dichotomy and would include policies such as wealth taxes broader access to insurance to reduce risk exposure workplace rights and voice corporate governance reform and substantial weakening of intellectual property rights speaking in the same session luigi zingales faulted economists for foisting their own preferences on the body politic this happens because economists tend to place greater value on certain outcomes such as efficiency than others such as income distribution and because they fall prey to groupthink and fetishise particular economic models over others part of the solution is to value diversity and exhibit greater modesty another part according to zingales is to pay more attention to research in other social sciences including history sociology and political science the implication of all these perspectives is that economics must be open to institutional alternatives and to institutional experimentation fostering such thinking is one of the major aims of the efip network the institutional basis of a market economy is largely indeterminate we can stick with institutional arrangements that sustain privilege and restrict opportunity or we can devise institutions that in the words of bowles and carlin are consistent with the pursuit of not only shared affluence but also an expanded concept of freedom empirical methods especially of causal inference will help and they have become much more central to the profession in recent decades this is a very good thing insofar as real world evidence with all of its necessary messiness displaces ideology but the focus on evidence also risks creating its own blind spots evidence about what does and does not work can be obtained only from actual experience we necessarily lack data on alternative institutional arrangements that are distant from our current reality the challenge for economists is to remain true to their empiricism without crowding out the imagination needed to envisage the inclusive and freedom enhancing

news analysis at the conclusion of 2019 the chinese zodiac year of the pig china was facing economic pain arising from none other than pigs the 2019 swine fever crisis in china devastated its pig population with 200 million pigs either dying or being culled causing pork prices to nearly double from december 2018 december 2019 s consumer price index cpi rose 4 5 percent compared to a year earlier mainly due to soaring food prices which rose a considerable 17 4 percent compared to last year according to official data from china s national bureau of statistics released earlier this month the cpi figures were eight year highs for china and food prices weren t the only culprit consumer goods increased more than 6 percent as well while pork supply constraints appear to be easing in part due to the central government opening its national pork reserve the crisis is still causing anxiety in beijing the lunar new year holiday is especially early this year to be celebrated at the end of january and pork is typically a mainstay at dinner tables shades of stagflation the combination of high inflation and low economic growth china recorded its worst gdp growth in nearly 30 years is an eerie reminder of stagflation the united states experienced degrees of stagflation throughout the 1970s with inflation soaring into the mid teens high unemployment and low economic growth on balance china s official cpi was up 2 9 percent for 2019 a benign figure by today s standards but high compared to most developed markets food prices in china also matter more than in other countries it s the largest household expense for many families in addition the chinese communist party ccp leadership is likely extra sensitive to inflation as it was a major cause of public dissatisfaction leading up to the 1989 tiananmen square protests the combination of high inflation and low economic growth china recorded its worst gdp growth in nearly 30 years is an eerie reminder of stagflation the united states experienced degrees of stagflation throughout the 1970s with inflation soaring into the mid teens high unemployment and low economic growth on the surface china shouldn t be worried its official growth rate of 6 percent remains as one of the highest in the world even if that figure will be in the 5 percent range during 2020 inflation figures if one were to strip out food prices remain reasonable but privately ccp leaders seem more worried premier li keqiang spoke to government officials of downward pressure in 2020 during a speech in late december in beijing according to a statement released by the state council li mentioned greater complexities facing china saying that governments at every level will have a more difficult task going forward without elaborating on specifics behind the scenes ccp officials likely recognize that economic growth isn t as rosy as the official statistics there s likely also a lingering concern that price inflation may have some durability ccp officials are undoubtedly facing challenges on multiple fronts domestically it s a major reason beijing wants to deescalate the ongoing trade war with the united states and lower tariffs on its exports and ramp up its factories this would at least contribute some organic growth to the economy and keep workers employed while beijing enacts policy stimulus to battle other fronts stimulus keeps coming but more nuanced the people s bank of china pboc said in november 2019 that keeping inflation modest was a key goal even as it battles to keep economic growth rising the central bank s job will become an increasingly difficult one in 2020 the ccp must tread carefully many stimulus measures designed to boost economic growth have the side effect of worsening inflation and elevating the risks of social instability the pboc announced on jan 1 that it would cut banks reserve requirement ratio the amount of cash banks must keep in reserve to free up 800 billion yuan 115 billion to increase lending the timing and relatively modest amount of this latest stimulus measure suggest that beijing is desperate to prop up the economy yet doesn t want to shout it from the rooftops part of the reason for the rrr cut is to inject liquidity into the economy leading up to the lunar new year a period of greater demand for cash the central bank recently announced another under the radar change intended to spur growth pboc in early january mandated that banks must utilize the so called loan prime rate lpr as the reference point for giving out loans currently the one year lpr sits at 4 15 percent previously loans were pegged to the central bank s one year benchmark lending rate as a reference which hadn t moved since oct 2015 and is at 4 35 percent banks do have leeway to add or subtract from the lpr to mirror the risk of individual loans but by amending the reference point to a slightly lower rate the pboc has in effect cut borrowing rates without officially announcing it as a rate cut

about 37 percent of the projects failed to create even one single job just over half the promised jobs were actually created only 42 600 jobs out of announced 81 800 jobs were actually created because of that only about 200 million of the nearly 900 million in announced grants were awarded all economic decisions are made on the margins jon sanders director of regulatory studies at the john locke foundation said only in a few cases are incentives going to be a marginal benefit that changes a no to a yes but figuring out how many companies would have hired in the state regardless of the incentives is a hard thing to measure tim bartik an economist at the w e upjohn institute for employment research studied that question specifically for incentive programs across the country his 2018 paper showed the vast majority of the jobs attributed to incentives in a given state somewhere between 75 to 98 percent would have been created there without the subsidies in a nutshell businesses make business decisions for business reasons if they can get free money from politicians wanting to look good in press releases and photo ops great but it s rarely a deciding factor it s also not free money the results indicate that neither mpis in general nor specific types or levels of tax credits are associated with overall state economic performance there is a weak association between low level non resident labor tax credits and growth of the film industry in states thus any gains that mpis may have appear to be limited to the film industry and do not spill over into the overall economy in addition to providing policy guidance regarding mpis this study s findings are applicable to other types of development tax credits that states may use in the attempt to foster economic development wral reporter tyler dukes has examined job creation promises from north carolina economic development incentives programs and found them falling far far short dukes assessed job creation from projects under the job development investment grant jdig program and one north carolina onenc fund from 2009 to 2016 a summary of dukes findings follow those results are sobering well north of a third of the incentivized projects didn t even bring a single job the state realized only a little more than half the promised jobs that last bullet point is a consolation at least companies must meet hiring retention and investment benchmarks to qualify for some of the grant funds still returns were so paltry that less than one fourth of the announced grant amounts were even awarded these findings spanning the administrations of two governors one from each political party democrat bev perdue and republican pat mccrory provide further evidence of what economists warn about regarding government incentives economists point out and commerce officials fully acknowledge that incentives are far from the primary driver for companies making decisions about their growth that s why state recruiters regularly tout factors like the quality of north carolina s workforce its tax climate and quality of life in their efforts to woo businesses meanwhile last year gov roy cooper approved 146 million in corporate giveaways under the job development investment grant jdig program and one north carolina onenc fund research from kennesaw state university economist john charles bradbury on film incentives found no association between the incentives and a state s economic performance as bradbury argued that finding applied to all incentives programs not just film incentives research published in 2015 in economic development quarterly looked at economic development incentives in north carolina under the now ended william s lee act researchers g jason jolley mandee foushee lancaster and jiang gao surveyed executives from 150 companies that received economic development incentives from north carolina and 465 companies that did not what they found highlighted how marginal the incentives were most executives seven out of 10 didn t even know their companies were getting incentives 29 3 percent were aware the company had received an incentive 61 8 percent did not believe the company had received an incentive and 8 9 percent were unsure executives listed not one not ten but 14 factors above incentives as important to a state s business climate top items were skilled labor low regulations low taxes low costs of living and good transportation infrastructure it is for these reasons and more that we at the john locke foundation promote economic growth policies not economic development incentives and want better thinking on corporate welfare

michael hicks my previous column warned that growing inequality between regions in the united states is the most pressing issue of our time i promised this week to write about potential remedies before doing so i want to remind readers that there are strong economic forces behind growing inequality workers are more productive in large cities drawing ambitious workers to urban places moreover urban centers have thicker labor markets enabling workers to change jobs more easily and providing better options for family members seeking jobs businesses will find it easier to attract the workers they need in these large urban places as well creating a dual opportunity for cities amenities are often thicker and more diverse in urban places there are typically more options across many things that families increasingly value like schooling recreation and the like of course many smaller places have their own charms and many americans happily exchange their urban living for smaller places which is why the in between suburbs tend to be the fastest growing counties in the nation the point of this is that market forces dictate much of the advantages and disadvantages of each place where public policy does play a role it usually unfolds over a very very long time the decline in the rust belt those midwestern towns where it is most evident has been unfolding since the 1950s for example detroit was already losing population before barry gordy founded a record label that would be called motown more from michael hicks growing regional inequality is the challenge of our age however the heavy influence of the invisible hand in these matters does not mean that public policy action or lack of action has not also played a role in regional divergence in many communities poor economic performance can be laid directly at the feet of poor public services obviously poor educational outcomes public corruption that scared away commerce and poor tax and regulatory policies often beggar communities but this last issue is nuanced and increasingly points to a duality of problems i often poke fun at the fiscal idiocy that created chicago s public finances i am right to warn others away from this plight but underinvestment also imposes a heavy toll on places in addition to its effects on educational outcomes there is increasing evidence that educational spending is viewed by families as an important aspect of their location choice school performance and as a proxy spending on schools is a magnet for families one result is that places with large unfunded debt as well as places with low spending on public services face economic stagnation places that spend more but do so without larger debt see better economies it should come as no surprise that families choose communities because of perceived value not just price places that are convincingly value oriented particularly in their schools will do well this reveals the formidable truth that the best way for an individual community to perform better is not to wait on outside help but to tackle the biggest problems themselves places with good and improving schools safe streets and welcoming neighborhoods grow if you are dissatisfied with the economic growth in your community it is probable that one or more of these factors are missing however this probably won t fix inequality between places because too many cities and counties are not up to the task of tackling their biggest problems this leaves two potential policy options both of which will be important one is what is often called the u haul school of economic development the other a broader suite of place based programs neither are a panacea the u haul policy is as the name suggests incentivized relocation of individuals and families from poor to rich places the policy recommendations i have seen are mostly limited to relocation subsidies for displaced workers these merit consideration and may be very helpful for individual families but they are likely to make regional inequality worse the only broad benefit is that they will move more families away from places that are unlikely to recover place based policies include specialized worker training targeted assistance to businesses and broad infrastructure spending programs all of these show some promise in some places but there are also real weaknesses the business assistance programs appear to work well for manufacturing and logistics but not in other sectors with factory employment shrinking these programs can likely impact less than a quarter of us counties though many of these counties are in the hardest hit areas worker retraining programs are expensive lead to little industrial restructuring and have a dismal track record together programs like these might improve economic conditions in some counties but they will not fix the majority of slow growing counties infrastructure spending on new transportation broadband and the like might better boost many lagging places the direct purpose of this is to connect communities to labor markets either through commuting or telecommuting still this has limitations workers with poor schools and low levels of educational attainment will not miraculously see their income rise through easier online connection to labor markets workers who commute are more likely to see wage gains but in either case the infrastructure alone won t solve regional inequality the best programs are likely to be highly tailored to individual communities involve both private and public sector activities and focus on making workers more productive this ultimately means the federal government will be woefully unable to construct something that works in more than a small number of communities today s regional inequality is really the perfect policy case for state level experimentation this should come in the form of state level programs aided by loosening of federal spending rules for many programs fortunately indiana has been a leader in this sort of program the stellar communities program its evolution into the stellar regions program and the regional cities initiative are all prime examples of highly tailored low cost efforts to reduce regional inequality what we have to accept in focusing on ways to fix regional inequality and divergent economic conditions is that most of the factors that lead to decline are really easiest to influence at the local level we must also accept that broad federal programs are unlikely to be tailored to local problems moreover the once seemingly endless pot of federal dollars now has a visible bottom the fixes are going to have to come from thoughtful state policy and urgent local efforts michael hicks is the george and frances ball distinguished professor of economics and the director of the center for business and economic research at ball state university
getty as was noted last year crystal ball gazing is a perilous activity in this unpredictable world of ours no one can say with any degree of certainty how international conflicts will unfold what will happen politically and whether the economy will plunge into recession generally as a social science economics has poor predictive power and economists have the usual suspects to blame exogenous shocks to economic systems and irrational behavior but 2020 is here and inevitably questions crop up about what health economists predict will happen in 2020 with prescription drug prices the overall healthcare market and the political realm which invariably has influence on all things healthcare on drug prices a wait and see approach is warranted as there s been far more chatter than action in 2019 even though h r 3 or the elijah e cummings lower drug costs now act was passed in the house the likelihood of this far reaching legislation getting the senate s approval is very slim and despite all the talk in 2018 and 2019 about restructuring the system of pharmacy benefit manager pbm rebates which in turn would impact pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals nothing material was done by government to change the system while i expect the status quo to continue in 2020 regarding drug price reform as the end of the year approaches there will be considerable uneasiness in the pharmaceutical and health insurance industries about imminent changes in 2021 and 2022 one source of uneasiness may be passage of the prescription drug pricing reduction act pdpra for those who hope for action on the drug pricing front it s a consolation prize of sorts as one of its key provisions is capping drug prices at inflation many of the bill s core components including the inflation cap on pricing are slated to go into effect in 2022 but one feature which is intended to reform the average sale price plus 6 reimbursement of physician administered drugs medicare part b is scheduled to begin on january 1 2021 namely a maximum add on the 6 portion of reimbursement payment of 1 000 per drug biologic or biosimilar in order to mitigate the financial incentive for physicians to prescribe higher priced part b drugs also regarding medicare part b the department of health and human services controversial demonstration project looks set for november 2020 implementation it has the potential to fundamentally reform the way part b prices are determined by introducing international reference pricing if the pdpra passes medicare part d plans and pbms will be forced to be more proactive when it comes to managing costs in the catastrophic phase of part d coverage as the government will no longer pick up 80 of the tab as re insurer of last resort rather it will pay for 20 of catastrophic costs in addition legislatively there will be the usual tinkering around the edges that typically characterizes u s policy with states taking on a key role on drug price transparency for example more than 25 states now have laws requiring drug companies to provide information on the list prices of drugs and planned price increases several laws specifically focus on identifying drugs with price increases above 10 per year state legislators hope more transparency will enable them to take regulatory action including the creation of drug affordability review boards such as those established in maine and maryland in 2019 these boards can set upper payment limits or impose spending targets on drugs expect more states to follow suit with establishment of drug affordability review boards in 2020 continuing on the hot button issue of transparency in relation to pricing and surprise billing i anticipate continued state level changes which may make hospitals begin to feel the heat states have been well ahead of the curve on this issue more than 25 states have passed legislation with another 20 states considering proposals in 2020 in spite of record numbers of biosimilar approvals in 2019 and more expected in 2020 the wrench that continues to impede uptake is an anti competitive u s market that translates into stubborn legal delays patent disputes and exclusionary contracts for originator biologics effectively locking out biosimilars in some instances i anticipate federal legislative proposals as well as regulatory initiatives targeting rebate traps patent thickets and other anti competitive tactics i predict a comfortable re election victory for trump in spite of the president s self destructive tendencies history tells us it s very hard to dislodge an incumbent when the economy is doing reasonably well the employment numbers in particular will boost the president s chances i believe that structurally there are problems in the economy that will have negative repercussions down the road beyond 2020 these include explosive growth in the federal budget deficit a persistent and increasing trade imbalance coupled with a deteriorating manufacturing sector aging and ailing infrastructure decline in the rate of business investment and an over reliance on consumption as an engine of economic growth a stagnating economy could have negative implications for patient access to healthcare as the numbers of un and underinsured continue to increase this amalgam of factors will put further upward pressure on premiums for those who are insured and the spill over effect on community hospitals solvency should not be underestimated
by spence finlayson nassau bahamas i had the wonderful privilege of meeting the legendary jamaican hotelier gordon butch stewart in nassau on bay street a few years ago i call it a chance meeting i was walking back to my car which was parked off bay street downtown and i saw two gentleman walking ahead of me and i took a closer look and i said to myself wow he looks like butch stewart so i walk up faster to catch them and i said is this butch stewart and the other gentleman answered quickly and said no it s not i said man this have to be butch and then mr stewart laughed and said yes this is me tell me who you are this was my chance encounter that i will always treasure as a matter of fact we kept in touch and i invited him to be a guest on my dare to be great tv show we agreed that i would meet him in jamaica to tape the show but when i called him after arriving in kingston to tape the interview with him he was detained in montego bay and could not make it so i ended up interviewing shaggy luciano and allison hinds at the hilton hotel in kingston for more than three decades gordon butch stewart the man called the king of all inclusive resorts and the master of marketing has blazed a trail of far reaching entrepreneurship spearheading two dozen diverse companies that are collectively jamaica s largest private sector group the country s biggest foreign exchange earner and its largest non government employer along the way he has inspired millions throughout the caribbean region and the diaspora helping to lay the foundation for their own success and touting the benefits of hard work and opportunity i love what i do and success has allowed me to do more of it says stewart stewart s spectacular jamaican based empire includes 24 caribbean resorts the atl group and the jamaica observer newspaper but stewart shares the benefits generously he has quietly supported countless community based philanthropic initiatives under the auspices of the sandals foundation and established the sandals corporate university for employees to provide the opportunities that come with a strong education born in kingston jamaica on july 6 1941 stewart grew up along jamaica s north coast now home to seven sandals resorts two beaches resorts and grand pineapple beach resort negril as well as the upscale royal plantation resort but the origin of stewart s business career as the leading entrepreneur in the caribbean had nothing to do with the hotel or resort industries rather it had everything to do with salesmanship and stewart soon proved himself to be a master of the craft after rising to the position of sales manager for the renowned dutch owned curaçao trading company stewart left in 1968 to start appliance traders ltd atl founded as an air conditioner service and distribution company atl soon grew meteorically adding refrigerators freezers and other appliances today atl makes or sells everything from water pumps and electrical generators to cars and auto parts in 1980 to generate the hard currency he needed to buy a c units from united states based fedders stewart ventured into the hospitality business his unofficial motto we can do better kicked into gear and led to his purchase of an old hotel on one of montego bay s largest beaches despite having no hotel experience stewart approached this business with a simple philosophy he has articulated many times since the winning formula is to find out what people want give it to them and in doing so exceeded their expectations seven months and 4 million in renovations later sandals montego bay opened the flagship of the most popular award winning luxury included resort chain in the world while his achievements in diverse industries affirm stewart s business acumen his inexhaustible drive to innovate and improve the lives of his countrymen were perhaps most visible during two crises the foreign currency debacle of 1992 and his 1994 agreement to take over national carrier air jamaica during a foreign currency crisis in 1992 when speculators drove the price of the us dollar up from j 21 to j 32 stewart led the campaign later called the butch stewart initiative to stabilize the exchange rate by personally depositing us 1 million a week into jamaican banks at a rate of 25 to one us dollar it cost him roughly us 30 million but by the time it was over stewart and thousands of ordinary jamaicans had beaten the international speculators pushing the price of a us dollar back down to 22 not long after in 1994 stewart agreed to take over leadership of the ailing air jamaica at the time the national carrier of the country and the caribbean s largest regionally based carrier it was a daunting task but stewart s formula prevailed he improved the passenger experience provided increased staff training and expanded routes in late 2004 stewart gave the airline back to the government with an increase in revenue of over us 250 million stewart s successes have garnered hundreds of personal and industry awards which have been publicized worldwide most recently sandals resorts international won top honours at the 2012 world travel awards as the world s leading all inclusive company for the 17th consecutive year applauded by 1 000 of the sector s leading figures stewart was also personally honoured with a lifetime achievement award which he accepted on behalf of the 10 000 people who work as part of the sandals family throughout the caribbean so impressive is stewart s track record that the jamaica government made him a commander of the order of distinction cd in 1988 and a few years later the order of jamaica oj the country s fourth highest honour bringing with it the title honourable he also received the dr martin luther king jr humanitarian award from the jamaica america society perhaps less well known is the extent of his considerable philanthropy sandals resorts international currently gives active support to more than 150 major projects in its host communities through the company s philanthropic arm the sandals foundation this support ranges from the building of schools to the paying of teachers to providing hospitals with linens to bringing health care to the doorsteps of those who cannot afford it in his homeland of jamaica stewart stepped in to revive the economy by donating 1 million to stop inflation and adjust the exchange rate so what s next for this restless entrepreneur no one can answer that conclusively not even gordon butch stewart but if his history is any indication whatever he applies his skills to will change an industry or a nation spence m finlayson is the founder ceo of the phoenix institute for positive development empowerment a human resources development firm based in nassau

last week the oil futures market saw december s rally effectively fade despite being aided by the increasing tensions between the united states and iran and the fears regarding a potential supply disruption in the market it s important to note that the current state of affairs doesn t necessarily reflect a better geopolitical situation and that the most recent actions aren t hinting towards a peaceful resolution after all we must remember that iran attacked american army bases last week and although the attacks weren t especially significant in terms of number of causalities the united states government still decided to impose additional sanctions against the iranians nevertheless it seems that investors understood that despite the rising tensions the oil supply wouldn t necessarily be affected in a significant way just as we suggested last week the situation in the oil futures markets also played against the canadian dollar oil is one of the main canadian exports and the energy sector itself accounts for around 7 8 percent of the canadian gross domestic product making its currency very sensitive to the movements of this market a rallying u s dollar has also affected the value of the cad especially as the signing of phase 1 of the agreement between the united states and china approaches besides those factors last week s data about canada s balance of trade didn t aid the loonie either as the country is heavily trade dependent data showed that canadian exports fell for their third consecutive month in november falling by 2 7 percent from october s figure while imports dropped by 1 7 percent leaving the trade gap at around cad 1 09 billion according to statistics canada such a situation is due to canada s longest railway strike in a decade which took place at the end of november 2019 and lasted eight days affecting the shipment of imports and exports in a significative way canada s energy sector exports also fell 7 4 percent because of pipeline disruptions that took place in october despite these disappointing facts the bank of canada recently highlighted the improving global economic situation as tensions seem to be fading or perhaps more correctly the threat of an imminent battle seems to be diminishing nevertheless the bank remains cautious regarding the potential implications of an eventual trade deal between the united states and china certainly it seems that the potential downside risks have eased as the united states and china approach a deal this all bears watching during the coming year said the bank of canada governor stephen poloz last thursday unlike its counterparts in the developed world the bank of canada has consistently refrained from cutting the cash rates leaving them unchanged at 1 75 percent since october 2018 this is noteworthy given the weakening global economic situation the world experienced last year which drove other central banks to cut their cash rates and to employ monetary easing to aid the sluggish economic growth the bank has justified its decision to leave the rates on hold claiming that despite the global tensions canada s inflation levels remain close to its target signaling that the canadian economy has been operating close to its potential output unlike the united states and the european union notwithstanding the above the loonie still managed to recover on friday after the markets learned that canada s unemployment rate fell unexpectedly to 5 6 percent in december from the previous month s 5 9 percent it s still not clear whether the bank of canada will prefer to remain on the sidelines clinging to the optimism caused by this data release or will choose to finally cut the cash rates in any case we won t know until january 22 after the bank s next policy meeting

introduction my dividend growth investments are for the large majority companies that increase their dividend like clockwork every year and have done it for many years or even decades it is a prudent approach as it gives the dividend income a certain reliability however some holdings in my portfolio mostly ex us ones don t have a long dividend growth record but offer a good risk to reward either through a high but sustainable yield or a major catalyst to future dividend growth i count my investments in gazprom ogzpy sberbank sbrcy and norilsk nickel nilsy amongst those high risk high reward dividend investments those investments are not for the risk averse but can be profitable as a part of a diversified portfolio thesis polaris infrastructure otcpk rampf is one of those dividend investments that is not for the faint of heart i initiated a position in the company in the end of february 2019 since then the stock has gone up 34 declined 29 and gone up 10 again i first wrote about polaris infrastructure in june of last year and i reiterate a buy rating the dividend yields 5 53 at today s price and is very safely covered the dividend has not been lifted since q4 2017 which is not what you want as a dividend growth investor but the company has continuously paid a high dividend during that time and focused on paying down debt and diversifying into other renewable assets to mitigate the single country risk that caused the stock price to decline by 50 in 2018 the catalyst for capital appreciation and future dividend raises is the recent completion of 2 peru projects that pi got from the ueg acquisition the el carmen and 8 de agosto projects have been completed and are delivering electricity under the ppa power purchase agreement that the company has in place until 2039 the stock price jumped 8 on the news of the completion these 2 projects will add an estimated 28 mw to pi s total generation capacity for the company s total capacity of 105 mw up 36 from current levels the company expects that those projects have the potential to increase ebitda by 7 9 million which would represent a minimum of 12 increase to ebitda during the recent earnings call ceo marc murnaghan discussed the possibility of future dividend raises now that the earnings and cash flow will significantly increase due to the completion of the projects we will continue to pay dividends potentially increase dividends but also look to grow the business ceo marc murnaghan ceo director the company is seeing a lot of opportunity in latin america and is looking to diversify the asset base further cash flow will be spent on paying down debt paying dividends and funding future projects risks the san jacinto flagship asset is operating in nicaragua a jurisdiction that has been in turmoil since 2018 in 2018 the share price was cut in half due to the ongoing protests spooking investors since san jacinto accounts for roughly 2 3 of polaris infrastructure s total capacity it is understandable that there was some selling due to fear however polaris infrastructure s business there has been largely unaffected by the ongoing protests going forward the executions risk for new projects is always a threat as these large projects are very capital intensive and delays can be very costly however the management has proven its competence with the latest project completions note that although pi is originally listed on the toronto stock exchange its dividend is paid in us dollars us investors should consult with a tax specialist regarding the withholding tax on canadian dividends and which accounts would be best for holding this foreign stock summary polaris infrastructure is a not a swan sleep well at night dividend growth investment it is an investment with elevated risk but with a higher possible reward from a high dividend that can potentially grow significantly in the upcoming years with the new projects fully complete that will act as a strong tailwind to earnings and management hinting at raising the dividend i recommend risk tolerant dividend investors do further research on this stock to see if it fits their portfolio editor s note this article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major u s exchange please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks

relevant sciences such as physics and chemistry i do not reject the labor theory of value out of hand and i do not believe that my criteria necessarily lead to rejection of everything marx had to say about value theory i am willing to consider the possibility that labor produces a value endowing property but to understand labor s role if any in producing value we must do more than repeat the familiar bromide that labor creates value and we should keep in mind while being careful not to conflate use value and exchange value that marx himself said labour is not the source of all wealth nature is just as much the source of use values as labour marx karl critique of the gotha program in robert tucker ed the marx engels reader 2nd ed p 525 541 new york w w norton company 1978 1875 525 a scientific theory of value must answer these questions in what way does labor serve as a source or the source of value if it indeed does so is understanding value strictly a matter of quantifying physical properties produced by labor or are other factors involved how are quantities of labor and other relevant properties measured do these quantities correlate with measurable quantities of value and if so how besides helping us understand how commodities acquire value and how value is measured a scientific understanding of value is critical for implementing what i call the socialist principle of distribution lenin used the term socialism to describe what marx called the first phase of communist society and communism to denote marx s higher phase of communist society i have followed this practice when i have considered it convenient to do so thus i refer to the distributive principles of the lower and higher phases as the socialist principle of distribution and the communist principle of distribution respectively for lenin s usage see the state and revolution chapter v 3 4 for marx s see critique of the gotha program part i 1 for an objection to this practice see layton richard no marx dissident voice april 9 2015 if we cannot understand and measure value then we cannot implement the principle and if we cannot do that then we cannot have socialism furthermore we cannot have communism either not if we think of communism as a mode of distribution that develops out of socialism what is the principle of socialist distribution it has been expressed in many ways but the gist of it is that under socialism the worker is supposed to receive a fair distribution that is he receives from society a quantity of goods and services equal in value to the labor he has performed minus deductions for public purposes such as social insurance public schools reinvestment in public enterprises or construction of public infrastructure just to name a few this contrasts with capitalist distribution in which the worker receives less value than he has contributed due to capitalist expropriation of surplus value at the point of production which is supplemented by other expropriatory methods such as fraud debt rent wage discrimination taxation by the capitalist state neoliberal austerity full or partial privatization of public enterprises and so called corporate welfare in critique of the gotha program marx expressed the socialist principle of distributive justice when he said that in the primary stage of socialism the worker receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such and such an amount of labour after deducting his labour for the common funds and with this certificate he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as costs the same amount of labour marx critique of the gotha program p 530 this distributive principle presupposes the ability to measure quantities of labor which are equated with quantities of value other versions of the socialist principle have been influenced by marx s formulation but they are not identical to it article 12 of the 1936 constitution of the ussr states the principle applied in the u s s r is that of socialism from each according to his ability to each according to his work constitution of the union of soviet socialist republics moscow 1936 many socialist constitutions contain similar expressions cf simons william b ed the constitutions of the communist world the hague martinus nijhoff publishers 1984 the soviet formula is worded differently than the statement in the gotha program it speaks of distribution according to work and thereby alludes to different kinds of work with presumably differing values but it does not explicitly mention quantities of labor what does this imply does the principle assume that different forms of work produce the same or different quantities of value and what about differences in the quality of labor socialist countries that adopted the principle to each according to his work did not practice equal compensation for all forms of work this suggests they did not think all types of work had the same value recognition of quantitative and qualitative differences in various forms of work is likely the basis of that distinction quantitative and qualitative differences were recognized as a matter of principle in socialist countries and this was used to justify higher compensation for work considered above average in those terms in fundamentals of marxism leninism a 1960s training manual for soviet cadres differences of quantity and quality are said to determine both the size and quality of the rewards that workers receive in socialist society the bulk of material and cultural values are distributed in accordance with the quantity and quality of labour expended by each worker in social production those who work more and better receive a larger and better reward for their work from socialist society kuusinen o v et al ed fundamentals of marxism leninism moscow foreign languages publishing house 1963 p 584 obviously this presupposes criteria for determining both quantitative and qualitative values of various forms of work so that higher forms can be identified and given greater compensation this raises many questions what are the criteria for measuring the quantity and quality of labor can these things be measured directly or are they reducible to a more fundamental quantity for marx the difference between high and low quality labor is apparently reduced to the production of lower and higher quantities of value marx developed the distinction in capital in explaining this distinction i will take the basic proposition of marx s labor theory of value for granted quantities of labor produce corresponding quantities of value thus it is clear that marx reduced quantities of value to quantities of labor which is in keeping with a labor theory of value in capital v i marx distinguished simple and complex labor simple labor is the expenditure of simple labour power i e of the labour power possessed in his bodily organism by every ordinary man on the average without being developed in any special way complex labor by contrast has an above average value creating power that counts only as intensified or rather multiplied simple labour so that a smaller quantity of complex labour is considered equal to a larger quantity of simple labour marx karl capital vol 1 new york vintage books 1977 1867 p 135 complex labor is higher in quality in the sense that it expends more labor power in a given time than simple labor and therefore creates more value for example if a simple laborer and a complex laborer both work for an hour the latter produces a higher quantity of value than the former in capital v iii marx offered concrete examples of simple and complex labor he used day labor as an example of simplicity and goldsmithing as an example of complexity marx karl capital vol iii london penguin books 1991 1898 p 241 commercial workers were classified as complex laborers due to their knowledge of commerce and languages etc marx wrote the commercial worker proper belongs to the better paid class of wage laborer he is one of those whose labour is skilled labour above average labour ibid p 414 skilled mechanics were included among complex laborers in a footnote to capital v iii written by engels ibid p 414 415 n 39 these examples reveal that complex labor is trained and educated labor apparently marx viewed this as the basis of its higher value productivity evidently marx assumed that simple jobs say ditch digging or repetitive work in manufacturing are less complex than the work of goldsmiths mechanics and commercial operatives what characteristics do these forms of work possess which make them above average in complexity they are more valuable it will be said but this is a mere tautology since value and complexity have already been equated we need to know what marx meant by complexity and why complexity is more valuable in the sense of knowing what quantities complexity is reducible to if any and how these quantities are measured how did he know that complexity of labor produces more value than simplicity did he just intuit this as self evident granted intuition if that is what marx used can be correct but he did not show why his intuition is correct in the examples complexity seems to mean a greater number of required skills the complex job has more dimensions more steps that must be mastered it requires more training education and knowledge to perform than simple labor does work that requires more training and education in and of itself produce more value than work requiring less has marx drawn a distinction without an explanation to merely repeat that complex work is more valuable because it represents more labor in a given time and it represents more labor just because it is more complex is a blatantly circular explanation once again we are back to the fundamental problem of measuring quantities of labor and explaining how those quantities produce corresponding amounts of value in short the problem of value creation and measurement creating and measuring value in capital marx is usually called a materialist who was trying to put socialism on a scientific basis therefore we shall expect the labor theory of value developed by marx in capital v i to identify the value creating property of labor whatever it happens to be as a physical characteristic that serves as the quantifiable basis of exchange value this is a reasonable expectation of any scientific theory but will it be borne out in capital v 1 marx begins his discussion of the labor theory of value by stating that two commodities of equal exchange value must share a common element that is present in both in equal magnitudes if our assumption about marx s intention to develop a scientific theory is correct he must be preparing to describe a physical and therefore quantifiable element let us now take two commodities for example corn and iron whatever their exchange relation may be it can always be represented by an equation in which a given quantity of corn is equated to some quantity of iron for instance 1 quarter of corn x cwt of iron what does this equation signify it signifies that a common element of identical magnitude exists in two different things in one quarter of corn and similarly in x cwt of iron both are therefore equal to a third thing which is neither the one nor the other each of them so far as it is exchange value must therefore be reducible to this third thing marx karl capital vol 1 p 127 we should expect marx to explain what this presumably physical element is how it is measured and on what basis he claims to know of its existence but he offers this astonishing proclamation instead this common element cannot be a geometrical physical chemical or other natural property of the commodities ibid p 127 marx just said that the value endowing element is not and cannot be a physical property he did not bother to explain why he thinks this is the case but it follows that he must believe commodities can have non physical properties does it not this appeal to an immaterial element should cause profound consternation among those who think marx had a scientific theory of value scientific in the sense of making empirically testable claims about the nature of value claims that can be nothing other than materialistic despite all the talk about marx s materialism his theory is obviously based on an immaterialist metaphysics which holds that all commodities share a common non material property that gives them exchange value marx is not a materialist after all at least not when it comes to exchange value i will leave it to others to explain how an historical materialist can be an immaterialist regarding value creation since analysis of changes in various modes of value creation i e modes of production are the basis of historical materialism if the value creating property is not physical then what are its properties how are these properties known and how is it possible to measure them if they are indeed non physical a use value or useful article therefore has value only because abstract human labour is objectified or materialized in it how then is the magnitude of this value to be measured by means of the quantity of the value forming substance the labour contained in the article this quantity is measured by its duration and the labour time is itself measured on the particular scale of hours days etc ibid p 129 abstract human labor according to marx is the value forming substance that is materialized in commodities how does marx know this it is evidently a conclusion of pure reason that is not further analyzable but how can an immaterial element an abstraction become materialized and take up residence in a physical commodity like the word becoming flesh what a confusion of categories the problem is only compounded by this additional description of the common element as exchange values all commodities are merely definite quantities of congealed labour time ibid p 130 here the value forming substance is described as congealed time specifically labor time apparently congealed labor time is used synonymously with abstract human labor it seems strange to speak of time in this way can other kinds of time also congeal such as sleep time or mealtime or does the fact that labor time is spent working endow it with a unique and fantastic physical property that allows it to congeal what can even be capable of congealing except material substances with specific physical properties marx does not say what could he say we are faced with an apparent contradiction exchange value is an immaterial property and yet it congeals the thing that congeals is time but time is not form of matter that can alternate among various states such as the classical states of solid liquid gas and plasma or the many high and low energy states discovered by modern physics to say that time which is a dimension of reality and not a state of matter can congeal is to say that something immaterial can do that which only matter can do it is an assertion that surpasses all understanding marx s treatment of the subject in capital v ii exhibits this contradiction the substance of value is and remains nothing more than expended labour power labour independent of its particular useful character and value production is nothing but the process of this expenditure the process of production disappears in the finished commodity the fact that labour power was expended to create it now appears in the form that the commodity has the following concrete property it possesses value the magnitude of this value is measured by the amount of labor expended the commodity value cannot be resolved into anything further and consists of nothing more marx capital v ii p 462 there is no talk of congealed time in this passage but the contradiction is apparent in that value is spoken of as a concrete property when we were assured in capital v i that value is a non physical property what can a concrete property be if not physical the term congealed labour appears soon after the above passage when marx makes the following comment on surplus value over and above them both there is still the surplus value this has in common with the value component that replaces the variable capital advanced in wages that it is a value newly created by the workers congealed labour ibid p 464 here marx speaks of congealed labor rather than congealed time to this writer it is a significant difference a theory in which labor congeals rather than labor time is a different theory did marx have two theories or is it just one muddled theory congealed labor denotes a process that becomes congealed whereas congealed labor time denotes a dimension but marx does not seem to be aware of this distinction alternate phrasings also appear in capital v iii sometimes marx writes he value contained in a commodity is equal to the labour time taken in making it marx capital v iii p 133 at other times he refers to the amount of labour contained in it ibid p 1006 he might have thought the two phrases congealed labor and congealed labor time are synonymous but they are not it is a characteristic of well formed scientific theories that terms are precisely defined and used consistently marx s theory fails to meet this standard try as i might i cannot find any reason to accept either his congealed labor time or congealed labor terminology because both phrases seem equally nonsensical congealability is a property of physical substances is it not melted fat for example congeals at the top of chicken soup as it cools and blood with sufficient clotting factors congeals coagulates into a scab both are examples of matter changing from liquid to solid but again time is not a state of matter it is a dimension that does not change states as a succession of moments this dimension is a pre condition that is necessary for matter to undergo qualitative changes from one state to another such as water freezing solid then melting back into liquid or evaporating into gas the fact that time provides the context in which matter changes states does not entail that time is a physical substance that congeals or undergoes other physical changes likewise with so called labor time to reiterate marx had no justification for saying that labor time can congeal into commodities thereby giving them exchange value time cannot congeal into anything let alone a commodity likewise with labor which denotes a process that consists of a series of activities the activities are engaged in by physical beings and of course take place in time but this does not mean that specific actions or entire sets of actions are physical substances that congeal like chicken fat the theory doesn t make any more sense when applied to concrete situations how would marx use it to explain why one commodity has a higher exchange value than another according to him if it takes 10 times more labor time to produce a pair of pants than it takes to produce a box of paper clips then the pants are 10 times more valuable than the clips and if in a given time your labor produces 10 times the amount of value that mine does then your labor is 10 times more valuable than mine why congealed labor time is the active ingredient so to speak marx has to say that the pants have 10 times more abstract human labor time congealed in them because your labor congealed more time than mine did it also follows that your labor is more productive than mine and this can be explained in two ways it is either faster or it is more complex how else could it create more value in the same amount of time why is this a terrible explanation marx s talk about congealed time and congealed labor has already been exposed as nonsensical and a nonsensical explanation is not an explanation at all still we might wonder if marx s theory really is so terrible if we assume labor time is the measure of value does it not follow that something that takes more time to produce is more valuable than something that takes less it certainly does but the conclusion follows only if we assume from the outset that labor time is the substance and measure of value this is an obvious circular argument because the premise that needs to be proven is assumed to be true at the outset when nonsense is acceptable then all other forms of nonsense are acceptable as well we might as well say that the patron saint of commodities conferred a larger blessing on the pants than on the paper clips and that this blessing was manifested at a ratio of 10 1 keep in mind marx did not say that value comes from time spent laboring in some ordinary language understanding of labor time he said more valuable commodities contain a larger amount of congealed abstract human labor time that is why the pants have a higher exchange value than the box of paper clips please show me where i can find this congealed time this value forming substance among the fibers dyes tools equipment and energy used in making the pair of pants it can t be done not because science has not yet found a way to detect the presence of this substance but because the existence of such a substance is impossible in principle the obvious conclusion is that when marx speaks of congealed labor time he is talking nonsense before you condemn me for being uncharitable to marx consider this what can talk of congealed time suggest except a quantity of time spent laboring in which the time itself hardens into the object that is being created if anyone can explain to me what this means how it occurs and show it to me happening i will abandon this criticism but i do not think this is likely to happen matter energy and the labor theory of value let us spend no more time congealed or otherwise on this embarrassing muddle labor is not a substance it is a process performed and undergone by substances by human workers and the products they work upon this might seem like a mere truism no more substantive than marx s talk of congealed time but at least i can take you to a workshop farm or factory and show you an actual labor process happening if marx were there he would have to say labor time is congealing here and if we responded what he would have no answer to say that labor time is a substance makes about as much sense as saying that running time is a substance and that a fast runner produces more of a substance called running time than a slow one of course work and running obviously take place in time which is a necessary condition for the unfolding of all processes but that doesn t help marx s argument you may insist on talking about labor time as if you have made a great discovery but it is unnecessary because everyone knows that labor requires time i will insist on this however although value is created during time spent laboring labor time is not the thing that creates or endows value rather it is the dimension in which value is endowed we said that labor is performed by a human worker a physical being upon another physical being an object that we call a commodity time is a precondition of these events it must be something that happens during this time that gives the commodity its exchange value what happens workers consume and apply energy in orderly planned and desired ways to enhance and transform the useful properties of matter the result is a commodity with exchange value rationally directed energy consumption is the common element that marx was seeking labor is the alteration of matter through the rationally governed consumption of energy thus the labor process requires ability and skill in addition to energy and matter since matter and energy are equivalent e mc2 after all we can reduce this to the statement that commodity production requires the skillful use or consumption of energy since the law of the conservation of energy also applies here we will understand consumption to mean the transformation of energy from one state into another with no net gain or loss of energy and correspondingly the consumption or transformation of matter again with no net gain or loss movement changes of state and consumption occur but not creation in the sense of bringing substances into being out of nothingness nor annihilation in the sense of transforming substances from being into nothingness acquisition of skill also requires energy consumption and again this consumption must be rationally directed to the desired end therefore in the case of labor the rational consumption of energy a special case of energy consumption is not further reducible we have reduced the statement that commodity production requires matter energy and skill to the statement that it requires energy and skill we can shorten this to the statement that commodity production requires energy consumption because the mental effort of acquiring and applying skill is a form of energy consumption skillful energy consumption contrasts with the non rational consumption that occurs in nature in the sun for example as far as we know the amount of energy consumed is the irreducible component of value the exchange value of any commodity is therefore reducible to the amount of energy expended to produce it not the amount of time taken to expend that energy quantities of value do not correlate to quantities of time they correlate to quantities of energy expended in a given time the quantity of energy is the common element shared by the quarter of corn and the hundred weight of iron that marx spoke of in capital vol i this includes the energy embodied in the substance and the energy required to transform the substance in the desired way obviously greater or lesser amounts of energy can be expended in the same amount of time the quantity depends on the form of energy and the skill of the worker skill regardless of its degree of complexity moves allocates or transforms energy and matter but it does not create these things anew energy is the value endowing ingredient of the labor process it has a dual role in the process as both transformer and thing transformed rationally expended energy is the common element of all commodities the amount of expenditure represented by the finished commodity is its objective exchange value from the worker s standpoint the sum of energy that he consumes while working plus the amount of energy required to maintain himself as a worker constitutes the value of his labor this is also the quantity of value matter energy owed him in exchange for his labor this quantity can be expressed in any units you like gram calories kilogram calories joules british thermal units etc provided we have a technique for measuring in terms of the unit in question and a method for converting into other commonly used units in depth treatment of the practical problems entailed by this theory are beyond the scope of this paper however it should be noted that measurement of human energy expenditure is a developed science with a history reaching back to 1919 with the formulation of the harris benedict equation for estimating an individual s basal metabolic rate harris j arthur and francis g benedict a biometric study of basal metabolism in man washington d c carnegie institution 1919 there is an extensive literature on human

identifying the empirically observable and measurable feature of labor energy expenditure that endows a commodity with value as a move toward a scientific theory of value it is superior to marx s unscientific attempt to explain value by appealing to the existence of an unobservable value endowing substance called congealed labor time or sometimes just labor time it is also consistent with the basic principles other scientific disciplines such as physics and chemistry which recognize the existence of matter and energy as physical substances and study the physico chemical processes that fuel the transformations of the various states of matter the theory is also compatible with the methodological principles of empiricism which frown on explanations that postulate the existence of unobservable entities this is real materialism not a faux materialism disfigured by hegelian metaphysical and ultimately bourgeois philosophical remnants removal of congealed time as a feature of marxism can only improve its standing among the sciences marxism and the crisis of the anthropocene there is a connection between marx s theory of value especially his overvaluation of complex or intellectual labor in contrast to simple or manual labor and the procreationism productionism and consumerism that are core ideals of the original bourgeois christian civilization marx unwittingly adopted these ideals whole cloth for procreationism see marx s discussion of malthus in capital v 1 p 766 767 and his remarks on surplus population in capital v 3 p 324 325 procreationism is a remnant of judeo christian traditions retained and gradually transformed into a human rights issue by some religious and secular liberals in bourgeois societies this aspect of the tradition was abandoned by bourgeois clerics such as malthus who prescribed anti procreationism as a solution to the poverty and misery of the surplus working class population marx s view is that there is no natural limit on human population the immiseration of so called surplus populations in capitalism is due solely to the exploitive relations of production in that system marx s procreationsim grows out of the connections between marx s views on population the higher value ascribed to intellectual workers by his labor theory of value and his productionist consumerist sympathies like capitalism marx s socialism requires perpetual reproduction of producers with an emphasis on highly skilled intellectual workers and consumers in unlimited numbers to facilitate perpetual economic growth his vision of socialism strives to be truer to them than capitalism could ever be by striping them of their class character and democratizing them these ideas have helped blind marxists to the tight logical relationship between class struggle and ecology marx s labor theory of value is implicated in this problem because productionism and consumerism are enabled and justified by the high consumerist privileges allegedly due to highly skilled workers who perform complex labor procreationism is a result of viewing people in advanced countries with their large numbers of highly skilled workers as the crowning glory of humanity the more there are the better the more they produce and consume the better if marxism is going to stay relevant in the twenty first century and beyond it must provide a theoretical basis for building forms of socialism and communism that can survive in the anthropocene epoch the term refers to our contemporary period in which modern economic systems are exerting increasingly harmful effects on earth s natural systems classical marxism marxism leninism and their numerous variants share with capitalism this productionism consumerism and procreationism a desire for unlimited expansion of production consumption and population that thrusts society toward environmental crisis for an early example of his productionism consumerism see the section on the meaning of human requirements in marx s economic and philosophic manuscripts of 1844 this outlook views nature mainly as a source of use values to be assimilated into the production process it fails to appreciate nature as a delicately balanced complex system that harbors all life by providing its material basis unchecked these tendencies lead to severe environmental degradation as the productive forces are developed and production and consumption increased this condition afflicts any modern system whether socialist or capitalist that combines vast power to utilize and transform nature with the failure to perceive the consequences as threats to the viability of natural systems species and individual life forms socialism and communism must distinguish themselves from capitalism on this point by ridding themselves of productionism consumerism and procreationism societies that aim to liberate human beings from capitalism must have a clear understanding of the dangers posed by these interrelated phenomena and a definite plan for harmonizing the twin goals of meeting society s material needs while preserving its organic and inorganic foundations marxism must place primary importance on the fact that the world s irreplaceable ecosystems count as fundamental material needs of all life and the basis of material and cultural wealth to accomplish this marxism needs new concepts and principles that elucidate the direct but overlooked relationship between class struggle and ecology textual evidence of the problem the economic purpose of communism present at the dawn of marxism was the tendency to view development as an unqualified good and to ignore its negative effects on nature consider the communist manifesto s paean to the awesome productive forces unleashed by capitalism the bourgeoisie during its rule of scarce one hundred years has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all proceeding generations together subjection of nature s forces to man machinery application of chemistry to industry and agriculture steam navigation railways electric telegraphs clearing of whole continents for cultivation canalisation of rivers whole populations conjured out of the ground what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labor marx karl and frederick engels manifesto of the communist party in vol 6 of karl marx frederick engels collected works 477 519 new york international publishers 1976 1848 p 489 the manifesto says that an immediate goal of the communist revolution is to make the proletariat the masters of the productive forces of society ibid p 495 it assigns to the new ruling class the task of using state power to increase the total of productive forces as rapidly as possible ibid 504 these are the same productive forces that the bourgeoisie used to subject nature to the needs and designs of their class this talk of subjugating nature is dangerous because nothing about socialism in and of itself guarantees that the proletariat will act with more wisdom toward nature than the bourgeoisie when the socialist revolution converts capital into the common property of society only the class character of the property is changed the potential of the mode of production to destroy the environment remains unchanged despite it being socialized abolishing the class character of capital does not alter its disposition toward nature ibid p 505 except for a line on improvement of the soil generally as part of a program to expand agriculture the manifesto s 10 point program gives no indication that ecological concerns will play a role in the transition from capitalism to communism socialism does not guarantee environmental sustainability misuse of the productive forces to destroy nature remains just as much of a danger as it was under capitalism in the primary stage of socialism the struggle to free the new society from the remnants of capitalism must prioritize plans to build an ecological socialism ecology is therefore one of the primary missions of the class struggle but the communist manifesto is blind to this perhaps excusably blind given the period in which it was written but blind nonetheless the danger of unbridled productionism and consumerism was apparently unrecognized by the later marx as well in the critique of the gotha program he envisioned the higher phase of communist society sometimes referred to as full communism as a time when the productive forces have expanded far beyond the already colossal extents of the capitalist and early socialist eras when cooperatively produced wealth flows so abundantly that it can be distributed to each according to his needs marx critique of the gotha program p 531 this implies the continuation of productionism and consumerism and why suppose any limits on procreation under communism while the environmental implications remain unacknowledged the productionism and consumerism at the heart of marx s conception of post capitalist society is exacerbated by lenin s gloss on the gotha program which views communism as the period when an enormous development of the productive forces makes wealth so plentiful that here will then be no need for society in distributing the products to regulate the quantity to be received by each each will take freely according to his needs everyone will have the right to receive from society any quantity of truffles cars pianos etc lenin vladimir i the state and revolution in vol 25 of v i lenin collected works 385 497 moscow progress publishers 1964 1917 p 473 lenin surpassed marx by predicting that under communism consumer goods would be produced in limitless quantities completely free for the taking we leave it to the reader to contemplate the environmental devastation that would result from unrestrained production and consumption of automobiles not to mention truffles pianos etc some might try to dismiss these passages as instances of a revolutionary exuberance that had no effect on the actual practices of socialist countries the extensive and easily accessible history of ecocidal development in these countries belies this view and exposes environmental practices under socialism as no better than under capitalism overall the reader is urged to investigate this independently since a full review of the history is beyond the scope of this paper besides practice we should consider theoretical discussions during actually existing socialism fundamentals of marxism leninism describes socialism as an era of tempestuous development of productive forces when the socialist state considers that its main purpose is the expansion of production in order to provide a continuously rising living standard for the population kuusinen et al fundamentals of marxism leninism p 544 569 this breakneck development will enable the soviet union and the other socialist countries to undertake with full confidence the task of reaching a level of consumption surpassing in every respect that of the most highly developed capitalist countries ibid p 570 socialist consumerism is but a prelude to the glittering consumerist paradise that will arrive with full communism following lenin the supply of goods will be so plentiful that controlling the amount of consumption will be unnecessary ibid p 705 people will assess their own needs and simply take as much as they want there will be no need to determine which needs are reasonable and which are not ibid p 706 707 nor should there be any worry about natural limits on growth shortages of raw materials for example will never occur because ever advancing agriculture more intensive exploitation of lands and oceans and creation of synthetic materials will be enough to satisfy every imaginable need ibid p 700 with no barriers to expansion communist consumerism will be limitless critics might accuse the author of ignoring passages from the marxist canon that express serious regard for ecological issues these might include the recognition that humankind is fundamentally part of nature as well as discussions on overcoming man s alienation from nature found in numerous passages in the economic and philosophic manuscripts of 1844 complaints about a lack of urban planning air pollution and other unhealthy living conditions in the proletarian districts of english cities described in engels condition of the working class in england engels frederick the condition of the working class in england in vol 4 of karlarx frederick engels collected works 294 596 new york international publishers 1975 1845 passim and in his dialectics of nature the recognition that humans and nature exist in a coevolutionary

nature human labor power marx critique of the gotha program p 525 lenin s enthusiasm for establishing nature reserves should also be mentioned here foster john bellamy late soviet ecology and the planetary crisis monthly review 67 2 june 2015 p 1 20 nevertheless a set of disconnected ad hoc comments and policies does not amount to a mature theoretical treatment of and comprehensive policy toward ecological issues nor does it temper override or repudiate the productionism consumerism and procreationism at the heart of the marxist leninist conception of socialist and communist society toward a genuinely ecological marxism a convincing and effective ecological marxism must amount to more than a tacked on addendum without clear logical connections to the fundamental principles and revolutionary orientation of marxism these connections do exist the class struggles in france contains marx s famous discussion of the four alls in which he explains that the task of the proletariat during the transition from capitalism to socialism is to abolish all class distinctions all relations of production all social relations and all ideas that spring from capitalist society marx karl the class struggles in france 1848 1850 in vol 10 of karl marx frederick engels collected works 45 145 new york international publishers 1978 1850 p 127 classical marxism indeed viewed itself as much more than a mere logical extension of the bourgeois enlightenment sans economic classes but it did not always realize this vision poductionism consumerism and procreationism are anachronistic leftovers from the philistinish unscientific and mindless optimism of the bourgeois enlightenment meshed with the capitalistic logic of profit maximization together they entail complete expropriation and commodification of nature for use in the valorization process ecocide is inherent in the logic of both profit maximization and the maximization of consumption as required by the four alls classical marxism should have rejected bourgeois ideals such as unlimited production and consumption they must be rejected now chinese socialism is an exception to the charge of procreationism both the one child policy and the recently adopted two child policy firmly reject it there is nothing in the logic of marxist socialism that necessitates such an error especially provided the errors in marx s labor theory of value are overcome the fundamental purpose of socialism as understood by the founders of marxism is to organize society to cooperate in and coordinate its efforts to satisfy the material and cultural needs of its members and to return to workers the same amount of value that they invest in society minus absolutely necessary deductions or unavoidable losses this immediately raises questions about the extent of material and cultural production entailed by the word satisfy does ecology dictate limits on what is permissible here evidently it does historically marxists and marxist leninists have had a weak grasp on this question and its answer they apparently thought there was no need for any strictures on production and consumption including the production of human beings chinese marxism notwithstanding but there really are objective limits dictated by the requirements of earth s ecology therefore the dangerous and simplistic goal of perpetual quantitative increases in material living standards should be removed from marxism and replaced by the explicit recognition that the achievement of socialism s purpose is impossible without healthy ecosystems taking this necessary condition into account it follows that the purpose of socialism is cooperation in the satisfaction of society s material and cultural needs to the degree compatible with the preservation of nature the idea that socialism and communism should place caps on production consumption and population growth must become core guiding principles of marxism in all its forms if they are to remain relevant in the anthropocene implications 1 marx s labor theory of value overvalues labor power in the sense that it erroneously believes that human labor is the creator of a potentially infinite expansion of value the realization that labor manipulates quantities of matter energy which may then be identified with quantities of value rather than creating value per se disconnects compensation from the notion that its purpose is to remunerate acts of pure and potentially infinite creativity when we cease to view human beings as creators of value rather than users and appreciators who need value we reduce them from the bogus quasi divine status conferred on them by the more promethean strains of the enlightenment to the lesser but more honest status of normal living beings workers are then viewed as beings with needs that are worthy of respect consideration and satisfaction but with no right to place their needs and wants above the health of the whole living system of earth and its biosphere 2 to reiterate labor does not create value it reconfigures pre existing quantities of matter and energy to serve useful purposes these purposes are not strictly class neutral in capitalism they serve the capitalist class interest in profit maximization under socialism they must satisfy the material and cultural needs of the working class within ecological limits the importance of labor s power to manipulate matter should not be underestimated but it is not value creation per se economic value is not a substance in and of itself therefore any such value judgments and value hierarchies based on them that are not grounded in quantifiable energy expenditures should be viewed with a high degree of skepticism value is not a uniquely independent substance but this does not mean it is purely fictitious it is an epiphenomenon of the labor process of the rationally directed use of energy and is real as such but value in its original and grounding manifestation the dual form of matter and energy pre exists human and all other life forms the worker is an arranger and discoverer of values but not a creator nature is the source of all values not only use values as marx erroneously believed 3 in this concept of ecological socialism the fundamental principle of socialist distribution that the individual receives from society a quantity of value equal to what he has contributed to it remains in force the difference is that value is reinterpreted in materialist terms as energy expenditure and return that on expenditure marx s understanding of value as congealed labor time is rejected as an idealistic hegelian reification of the concepts of labor and time that is incompatible with materialism 4 the distribution scenario for the primary stage of communism sketched by marx in critique of the gotha program is therefore rewritten he receives a certificate from society that he has consumed such and such an amount of energy after deducting part of this amount for the common funds and with this certificate he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as costs the same expenditure of energy the same amount of energy which he has given to society in one form he receives back in another but all expenditures must take place within quantifiable ecological limits the principle for the higher phase of communism is reworded from each according to his ability to each according to his need within the limits of nature s capacities 5 this reformulated theory of value requires reinterpretation of the concepts of exchange value surplus value price and fair compensation exchange value is reinterpreted as the amount of energy required to produce the commodity surplus value as the amount of energy contributed by the worker to the production process that exceeds the quantity of energy that he receives in return for his labor fair compensation now means an equal energy exchange between the worker and the owner of the productive enterprise minus deductions necessary to maintain the enterprise and other socially necessary subtractions under socialism the owner will be the whole society since ecology is logically prior to all society this principle applies whether the owner is a capitalist a class an alliance of classes a state or a free association of workers 6 the only justification for differences in compensation is measurable differences in energy expended by workers during the labor process this replaces marx s standard of labor time and the distinction between simple and complex labor compensation differences based on differences in the quality or complexity of different forms of work are unjustified in these terms justification requires demonstration of a quantifiable difference among forms of work for example if a construction worker expends more energy than an accountant the former is owed higher compensation than the latter if not then not society may choose to use compensation differences to encourage quality improvements or the acquisition of complex skills but such considerations are matters of social utility that violate the reformulated principle of socialist distribution if they are not justifiable in material terms in this interpretation the priority of socialist distribution is to return to individuals the amount of energy they have invested in society minus necessary deductions adherence to this principle is incompatible with distribution regimes that promote either poverty or wealth by returning to workers either less or more than the amount of energy they have contributed furthermore it has been argued that there is no scientific basis for such distinctions contrary to marx s erroneous belief that complex labor necessarily has greater objective value because of its higher value creating capacity in a socialist society compensation differences permitted for reasons of social utility must be minimized and regulated to prevent capitalist restoration 7 marx s view that smaller quantities of complex labor are equal to larger amounts of simple labor is justified only if there is evidence that complex labor consumes more energy than simple labor but there is no such evidence the evidence is overwhelmingly to the contrary simple manual labor requires higher energy consumption than complex intellectual labor see note 20 the reformulated theory of value provides no justification for a compensation hierarchy favoring complex intellectual labor over simple manual labor 8 the fact that some forms of work involve manipulation of higher quantities of energy than others does not entail that workers in those fields expend more of their own metabolic energy during their work or as part of their labor in acquiring and maintaining their ability to perform high energy work nor are they entitled to higher compensation because they create higher energy fields energy and matter in conformity to their respective conservation laws are neither created nor destroyed these fundamental constituents of our material reality may be transferred or transformed from one state into another by the worker but unlike shiva the human worker whether of hand or brain can neither create nor destroy matter and energy since value is reducible to quantities of energy the conservation laws also apply to value strictly speaking the view that labor creates value is erroneous labor manipulates quantities of matter and energy and thereby manipulates quantities of value new methods of manipulating value are discovered during the labor process but human beings do not possess the power of creating matter energy or value out of nothing 9 since the universe is composed of a pre established quantity of matter and energy the labor process in the broadest sense is the act of directing finite quantities of energy the process can be exploitive capitalism or cooperative socialism 10 a reasonable socialism aims to meet each person s material needs emphasis on needs not wants in quantities that correlate with the society s productive capacity preservation of its ecological foundations and the functioning of society within known ecological limits the reinterpreted theory of value promotes this while marx s theory discourages it any deviation from these limits that favors intellectual workers or any other social stratum on the erroneous assumption that they contribute more labor or create more value than other workers is unjustified socialist society must respect objective energy values and the dialectic of needs and limits it cannot shirk its responsibility to meet fundamental material needs but it must prohibit breaking ecological limits to provide so called elite strata intellectual workers or even elite populations such as north america or western europe with extravagant compensation levels that they are erroneously judged to deserve under the old labor theory of value 11 in this concept of value over consumption of energy by favored social strata that exceeds their actual contribution to society is dealt with by limiting compensation to the quantity of energy contributed by the worker this does not preclude the possibility that specific forms of energy such as fossil fuels may come under additional regulations required for maintaining a healthy ecology yes a socialist society must return to workers what they invest in society but it would be madness to give so much that its ecological foundations are destroyed in the process the point is for socialism to fill basic needs not unlimited wants 12 the primary concern of socialism must not be to provide human beings with limitless material abundance it must strike a balance between material needs and known ecological limits and the conception of need must evolve with changes in our knowledge of ecological limits socialism must fairly compensate workers for the energy they contribute to the common good but whether this results in material abundance is a secondary concern it must be decided how much growth is compatible with a thriving environment because the material world is ultimately entropic as expressed by the boltzmann entropy equation s k log w life s flourishing requires temporarily decreasing entropy through matter energy inputs both natural and rationally directed consequently there must be a sense of limits to disruptive growth a preference for permitting nature to exist undisturbed and recognition of the importance of letting things be 13 consumption must be understood as compensation for one s material contribution not a reward for virtue of any kind which must be its own reward if it is to remain virtuous otherwise talented workers and this includes those who are talented at self promotion fraud deception theft violence and gluttony will take the vast bulk of social goods for themselves and condemn other to second class status as the deserved outcome of their inferiority in the process they will destroy the biosphere with their voracious consumption which they view as just reward for their limitless superiority capitalism and the old productivist consumerist socialism with the groundless distinctions between work deserving of high and low rewards must be rejected a scientific socialism scientific in the sense that it takes other sciences seriously including climatology and ecology must be about limiting human consumption not unleashing it consumption must be within the limits defined by climatology and ecology rather than the promethean consumerist aspirations of classical liberalism nineteenth century marxism twentieth century marxism leninism and socialism with chinese characteristics this might seem unfair to chinese socialism which promises to build an ecological civilization amid rapid and massive development but it is too soon to tell whether this promise will prove empty what is certain is that it has already made a substantial contribution to the global climate crisis by releasing what are now world leading quantities of co 2 into the atmosphere 14 the idea that scientific socialism must be compatible with other sciences requires clarification it does not mean that socialists must acknowledge the established assumptions and findings of all sciences and explicitly agree with them does it matter whether socialists know and accept the latest findings of actinology otology tribology etc probably not it is enough for socialists to take account of established theoretical principles and empirical findings in all sciences that bear directly upon their project and take care not to violate their principles unless they can show that the established principle is incorrect and must be abandoned i mean by established principles and findings those that have withstood scrutiny so far and which have not been convincingly refuted by any other science including marxism marx should be criticized for example when he talks about labor time as a congealable ingredient that the labor process adds to the material substance of the commodity this conflicts with a fundamental proposition of modern physics which views time as an immaterial dimension of reality not an ingredient that can be added to things by some process or other such as labor if marxists cannot provide convincing reasons to prefer their assumptions about time to those of modern physics then the traditional marxist theory of value should be reformulated in terms compatible with physics on the other hand if marxists can refute standard physics by rigorously demonstrating that time should be regarded as a substance the substance of value as marx called it then physics should adapt to marxism but this does not seem likely 15 besides the need for an empirically defensible theory of value marxism must be kept relevant in the newly named anthropocene epoch this name denotes the present age of planetary environmental crisis it is now clear that the intractable environmental problems facing humankind are the result of human activities especially the complementary economic and scientific developments that have taken place since the industrial revolution at the very latest a terrifying increase in human power to devour the environment has occurred causing a constellation of problems that includes air water and soil pollution global warming and climate change human overpopulation resource depletion the global destruction of habitats and mass extinctions the stress on the material bases of life has killed vast numbers of organisms in what is called the sixth great extinction cf kolbert elizabeth the sixth great extinction new york henry holt and comany 2014 there is even some concern that homo sapiens may not survive the anthropocene no one is sure whether life can survive if industrial civilization continues its trajectory toward unlimited economic growth or whether humans if they do survive will be forced to revert to the lower consumption levels that characterized early or pre industrial eras if marxists can develop a theoretical and practical program for dealing with the problems of the anthropocene the world will flock to it otherwise the world will look to capitalist solutions such as liberalism neoliberalism social democracy and fascism for solutions this will happen regardless of how dangerous and absurd it seems to marxists 16 a scientific theory of value is necessary not only to bring marxism in communion with the other empirical sciences it is also a prerequisite of an ecological marxism which is in turn crucial to marxism s relevance in the anthropocene it must replace marx s labor mixing theory which is a holdover from natural rights based labor mixing theories of bourgeois political economists for an early labor mixing theory see john locke s discussion of property in chapter 5 of the second treatise of civil government it is scientifically correct that marxists aim to replace these ideological mystifications with empirically verifiable propositions it is also a wise political strategy because science based political strategies like all human endeavors informed by the relevant scientific disciplines actually stand a reasonable chance of achieving the intended results
what real journalism is all about walter cronkite once said that journalism is what we need to make democracy work he was absolutely right which is why today s assault on journalism by wall street billionaire businessmen silicon valley and donald trump presents a crisis and why we must take concrete action real journalism is different from the gossip punditry and clickbait that dominates today s news real journalism in the words of joseph pulitzer is the painstaking reporting that will fight for progress and reform never tolerate injustice or corruption always fight demagogues pulitzer said journalism must always oppose privileged classes and public plunderers never lack sympathy with the poor always remain devoted to the public welfare never be satisfied with merely printing news always be drastically independent never be afraid to attack wrong whether by predatory plutocracy or predatory poverty when we have had real journalism we have seen crimes like watergate exposed and confronted leading to anti corruption reforms when we have lacked real journalism we have seen crimes like mortgage fraud go unnoticed and unpunished leading to a devastating financial crisis that destroyed millions of americans lives real journalism requires significant resources one reason we do not have enough real journalism in america right now is because many outlets are being gutted by the same forces of greed that are pillaging our economy advertisement for example two silicon valley corporations facebook and google control 60pc of the entire digital advertising market they have used monopolistic control to siphon off advertising revenues from news organizations a recent study by the news media alliance a trade organization found that in 2018 as newspaper revenues declined google made 4 7bn off reporting that google did not pay for at the same time corporate conglomerates and hedge fund vultures have bought and consolidated beleaguered local newspapers and slashed their newsrooms all while giving executives big payouts gannett s proposed merger with gatehouse media for instance will consolidate hundreds of publications under one mega corporation s control and slash 300m worth of synergies which is often corporate speak for layoffs matt pearce a reporter for the los angeles times notes that the new gannett gatehouse chief executive is getting 4 5m in bonuses and stock just for walking in the door the result of these trends has been the decimation of journalism over the past 15 years more than 1 400 communities across the country have lost newspapers which are the outlets local television radio and digital news sites rely on for reporting since 2008 we have seen newsrooms lose 28 000 employees and in the past year alone 3 200 people in the media industry have been laid off today for every working journalist there are six people now working in public relations often pushing a corporate line at precisely the moment when we need more reporters covering the healthcare crisis the climate emergency and economic inequality we have television pundits paid tens of millions of dollars to pontificate about frivolous political gossip as local news outlets are eviscerated the negative effects are predictable according to a working paper by researchers at notre dame and the university of illinois when newsrooms are hollowed out overall costs to taxpayers rise because there are fewer reporters scrutinizing government transactions a study published by spotlight on poverty and opportunity a non partisan forum found that despite millions of americans struggling to survive budget strapped newsrooms have not turned their attention to poverty to be sure when we see the miami herald exposé on jeffrey epstein or the charleston gazette mail s courageous reporting on the opioid crisis we know that good reporters are still overcoming the odds and managing to produce essential journalism that scrutinizes power exposes wrongdoing and challenges the status quo but we know that those success stories are too often the exception and not the norm we also know that donald trump is making things far worse he is a pathological liar who has spent his presidency trying to demonize journalists when they dare to debunk his lies worse he has called the media the enemy of the people in a deliberate attempt to destroy the very idea of a free press trump s authoritarian bullying of the media is totally unacceptable and it must be denounced and rejected but let us be clear that alone will not solve the journalism crisis moreover a further expansion of oligarchic business models in the media industry could make matters worse today after decades of consolidation and deregulation just a small handful of companies control almost everything you watch read and download given that reality we should not want even more of the free press to be put under the control of a handful of corporations and benevolent billionaires who can use their media empires to punish their critics and shield themselves from scrutiny after all tv networks that rely on 4 5bn a year of pharmaceutical ads may be thrilled to sugarcoat our current dysfunctional healthcare system but they will never provide a consistently fair hearing for something like medicare for all even though polls show that a majority of americans support such a proposal corporate media organizations sponsored by fossil fuel industry ads may gladly provide a platform for guests who insist that our current oligarchic economy is just great but as studies show the same outlets often downplay or omit coverage of the climate crisis that those advertisers are helping create and news outlets owned by disney and jeff bezos may happily tout disney films and bezos s plans for space exploration but we cannot count on them to consistently and aggressively cover workers fight for better wages at disney or bezos controlled companies in fact in one instance we saw that the washington post which bezos owns tried to punish a reporter because he spoke out for better wages at the newspaper advertisement we need to rebuild and protect a diverse and truly independent press so that real journalists can do the critical jobs that they love and that a functioning democracy requires when i am president my administration will put in place policies that will reform the media industry and better protect independent journalism at both the local and national levels for example we will reverse the trump administration s attempts to make corporate media mergers even more likely in the future we are not going to rubber stamp proposals like the new plan to merge cbs and viacom into a 30bn colossus i have long opposed media consolidation and was one of only 16 members of the us house to oppose the disastrous 1996 telecommunications act which accelerated consolidation in my administration we are going to institute an immediate moratorium on approving mergers of major media corporations until we can better understand the true effect these transactions have on our democracy in the spirit of existing federal laws we will start requiring major media corporations to disclose whether or not their corporate transactions and merger proposals will involve significant journalism layoffs we will also require that before any future mergers can take place employees must be given the opportunity to purchase media outlets through employee stock ownership plans an innovative business model that was first pioneered in the newspaper industry and we will prevent media related merger and deregulation decisions at federal agencies that adversely affect people of color and women as the not for profit watchdog group free press has noted women and people of color are woefully underrepresented among broadcast license holders the group points out that this is because when the federal communications commission has approved mergers it has failed to consider how such concentration affects ownership opportunities for women and people of color when our administration appoints new progressive leadership at the fcc we will reverse the trump administration s moves which have gutted longstanding media ownership rules what trump has done allows cross ownership of newspapers and television or radio stations he has also given the green light to owning multiple stations in the same market the harm may be great in theory says free press these changes would allow a single broadcaster to own both your local newspaper and your top two local broadcast stations plus operate a handful of other stations through sharing agreements turning your community into a one newsroom town we will do the opposite we will reinstate and strengthen media ownership rules and we will limit the number of stations that large broadcasting corporations can own in each market and nationwide we will also direct federal agencies to study the impact of consolidation in print television and digital media to determine whether further antitrust action is necessary additionally we will pass my workplace democracy plan which will boost media workers laudable efforts to form unions and collectively bargain with their employers i have publicly supported journalists efforts to unionize unions not only fight for media workers wages and benefits they can also better protect reporters from corporate policies that aim to prevent journalists from scrutinizing media owners and their advertisers we cannot sit by and allow corporations billionaires and demagogues to destroy the fourth estate nor can we allow them to replace serious reporting with infotainment and propaganda advertisement finally when it comes to silicon valley i will appoint an attorney general as well as federal trade commission officials who more stringently enforce antitrust laws against tech giants like facebook and google to prevent them from using their enormous market power to cannibalize bilk and defund news organizations their monopoly power has particularly harmed small independent news outlets that do not have the corporate infrastructure to fight back we must also explore new ways to empower media organizations to collectively bargain with these tech monopolies and we should consider taxing targeted ads and using the revenue to fund not for profit civic minded media that will be part of an overall effort to substantially increase funding for programs that support public media s news gathering operations at the local level in much the same way many other countries already fund independent public media our constitution s first amendment explicitly protects the free press because the founders understood how important journalism is to a democracy more than two centuries after the constitution was signed we cannot sit by and allow corporations billionaires and demagogues to destroy the fourth estate nor can we allow them to replace serious reporting with infotainment and propaganda we must take action and if we do i know we can be successful we can and will restore the media that joseph pulitzer and walter cronkite envisioned and that america so desperately needs n sanders was a formerus presidential candidate
although economists say december s job gains are respectable for this stage in the economic cycle some worry that workers are losing ground as wage gains slipped to 2 9 percent on an annualized basis below economists expectations glassdoor com chief economist andrew chamberlain called the figure incredibly disappointing noting that in spite of 145 000 new jobs and an unemployment rate that remained steady at 3 5 percent pay growth has consistently lagged the rest of the labor market recovery since the great recession dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america said part of this is a function of the lower number of available jobs at this stage of the economic cycle but he added that the pressure president donald trump s trade war is exerting on corporate profits is a key culprit behind the falloff in worker pay there s no question that margins are being squeezed we re seeing a lot of evidence of that he said there are two implications it takes some of the pressure off profit margins for companies but it s healthy enough to help consumers feel like they can go out and spend said sameer samana senior global market strategist at the wells fargo investment institute although he added that further deceleration could undermine consumer confidence and lead to a cutback in spending the creation of more low paying jobs also could play a role according to josh wright chief economist at icims the december figures showed a surge in leisure and hospitality health care and social assistance and retail jobs which tend to be lower income positions jeff mills chief investment officer of bryn mawr trust offered a silver lining to slowing wage growth it suggests monetary policy will remain accommodative this year it underscores an inflation backdrop that remains pretty benign it s unlikely to provoke tightening by the federal reserve he said the good news for consumers is the federal reserve has indicated it has the economy s back having pivoted on interest rates in 2019 said mark hamrick senior economic analyst at bankrate com but the trio of rate cuts last year has left the central bank with a weaker hand to play in the event of a downturn he added a big part of its ammunition is gone with capital investment at a trough as corporate executives wait out the uncertain outcome of trump s trade policies the u s economy has been dependent on robust consumer spending for continued momentum a sharp or sustained drop in that activity would mark an economic inflection point economists said the average hourly workweek has ticked lower from a year ago which translates into smaller take home pay and less disposable income samana also noted that the average hourly workweek has ticked lower from a year ago a potentially bad sign in the absence of robust wage gains a shorter workweek translates into lower take home pay and less disposable income in the average american pocketbook in some ways the u s economy s been doing the heavy lifting of the rest of the world hamrick said that imbalance cannot continue forever a shorter workweek also is a frequent harbinger of impending job cuts often companies reduce hours worked before they lay people off samana said it s something that could be one of those leading indicators

last week the oil futures market saw december s rally effectively fade despite being aided by the increasing tensions between the united states and iran and the fears regarding a potential supply disruption in the market it s important to note that the current state of affairs doesn t necessarily reflect a better geopolitical situation and that the most recent actions aren t hinting towards a peaceful resolution after all we must remember that iran attacked american army bases last week and although the attacks weren t especially significant in terms of number of causalities the united states government still decided to impose additional sanctions against the iranians nevertheless it seems that investors understood that despite the rising tensions the oil supply wouldn t necessarily be affected in a significant way just as we suggested last week the situation in the oil futures markets also played against the canadian dollar oil is one of the main canadian exports and the energy sector itself accounts for around 7 8 percent of the canadian gross domestic product making its currency very sensitive to the movements of this market a rallying u s dollar has also affected the value of the cad especially as the signing of phase 1 of the agreement between the united states and china approaches besides those factors last week s data about canada s balance of trade didn t aid the loonie either as the country is heavily trade dependent data showed that canadian exports fell for their third consecutive month in november falling by 2 7 percent from october s figure while imports dropped by 1 7 percent leaving the trade gap at around cad 1 09 billion according to statistics canada such a situation is due to canada s longest railway strike in a decade which took place at the end of november 2019 and lasted eight days affecting the shipment of imports and exports in a significative way canada s energy sector exports also fell 7 4 percent because of pipeline disruptions that took place in october despite these disappointing facts the bank of canada recently highlighted the improving global economic situation as tensions seem to be fading or perhaps more correctly the threat of an imminent battle seems to be diminishing nevertheless the bank remains cautious regarding the potential implications of an eventual trade deal between the united states and china certainly it seems that the potential downside risks have eased as the united states and china approach a deal this all bears watching during the coming year said the bank of canada governor stephen poloz last thursday unlike its counterparts in the developed world the bank of canada has consistently refrained from cutting the cash rates leaving them unchanged at 1 75 percent since october 2018 this is noteworthy given the weakening global economic situation the world experienced last year which drove other central banks to cut their cash rates and to employ monetary easing to aid the sluggish economic growth the bank has justified its decision to leave the rates on hold claiming that despite the global tensions canada s inflation levels remain close to its target signaling that the canadian economy has been operating close to its potential output unlike the united states and the european union notwithstanding the above the loonie still managed to recover on friday after the markets learned that canada s unemployment rate fell unexpectedly to 5 6 percent in december from the previous month s 5 9 percent it s still not clear whether the bank of canada will prefer to remain on the sidelines clinging to the optimism caused by this data release or will choose to finally cut the cash rates in any case we won t know until january 22 after the bank s next policy meeting
happy new year the u s economy has entered 2020 with a little more zip as long as americans keep spending the economy is all but certain to sidestep a recession in 2020 for a record 11th straight year the crucial question is can they and the answer seems to be quite clearly yes what s put a sturdy foundation under the economy is the best labor market in decades the u s added 145 000 new jobs in december to cap off the ninth straight year in which the economy created more than 2 million new jobs all the new hiring over the last decade has pushed the unemployment rate down to a 50 year low of 3 5 if it goes any lower the jobless rate would hit a bottom last reached during the eisenhower presidency in the early 1950s the pace of household spending in 2020 however could take a step back if the recent deterioration in wage growth persists the increase in hourly pay over the past 12 months fell below 3 in december for the first time in a year and a half reflecting a shift in hiring toward lower paying jobs yearly wage growth peaked at 3 4 last spring and has been drifting lower ever since read yikes wage growth called incredibly disappointing in jobs report the surprising slowdown in the growth of worker wages will make it harder for consumers to keep spending at their 2019 pace in 2020 said scott anderson chief economist at bank of the west but spend they will secure in their jobs americans are still quite confident in the economy surveys show they appeared to have boosted spending during the holiday season at decent clip unlike a year ago when the government was partially shut down and the stock market briefly tumbled on fears of a recession economists polled by marketwatch predict retail sales in december likely rose around 0 4 the government s retail postmortem the capstone in a big week of economic reports is published next thursday if that s not enough the federal reserve cut the cost of borrowing in the second half of last year stocks djia 0 46 spx 0 29 keep hitting fresh record highs and the trump administration struck a deal with china that reduces to a simmer a trade dispute between the world s two largest economies that nearly boiled over last summer the economy looks to head into the new decade with a little more zip than we thought said senior economist sal guatieri of bmo capital markets while this may not foreshadow another decade of uninterrupted growth it should keep recession fears at bay the fed is widely expected to keep u s interest rates low for quite some time perhaps another year or even longer the erosion in wage growth is just the latest sign showing that inflation poses little or no threat to the economy despite the tightest labor market in half a century a trio of readings this week on consumer wholesale and import prices are all expected to reinforce the idea that inflation remains low too low for many senior fed officials they d like to see inflation creep above their 2 target and stay there for awhile for now it doesn t appear to be in the cards the state of heavy industry is also likely to disappoint in a handful of surveys of manufacturers they have borne the brunt of the trade war with china many firms scaled back production investment and hiring in 2019 to cope with lower exports or higher costs of raw materials even the partial u s trade agreement with china probably won t give them much of a lift in light of the wide rift between the two economic superpowers in short 2020 is shaping up to be much like 2019 consumers once again hold the key too how well the economy performs source marketwatch
the south african rand exchange rates stumbled in initial trade this week with the currency being buffeted by tensions in the middle east as well as the load shedding implemented by struggling state utility eskom the rand would later strike a two week low on tuesday as the iran launched a series of missiles at us airbases in iraq stoking fears of another escalation of tensions however markets quickly calmed in response to a tweet from donald trump claiming all is well with the rand and other risk assets quickly rallying on hopes iran would see this as a suitable response to the killing of general qasem soleimani and the lack of any us casualties would not see washington escalate things further marios hadjikyriacos of trading firm xm suggested investors seem to have sided with the view that while this is clearly a worrisome situation it doesn t end with an actual war the concern was that iran would strike back against us personnel leaving trump no choice but to hit back again generating a vicious tit for tat cycle of retaliation with no us casualties to speak of though and with tehran having replied in a strong enough fashion to save face domestically the risk of the situation escalating out of control appears fairly low the rand was unable to consolidate at its best levels however being forced to give some ground in the latter half of the week as eskom announced it would need to extend its power cuts into friday pound exchange rates undermined by carney s dovish comments meanwhile the pound gbp got off to a strong start this week as the final reading of the uk s services pmi in december was revised higher according to data published by ihs markit the uk s services index was revised up from 49 1 to 50 in december meaning the uk s dominant service sector narrowly avoided a contraction at the end of 2019 advertisement tim moore economics associate director at ihs markit commented the latest uk service sector figures are an improvement on those seen in november and strike a slightly more positive tone than the earlier flash pmi for december the final ihs markit cips uk services data includes survey responses from after the election unlike the earlier flash estimate however sterling then faced a setback in the mid week as brexit returned to the spotlight as boris johnson meet with european commission president ursula von der leyen speaking ahead of the meeting von der leyen warned that it would be impossible for the uk and eu to reach a comprehensive deal on trade given the limited timeframe imposed by johnson these losses were then accelerated in the latter half of the week in the wake of some dovish remarks from bank of england boe governor mark carney carney warned there are downside risks from global growth and the possibility that uncertainties over future trading relationships could remain entrenched with the relatively limited space to cut bank rate if evidence builds that the weakness in activity could persist risk management considerations would favour a relatively prompt response gbp zar exchange rate forecast robust inflation to bolster sterling next week speaking at an inflation targeting conference in london carney dropped hints that the boe could cut interest rates in the near term as he suggested the bank would respond promptly if an expected recovery in growth did not materialise looking ahead to next week the pound to south african rand gbp zar exchange rate may face some headwinds at the start of the session as the uk s latest gdp figures are forecast to show that domestic growth stagnated again in november however sterling may rally in the mid week with the publication of the uk s consumer price index as another bump in inflation could ease the pressure on the boe to cut interest rates meanwhile the focus for zar investors next week is likely to be on the south african reserve bank s sarb latest rate decision while no policy changes are expected this month the rand could take a dive if the sarb s forward guidance hints at the possibility of a rate cut in the near future
gov laura kelly special to gannett kansas as i travel throughout the state i m impressed by kansans energy and optimism even as we tackle serious problems there s renewed spirit and dedication i ve also been heartened by feedback from people across the state and equally encouraged by my administration s work to repair programs and restore services kansans want and need after i took office we set out to hear from kansans at town halls listening sessions roundtable discussions and other public gatherings we haven t been disappointed kansans are smart and practical they embrace fiscal responsibility they want pragmatic thoughtful solutions and we are on that path we funded schools and our careful budgeting led to the state s largest ending balance in a decade we also will continue to reject reckless tax policy proposals and instead align with kansans who value strong schools good roads and healthy communities to start kansans have been loud and clear in calling for the responsible expansion of kancare the state s medicaid program retaining our federal tax dollars and providing affordable health care for some 150 000 uninsured kansans is both morally and fiscally responsible preventive care wards off more serious and costly ailments making expansion a prudent investment in healthier families and communities unfortunately the state so far has turned away more than 3 7 billion in federal funds since january 2014 dollars that would aid kansas hospitals struggling with the cost of uncompensated care the governor s council on medicaid expansion has studied expansion models in other states so we can avoid repeating their mistakes kansas needs a straightforward approach not one that s overly complex and costly the bipartisan plan we recently unveiled would address those concerns we re also listening and responding to kansans who need tax relief among recent recommendations from the bipartisan governor s council on tax reform were a food sales tax rebate to help kansans who need it most and a return to a tax reduction fund that would give local governments more ability to lower property taxes labor shortages plague businesses and communities statewide as well technical and trade schools and other job training programs deliver a strong return on investment early education and k 12 public schools form the foundation for success and also cannot be shortchanged another strategy to grow the labor pool rests in our prisons the shift from strictly punitive strategies to more workforce training will help fill job openings and also reduce recidivism it s one step needed to address overcrowded prisons corrections as well as our foster care system were severely undermined to repair both systems under great stress we re implementing proven programs and strategies designed to restore those vital services road projects also took a hit in recent years kansans know good infrastructure enables economic growth and enhances safety in communities large and small we re ending the senseless diversion of funds away from highways by closing the so called bank of kdot moving forward we envision a more modern plan for our fast changing transportation landscape kansans also have helped guide us by speaking out in public gatherings for our new economic development framework for growth and our new office of rural prosperity designed to aid in rural improvement efforts we ll keep listening with more public events to come other opportunities to share input are available through our virtual town hall at governor kansas gov or by emailing us at govevents ks gov working together we ll chart an even better course for kansas in 2020 and beyond laura kelly is the 48th governor of kansas
the san diego union tribune editorial board interviewed four candidates in the 50th congressional district race ahead of the march 3 2020 primary election in which the top two vote getters will advance to a runoff election in november below is the transcript of our dec 2 2019 interview with republican candidate carl demaio who is running to succeed duncan hunter in a district that represents residents in a large swath of san diego county including el cajon escondido alpine julian borrego springs and some of riverside county this interview was transcribed using the digital transcription service temi and checked for accuracy by a staffer to call any errors to our attention or to ask any questions about our interviews please email matthew hall sduniontribune com with the subject line election interviews union tribune tell us why you re running for congress carl demaio well uh i m running for congress because first and foremost i don t think that the voters are getting the sort of representation that they deserve uh they ve had a member of congress who s been distracted by a criminal matter uh for many years who broke public trust uh and and let them down and i think that those voters deserve a full time member of congress who s going to be a fighter all across the state of california when i travel and talk to uh to voters um whether it was on the gas tax repeal campaign in 2018 um or in this campaign i get the same frustration from democrats even republicans and independents they feel like no one is their voice in sacramento no one has their voice in washington that politicians run and make lofty promises and never actually fight to get those things done if anything people know me as a fighter someone who takes on the challenging issues the big issues and most politicians don t want to do that because that is in some cases political suicide uh why not just you know put out puffery or niceties uh broad statements but actually don t do anything and then people will think that you did something it s all talk and no action uh and whether it was uh what i did in the city of san diego to fix the finances um in calling for fiscal reform pension reform um and taking the battle literally into the streets when the mayor and the city council weren t able to actually do their jobs on those important pressing uh matters or um taking on the issue of the gas tax and the car tax advertisement i m running for congress because first and foremost i don t think that the voters are getting the sort of representation that they deserve carl demaio um starting with the first successful recall of a sitting state senator in 104 years uh and i think that sent a strong message that um politicians who break their promise to their voters to their constituents and add to the burden of our cost of living face a consequence at the ballot box um or putting the item on the ballot um now we were robbed of an honest election of a fair election uh when they changed the title and summary but uh what we showed is that we have ballot access and that people can organize and fight in the state um against the odds and so what they will get from me as their member of congress is someone who um is clear and candid on where they stand on the issues um which is refreshing in politics and uh you know it s not often seen and someone who isn t just going to pay lip service to issues but someone who s going to actually organize the fight and take the fight on the issues that people care about meet other candidates in the race below commentary meet the candidates for the 50th congressional district these are four of the major candidates seeking to succeed congressman duncan hunter in the 2020 primary election q what do you think about hunter s i m going to say apparent because it hasn t happened yet decision to plead guilty and do you think he should have resigned earlier if not much earlier a well obviously it has to be a difficult decision for him to finally have to take responsibility for his actions um and i wish that he had done it sooner but i m glad that he s finally done it because it does two things in addition to saving his family some additional grief first it gives the voters in the 50th district an opportunity for a fresh start and we can turn the page on the criminal issues the scandal and they can get a full time member of congress depending upon when his resignation is it could be sooner versus later uh second um it shows that members of congress are not above the law he broke the law and all too often members of congress are not held accountable if you or i did what we did with the corporate credit card embezzled a quarter million dollars um a the credit card would have been cut up upon being you know accused of doing something bad you would have been you know the credit card would ve been cut up you probably would ve been put on unpaid leave if not you know fired from your job but what he has been able to do is drag out this ordeal for several years and continue to have access to that very credit card and so what i appreciate about his decision today is that he is finally accepting responsibility for his actions and showing that members of congress are not uh above the law and so i appreciate the fact that the department of justice took the case on um i i appreciate the fact that he has finally accepted responsibility for his actions but it also means that we have a lot more work to do to change the culture in washington because a lot of those members of congress uh they turned a blind eye at any time speaker pelosi could have vacated his seat at any time she could have put the issue on the floor and said hey we should have the ethics committee review the conduct uh it seems painfully obvious what this guy has done and he should be stripped of his position his taxpayer funded position and you shouldn t be having a campaign account with a credit card so members of congress from both political parties are guilty in this instance of looking the other way congressman duncan hunter walks across broadway in downtown san diego on his way to federal court with his attorney paul pfingst where he is expected to plead guilty nelvin c cepeda the san diego union tribune advertisement q well he did lose his committees right a oh boy what a burden not having to show up to his committee meetings uh no being stripped of a committee is is not uh a real punishment from these members of congress uh the real punishment would have been that his colleagues should have said that this is unacceptable behavior they should have weighed the evidence they should have removed him from his position now that doesn t mean that the issue goes away criminally as an individual he still uh would face trial and he would get his day in court but it does not mean that the members of congress should turn a blind eye to this issue and so one of the major uh issues i ve always run on is accountability enforcing politicians to live under the same rules as the rest of us it was part of the pension reform uh initiative that we would strip members of the city council and the mayor and the politicians of their gold plated pensions and they would be put into the 401 k system um getting rid of the auto allowance stripping them of their luxury boxes members of congress members of the state legislature dogcatchers anyone who serves any public office should be subjected to the same exact laws as the rest of us and so i find it refreshing that the department of justice actually did take the case on because duncan hunter wasn t the first who engaged in this sort of conduct over the years q does your dogcatcher policy apply to the president of the united states of america a it should apply to every single elected official that they should be treated uh no different than um the citizens that they govern q so what do you think about the impeachment process a i think it s a farce no look be honest about it they were calling for his impeachment even before all the ballots were counted in 2016 advertisement q on the ukraine issue what do you think about the ukraine issue a oh well why don t we start with mueller why don t we start with the uh steele dossier president donald trump speaks at a campaign rally thursday jan 9 2020 in toledo ohio ap photo jacquelyn martin associated press q because the question i asked was about the ukraine a well of course it s convenient because all the other attacks on him have fallen by the wayside at some point you have to sit back and say you know it doesn t matter what this guy does they want to impeach him you know it s like what pelosi said on obamacare we have to pass the bill to find out what s in it we have to remove him from office to find out what he did wrong and i find that to be an abuse of power uh as much as the democrats are accusing the president of abusing his power the only abuse of power i see here is abuse of power by department of justice officials and the intelligence community there s some real inappropriate uh activity that s been going on and it needs to be fully investigated and people need to be held accountable and i see congress abusing the articles of impeachment uh the process of impeachment which should be very rare and only for the most extraordinary high crimes and misdemeanors um carried out by a president against our country q so you think it s ok for a sitting president to ask a foreign leader for advertisement a i read the transcripts and i read the transcripts and i found no problem i found no problem those discussions happen all the time asking for help in an ongoing investigation to find out uh who actually did interfere in our elections absolutely asking for an investigation into whether another elected official misused their office for personal private gain absolutely um that is absolutely a legitimate question to be asking and to be referring the matter as he did to his attorney general at some point you have to sit back and say you know it doesn t matter what this guy does they want to impeach him carl demaio q do you think your would be constituents are in the same camp with you a i do i do believe that absolutely what i m finding the voters um whether they like trump or they don t like trump i see more and more every single day that these hearings drag on that people are seeing this for what it really is that this has been a witch hunt that this has always been let s get the guy out of office and whatever the cause or whatever the claim is we ll do i remember where all this started apparently he was a russian operative and then they really figured out well that s not going to fly well then it was he colluded with russia and then that didn t fly but we knew that about six weeks into the investigation mueller knew that six weeks in the investigation but we still had two and a half years of a process playing out and because the president decided i m going to stand up for myself oh that s obstruction of justice so where does it end when do we actually say that elections have consequences and that if someone is elected if you don t like it what you do is you find a better candidate to run against them four years from that point you don t sit there and try to create criminal um indictments to overturn the will of the voters i think that is the biggest uh thing that i think a lot of independents and even some democrats are saying uh if they re being honest with themselves and that s why i think you know one of the things i want to do is stand up and say i think that the president is getting a raw deal i think that this is an abusive power the only abuse of power i see right now is the fact that the democrats want to exercise what should be the most um extraordinary power of the congress to say we are going to remove someone from office and overturn the results of an election that s extraordinary and they have not met the standard for utilizing that process q so what s your one word description for donald trump a fighter advertisement q what are your priorities a and that s refreshing again the idea that someone would run and say here s what i m going to do and actually get to washington and do it and have a bunch of people in the bureaucracy the career people and the intelligentsia and the establishment from both political parties try to oppose him at every step and then not only oppose his policies but say what we want to do is we want to go after you personally we want to go after you criminally who is really abusing their position here that s the abuse of power that i m seeing so what are my priorities no 1 q so what are your priorities both domestic and foreign policy a there are a lot because there s a lot of stuff that s screwed up but first and foremost um it s about a priority that is political as a political leader i want to organize the opposition in california we have a one party state i don t find that to be healthy and in fact if you sit down with reasonable democrats some of them are scared out of their wits as to the absurd crazy extreme policies that are being proposed by gavin newsom that are being proposed by members of their party and so in california i think we need to have a voice of opposition and that we need to organize the republicans in california to do a better job of fighting back and being a counterbalance that s first and foremost in a political capacity um second my role as a member of congress on the issues that my constituents care about securing the border uh pushing back against government intrusion into our daily lives whether that s taking our money with high taxes uh restricting our choices with regulations or violating our constitutional freedoms those issues of government intrusion whether it be it financial regulatory or uh an infringement on our constitutional rights those issues need to be pushed back against uh strongly and as a member of congress uh i plan to tackle those issues the intrusion of government in our daily lives uh and then finally i would like to be a problem solver on issues that have plagued us for a long time um you know i m disappointed in my own party that they ran on a pledge to secure the border and they didn t we need to build the wall sept 18 lt gen todd semonite left the commanding general of the army corps of engineers explained the construction details of the new border fence to president trump on on wednesday september 18 2019 east of the otay mesa port of entry john gibbins the san diego union tribune we need to reform our asylum and immigration laws so that their loopholes are eliminated and that our border patrol agents and our ice agents can actually do their jobs we need to have e verify so that big business doesn t profit from illegal immigrant labor um and that s why both parties are for illegal immigration big businesses write big fat checks the big lobbyists in d c love an open border they like the dysfunction of the broken immigration system um and so we can have a solution that not only recognizes that we are proud to be a nation of immigrants we take in a million legal immigrants each and every year um the idea that democrats want to say border security is racist i m sorry um a million legal immigrants a year how many more should we take in before you stop calling us racist they re not just calling people who want to secure the border racists they re calling the american people racist that somehow we haven t been generous enough and i find that our country has been amazingly welcome warm inviting as we should it s been a strength for our country to get the best and brightest how lucky are we to get the best and brightest from all around the country or all around the world but if people break our rules and betray our generosity um by not following the process that s been laid out or if that process is not merit based it s more chain based uh you know uh relationship based uh then maybe we re not doing the immigration process the best way when you have people abusing the asylum process which we actually implemented after the sad chapter of our country s history of turning away the jews from nazi germany we said that we will never do this again we will have a whole process for asylum um the people who are abusing the asylum process making phony claims of asylum political persecution um are betraying the lesson we learned in the 1930s and 40s um and so we need to make sure that when we do have an asylum process that it is for people who legitimately have claims for persecution and should be granted asylum um that issue has disappointed me obamacare they ran on repeal and replace obamacare for 2010 2012 2014 2016 they didn t even have a replacement so i released two weeks ago my plan it s a starting point it s called freedom care um because i actually think that if i m going to criticize the republican party for not having a plan to replace obamacare that i should lay out at least one that i d be willing to vote for on day one and hopefully people can see that plan and get their own ideas and add to it and make it a better plan i consider it a starting point but um what s frustrating to me is that there are some problems that we all can agree on uh when you look at the issue of border security 70 of the american people agree we should secure the border um when you take a look at a concern about healthcare costs soaring healthcare costs 70 of american people are worried about soaring house health care costs they just disagree on how to actually fix it and so on those issues that have been longstanding that everyone agrees need to be addressed i d like to be a problem solver and see if i can bring some innovative policies into the mix for people to look at advertisement we need to reform our asylum and immigration laws so that their loopholes are eliminated and that our border patrol agents and our ice agents can actually do their jobs carl demaio q and how would you do that on obamacare or border security a can you point to another congressional candidate in the country that s offered a five point you know detailed you know repeal and replace plan we couldn t find anyone we found principles on a website somewhere but no actual step by step plan and what about sewage tijuana river sewage sewage from tijuana spilling over and closing our beaches and bays last year 131 days out of 365 days and where is the environmental community i mean yes there are people who do press conferences but those are the same damn press conferences i ve seen for what 40 years i remember a young brian bilbray taking a tractor and pushing dirt into the tijuana river valley q well we ve been following that pretty closely to it seems like in the last year more conversation around that issue a oh conversation oh don t let that get you too excited no conversation enough conversation action q how about you specifically how would you advertisement a we re going to build a toilet bowl we re going to make mexico pay for it and we re going to shut down the border every day that one of our beaches has been shut down q a toilet bowl what a building the toilet bowl is really my uh lighthearted way of describing we need to actually put in place infrastructure to deal with the issue and right now there are six separate band aid infrastructure projects that cost about 450 million that have been proposed and the studies the feasibility studies of those six projects that everyone s talking about all that excitement you had about the conversation matt those six projects admittedly in the feasibility studies will not stop the sewage spills 450 million so what i do in my plan and it s on my website three point plan is it starts out with a competition saying look we have six projects that people have come up with the bureaucrats have okay so we have these but what we want to do is issue a incentive competition to entrepreneurs the private sector to come up with a better solution and what we re going to do is we re going to give you some sort of bonus or share on savings and you actually would then be awarded a contract a team would be awarded a contract to actually do the infrastructure project how do we get mexico to pay for it well uh we ask them if this is your sewage water you need to deal with the issue uh but that s where that border closure issue comes in for every day that they have a sewage spill it shuts down one of our beaches we make an adjustment in the hours of our border crossing we start putting the screws little at first but then we continue to ramp up if we re not seeing the cooperation from the mexican government and their investment in the project because this is their sewage water it s not our a sign warns of sewage contaminated ocean waters on a beach on march 1 2017 in coronado calif gregory bull ap photo q are you saying you d close the border let me make sure i understand that what exactly do you do you close the border and you damage the u s economy a and you know who came up with this idea congressman brian bilbray he said you don t close it entirely you take one point of entry and you lop off one of the hours and you say if it happens tomorrow we lop up a second hour here s the thing advertisement q isn t that shooting americans in the foot too a no no it s not what it does is it puts the screws of accountability to both sides because you know what i want the san diego county regional chamber to start really focusing on this i want local politicians here to focus on this i want mexico s politicians to focus on this i want mexico s big business titans to focus on this and the only way you get their attention is by putting a little bit of pain in the mix for these special interests if you have a better idea after 40 years of non action and conversation i m willing to hear it but i m putting a three point plan on the table as a starting point q just to be clear it s not just special interests you re hurting it s everyday americans and mexicans who cross that border a you know who also is getting hurt every single day the people who are trying to swim in those waters the border patrol agents who have to wade through sewage water when they re trying to apprehend people illegally crossing the border so you know inaction does not come without pain without a price and i m sick and tired of seeing this issue uh which should be something that everyone s worried about you know contaminated water you know the san diego regional water control board says that fecal matter in our waterways is the no 1 contaminant this is a huge issue uh and so yeah some of it is runoff you know from the homeless population but a lot of it s also the tijuana river flows of sewage 131 days out of the year so i want to bring some innovations some fresh approaches and some accountability to the proposals and if someone has a better idea great but you know what we re not going to do we re not gonna have another conversation for the next 40 years about this issue we re going to get it done q how are you going to get it done given that as you said have been talking about this for 40 years and nobody ever finds common ground but for brian bilbray it didn t solve anything how would having a plan that nobody is probably likely to back going to get anything done a hold on a second hold on you re making assumptions i think the people will back this first i think we need to get the president up to speed on just how bad the situation is i m not sure that he s fully aware of what happens with the tijuana river uh sewage problem um and i think he d be naturally interested in this and he s used the same approach to getting mexico to cooperate um in a more effective way on border security and he threatened to shut the border uh if mexico did not do a better job of controlling the flow of refugees from the southern portion of the border and it worked i think the president will see the playbook that i m using is his actually second there are provisions in state law and local uh abilities for us to put this issue forward locally um whether it s the county board of supervisors or it could also be through citizens initiative but my goal is to agitate on this issue until the politicians actually solve the problem it is not a mysterious it s not like one of these issues where you say well how are we going to solve it no it s sewage water most you know municipalities have found ways to treat their sewage you know why the mexico uh hasn t put money into their treatment it costs too much money and the water flows up to the united states we re the ones that deal with the consequence so they don t want to put the billion dollars into the upgrades down there now if we were doing it here it d be 3 billion uh but in mexico the same sort of project would be 1 billion they don t want to pay the money fine you don t want to pay the money maybe you re going to start seeing some uh pain when it comes to the border um crossings and how dependent mexico is on that border advertisement q do you have other foreign policy priorities outside of mexico a well i would consider that tangentially foreign policy that s environmental policy that s quality of life i mean think about this the thing i keep hearing from folks is that they can t afford to live in california anymore and they cannot stomach living in california anymore by that they mean they look out and they see the homeless population skyrocketing instead of us helping these people out with the real root of the issue mental health substance abuse we are literally finding ways to shelve the problem i call it shelve it s not house i m not using the word house we re going to shelve the problem in a shelter in a tent we re going to let you sleep in your car we re going to let you sleep over here as long as people can t see you people have gotten the word across the country that california is the place to come if you have a drug habit or a mental health problem and you can t function in your daily life um you know we should call the homeless what they actually are they re vagrants who because of a problem in their life cannot keep a job and because they don t have a job they can t afford to live like the rest of us they can t afford to pay for an apartment uh pay for housing by basically seeing this as a housing crisis we are addressing the wrong issue the root of the issue is people who have broken lives because of their addiction or their mental health problem or dual diagnosis that are not being forced into the treatment programs that they need to change their lives everyone on the street that you see has a family that has given up on them that s how great a challenge they are consumed by the thing i keep hearing from folks is that they can t afford to live in california anymore and they cannot stomach living in california anymore carl demaio q aren t some of the people on the street families themselves a some people on the street our families and for those individuals and we call those there s actually a term in the homeless community uh the homeless providers call them the upper class homeless they have cars usually some of them actually still have jobs and they are economically displaced and we have programs to help them what i d like to see happen on the homeless problem is no 1 enforce the law everything on the homeless crisis begins with our ability to enforce laws to use the laws as leverage whether that s vagrancy laws public encampment laws um panhandling laws drug laws using law enforcement as a lever to force people into the treatment programs that will help actually solve their problem second we have to fund success and not fund failure the housing first model says by government fiat we will only give you money if you allow people to use drugs and if you don t hold them accountable so in other words we are going to take away your ability to actually help these people out to get them into the programs and hold them accountable our best homeless service providers in san diego county solutions for change and the east county transitional living center and you ought to do big stories on these people because they are a huge success they do not take a dime of government money because they do not want the restrictions and the regulations and the strings attached with government government is funding failure right now local state and federal government on the homeless issue we are literally throwing money at failed strategies whereas these two programs which are entirely privately funded are engaging in accountability love compassion and their success rate is through the roof eighty six percnent of east county transitional living center s expenses are paid for by the homeless individuals getting jobs and working through their work work program they are required to go through and complete a g e d they may not engage in any drug use they can t even smoke i don t know why they make that requirement but apparently their model works so i m not going to second guess it so what i want to do is move us from this restrictive failure based program to a performance based share in savings program and i want to try a bunch of different interventions because i don t think one size fits all perhaps the solutions for change and east county transitional living center model works for a certain segment they have a heavy dose of faith based uh programs uh as part of their solution it may not work for all but as long as people and the providers and homeless providers are held accountable for results i don t mind investing in them because you re saving lives final element taking a page out of the east county transitional living center if you are homeless and you re receiving any public assistance from us whether that s free housing welfare et cetera you will be put into a public works program where you will go clean off the trash from the streets people talk about all the uh uh straws and cups and litter that goes out into our beaches and bays fine let s have the most pristine community here in san diego because what we require out of people who receive public assistance is a simple two hour shift every other day to clean up our community um it gives them the sense of satisfaction that they are not a drain on society that they re giving back it gets them into that work pattern of and that s the big thing i ve seen in east county transitional living center it s giving them that sense of satisfaction that i can do this i can actually be productive i can hold a job i can pay my own way and as a result 86 of their program is funded by the people the homeless individuals working at 15 an hour for a variety of you know companies and government enterprises q so you see homelessness as a federal problem advertisement a it s a federal state and local problem because the strings that i m concerned about these restrictive mandates and regulations that um basically are forcing us to fund failure rather than incentivize success those strings start at hud and then they cascade down to state of california and local and so when you have all these zealots out there screaming housing first and you find that affordable housing is 900 000 a unit you scratch your head saying okay seems like someone s using the homeless as window dressing to get their share of the government uh moolah that they re just looking at a stream of money from government and the problem getting worse is actually a good day for them because that means that people will have to raise taxes and divert more money into the failure that we see every day i want to do is see how we can change the policies federal state local to incentivize different approaches to empower these service providers that are doing a great job and to fund success i m also looking at uh social uh philanthropic solutions such as share in savings and social bonds where investors can come in and say okay what s the cost of providing the 911 calls the health uh issues the economic issues with the homeless population and if i save money can i actually uh gainshare on that savings and that actually is an obama administration program called evidence based uh innovation and uh it started out as a federal pilot i want to expand that in the homeless area and see if we can get social philanthropy bonds uh as part of the solution i don t think there s one solution to homelessness but it all has to boil down to measuring our success and holding people accountable q so again i go back to the core question how do you convince all the elected representatives from around the country that this is a national problem not california s problem how do you get them onboard a well i think that when you have as many members of congress from california and this is a major issue throughout the state of california that s a good start when you have 53 representatives i think that s where you might get some bipartisan um leadership on the issue uh but this is an issue that when people see it across the country they see the filth they see people um and the pain every day uh they see the impact of the economy uh they see the cost of these homeless um encampments because we have a major drain on the uh public health system the emergency room costs that go through the roof 911 police and fire and all the diversion of resources for what they call frequent flyers all of those issues um why would they oppose us if we wanted to try to actually solve the problem q what is a standout way or obvious way you d say you d differ policy wise from hunter a i m going to follow the law advertisement q policy wise a i don t think there s a whole lot of difference on issues between um you know duncan hunter s voting and mine q let s talk about the environment a but the role of a congressperson is not to hit a button that s one of the job descriptions hit the right button vote yes or no no that s not what you re there for your job is to innovate solutions to pressing problems um and build the coalitions and apply the political pressure to force the system to act and i think that what i ve shown over the years is an ability to come in with some innovative solutions um i never want to say no and i refuse to accept that well the politicians have never done this before oh well you know what and that s why the problem hasn t been solved so that s not a good enough excuse in my book the goal is to get out there and get the best and brightest ideas minds together and get the ideas out there create the right incentives in the system for action and then build the political muscle to actually get things done q on the environment should the u s be in the paris climate accord a i think that we can do far better on environmental issues if we balance cost and benefit at every step of the way i refuse to accept the notion that we have to choose between having a healthy environment or a prosperous economy working families already struggling in california with the cost of living let s not add to those burdens and when you take a look at some of the ideas offered by folks on the left that are related to environmental purposes um t always boils down to raising taxes increasing regulation and restricting freedom it always does it s not like they ever come up with an easy one where it says oh this is good for the environment and guess what we re not going to raise your taxes and guess what we re not going to regulate your living or your business oh by the way we re not going to restrict your freedom i ve never seen that so call me silly i don t think that their ideas are about the environment i think their ideas are ultimately about getting more of our money restricting more of our freedom and regulating our businesses and our daily lives and they like to create winners and losers in the name of the environment advertisement i think that we can do far better on environmental issues if we balance cost and benefit at every step of the way carl demaio so i m not interested in that i am also not going to let the republicans off the hook where is the republican environmental program where s the republican environmental um proposals because here s the thing i ask audiences all the time okay which one of you want to destroy the environment which one of you wants to choke on dirty water and gag on dirty air oh none of you we re all environmentalists okay and republicans you all think your ideas are better than the other side right and they go yeah that s right so if we care about the environment and we think we have better ideas where s our environmental platform where are our ideas and so whether it s the tijuana river issue or it s performance based environmentalism these are issues that i want to lead on um on climate change let s take a look at continued research and in san diego we have some of our research institutes and grants are at the forefront of doing that let s take a look at china you don t hear a whole lot about what china needs to do to change their emissions you hear a whole lot about how you re bad and you shouldn t be driving a car or you shouldn t be in an airplane while these same politicians are driving cars uh and flying airplanes q but to be clear they re american politicians not chinese politicians that are putting out american policy ideas right a right but when the rate of growth of carbon emissions is from the country of china in india don t you think that that s maybe where we should start because you could literally eliminate the carbon emissions in the united states but if we don t do something about china i guess we re all going to die in 12 years or maybe 13 years instead of 12 years and so again it comes back to the whole notion that i don t believe that they actually um are interested in solving the issue that they purport to be leading on i think they re more interested in getting more of our money regulating more of our lives taking more of our freedoms and i m not going to agree with that what i want to do is come up with better ideas that are about linking a prosperous economy and a sustainable environment q do you believe in climate change that it s caused by humans a i believe the climate has been changing since day one advertisement q do you believe that it s caused by humans a do i believe that humans have an impact on the climate yes because everything has an impact on our ecosystem but i am not convinced that a we can do anything about climate change and so you know what i like to call it do you believe in climate control because literally that s what the other side is trying to suggest is that they somehow have regulation taxes and restrictions on freedom that will allow us to control the climate i don t know but that s sounds awful like a weather machine to me i m more interested in thoughtful solutions that are sustainable can we reduce our footprint can we be more sustainable can we embrace more renewables if the answer is yes and it s good for the economy let s do it so i m looking for the both and solutions not the either or and what i can do is challenge the republican party to come up with market based freedom respecting um taxpayer responsible solutions that are good for the economy and good for the environment you don t see a whole lot of republicans leading on the environment i think you re going to find i m going to be occupying a lane that we haven t seen a whole lot of out there q pretty sure climate change is not a political issue a what s that q i m pretty sure a political issue is not what we re talking about when we re talking about climate change my personal opinion a of course and you make your opinion known every day on the editorial board and in your news coverage advertisement with signs in hand participants get ready for the people s climate march san diego howard lipin san diego union tribune q so just to be clear you don t think america needs to be in the paris climate accord a no i think that the paris climate accord is a flawed approach and i d like to see us come up with solutions that produce cleaner water first cleaner air healthier lands cleaner communities those four things are my priorities i m more concerned about syringes on the sidewalk and human feces on the sidewalk associated with rampant drug use and homelessness that s my first environmental concern i m more concerned about the sewage spills from mexico closing down our beaches 131 days that s immediate that impacts san diego today i m more concerned about rampant wildfires uh because we haven t been doing proper forest management practices these are the issues that i think we can start on because i think that s where you re going to build consensus and they have an immediate impact on our quality of the environment and quality of life q on emissions auto emissions this dispute between trump and california who s in the right there a i think that we should have a national policy um when it comes to those products that are sold across state lines q but should it be to stricter california standards or the less strict advertisement a i think we start with the notion that it needs to be a national policy i think the california standards need to be looked at from cost benefit and is this a standard that we should adopt nationally or is it something that s not worth the cost but it needs to be a national discussion california likes to have it both ways the politicians in california say hey leave us alone we get to govern our affairs but then they turn around and every time i look around i see them filing a lawsuit against trump over a federal issue it s like figure it out and no one in the media seems to be a challenging the leaders in california on that hypocrisy traffic in los angeles luis sinco los angeles times q about nato do you think nato is still a valid organization an important part of our foreign policy or is it time to make some major changes a i think the president was right to expect that our european allies uh step up to the plate and do more and i think we re seeing those changes my good friend rick grenell the ambassador to germany has been a great advisor to me on these issues and he supports the president as do i on the changes that have been proposed and are being made at nato but nato was important for two reasons one um it does serve as a um stabilizing influence against uh russia s ambitions in eastern europe uh and it also is military uh cooperative force that we can utilize in the war on terror and in a number of other uh capacities uh for global peace so we can get great benefit out of nato in terms of the um cooperation you see across countries but everyone has to do their share q what do you mean by that how do you define their share a their share is defined in the nato agreement that many of these member countries were not complying with the president pointed that out held them accountable and voila those countries are stepping forward and doing their part well i don t want to see that go away i mean that s why we need to continue to expect that the nato partners um are being held accountable advertisement q looking at the global stage what s the biggest threat facing america a oh my goodness um i still believe that uh terrorist ideology uh extremist ideology remains our biggest threat and there are a lot of threats out there whether it s the uh global designs of china both militarily and economically um or uh the nuclearization of iran although i would put that into the extremist ideologies given the regime or north korea uh but i am concerned about extremist ideologies around the globe um inspiring people to do heinous evil acts uh and as you saw with al qaeda or isis when those extremist ideologies get organized and with isis get a actual land mass uh with revenues associated with that landmass with the oil uh that they can do great damage and i applaud the president for um changing the dynamics the caliphate has been wiped off the face of the global map the ideology is still there the extremist thinking is still there the entity is still there but the president s strategy was effective and everyone pooh poohed his promise that he would come up with a strategy with the generals that would be far more effective in the global fight against isis and guess what he succeeded and he deserves the credit and i don t think the media has actually given him the credit for the progress we ve made against isis the voters in the 50th want a fighter they don t want a quitter they don t want someone who cuts and runs carl demaio q um let s say that you and darrell issa are the front runners um a you mean the top two q yeah advertisement a i doubt that will be the case q for your party okay how would you convince the voters that uh that you who d be a freshman would be more influential on capitol hill and then issa who s been there for years a that s his problem he s been there for years 18 years um i m not interested in learning the swampy rules of the deep state um i m not interested in uh the cocktail parties i m also not a quitter darell issa has shown himself in 18 years to be all bluster and very little result uh he did a lot of hearings did anyone actually go to jail was anyone actually held accountable for their behavior no it got him on fox news and then in 2018 when his party needed him when the president needed him to run for reelection and defend his seat he chickened out he choked he choked he quit he let down the president he let down his party and because he didn t put up a fight for his seat and he undercut the republican nominee diane harkey um we lost not only that seat but democrats were able to shift resources from darrell issa s seat to other seats in orange county to flip those seats as well so when we needed him to fight he chickened out and he quit and the voters in the 50th want a fighter they don t want a quitter they don t want someone who cuts and runs might i add that he put himself in the position of losing his seat by neglecting his constituents over the 18 years that he served q as we re talking about record what do you see as your biggest accomplishment on the council a i think changing the dynamic um what people might say well is it because you defeated the sales tax increase that all of the swamp in san diego supported remember the business lobbyists supported it the union supported it the democrats supported it we were outspent eight to one and we defeated the sales tax increase which meant that they had to in 2010 instead of balancing their budget on the backs of working families in the middle of the greatest recession we had seen in generations they had to actually balance the budget by tightening the belt at city hall and so it forced fiscal reform into our budget and a lot of the ideas that i had proposed that people were saying would never happen suddenly became the law and actually generated the savings um and then that led to our pension reform uh movement and the initiative uh which is still the law and still a success and will continue to be the law and a success q how do you say that advertisement a because it was properly done and we can get into all the legalities q prop b is going to be a thing of the past a no q with the procedural swipe of a pen a no you make a lot of assumptions um i m i m hoping that you actually before you write the story actually cover the story in terms of q i think i ve covered the pension fiasco for 15 years in this town my friend advertisement a right but take a look at what the unions did they re not arguing with the legality of the pension reforms that we made they re not even arguing that the citizens had a right to do what they did what they said was well jerry sanders because he supported it gave it the kiss of death really so let s let s play this logic forward so if i q did the court play this logic forward i don t see where you re going with this a no no no no and that s why i don t think you ve looked at the story close enough because what the unions have alleged is that jerry sanders a strong mayor shouldn t have done what he did he gave it the kiss of death so does that mean that the next time i file a pension reform measure in san diego that all the strong mayor has to do a democrat like bob filner all he has to do is say i support it okay guys it s okay i gave it the kiss of death i vetoed it i just said i supported it see now all you have to do is sue no no no no this is a very swampy this is a very cozy corrupt system uh trying to override the will of the voter 66 of san diegans voted to implement common sense pension reform the politicians didn t want to put it on the ballot so we had to collect signatures what i find will be the case is that the california supreme court will say wait a minute hold on we didn t say that pension reform is invalid in fact the justices if you go back and read the transcript said we re not saying pension reform was invalid we re not saying it wasn t a citizens initiative what we re saying is what jerry sanders did in his capacity as strong mayor was wrong i disagree with that but let s suppose that they re right fine jerry sanders or fine more appropriately the city of san diego because he was mayor at the time what does that fine look like what does that remedy look like i believe that the lower court overreached in suggesting that somehow the city employees should be made whole for something that jerry sanders did because if you make the city employees quote whole it means that you re violating the pension reform because the voters said we re not giving you anything more than what we re willing to give you which is guess what a 401 k benchmarked to the social security and 401 k private system that the rest of us have paying the bills pension reform has to be done in san diego or we go bankrupt as a city carl demaio so that s why we are now on the final phase of this process which is quo warranto the unions thought no one would put up a fight to defend the citizens initiative that they got the city to cave that all they had to do was go into a judge and say quo warranto make it go away well they weren t counting on a coalition forming and raising the money to hire lawyers to show up and defend the right of the voters and the taxpayers and that s exactly what we re doing um and so i m actually pretty confident that the court will say wait a minute we said what jerry sanders did was wrong we asked the lower court to come up with a remedy you ve come up with a remedy that invalidates a citizens initiative and we said clearly in our ruling we re not challenging the citizens initiative what we re saying is that mayors shouldn t be wading into citizens initiative when they re started final point the case file that was developed was developed by the unions and government bureaucrats in sacramento and that case file is not actually what happened they actually rewrote history to get the judgment that they got at the supreme court under quo warranto the case file is invalidated and we start fresh the unions are going to develop their case file the citizens attorneys will develop their case file ours will actually be true and based on evidence and we will face off in the court system and i believe we will prevail if not be ready for the son of prop b pension reform has to be done in san diego or we go bankrupt as a city it s also necessary because government employees should receive no better no worse a pension benefit or retirement benefit than the hardworking taxpayers who foot the bill q it seems like son of prop b is a much more likely outcome than the court situation you re talking about let me ask you another city hall uh advertisement a well that will create new constitutional law that basically says the citizens don t have the initiative right that we can take away the citizen anytime a politician says i agree with that it doesn t say that in the constitution and so for the justices to come to that conclusion would mean that they are literally ripping out the citizens right to place items on the ballot to hold their government accountable i don t think that s going to pass any sort of muster q uh another city hall story that has resurfaced and that we asked ben hueso about when he visited us for an editorial board meeting was um that he walked in on you in a bathroom and said you were masturbating and you said that was so false that i have to speak out you said it really tarnishes my reputation that it s a vicious rumor ben hueso hasn t walked that back years later you guys are both running for public office where honesty and integrity matter is he lying a uh i think the record shows clearly that he s lying and it also shows that what happened to me is what donald trump finally gave a name to it s fake news the great smear when you can t beat someone on the ideas then you have to make up vicious terrible lies and you hope that the voters are duped uh and so um you know that s the way that the swamp works and what it shows is that i know that s how the swamp works i ve had to suffer the humiliation of a lie i ve had to deal with the consequences of a lie and yet i m not going away and that sends a real powerful message to the swamp that i don t care what you do to me i m not backing down from the issues that matter to the voters that sent me to washington i will fight no matter what the consequences and no matter how heinous my opponents will get q do you expect this race to get heinous a oh i you know politics is you know rough and tumble sometimes but what i hope is that the voters can demand better of their candidates better of the media frankly i think that the media dropped the ball big time um uh in that matter um and again i think the media wanted it to be true about a republican and that is actually a demerit that s actually a smudge on san diego local media for their lack of due process and diligence uh on smears like that fake news and you undermine your own credibility so my hope is that we can finally get the sort of political system that people say they want which is let s talk about the issues let s talk about ideas and let s finally get journalism back in this country where journalists say hey we don t report something unless it s factual it s balanced it s corroborated but instead what do you guys do you go with anonymous sources you go with one source you go with this he said she said and so i think partly you know what the issue of fake news is not just about the politicians practicing in lies and smears it s an indictment of the failure or the death of media or death of journalism in this country advertisement q well i guess i would say that a i do think that you ve been subject to basically anti gay smears in more than one campaign that i ve seen in san diego it s really reprehensible and i m not sure that we have handled it properly as media a oh and let me point out who makes those who s practiced in that democrats and that s not something that the media wants to admit that the people who the people are playing that card are democrats who say that they re for dignity and tolerance and diversity no no no no they are the ones that practice the politics of personal destruction and they were given a pass q however i m not sure it s a strong argument to confabulate that together with the trumpian term which is just a fake news q yeah a oh i think it fits perfectly nope nope i find it fake news absolutely find it fake news advertisement q okay i would say those stories were to me part of a purposeful smear campaigns to damage you in the reprehensible way i agree with that you see that a and only one individual the good part about it and what i um appreciate and i don t think the president s going to get this sadly is that the fbi actually investigated and brought one of my accusers to justice didn t bring ben hueso to justice because he s you know these politicians are clever about how they throw their grenades of lies and smears as they try to you know walk right up to that line but not over it so i was grateful that the fbi stuck with the case and brought some accountability and justice some vindication seven months after the election no less but still i was appreciative i don t think our president is going to get that sort of vindication on some of the heinous accusations and smears and mistreatment that he has had to endure that people around him have had to endure and that s why i look at this fisa investigation and i want to see people go to jail i want to see people held accountable i want to see careers ended because of the abuse of power and but yet the media doesn t want to cover it because they re off to something else there will not be sadly accountability in what happened on the whole russia collusion scam q we might find out if there is going to be accountability a i hope i hope i hope i m wrong q the end of my thought was going to be i m surprised truthfully that you would extend that outrage to these issues around trump which are nothing like the story that you re talking about a no no no no no no no no no hold on back up the cart back up the cart what are they when you say that donald trump colluded with russians you re accusing the president advertisement q i didn t say that donald trump colluded with russians a no no but isn t that isn t that one of the accusations that s what led to the fisa warrant is that somehow donald trump was a mole from russia that he was colluding with the russians to do things wait so what you re saying is that our president who i believe through and through is a patriot i believe that the president is america first he puts america first and a lot of people don t like him for it that somehow he s actually not america first he s america last and he s a toadie of some foreign government excuse me but that is fake news and that does damage to his reputation he does not deserve that and there should be some sort of accountability for the process that he was subjected to you show me what other incoming president has had his presidential transition team offices bugged spied on by the department of justice of the outgoing administration it s extraordinary that more people are not up in arms about it and i do believe that this does beg the question do we have to revisit some of the provisions of the fisa process for all americans i am sympathetic to people who say well wait a minute patriot act may be providing far too much discretion to the courts to spy on american citizens that process was actually abused and yet i don t see a whole lot of people from both sides because this is kind of a bipartisan issue democrats and republicans both saying well maybe we re going a little too far i would like to see at least one byproduct of this mess be a reexamination of that process for better internal controls i believe that the president is america first he puts america first and a lot of people don t like him for it carl demaio q so i m surprised that i have to ask you this but if trump is impeached and convicted would you accept that finding a it would presume that that he did something criminal q it s a hypothetical question if he s impeached and convicted advertisement a it would presume q what will you say we need to change the process we need to a no i think i think that s an invalid question from this standpoint if he s convicted what it meant is that two thirds of senators looked at evidence and said oh goodness he broke the law and it s a high crime and misdemeanor i don t see that at all in the allegations against him so i m not willing to even go there it s like saying if jesus came down tomorrow and said trump is guilty would you accept that well i mean excuse me okay it takes a lot of leaps to get to where we are what i m looking at are what are the accusations against the president and what is the evidence that i ve seen thus far what the president did and i m not seeing i m not seeing an impeachable offense at all q and that s akin to the hueso slander the trump impeachment hearing a no i think there are elements i think there are elements that are similar in terms of the steele dossier as well and i think you know what i m referring to the goal is for the other side to try to humiliate their opponents and to distract from issues because they know they can t win on the issues god forbid we have an actual campaign in this town on issues or any town in this country because what we might actually find is that there s a lot more agreement that the american people have across party lines on some of the issues that they want to see addressed q any other uh questions give us your 30 second pitch on why voters should choose you over the other republicans and your democratic challenger advertisement a if you are frustrated with the direction of politics where politicians say one thing and do another and that they actually don t put up a real fight or they don t have a plan to fight in a smart way to get reform done if you re frustrated then join my movement this is not just about saving one congressional seat it s about igniting a movement across california to bring balance back to our politics california is going in the direction of socialism some would argue we re already there i argue we re already there and what we need to do is bring our state back from those extreme and failed policies uh to get better cost of living better quality of life uh and a government that respects our personal freedoms that s the fight that i m waging that s the fight that i believe the voters of the 50th district have been craving and expecting from their next member of congress q thanks for coming in a thank you
new york is facing a 6 billion budget deficit this coming fiscal year the state s worst financial position since gov andrew cuomo took office in 2011 with a 10 billion gap to fill yet the shortfall was practically an afterthought in cuomo s 2020 state of the state speech on wednesday the governor used the word deficit once and that was more than halfway into a speech outlining a big environmental agenda another set of flashy infrastructure projects and proposed tax cuts for farmers small business owners and middle class taxpayers where will the money come from to pay for it all some of it will be borrowed some will come out of the revenues of public authorities and existing pots of school aid the rest remains a mystery until cuomo releases his proposed budget later this month our fear is that the governor may look to local taxpayers to make up the difference in the program largely blamed for the deficit medicaid don t do it governor have your new medicaid redesign team look for savings at the source rather than putting the costs on property taxpayers medicaid is the health insurance program for poor elderly and disabled new yorkers federal state and county taxpayers share the cost medicaid costs are rising faster than the state can afford due to a combination of more generous benefits relative to other states higher income thresholds for recipients higher wages for health care workers and an aging population at the end of the last fiscal year the cuomo administration employed an accounting gimmick to kick a 1 7 billion medicaid bill into the current fiscal year it is poised to do it again the budget deception hides the true cost of medicaid and allows the governor and legislature to keep on spending that just postpones the reckoning meanwhile an emergency 1 percent cut in medicaid payments to health care providers with projected savings of 62 million this fiscal year and 248 million in the next will barely make a dent in the shortfall in his speech the governor suggested that the state could no longer afford to shield local taxpayers from increases in medicaid costs it is too easy to write the check when you don t sign it cuomo said failing to mention that the state sets most of the medicaid rules since 2015 the state has capped the local share of medicaid and absorbed increases above the cap that cost the state 4 billion this year without the cap and a previous 3 percent cap enacted in 2006 onondaga county s medicaid bill in 2020 would be double from the current 100 million to over 200 million imagine how much higher your property tax bill would be under that scenario new york already relies too much on local taxpayers to pay for medicaid more than any other state it should be looking to reduce that burden not increase it new york would be in a better position to handle the medicaid crisis if it had budgeted more wisely over the past few years unlike in 2011 new york s economy is healthy and wall street is booming the state should have been socking away money for a rainy day but the governor and the legislature are addicted to spending for example spending on state operations grew nearly 25 percent from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2019 while inflation was below 15 percent according to the citizens budget commission school aid has grown at twice the rate of inflation over the past 10 years while enrollment has declined by 5 percent some of that spending was necessary to fix roads and bridges upgrade airports spruce up parks and college campuses and invest in neglected upstate cities other expenditures profligate economic development awards clumsily designed tax breaks and poorly targeted school aid increases for example are demonstrably wasteful or excessive as the budget process begins the legislature should reject cuomo s gimmicks and take a firmer hand on where and how the money is spent lawmakers need to be more than a rubber stamp for the governor about syracuse com editorials editorials represent the collective opinion of the advance media new york editorial board our opinions are independent of news coverage read our mission statement members of the editorial board are tim kennedy trish lamonte jason murray and marie morelli to respond to this editorial post a comment below or submit a letter or commentary to letters syracuse com read our submission guidelines if you have questions about the opinions editorials section contact marie morelli editorial opinion leader at mmorelli syracuse com thanks for visiting syracuse com quality local journalism has never been more important and your subscription matters not a subscriber yet please consider supporting our work
the global cio office has released a report focusing on the year ahead for the firm as well as highlighting the trends that are shaping the next decade gary dugan ceo the global cio office said geopolitical issues will remain a significant driver of market sentiment and returns in years to come millennials are taking over from baby boomers as the key cohort in the workforce and electorate hence we expect the development of more left of centre governments and a much greater emphasis on esg issues the report highlights the challenges of the waning dominance of the united states in the global economy and the uncertainty it will bring to financial markets although the global cio office have their doubts about the strength of global growth with the us economy growing at no more than 2 per annum over the long term as reported to be the case in a press release on january 8th 2020 they believe that central banks will provide ongoing substantial support johan jooste managing director the global cio office said we believe that the great experiment of what s termed the new monetary theory whereby central banks fund will anchor interest rates at very low levels and fund significant government spending the global cio team see ample opportunity to generate income streams of acceptable quality in global credit markets despite spreads being at their recent lows they see scope for even lower spreads due to the weight of liquidity a non recessionary outcome for 2020 should be broadly supportive of the emerging market debt in particular commented jooste regardless of the cio team s reservations about valuations and the outlook for growth they believe that equity markets could still post reasonable returns in 2020 in particular they think that uk equities can close the gap in performance that has opened in recent years we believe the growing certainty about brexit and a trade deal and the benefit to the economy from a fiscal boost will propel uk equities to some strong outperformance comments dugan a feasible strategy for investing for income could be dividend focused strategies outside of reits as many markets have equities paying out higher yield than government bonds by combining these with a selection of investment grade and high yield bonds could sensibly picked should continue to deliver the income streams that global investors have seen in 2018 and 2019 said jooste writing before the iranian crisis of recent days the team were very constructive on gold we urge investors to take out the insurance policy against untoward issues in the near term and long term a world of declining real rates currency devaluations trade disputes tensions in the middle east and debt levels showing no bounds is a world made for gold and silver the global cio office is constructive on singapore assets the team believe that a receding of the us trade dispute with china could propel excellent performance from singapore equities the high dividend yield and the heavy weighting of reits in the index could be attractive to income seeking investors the global cio team highlight selective opportunities in the commercial real estate market they are positive on european commercial real estate they see opportunities to invest in buildings with yields sometimes as high as 7 they remain cautious on residential real estate around the world given the unaffordability of many markets for those with middle incomes
by lee seglem years ago an enterprising operative in new york s tammany hall political machine coined a term for exploiting government for personal gain while appearing not to do so he called it cynically honest graft and it goes like this why risk criminal prosecution for overtly dishonest acts like bribery and extortion when you can get the same results sweetheart public contracts profitable zoning changes favored treatment in legislation by deploying strategic campaign cash or manipulating systemic weaknesses and loopholes why indeed i ve been thinking about this because having retired recently as executive director of new jersey s independent state commission of investigation sci and after an earlier career as a reporter and trenton statehouse correspondent people routinely ask me whether new jersey is the most corrupt state in the nation my answer is pretty much always the same from my experience i don t think it is at least not in the criminal context notwithstanding the pile up of public corruption convictions here over the years no i think it just feels dirtier in new jersey than elsewhere because the garden state s grafters learned well from their new york cousins they re very good at skating right up to the edge of criminality without crossing the line during 25 years with the sci i worked on more than 50 investigations into noncriminal waste fraud and abuse of tax dollars often with the added backdrop of organized crime in almost every instance people were found to have gamed the system in ways they tried to defend sometimes laughably so as perfectly okay because what they did was technically legal things like causing local taxpayers to be hosed by quietly inserting costly proprietary specifications into contracts for school roofing projects or ripping off new home buyers with shoddy construction and inspection practices or using jail inmates to recruit customers for bail bond business or steering lucrative retainers to relatives or donors in the legal accounting and insurance professions or positioning a known mob figure to reap millions in the used car industry by pressuring state bureaucrats to soften motor vehicle oversight requirements the trouble is that this kind of soft corruption while affording plausible deniability upfront often serves as an overlay for its hardcore relative underneath in the matter of the mobbed up car entrepreneur for example the seemingly legitimate south jersey warehouse from which he operated became a font of criminal activity by his clientele who engaged in everything from theft and consumer fraud to money laundering it s worth noting that we had to conduct a follow up inquiry into this mess before the appropriate elements of government stopped doing this guy s bidding and started to close regulatory loopholes that enabled such conduct stuff like this makes you wonder whether the system isn t designed like that in the first place in which case the loopholes aren t loopholes at all but accommodations one other thing i ve learned over the years is that the truly artful practitioners of honest graft those who work hardest to maintain outwardly upstanding public personae despite the reality of their secretive scheming is that they are the ones who howl the loudest with indignation and moral outrage when found out during my career it happened like clockwork every time we issued an sci report how dare you say this about me it s not like i broke the law was the sense of the standard response true but you did do something unethical shady and stupid and at some cost to your fellow citizens and by the way if you did do nothing wrong why didn t you do it in broad daylight so all could see which brings me to real enabler of this kind of activity the general lack of effective transparency across all sectors of government new jersey s weak open public records act the entire state legislature for example is virtually exempt from substantive matters of disclosure is no match for what is going on these days with undisclosed millions flowing into political super pacs and extensive interlocking special interests operating behind the scenes this isn t some wild conspiracy theory look no further than the controversy over the economic development authority s doling out of rich tax credits to select insiders that scandal was percolating in the backrooms long before a dribble of facts started to frame an ugly picture of outright manipulation and self dealing all of it apparently within the bounds of the law question what is going on in other areas that have similarly operated for years in the shadows of weak scrutiny and little disclosure like municipal insurance health care financing and real estate deals involving politicians and other public officials the one glimmer of brightness here is that key elements of the tax credit debacle were revealed in a refreshing burst of investigative journalism by dogged outlets like pro publica but regrettably that reporting stood out so sharply in part because it is so rare anymore much of the news media is diminished these days beaten down by economic and other forces beyond their control not to mention by the disgraceful rhetoric of a bully boy president himself a world class grafter and grifter who piles on with cheap trash talk about fake news and enemy of the people having worked as a reporter and as a government investigator i know for a fact that both endeavors embody honor integrity and value i also know that without them our democracy is lost to

for relevant additional information i recommend reading my 2020 oil price outlook available here along with my article analyzing exxonmobilâ s guyana assets guyana is a small country on south americaâ s north atlantic coast the country is defined by its dense rainforest or for avid discovery channel viewers the season of goldrush where the hoffmanâ s decided to try their hand mining there however the purpose of this article is to talk about this countryâ s future as it becomes one of the wealthiest countries in the world from the discovery of not gold but black gold as we ll see this country has a strong business environment and huge potential wealth that despite the risks make it a strong place to invest guyana wild junket guyana overview guyana is small and sparsely populated the country is just 83 000 square miles or a bit over half the size of california the country is notable as the only country in south america where the official language is english however the country s populace is incredibly small it has just over 750 000 people making it one of the least populated countries in the world guyana overview exxonmobil investor presentation on a geopolitical stage the country is overshadowed by its much more significant neighbors of venezuela and brazil the countryâ s business climate isnâ t anything to write home about it ranks at 93 180 on the country corruption perceptions index and 134 among 190 countries on the ease of doing business in the country rankings however landing in the middle of the pack isnâ t anything bad for reference other countries with similar rankings on the country corruption perceptions index are china rank 87 india kuwait and turkey rank 78 and the philippines and thailand rank 99 notable countries nearby on the ease of doing business rankings are belize rank 135 maldives rank 147 and brazil rank 124 again nothing to write home about but nothing so difficult as to prevent economic growth now looking at the political situation the country fares slightly better on the democracy index it ranks 54 out of 190 countries next to neighbors such as poland at 54 croatia at 60 mexico at 71 and india at 41 however the countryâ s small size means that an influx of wealth can always change things and upturn society which is worth paying attention to lastly looking at the countryâ s wealth its gdp per capita is roughly 6900 and has gone up significantly since it was at 1100 in 2005 life expectancy at just under 67 years is respectable and also trending upwards rapidly the countryâ s small population hasnâ t changed significantly since the 1980s meaning that it has no upcoming demographic issues i e a rapidly aging elderly population itâ s worth noting that this environment overview doesnâ t provide any guarantees but is a useful way to provide some perspective on where things could be headed guyana potential growth now that we have identified the guyana demographics political situation and business environment letâ s talk about the massive potential growth exxonmobil guyana growth exxonmobil investor presentation the above image provides exxonmobilâ s alone planned production startups in guyana for reference if you think about the classic wealthy oil countries saudi arabia kuwait qatar and the uae saudi arabia currently produces 0 33 barrels of oil per person day kuwait produces roughly 0 80 barrels of oil per person day qatar produces 0 70 barrels of oil per person day and the uae produces roughly 0 20 barrels of oil per person day in 2020 exxonmobil alone will produce 0 16 barrels of oil per person day and by 2025 that will rise to more than 1 barrel of oil per person day the imf as a result of exxonmobil alone is forecasting 86 gdp growth for the country in 2020 alone the number of additional prospects for exxonmobil in the country is also staggering itâ s also important to note that exxonmobilâ s discovery came on the back of many dry wells in the region however itâ s success is bringing new attention to the country that could potentially result in the discovery of other major plays that havenâ t even been realized yet guyana future developments exxonmobil investor presentation the above map shows exxonmobilâ s drilled and undrilled prospects itâ s important to note that despite drilling large amounts of new prospects roughly as many in 2018 alone as in 2015 2017 combined the company still has significantly more undrilled prospects than drilled ones as the company learns to understand the geology and oil fields this could push production in the country to 1 2 million barrels day exxonmobil is also the best known but not the only operator in guyana tullow oil originally made some respectable discoveries however said it was slowing down to re evaluate whether it was an economic discovery in light of the heavy crude and high sulfur content of the discovered oil however just a few days ago the company found 4 meters of net oil pay but much higher quality oil four meters of net oil pay isnâ t a ton exxonmobil and tullow oilâ s heavy wells had roughly 10 20 times this but it points to the potential for some balance between the heavy and light crude with more net oil pay as exploration continues i would expect this number to rise significantly and some production to come from this block that could be very rewarding to guyana with a small population it doesnâ t take much for example 150 000 barrels day of peak production in tullow oilâ s region would be a mid size operation but would be on a per capita basis as much oil for guyana as the uae produces in its entirety anadarko petroleum now occidental petroleum also has licenses for guyana offshore blocks that will likely be solid off read about occidental petroleum here the company hasnâ t been clear yet about the results of exploration or its plan for this region guyana risks however in the interest of discussing both sides of the opportunity investing in guyana is not a risk free opportunity in fact there are 3 major risks that i view as possible and recommend that investors pay attention too the first is that due to previous lack of success in exploration in guyana exxonmobil was given extremely good exploration terms the exxonmobil discovery was so unexpected that the countryâ s department of energy has a budget of just 2 million and hasnâ t finished drafting laws to deal with exploration and production it has set up a 5 billion sovereign wealth fund to handle the money but still doesnâ t have a good framework the countryâ s president lost a vote of no confidence upon peopleâ s anger over the terms of the deal given to guyana there are corruption investigations going on over the deal terms given to exxonmobil which was signed at a time when the country was desperate to get producers anyone at all to drill however iâ m still expecting a multi billion dollar settlement another potential issue in guyana is wealth inequality which historically is more likely to lead to protests or other forms of complaints the countryâ s gini coefficient a measure of inequality is respectable 0 45 for guyana vs 0 49 for the us and 0 27 for norway however the country does have some social issues with citizens of portuguese colonizer descent tend to be much wealthier again this doesnâ t mean anything but itâ s a risk factor worth paying attention too the last risk factor i want to discuss is one of guyanaâ s neighbors venezuela venezuela claims much of the waters in offshore guyana especially major parts of the exploration block in fact exxonmobilâ s discoveries to date in guyana have been away from the venezuela coast due to potential decisions in the past venezuelaâ s navy has seized ships to enforce these claims venezuela is essentially a failed state as such it is unpredictable while the us and other nations will back guyana where the discoveries fall within its exclusive economic zone especially in terms of attacks against a us company itâ s a risk worth paying attention too guyana investment recommendation putting all of this together letâ s discuss how to invest in guyana there are two primary ways to invest in guyana the first is to invest in companies in guyana that will benefit from overall growth the second is to invest in the oil companies that will provide this growth the guyana stock market is incredibly small as visible by looking at the above chart of every company in the stock market along with their trading information as of yesterday several of these companies havenâ t had shares traded in years investors with large sums of capital can benefit by looking up how to invest in these companies which due to their position in a small country especially the banking construction companies will likely do quite well guyana goldfields and atni are two guyana companies you can trade in the u s atni controls indirectly most of the countryâ s cellular and telecom networks unfortunately etfs with exposure are difficult to find due to the countryâ s small size alternatively you can invest in countries that will benefit exxonmobil nyse xom and hess corporation nyse hes are major owners of the straoboek block that will begin producing soon for reference hess corporation produces 265 thousand barrels per day currently so its share of guyana production by the mid 2020s could be almost as big as the rest of the company combined exxonmobil will see its share of the production by the mid 2020s be 10 of the company s production current breakeven costs are estimated to be 35 barrel with liza oil selling for 5 7 barrel more than brent 70 barrel as of today that means for hess corporation a 21 billion company guyana alone will provide almost 3 billion in profits year by the mid 2020s for exxonmobil a 300 billion company guyana will be 4 5 billion profits year that assumes no new discoveries as we saw above there s plenty of un drilled prospects this cash flow will go straight to shareholders generating strong rewards another option tullow oil otcmkts otcpk tuwoy is a high risk high reward option that has a stake in other oil producing assets either of these companies would see their stock price and shareholder returns go up as they begin to produce oil conclusion guyana is on the cusp of major growth thanks to exxonmobil and other companies the country is on the verge of becoming the largest oil producing country in the world on a per capita basis which should generate a massive amount of wealth the country is already preparing for this by building a sovereign wealth fund and attempting to rewrite laws to handle the influx of money of course the country has risks namely around potential inequality and the original contract terms along with threats poised by its neighbor venezuela however it will experience significant growth i recommend for wealthy investors looking at investing in the stock market directly alternatively i recommend looking at investing in the oil companies that will benefit editor s note this article covers one or more microcap stocks please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks

the wealthy often complain when sane and reasonable minds point out the dangers and reality of the obscenely class stratified nature of u s society these complaints often find expression in such phrases as the following there go those radical leftists playing the class struggle card again these radical leftists just want to punish success in america to get more stories like this subscribe to our newsletter the daily why do these radical leftists want to foster divisions among us by talking about class struggle the wealthy are great examples of what can happen for people in america if they work hard and of course as i suggest through my examples anyone who wants to even broach issues of the gross income inequality and class stratification characterizing u s society is of course automatically branded a radical leftist as though such a label is sufficient to disarm serious intellectual engagement with our class realities a look at recent reporting by cnbc s maggie fitzgerald regarding an annual outlook report from j p morgan s private bank to its wealthy clients for whom it manages 2 2 trillion reveals the reality of competing class interests of class struggle in america and the complete lack of concern for the economic prospects of average working americans and even an antagonism to the average working american s well being if it any way impacts their ability to accumulate even more excessive wealth moreover this report reveals the bank s support for a trump agenda that protects the money of the wealthy even if it not creating a healthy economy that improves the economic status of all fitzgerald indeed summarizes a major thrust of the report as forecasting that a presidential victory from a radical leftist candidate as among the biggest threats to their money in 2020 notice that the radical leftist candidate was not characterized as a threat to the economy or economic health of the american working class majority but rather as a threat to the money of the wealthy these are two very distinct animals according to fitzgerald michael cembalest chairman of market and investment strategy for j p morgan asset management declared a progressive overhaul of the u s economy after the election as among the most significant threats to their wealth elements of this overhaul mentioned in the report according to fitzgerald included a ban on stock buybacks increased corporate tax rates collective bargaining and a break up of big tech as distinct possibilities in short the report defines as perils to the wealthy such conditions as workers having more democratic rights in the workplace and more bargaining leverage in negotiating wages and benefits or corporations such as amazon actually paying some taxes to support the infrastructure that makes its success possible basically the kinds of economic policies that would foster a healthy economy that functioned to improve the lots of all are precisely what j p morgan s private sees as threats as unwelcome developments when it comes to protecting the 2 2 trillion it manages for its wealthy clients the report makes clear that the bank s objectives in serving its wealth clients is to work and wish against the policies and developments that would actually improve the lives of the majority of americans it seems class struggle is alive and well in our clearly class stratified america j p morgan certainly thinks so identifying the class interests of its wealthy clients as at odds with the economic interests of wage earners indeed while the report suggests that wage inflation could pose a risk as well to the wealth of the bank s clients it finally dismissed inflation as a major concern because of the decline in labor bargaining power the increased speed of retail price readjustments the impact of globalization on wages no worries dear wealthy workers are losing bargaining power and global competition is driving down wages so we don t have to be concerned about any improvement in their economic well being or about them having any more power or voice to exercise in the spirit of democracy what can the majority of americans learn from this report how precisely to read by which i mean how to read their political and economic interests when confronted by the texts our political and economic leaders issue every day most illuminating in this regard perhaps is douglass account in the narrative of the life of frederick douglass of his learning to read or perhaps more precisely his learning of the importance of reading when his master forbids his wife to teach him precisely because it would forever unfit him to be a slave to play his role as worker in the class system of slavery douglass recounts the moment when his master scolds his wife for teaching him to read and his concomitant new and special revelation of his political interests as he comes to understand the denial of literacy as part of the white man s power to enslave the black man he becomes confident that what the master is saying is true and that the result of the slave s achievement of literacy will in fact be in some measure the undoing of the system of slavery itself douglass represents reading not just as an act of assimilating the meaning of words but as an act of discerning of grasping one s political and economic interests douglass doesn t learn to read the same way his master does but rather reads the master s statements negatively to decipher the reality of his situation and his political and economic interests such that we see that ways of reading are politicized and differentially conditioned by one s position in the larger social power structure douglass writes what he most dreaded that i most desired what he most loved i most hated that which to him was a great evil to be carefully shunned was a great good to be diligently sought reading j p morgan s report we can decipher what that bank most dreads the american majority should most desire could it be that a progressive overhaul of the economy by a radical leftist candidate might deliver economic policy that serves the american majority even if it doesn t protect the rich s money

origins of totalitarianism see facebook item below view larger images of the vast demonstrations including a stampede that killed dozens of people in iran to protest the u s assassination of general and terrorist in chief qasim soleimani give a somewhat exaggerated picture of outrage yes indeed the odious general had long since been presented as a hero by the theocratic dictatorship for his attacks on american interests in the middle east and parts of shia islam have a propensity for declaring such people as martyrs to be avenged but not all of shia islam takes such a fierce stance consider the ismailis numbering tens of millions of shia they re remarkable for their worldliness tolerance high levels of education and professional accomplishments and extraordinary philanthropy disclosure i worked in a nonprofit education project in east africa run by an ismaili group many in iran detest the regime indeed it has killed thousands of anti government protesters in the past few years and as for the millions in the streets let s remember that iran is a police state more than a few in those throngs in tehran and other iranian cities were ordered by the regime through their workplaces schools and other institutions to go on the streets to mourn soleimani and demand revenge giant photo ops for international consumption as for revenge as of this writing iran has lobbed ballistic missiles at u s bases in iraq i doubt that will be the end of it i think it was just a show not a real attack to the world that iran is capable of conventional warfare attacks it seems that some of the missiles were actually guided to land in the sand to avoid killing americans i doubt that the desire for revenge of iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei has been slaked among other things iran could make the straits of hormuz a little too exciting for supertanker captains to want to transit driving up the global price of oil and israel is always in the crosshairs but the islamic republic is more likely to seriously attack america through asymmetrical methods consider that iran which has plenty of very competent scientists and engineers has major cyber warfare resources and other weaponry that it can use to make life unpleasant for americans at home and abroad and yet allow for plausible deniability so don t be entirely surprised if your lights go out at a time of the iranian regime s choosing perhaps in a few months they can bide their time the russians and the north koreans may help them with some of the technical issues but wait trump s weirdly spoken we know he doesn t drink but address on the iranian attacks held out some realism for one thing he implied that maybe we could negotiate a revised easier to monitor and enforce version of the obama era joint comprehensive plan of action to curb iranian nuclear plans that trump had america quit further and i wondered who told him trump pointed to the mideast s common enemy of isis al qaeda and other sunni extremist groups he said accurately isis is a natural enemy of iran the destruction of isis is good for iran and we should work together on this and other shared priorities refreshing to hear this still trump has just imposed yet more economic sanctions on iran a proud and ancient country and he s so erratic it s hard to know what his thinking is but we do know he ll do virtually anything to get re elected be it cutting payroll taxes as the federal budget deficit explodes or even maybe gasp détente with iran which would a better long term u s ally than saudi arabia whatever the trump organization s business interests as for the iranians downing with a russian missile of a ukrainian jet killing the 176 people on it this is the sort of accidental disaster that happens in the fog of near war view larger as the rhode island general assembly settles in for its new session it faces a difficult challenge to try to ensure that the ocean state s tax and regulatory systems and education quality become as much like massachusetts s as possible over the next few years increasingly the ocean state to be competitive must follow the lead of its much bigger and richer neighbor while pitching its unique quality of life strengths and lower costs car tax appeal i know that many perhaps most rhode islanders hate car taxes i myself have a certain liking for use taxes they seem the fairest way to pay for government services but the state might be better off economically and environmentally if it stopped cutting the car tax and used the revenues to fund more and better public transportation to reduce the need to drive everywhere even famously car dependent places in the sunbelt such as south florida have been building commuter rail lines even in a time of cheap gasoline or maybe because of it because cheap gasoline spawns more driving and more congestion view larger officials in rhode island massachusetts and elsewhere are calling for a big push to expand that rather nebulous thing called affordable housing probably the most dramatic set of proposals in new england comes from boston mayor marty walsh who presides over a city in the middle of a metro area whose tech health care and financial services companies have brought great wealth but have also driven up further what have long been among america s highest living costs mr walsh has vowed to commit 500 million over five years to address the city s affordable housing crisis that would necessitate among other things the sale of a parking garage and implementing a real estate transfer tax the mayor is also pressing major companies and foundations to consider pooling some money perhaps as much as 100 million to help finance affordable housing in boston if this actually happens boston would apparently become the first east coast city to do something like what s happening on the west coast where tech companies are funding some big housing programs to address some of the cost challenges they created still isn t having rich companies with highly paid workers better than having poor ones as always each success presents new problems over the long run the affordable housing issue will be most effectively addressed through changes in zoning laws especially in the suburbs that have long discouraged mixed used neighborhoods commercial residential and multi family housing snob zoning which sets high per residence minimum acreage has in particular removed a lot of land from possible new housing construction but those who live on snob zoning lots have much more political clout than people searching for a place to live that they can afford and zoning is mostly a local power anyway certain changes could dramatically increase the supply of less expensive housing reducing the price pressure that would include a slowing population growth making housing more of a buyers market view larger after many cheers when giant general electric company decided to move its headquarters to boston from fairfield conn the noise turned to boos as its stock price tanked but last year the stock of the venerable company surged 53 percent from 2018 its biggest jump since the 1980s and much

many of the trees are eucalyptus which are highly flammable almost explosive because of their aromatic oil will global warming and its associated droughts higher temperatures and brush and forest

lies and clicks on facebook the world s largest media company will continue of course it s impossible to stop all lies or maybe even many of them but why can t facebook at least try to avoid publishing lies speaking of lies consider that arizona republican congressman and conspiracy pusher paul gosar tweeted an image of former president obama shaking hands with iranian president hassan rouhani in fact obama and rouhani have never met the image was photo shopped from a picture taken of obama s 2011 meeting with then indian president manmohan singh god help our political system when this is so easy to do view larger the original idea of the founding fathers in having the senate act as a jury in the trial of a president impeached by the house was based on the belief that the upper body whose members have six year terms would be much less politicized than the house whose members are elected every two years that most senators would be capable of thoughtful disinterested consideration of the charges against the president but that has always been an excessive hope and never more than now when the profoundly corrupt but very smart and disciplined senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has announced that he ll work hand in glove with the white house to acquit trump in order words the senate won t act as the jury envisioned in the constitution i wonder if the constitution could be amended so that a corrupt president could be tried by say a panel of federal appeals judges or the supreme court itself yes most of these judges are identified in varying degrees with democratic or republican positions and or certain ideological leanings but their life tenancy should encourage them to exercise more independent judgment than politicians have as things stand now having the senate sit as jurors of an impeached president borders on farce dodging those suvs although traffic deaths in general have fallen over the past few years pedestrian fatalities have been rising in the united states the governors highway safety reports that the number of pedestrians killed by drivers rose 35 percent in 2008 2017 from 4 414 deaths in 2008 to 5 977 deaths in 2017 in 2018 6 227 pedestrians died after being hit on our roads the most since 1990 you d think that unlike car on car fatalities that almost all pedestrian deaths would be avoidable and the report s authors conclude some of this can be attributed to the rise of popularity of suvs those heavy gas guzzling behemoths their weight makes them more likely than smaller cars to kill people they hit and too many drivers of suvs speed on narrow streets perhaps feeling that the height and size of these vehicles makes them invulnerable and king queen of the roads higher gasoline prices and hence fewer suv

if the islamic republic of iran has had one consistent goal since 1979 it s been survival since the islamic revolution iran has essentially existed in crisis management mode whether it s been fighting saddam hussein in the iran iraq war or weathering the latest u s sanctions today there are two interlinked issues that iran views as essential to its long term survival its economic health and its regional strategy in iraq and the levant protecting both of these priorities has put tehran in a bind however iran could ameliorate its dire economic situation by caving in to u s demands and disengaging from the wider middle east but this would entail reducing support for its regional proxies and bashar al assad s government in syria thereby crippling iran s strategy to project power across the region the very thing that so irked u s president donald trump in the first place still bind or not iran s limited response to the u s assassination of senior military figure qassem soleimani suggests that it is determined to maintain course on a strategy in which consistent pressure on washington throughout the middle east eventually frees its economy from the fetters placed on it by the united states all about the economy for iran the economic status quo is unsustainable sanctions have caused iran s oil exports to collapse and cut off its access to international financial markets and a great deal of trade including humanitarian goods like food and medicine those economic issues came to a head in november 2019 when another round of major protests erupted in response to tehran s decision to eliminate fuel subsidies and introduce fuel rationing nevertheless many of iran s economic problems run deeper than just u s sanctions indeed ending washington s punitive measures was just the first plank of hassan rouhani s economic platform when he ran for the presidency in 2013 at the time rouhani also had hoped to enact significant banking reforms pass new legislation to bring iran s regulatory framework for combating money laundering and terrorism financing in line with international standards to attract foreign investment all while weakening the economic dominance of iran s islamic revolutionary guard corps and military backed conglomerates for tehran the economic reforms are critical because it is dealing with widespread youth unemployment and underemployment while lower and middle classes are also chafing at the reduction in job opportunities increasing poverty and falling purchasing power essentially the islamic republic s leaders have failed to come up with a sustainable economic model over the past four decades but they are well aware that they must do so if their theocratic government is to survive the collapse of oil prices in 2014 initially scuppered rouhani s plans although worse was to come two years later when trump was elected president vowing to confront and contain iran with iranian leaders unable to address the teetering economy the country s largest protests in a decade erupted late in 2017 for this reason iran has not completely shut the door on talks with the united states indeed tehran s response to washington s decision to walk away from the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa limiting iran s nuclear program has been incremental even though the united states and europe have lamented iran s decisions in announcing each of their five moves to reduce jcpoa commitments iranian officials have been adamant that tehran can reverse every step if the united states were to suspend sanctions iran has also conducted closed door talks with the united states seeking partial sanctions relief in exchange for renewed talks and a suspension of escalations to its nuclear program ultimately iran knows that it must one day negotiate with the united states although it would prefer to do so with a different u s president as iran continues to try to normalize its relationship with the world it will find its ability to behave in abnormal ways limited right now iran is dependent on china for continued oil exports while it also does not wish to alienate european powers lest they trigger the jcpoa dispute process leading to the reinstatement of u n security council sanctions which would then grant the united states a veto on their removal an overarching regional strategy but even if iran wants to normalize its international relationships the path forward is unclear tehran relies on proxies to carry out its asymmetric defense strategy as it lacks the conventional military strength that the united states and its allies possess for the moment iran appears to have concluded its initial response to soleimani s death yet it will resort once more to using its regional allies to harry the united states in so doing iran can maintain plausible deniability for any attacks that hurt u s interests as part of its bid to undermine the u s relationship with countries like iraq what s more tehran would still harbor two major concerns even if it reached a deal with washington to reduce sanctions first the level of distrust between iran and the united states not to mention israel will remain high soleimani s killing will certainly add to that in truth it will likely take decades for the countries to ever build a significant level of trust in tehran s eyes trump s quick reversal of predecessor barack obama s stance on iran was a revelation iran cannot operate under the assumption that even a prospective rapprochement with the united states would continue for more more than a few years second even if iran does reach a deal with the united states it would still have to worry about its own security with regard to regional rivals like turkey and saudi arabia in the end iran s challenge today is how to persuade the united states to stop linking economic sanctions with tehran s defense strategy something iran succeeded in doing during obama s term when it obtained considerable sanctions relief in return for offering to limit its nuclear program iran almost certainly does not want to provoke a war with the united states now or in the near future but iran s line has been pretty clear the united states unjustly abandoned the nuclear deal meaning that if it wants to open up a new round of negotiations it must first provide significant economic sanctions relief if not tehran and its allies have made it obvious that they will inflict a great cost on the united states its allies and their joint interests in the middle east evidently iran has decided not to respond to soleimani s death in a way that jeopardizes its attempts to reestablish its connections to the international community or closes the door to negotiations on sanctions relief that means iran won t look to provoke the united states by making a move that endangers its own survival such as attempting to assassinate a high profile american figure instead iran is more likely to try to keep the conflict contained to its current theaters like iraq but given that iranian backed iraqi militias have promised their own response to the soleimani operation which also killed deputy kataib hezbollah leader abu mahdi al muhandis and iranian backed iraqi politicians are dead set about driving u s forces from the country that s likely to translate into more violence and escalation in iraq and potentially elsewhere nearby iran is still playing the long game is republished with the permission of stratfor worldview a geopolitical intelligence and advisory firm image reuters

the government s catch up spending and the possible signing of the phase one trade deal between the united states and china could help boost exports and imports an analyst from the rizal commercial banking corporation rcbc said for the coming months both imports and exports could start to pick up after the phase one us china trade deal to be signed on jan 15 2020 as a step in the right direction to somewhat ease the lingering us china trade war since july 2018 and eventually lead to some pick up in global economic growth and global trade including some pick up in the growth of philippine exports and imports as well said rcbc chief economist michael ricafort

when zimbabwe started the just ended decade the government of national unity gnu between the ruling zanu pf party and the movement for democratic change was less than a year old thus the past decade started buoyantly and gave the nation hope for a brighter and better future with unity and peace being central to nation building as the democratic spaces were opening up so too the opportunities however anything the good and the bad can happen in a decade providing lessons for the future new things are born while others die which is natural in evolution for example cyclone idai which struck mozambique zimbabwe and malawi last year was an indicator of challenges we have to look out for in the 2020 2030 decade and beyond on the economic front the just ended decade saw zimbabwe adopting a basket of multi currencies with the united states dollar being dominant since attempts have been made to revert to the local currency what lessons have been learnt had we sold our sovereignty and nationhood on the altar of expediency considering that the ghosts from this policy continue to haunt the economy while the end of the past decade saw the start of the second republic it will also be remembered as the decade when zimbabwe lost a number of its gallant sons and daughters that fought for the country s independence and served the nation in various capacities while at the same time they protected the founding principles outlined in the constitution those that departed are too many to mention but some of the notable figures include the founding president robert mugabe vice president john landa nkomo general solomon mujuru and dr dumiso dabengwa the intelligence supremo in the zipra guerrilla wing of zapu while efforts to ensure that key pillars for economic recovery and development agriculture mining and human resources maintained an upward trajectory the results from the past decade are not at all what everyone had hoped for now we have not only started a new year but a hyped decade what does 2020 2030 hold for zimbabwe when we analyse results on the ground vis à vis assurances that president mnangagwa and his lieutenants give about zimbabwe attaining a middle income status by 2030 do we think that it s achievable harare the capital city s vision is to achieve a world class city status by 2025 is this also realistic zimbabwe is also not an island it starts the new decade on the same pedestal as other world nations the united nations un has declared 2020 2030 as the decade of ecosystem restoration and the decade of ocean science for sustainable development ghana also launched a birthright campaign under the theme 2020 2030 a decade of african restoration while the world health organisation says it is a decade of healthy aging which addresses sustainable development goal no 3 on health and well being according to chile s health minister population aging is an unprecedented phenomenon that forces all of our countries to unite the decade of healthy aging 2020 2030 will be a global effort that can make a difference in people s lives and their environments for some 2020 to 2030 will be the decade of agri tech maintaining that agriculture the mainstay of africa s informal economies needs a facelift and some new faces to talk tech to power agri tech is the buzzword meanwhile some religious establishments have declared it a decade of dominion or the new decade of divine establishment according to one website 2020 is such a huge and important year in fact this is a pivotal year which means that the prosperity and well being of the years to come are directly hinged to the advancement and establishment of this year against this backdrop what will be the biggest stories hopes challenges and personalities for this decade not just for zimbabwe when united states president donald trump ordered the assassination of iranian military commander qassem soleimani in a region ravaged by war how will the decade end the decade will also see an upsurge in information communication and technological connectivity as the fourth industrial revolution takes effect parag khanna s 2016 publication connectography mapping the future of global civilisation gives a broad overview of what the decade will be like in that area other issues that will make it an interesting decade include climate change water crisis food security terrorism unemployment rise of white nationalism cyberspace operations all of which pose major national and international security risks how will they be resolved pope francis sentiments in his new year message portray the positive and negative aspirations for 2020 and ensuing decade our human family is scarred and wounded by a succession of increasingly destructive wars that especially affect the poor and those most vulnerable sadly the new year does not seem to be marked by encouraging signs as much as by heightened tensions and acts of violence he said notwithstanding time will tell
washington new york the idea of imposing a wealth tax on the richest americans has elicited sharply divergent views across a spectrum of politicians with president donald trump branding it socialist and progressive democratic presidential contenders senators elizabeth warren and bernie sanders prominently endorsing it but it may have broad public support according to a reuters ipsos poll that found nearly two thirds of respondents agree that the very rich should pay more among the 4 441 respondents to the poll 64 percent strongly or somewhat agreed that the very rich should contribute an extra share of their total wealth each year to support public programs the essence of a wealth tax results were similar across gender race and household income while support among democrats was stronger at 77 percent a majority of republicans 53 percent also agreed with the idea a wealth tax is levied on an individual s net worth such as stocks bonds and real estate as well as cash holdings similar in concept to property taxes it is separate from an income tax which applies to wages interest and dividends among other sources asked in the poll if the very rich should be allowed to keep the money they have even if that means increasing inequality 54 percent of respondents disagreed rich people have a right to blow their money on lamborghinis and world wide cruises or whatever said esin zimmerman 53 a lifelong republican from madison minnesota who wants higher taxes for the wealthy but that money could be used in other ways that help people zimmerman said she would especially be in favor of a wealth tax that would help pay for government programs for us military veterans or help single parents with young children it could put the border wall up she said the results may reflect how the economic changes of the past roughly 20 years from globalization to the financial crisis have shaped attitudes about economic policy according to polling by gallup concerns about the rich paying too little actually declined through the 1990s and early 2000s a relative boom period for the united states but the concerns have been climbing since the crisis years of 2007 to 2009 from 55 percent to more than 60 percent as of 2016 here the reuters ipsos results suggested even stronger support for an annual levy on total wealth not just income warren and sanders have touted the idea as a way to help pay for major social programs like medicare for all and to reverse a stark rise in the share of wealth owned by the very richest americans known as the 1 percent the poll also points to changing attitudes toward basic ideas such as keeping what you earn that notion central to a winner take all brand of capitalism got mixed reviews while 56 percent of republicans agreed the very rich should keep what they have regardless of the impact on inequality 35 percent of republicans disagreed with the statement as did 71 percent of democrats republican survey respondents interviewed by reuters said they did not see their support for a wealth tax conflicting with their party ideals or their support for trump kathy herron 56 a republican who lives in santa rosa california said her support for trump a self proclaimed billionaire stems from his hardline policies on illegal immigration in her view the president would do well to support higher taxes on rich americans we re taxed from one end to the other and it just seems the rich don t pay their share she said in recent years in particular mainstream economic institutions like the international monetary fund and the federal reserve have taken seriously the possibility that high levels of wealth and income inequality may be not just politically corrosive but bad for economic growth at the most recent fed policy meeting staff members presented research on how families differing access to credit might make a recession worse the sort of exercise that shows how unequal starting points among households can influence national outcomes economic and market trends have likely reinforced doubts about who gets ahead and how fast since the start in 2009 of a now decade long recovery the top 1 percent s share of national net worth has grown from 27 8 percent to 32 2 percent driven by a record setting boom in the stock market according to fed data trump has cited the rise in equity markets as a selling point in his campaign which is centered on taking credit for historically low unemployment and a tariff heavy trade policy that he says will restore manufacturing jobs but that has not changed the country s wealth picture while the share of wealth held by the bottom 50 percent of americans has increased since the crisis to 1 5 percent percent longterm the trend is down with their share at less than half what it was in 1989 the shares of wealth held by the middle and upper middle classes or all other americans save for the richest 1 percent have all fallen since the crisis

falling short of the 165 000 economists were expecting it s also less than the 266 000 jobs added in november although the data still kept the unemployment rate near a 50 year low at 3 5 analysts aren t ready to proclaim stocks are cheap particularly as benchmarks which all posted gains for the week are still near all time highs but we ve seen time and time again that valuation arguments can fall

by clicking sign up you accept our terms of service and privacy policy you can opt out at any time ray dalio sounded frustrated he didn t want to debate policies he didn t want to discuss presidential candidates he wanted to focus on the priority no one was talking about i had called dalio the billionaire founder of bridgewater associates the world s largest hedge fund to get an update on his call to reform capitalism in america from last year and his desire that the country s leadership declare inequality in the country a national emergency in the nine months since the idea of rethinking capitalism had broken into the business mainstream with advocates like the business roundtable under jpmorgan chase s jamie dimon and ceos like salesforce s marc benioff saying that we needed to move away from shareholder primacy this story is available exclusively to business insider subscribers become an insider and start reading now have an account log in i went in wanting to see what he thought of these developments as well as issues that democratic frontrunners like senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren have been championing when i asked what he thought about increasing wage inequality over the last four decades dalio jumped in you keep focusing on measures of inequality as though those themselves he said trailing off to me the question is merely how from an engineering point of view how to increase the size of the pie and divide it well to be clear he s written extensively about measures of inequality and he s gone on the record about tax and healthcare reform he emphasized that he wasn t going to make policy proposals on subjects he wasn t an expert in but that if it increases the size of the pie and divides it well i m all for it that message became his refrain for our phone call and follow up emails the economy s wealth and opportunities can be divided better but it must above all else be grown to further benefit americans over the long term advertisement and it reflected his point that over the past year virtually everyone has been missing the most important metric productivity the measure of how efficiently a country is using labor and capital to create value when workers are equipped with job relevant skills companies are innovating and industries are growing more products and services are created with more efficiency and standards of living rise and yet the united states productivity has been on the decline since 2004 and has been low since the great recession from 1990 2008 productivity rose annually an average of 2 32 compared to 0 9 from 2010 2018 when dalio talks about reforming capitalism he s talking about any policies and regulations optimized to reversing this trend what it means to fix the system since the financial crisis dalio has been studying other debt crises the rise and fall of great powers populism and polarization he told me that he s giving the us five years before economic and social upheaval akin to what it saw during the lead up to wwii in the 1930s hits it he thinks it s an inevitability if the us either stays the course or takes a sharp turn left that s not to say he s opposing any liberal reform last year in a 60 minutes interview he said that of course rich americans should be paying more taxes but in our call he clarified that he is wary of any talk from the left that equates significant tax hikes with a solution by default to inequality advertisement let me be clear about something redistributing the wealth ain t going to do it because wealth doesn t last he said referring to the depreciation of assets he s taking a basic free market macroeconomic approach here if we took the current economy we have he s arguing and redistributed the wealth to reduce inequality we would have different sized slices of the pie but it would still be a lousy dessert that said if we continue on the current path of relatively low taxes on the wealthy and corporations that hasn t been helping either he wants policies that will allocate resources to improving our workforce and stimulating innovation for the purpose of raising the quality of life for the least wealthy americans which could be done through new policies as well if raising taxes on the rich is done to fund such a policy that s great dalio sees everything in life from nations economies to person to person interactions as composed of systems these systems produce patterns that usually repeat regardless of context if you can recognize these patterns you can then respond in the way that historically has yielded the best result this is the approach that dalio made famous at bridgewater from its investing algorithms to its work culture of radical transparency assisted by proprietary ipad apps so when a decade of economic and historical research is telling him that low productivity drastic inequality and polarity fueled by populism will lead to an upheaval of society that will hurt both our economy and social fabric he s discouraged when others aren t on the same page or that to some critics he as an investor with a net worth that forbes puts at 18 7 billion shouldn t be offering prescriptions to america s ailments advertisement we ve begun to demonize each other he said and because of good and evil billionaires are evil it s not like we could sit down together and figure out what s best he desperately wants americans to turn to moderate leadership and keep productivity as their north star it s all about productivity in his linkedin essay about reforming capitalism that accompanied his 60 minutes appearance dalio included charts showing the ways that wages have remained stagnant for the bottom 60 of americans since 1980 while the wages for the top 40 of earners have increased how the percentage of young people making more than their parents has sharply decreased over that time and that the income shares of the 1 and 90 are at 1930 levels all of that means that even when unemployment is low and the stock market is doing well as they are now the winners have been those who have been doing well for the past decade related stories due to a variety of factors like automation and moving jobs overseas productivity has lagged and its tied to the symptoms described above advertisement a 2017 mckinsey report noted that starting in 2004 labor productivity fell from growing at an average pace of 2 1 annually to 1 2 over the next decade there was a brief spike during recovery from the recession but the rate since 2011 has been only 0 6 productivity growth has been much lower since the great recession than it was in the 1990s andy kiersz business insider dalio thinks there are multiple ways to reverse this including a coordination of monetary and fiscal policy as well as increased taxes but redistribution will not be effective unless productivity is also invested in keep in mind that we eat our productivity meaning that what we consume is what we produce he said and what we have i e our wealth won t last long so we have to constantly be mindful about making our productivity greater which is not what i m seeing the country must invest in education dalio considers education the most important example of how to raise productivity advertisement as dalio became more interested in how america s economic health fit into the wide expanse of history following the financial crisis he became increasingly fascinated with empires life cycles and became a big fan of historian paul kennedy s 1987 book the rise and fall of the great powers he undertook a research project into the subject considering eight measures education technology output share of world trade military strength of the financial sector and reserve currency status education is the best leading indicator of an empire rising and its deterioration is the best leading indicator of a society declining he said american students currently test in the bottom 15 of the developed world it s why dalio and his wife invested 100 million last year in connecticut s public schools an amount matched by the state he s an advocate of public private partnerships for education because the private sector can impart what skills it needs to innovate an example of what this could look like is ibm s p tech school model in which public high school students can take skills based classes in addition to the state curriculum get access to exclusive internship and mentorship opportunities with a particular corporate partner and go to a partner community college at no cost to work toward an associate s degree advertisement as dalio sees it if america is going to reform its economy it needs to rethink public education as a way of building a workforce equipped for a rapidly changing world it s a dangerous situation dalio said that his research of the past decade led him to conclude that there is a clear cycle that can emerge from periods of extreme inequality step one resentment step two demonization of the other side step three causes become more important than the systems for solving disputes step four a revolution totally disrupts the system he said that he d put the us right now at step two with signs of step three revolutions occur because modifications of the system are typically not enough to satisfy and so what happens is you go through this cycle all the time people demonize the other and they make good and evil he said advertisement dalio instead wishes for a moderate president who would declare america s inequality a national emergency and create a bipartisan board to develop a plan for increasing the nation s productivity given the reality of america s polarization and how sanders a top presidential candidate is outright calling for a revolution of the system similar to what president franklin delano roosevelt engineered dalio recognizes that it s a longshot he put the odds of the country headed toward a bipartisan measured course that would address his concerns at just 30 in an election year that s kicking off a new decade america is at a turning point in its history and staying the course is going to lead to upheaval these things happen over and over again this is not new he said there s a faction of americans who want that upheaval dalio wants to avoid that more than anything more from the 2010s toward a better capitalism the mainstreaming of occupy wall street how rethinking american capitalism became the most important debate of the 2010s this 33 year old economist hasn t just helped shape one of elizabeth warren s and bernie sanders boldest policies he s been changing how you think about wealth whether you know it or not advertisement big countries are refusing to tackle climate change so companies are stepping in take an exclusive look at a tool the un hopes will revolutionize the way these businesses track sustainability goals what investors need to know about opportunity zones the controversial

by avital chizhik goldschmidt january 12 2020 the numbers were not adding up for a new jersey orthodox couple in their early 30s with five children she is a lawyer he works in tech two well paying jobs they still qualified for income based assistance from their local yeshiva so tuition for the three school age kids totaled 40 000 but they knew that if either of them got even a minor salary bump they d be in a difference bracket and lose the assistance instantly tripling their annual household expenses we d have to make major life changes we d have to move into a tiny apartment the wife said in a recent interview we already don t go on vacations we really don t live an extravagant lifestyle we have good jobs and we still are struggling to make ends meet forwarding the news thoughtful balanced reporting from the forward and around the web bringing you updated news and analysis of the crisis each day terms required i agree to the forward s terms of service and privacy policy email required she spoke on the condition she not be named because the family has decided to make aliyah this summer and their employers do not yet know of the plan if we re going to struggle to make ends meet we d rather do it there than here she said and the math is much different because in israel the children would enroll in the religious track of the public school system goodbye tuition it is an increasingly common calculus among the millennial orthodox with day school costs rising along with housing prices in neighborhoods within walking distance of many synagogues plus a general social pressure to keep up with the cohens more and more families seem to be considering aliyah in part for financial reasons we call them tuition refugees said chana shields rosenfelder who lives in beit shemesh israel and is a consultant for students with special needs for whose families aliyah can be especially attractive some of the financial pressures are not unique to the religious lifestyle expensive healthcare and higher education burgeoning student debt and bleak retirement prospects are all factors several families cited in interviews but for large orthodox families yeshiva tuition kosher groceries and the pressure to enter highly lucrative careers are just too much modern orthodoxy in america costs too much said a 44 year old mother in new york city who said she and her family have been considering a move to israel for several years and spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of professional consequences wherever you want to live with the better schools costs money there are very few out of town communities with decent schools plus extras bar and bat mitzvahs camps so people are like why not just struggle there according to prizmah a network of jewish day schools across north america 55 to 66 of families get tuition assistance now the pressure is on the middle income families explained dan perla who studies day school finances at prizmah twenty years ago middle income never needed scholarship but now they do because tuition has been rising far quicker than wages some consider public school a recent survey by nishma a sociological research group that studies jewish communities found that 31 of parents with school age children might consider public school as an option with these trends in mind orthodox groups like the orthodox union and the national community development program of lakewood s beth medrash govoha are trying to help families move out of urban areas creating orthodox friendly neighborhoods in places like austin texas and south bend indiana but some families are looking further away seeing a move to the holy land as a way to save money and express their zionism not that a move to israel doesn t have financial downsides the cost of living is notoriously high and the median monthly salary there is equivalent to 3 112 55 versus a median monthly salary in the united states of 3 676 still several professionals interviewed said that aliyah made financial sense for them given the costs of orthodox american life and the stagnancy of u s wages david avraham a 34 year old lawyer moved to jerusalem with his wife and three children in 2017 they have since had another baby the idea of paying for four kids over 100 000 for day school tuition when you can come here and pay about 2 000 shekel roughly 600 a year per kid as an administrative and activities fee we couldn t reconcile that and still can t he said avraham reflected on the stresses that many parents who receive scholarship feel when sending their children to yeshiva day school in the states while acknowledging that many schools have done an admirable job at implementing heightened privacy and confidentiality standards he said that there s still a perception that someone may always be looking over your shoulder there is real discomfort in making certain financial decisions like taking a family vacation as those decisions may feel scrutinized through the prism of the family s scholarship he added overall it s just not a sustainable model several olim interviewed for this article repeatedly said that they had been scraping by in the u s and now in israel felt more financial flexibility as dual citizens they remain simultaneously eligible for american child tax credits and taxpayer funded israeli health care it s much easier to set ourselves up here than it was to do it in the states said benjamin nadler a tech content writer and father of two whose family moved to modiin from boca raton fla in 2017 i think most people have something of a mixture of ideology and opportunity tova and mordechai horowitz also moved from boca raton in 2013 rather than pay 30 000 in tuition for both of their twins they moved to maale adumim a west bank settlement that is just outside of jerusalem and have both found work in hi tech it wasn t about the ideological but the practical she said it doesn t make sense for everyone but a lot of our calculations made it the right choice shimon simpson a 37 year old accountant was perfectly happy living in philadelphia and for years demurred at his wife s desire to make aliyah until their son was diagnosed with autism he got sticker shock when looking at special education programs within the day school world we were getting quotes for high school anywhere between 35 000 50 000 they moved in 2016 to ramat beit shemesh about halfway between jerusalem and tel aviv their autistic son enrolled in a public special education haredi school in neve yaakov and they ve since had a fourth child now their son attends a public haredi high school in ramot costing them 250 nis roughly 72 annually i definitely took a paycut coming from the u s to israel he said but economically overall things balance out as long as you re willing to work within the system obviously nothing is free it s coming out of your paycheck every month there s a 17 sales tax on everything so you rearrange priorities marc rosenberg of nefesh b nefesh a group that assists people in making aliyah said it s not just the actual numbers but the sense of an american rat race that pushes a lot of orthodox families to make the move day school tuition is the symptom not the problem he said one young man recently told me i don t want to work as hard as my parents did to live this lifestyle these are not bringing mashiach conversations these are often just we want to have more children conversations he added many believe israel is simply more family friendly and can offer a better work life balance maternal paid leave of 14 weeks is guaranteed by israel s national insurance institute it is relatively common for parents to leave the office at 3 or 4 p m to take care of children several young olim said that they decided to have more children after they moved since they no longer had to consider additional day school tuition which orthodox jews in american often joke is a form of birth control you might not have made aliyah to have more children but it happens like that rosenfelder the beit shemesh education consultant said we can afford to have a third or fourth or fifth child because we re not paying so many tuitions other olim are drawn to the prospects of pursuing unorthodox creative careers professions that could never pay the bills for a modern orthodox family in the united states a community that constrains the career choices of its young people incurs a cost that cannot be measured only in dollars and cents rabbi elli fischer wrote on american modern orthodoxy in the pages of the jewish week in 2015 after making aliyah in 2006 the pressure to produce high earners discourages and marginalizes those members of the community whose calling is in music literature and the visual or performing arts the new jersey lawyer who is planning to make aliyah this summer said she was doing it to make life better for her children it s not like it was for our parents who did better than our grandparents did i m not sure it ll be better for my kids if i stayed here financially she explained that reality is catching up with the community quickly because we have this big ticket item of tuition on our list she paused then added living in america isn t the american dream that it used to be avital chizhik goldschmidt is the life editor at the forward find

the trump assassination of major general qasem soleimani reflects regime change efforts withdrawal from iran nuclear deal new sanctions covert operations undermined de escalation plunging oil production and diminished economic prospects that have taken a perilous turn on january 3 2020 the plane of qasem soleimani major general of the islamic revolutionary guard corps irgc and commander of its elite quds force arrived at baghdad international airport at the same time the us mq 9 reaper a prime assassination drone was loitering in the area with other military aircraft at the airport soleimani left with abu mahdi al muhandis the deputy head of the iran backed iraqi popular mobilization forces as they entered two vehicles the convoy headed toward downtown baghdad at 1 am local time the reaper launched several missiles on baghdad airport road the two cars exploded in flames killing some 10 people including soleimani and al muhandis after the devastation whatever was left of soleimani could be identified only by his ring ironically several perished iranian and pro iranian commanders had been instrumental in the defeat of islamic state secretary of state mike pompeo said washington had made an intelligence based assessment that soleimani was actively planning in the region to attack us interests in turn president donald trump declared soleimani was behind imminent attacks on us diplomatic facilities and personnel across the middle east that s the official story undermining de escalation afterwards trump s team got caught offering mixed messages about iran s imminent attacks as a justification for soleimani assassination national security adviser robert o brien says trump authorized eliminating soleimani who cooperated with his allies to kill american diplomats and soldiers in significant numbers defense secretary mark t esper claims there was exquisite intelligence indicating soleimani was conducting preparing military operations akin to terrorist activities against the us in turn pompeo seized iran s past behavior as justification none of these reasons which stress attributed intentions rather than hard evidence seem credible in the light of iran s efforts at multilateral diplomacy its challenging economic conditions and the behind the façade attempt at de escalation with saudi arabia however the mixed messages do reflect a longstanding us effort to justify permanent war in the middle east and certain other hot spots the house resolution to limit trump s war powers against iran is a move in the right direction but it can neither reverse the past policy mistakes nor halt the current escalation in the subsequent tv address trump delivered his orwellian soundbite we took action last night to stop a war we did not take action to start a war and yet several us planes were taking off from bases in the eastern united states toward the middle east as pentagon sent 3 500 members of the 82nd airborne division one of the largest deployments in decades amid mega rallies for soleimani and iraqi parliament calling for the expulsion of us troops from the country iran s supreme leader ali khamenei spoke about the impending retaliation trump warned tehran that any retaliation would result in us targeting 52 iranian significant sites including cultural sites the allusion was to the number of american hostages during the iran hostage crisis some 40 years ago then came the bomb shell two days after the assassination iraq s prime minister adil abdul mahdi addressed his country s parliament suggesting that soleimani was on a peace mission according to abdul mahdi he had planned to meet soleimani on the morning the general was killed to discuss a diplomatic rapprochement that iraq was brokering between iran and saudi arabia abdul mahdi said trump personally thanked him for the efforts creating the impression that soleimani could safely travel to baghdad even as the white house was busy planning a hit subsequently pompeo rushed to defend the assassination again we know that wasn t true he said we got it right once again he presented no hard evidence in reality the us assassination appears to have been the latest effort to preempt de escalation plans in the region to reinforce iran s destabilization it follows years of misguided covert operations here s how it happened from trump s u turn to new iran sanctions only a few years ago there was still great hope in iran after years of diplomacy the comprehensive nuclear accord jcpoa july 2015 was achieved between tehran and the so called p5 1 nations that is the five permanent members of the un security council china france russia uk and the us plus germany together with the european union eu under the deal iran agreed to eliminate its stockpile of medium enriched uranium while the international atomic energy agency iaea gained access to all iranian nuclear facilities to iran the deal offered relief from us un and multilateral sanctions on energy financial shipping automotive and other sectors these primary sanctions were lifted after the international atomic energy agency s iaea certification in january 2016 that iran had complied with the agreement yet secondary sanctions on firms remained in place along with sanctions applying to us companies including banks after the 2016 us election the congress with its democratic majority not president elect trump paved the way for a u turn following the house of representatives the senate in late 2016 unanimously extended the iran sanctions act isa for a decade stunningly the deal that president obama had portrayed as his legacy in the region was shot down surprisingly fast intriguingly most democrats reversed their positions regarding the nuclear deal as trump arrived in the white house he began developing a far more muscular policy against iran to benefit from saudi economic and geopolitical support in may 2017 trump and saudi arabia s then king salman bin abdulaziz al saud signed a historical arms deal which totaled 110 billion immediately and 350 billion over a decade widely perceived as a counterbalance against the iranian influence in the region it cemented the ties between saudi arabia and the us however crown prince mohammed bin salman s reform efforts have been tarnished by harsh measures against members of his family and opposition the khashoggi murder and dismemberment and the devastating war and famine in yemen in return for the saudi deal the white house began a concerted push to counter iran s regional and strategic weapons programs which had been excluded from the iran deal in may 2018 trump signed national security presidential memorandum 11 ceasing u s participation in the and taking additional action to counter iran s influence and deny iran all paths to a nuclear weapon that s when the us effectively nullified a decade long unified multilateral approach to iran s activities while setting in motion unilateral economic sanctions which have affected not just u s businesses but targeted commerce from other major economies particularly china france russia uk germany and the eu even after iran s missile attacks against two bases of american troops which seem to have purposefully shunned human targets trump promised further ratcheting up of economic sanctions against iran the use of sanctions is predicated on a purposeful effort to overthrow the iranian government from bolton s shah scenario to regime change the trump administration has greenlighted clandestine efforts to weaken iran s moderates hoping to incite hawks into strategic moves that could be used as a pretext for regime change in april 2018 trump hired the neoconservative uber hawk john bolton as us national security advisor he was booted less than a year and half later a relic of the bush era bolton had engaged in the weapons of mass destruction pretense that led to the iraq war now he advocated regime change in iran and other countries by november 2017 bolton urged the us to have a contingency plan for a shah of iran scenario and regime change before february 2019 the 50th anniversary of the iranian revolution his change agent was mojahedin e khalq mek an iranian opposition group which advocates a violent coup in iran in the early 2010s the uk eu and the us considered mek a terrorist organization until then state secretary hillary clinton de listed the group to exploit it in us led destabilization to support his economic sanctions with clandestine operations trump named michael d andrea as the head of cia s iran operations nicknamed ayatollah mike he inspired the character of the wolf in the oscar awarded movie zero dark thirty 2012 although d andrea failed to track nawaf al hazmi one of the hijackers who crashed american airlines flight 77 into the pentagon on september 11 2001 he was made head of the cia s counterterrorism center few years later with president obama s blessing he also presided over hundreds of us drone strikes in pakistan and yemen his operatives oversaw several interrogations which a us senate report has described as torture and he has been blamed for the camp chapman attack in afghanistan in which seven cia operatives were killed when the then cia chief mike pompeo became secretary of the state his deputy gina haspel took charge of cia following 9 11 haspel oversaw a secret cia prison in thailand which housed suspected al qaeda operatives relying on enhanced interrogation techniques she like d andrea was deeply involved in the detention and interrogation program condemned by the 2014 senate report worse haspel played a key role in the destruction of 92 interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of detainees in black sites while the bush and obama era cia leaders supported her cia nomination more than 100 retired us generals and admirals expressed profound concern due to her record plunging oil production d andrea and pompeo favor regime change in iran and some observers see their covert operation influence in the 2019 20 iranian protests in many cities as iranians have greatly suffered from us efforts at domestic destabilization and international insulation some demonstrators are obviously motivated by economic woes but it also seems that bolton s shah scenario and its variations remain on the table as evidenced by the role of the us sponsored pahlavi loyalists among some protesters in contrast iranians see oil as the main reason to us interest in the middle east iran and iraq hold some of the world s largest deposits of proved oil and natural gas reserves combined their reserves exceed those of venezuela which has the world s largest proved reserves between 2010 and 2013 the sanctions hurt iran s economy contributing to the fall of crude oil exports from 2 5 million barrels per day to 1 1 million by mid 2013 that in turn was compounded by the plunge in oil prices since early 2014 following the nuclear deal iran s production soared back to 4 million barrels with trump s efforts at regime change the capacity steadily decreased to 3 7 million barrels per day figure 1 recent opec estimates suggest it has plunged to 2 8 million barrels figure 1 iran s petroleum production and consumption 2011 2018 source eia difference group if iran s production capacity takes a further hit that will penalize particularly its biggest importers china india south korea and turkey diminished prospects since russia and china were expected to stay behind the iran nuclear deal the real question was whether the european powers germany france the uk and the eu itself would defend it unsurprisingly the trump administration targeted european businesses that did business in and with iran after the nuclear deal in june 2019 the eu created a mechanism instex that allows european countries to trade with iran despite us sanctions but it was too little too late brussels failed to sustain the iran nuclear deal against trump s unilateral moves before 2015 iran s economy shrank by 9 two years due to sanctions after stabilization sanctions relief enabled iran s oil exports to return to nearly pre sanctions levels permitted tehran to regain access to funds held abroad boosting 7 overall economic growth in 2016 foreign energy firms made new investments in the energy sector and major aircraft manufacturers sold iran s commercial airlines new passenger aircraft the relief contributed to the victory of iran s president hassan rouhani in the 2017 presidential election growth broadened to the non oil sector real gdp growth was projected to rise toward 4 5 over the medium term as financial sector reform was anticipated to take hold but then came the trump u turn in may 2018 he had the u s withdraw from the nuclear deal while secondary sanctions drove iran s economy into mild recession as major companies exited the country rather than risk being penalized by the us the value of iran s currency declined sharply even before the us escalation iran s economy was expected to undergo a second consecutive year of recession and contract by 8 7 in 2019 20 inflation was estimated to reach 38 annually with mounting fiscal pressures economic expansion which began after the nuclear deal has been undermined neither is stagnation enough for the trump administration what the white house is fostering is progressive contraction figure 2 figure 2 iran gdp growth and supply side components 2011 22 source world bank difference group following the drastic re escalation iran s economy will have to cope with even more challenging downward risks and if oil exports were to be curtailed further the economy could enter into a steeper recession and suffer from high inflation rates in such a status quo the challenge of protecting the vulnerable households would put additional pressure on the government finances and potentially the rial unfortunately that may be precisely the white house s objective the challenges highlight the crucial role of further economic diversification by focusing on non oil sources of growth and government revenues the world bank stated in a recent update in reality economic diversification can only be built on peaceful conditions and political stability which allow governments to proceed with a medium term diversification such preconditions predate trump s iran policy that has undermined years of international multilateral diplomacy the net effect is the most dangerous escalation in the middle east in decades and possibly the last nail in the fragile global economic prospects that could

agencies to review public property that can be converted to emergency housing and to deploy 100 camp trailers from the state fleet to use as temporary shelters the proposals come on top of 1 billion allocated last year to keep people off the streets the governor also stood by his decision not to name a homelessness czar you want to know who s the homeless czar is i m the homeless czar newsom said he declined to say whether the state should guarantee a right to housing a policy being pushed by some democrats as a tool for hastening action assemblywoman autumn burke has introduced a right to housing bill for homeless families what about building more homes the newsom administration says the state has secured 4 5 billion in commitments including loans and land from tech companies google apple and facebook to support affordable housing but the budget offered few new policy changes to make it easier for developers to build except to say the administration is exploring the creation of a new agency on housing and homelessness during his gubernatorial campaign newsom set a goal for the building of 3 5 million new homes we need teachers in low income schools the governor is pitching a 100 million grant program to offer 20 000 stipends to teachers who agree to work in low income schools for at least four years the effort newsom says addresses this sobering statistic california

at least four years calling the state of special education in california a crisis the governor proposed 895 million in services for students with disabilities with an emphasis on early intervention

toward teacher recruitment and retention in low income schools that chronically have difficulty in hiring and keeping qualified educators school lunches tasty but healthy about those cafeteria frozen pizzas and burritos the state would direct 70 million toward improving nutrition in school meals a proposal lobbied by first partner jen siebel newsom siebel newsom who worked on the proposal with kat steyer took a page out of the playbook of former first lady michelle obama who put her stamp on the white house focusing on school nutrition newsom lamented those damn headlines coming from betsy

on workforce training with 83 million to fund apprenticeships and 17 million for a pilot project to help central valley residents earn degrees in fields with local shortages such as accounting teaching and nursing if we can prove it works in fresno then we go to the central coast inland california and the north coast the governor said the university of california and california state university would each get a 5 spending boost to enroll and graduate more students community colleges would receive an additional 409 million including money to improve faculty diversity reduce textbook costs build food pantries provide legal services to immigrant students and expand programs that allow students to earn a high school diploma and associate s degree at the same time newsom would also add 21 6 million to an initiative he championed last year that provides student parents with more financial aid for living expenses and set up a 5 million task force to brainstorm ways to help californians struggling with student debt for undocumented health care but not tax credits newsom is still resisting a proposal to extend the state s earned income tax credit to undocumented workers who file taxes that idea that was quietly dropped during final budget negotiations last spring but he is willing to extend health coverage to an estimated 27 000 undocumented seniors over the age of 65 at a cost of 64 2 million a year through the state s medicaid program known as medi cal the expansion pushes california toward universal coverage gov jerry brown first extended medi cal to children regardless of immigration status and the state has since expanded coverage to undocumented young adults but newsom signaled restraint saying offering medi cal to all undocumented residents would be too pricey at this point talk of a mystery state park the budget calls out 20 million for a new unidentified park speculation has focused on an 80 square mile swath of land known as n3 ranch that spans parts of alameda santa clara san joaquin and stanislaus counties newsom declined to name the exact location saying that identifying it would drive up the price to obtain the property the

climate change asking for 12 5 billion over five years to boost climate resilience curb greenhouse gas pollution and tackle the state s wildfire crisis that includes 1 billion over four years for a

on first responders governor dad is still pushing a parents agenda the parents of four young children newsom and his wife jennifer siebel newsom frequently say they re pushing a parents agenda to make life easier on california families this budget would extend a tax break on diapers and tampons until july 2023 and support a law allowing more workers to take paid family leave by guaranteeing they can come back to their jobs many workers don t take leave to care for a new baby or a sick family member because they can t afford to get by on partial salary or could lose their jobs if they do currently the program replaces 60 to 70 of a workers wages companies that have fewer than 20 employees do not have to guarantee workers they ll have a job after a leave democratic sen hannah beth jackson has been trying for years to pass a job protection law but has been thwarted by the california chamber of commerce which has lobbied against the idea as a job killer that could create more litigation against businesses bold moves to lower health care costs california could become the first state to establish its own generic drug label leveraging the state s massive market to increase competition and lower generic drug prices generic drug makers counter that drug costs are being driven up by brand name drugs newsom s budget also would continue to push to establish a single market

reduce health costs time for a tax on vaping calling it a long overdue tax on vape cartridges newsom is proposing a 2 levy on each 40 milligrams of nicotine it s the same idea behind a new bill from

petris short act which limits the authority of government officials to detain mentally ill people last year several bills intended to tame tobacco sales especially those aimed at kids were stalled or gutted with lobbying from tobacco and vaping companies such as juul how we treat mentally ill people could be changing while offering no specifics newsom vowed to re examine the 1967 lanterman petris short act which limits the authority of government officials to detain mentally ill people civil libertarians have fought any changes contending people should not be detained unless they are clearly a danger to themselves or others the act was conceived when i was conceived newsom said the world has changed the governor mused that while there might be a need to construct more facilities to care for such people treatment should be done at the community level and he s promising to get tough on health plans to provide equal treatment on mental and health needs we re ready to discuss closing a state prison newsom s budget says that if the inmate population continues to decline he will close a state operated prison within the next five years a sharp turnaround from the 1980s and 1990s when

washington new york the idea of imposing a wealth tax on the richest americans has elicited sharply divergent views across a spectrum of politicians with president donald trump branding it socialist and progressive democratic presidential contenders senators elizabeth warren and bernie sanders prominently endorsing it but it may have broad public support according to a reuters ipsos poll that found nearly two thirds of respondents agree that the very rich should pay more among the 4 441 respondents to the poll 64 percent strongly or somewhat agreed that the very rich should contribute an extra share of their total wealth each year to support public programs the essence of a wealth tax results were similar across gender race and household income while support among democrats was stronger at 77 percent a majority of republicans 53 percent also agreed with the idea a wealth tax is levied on an individual s net worth such as stocks bonds and real estate as well as cash holdings similar in concept to property taxes it is separate from an income tax which applies to wages interest and dividends among other sources asked in the poll if the very rich should be allowed to keep the money they have even if that means increasing inequality 54 percent of respondents disagreed rich people have a right to blow their money on lamborghinis and world wide cruises or whatever said esin zimmerman 53 a lifelong republican from madison minnesota who wants higher taxes for the wealthy but that money could be used in other ways that help people zimmerman said she would especially be in favor of a wealth tax that would help pay for government programs for us military veterans or help single parents with young children it could put the border wall up she said the results may reflect how the economic changes of the past roughly 20 years from globalization to the financial crisis have shaped attitudes about economic policy according to polling by gallup concerns about the rich paying too little actually declined through the 1990s and early 2000s a relative boom period for the united states but the concerns have been climbing since the crisis years of 2007 to 2009 from 55 percent to more than 60 percent as of 2016 here the reuters ipsos results suggested even stronger support for an annual levy on total wealth not just income warren and sanders have touted the idea as a way to help pay for major social programs like medicare for all and to reverse a stark rise in the share of wealth owned by the very richest americans known as the 1 percent the poll also points to changing attitudes toward basic ideas such as keeping what you earn that notion central to a winner take all brand of capitalism got mixed reviews while 56 percent of republicans agreed the very rich should keep what they have regardless of the impact on inequality 35 percent of republicans disagreed with the statement as did 71 percent of democrats republican survey respondents interviewed by reuters said they did not see their support for a wealth tax conflicting with their party ideals or their support for trump kathy herron 56 a republican who lives in santa rosa california said her support for trump a self proclaimed billionaire stems from his hardline policies on illegal immigration in her view the president would do well to support higher taxes on rich americans we re taxed from one end to the other and it just seems the rich don t pay their share she said in recent years in particular mainstream economic institutions like the international monetary fund and the federal reserve have taken seriously the possibility that high levels of wealth and income inequality may be not just politically corrosive but bad for economic growth at the most recent fed policy meeting staff members presented research on how families differing access to credit might make a recession worse the sort of exercise that shows how unequal starting points among households can influence national outcomes economic and market trends have likely reinforced doubts about who gets ahead and how fast since the start in 2009 of a now decade long recovery the top 1 percent s share of national net worth has grown from 27 8 percent to 32 2 percent driven by a record setting boom in the stock market according to fed data trump has cited the rise in equity markets as a selling point in his campaign which is centered on taking credit for historically low unemployment and a tariff heavy trade policy that he says will restore manufacturing jobs but that has not changed the country s wealth picture while the share of wealth held by the bottom 50 percent of americans has increased since the crisis to 1 5 percent percent longterm the trend is down with their share at less than half what it was in 1989 the shares of wealth held by the middle and upper middle classes or all other americans save for the richest 1 percent have all fallen since the crisis
the wall of student debt is an obstacle to opportunity for thousands of pennsylvania s young citizens in fact the commonwealth has the unfortunate distinction of having the highest average debt among the 50 states and washington dc according to a peterson s data survey as of 2017 that average was 36 193 and climbing the result is that college graduates find themselves held back from buying homes getting married starting families and taking jobs that create future opportunities but don t pay enough now to cover loan payments the stereotyped living in their parents basement is a direct result of student debt why are pennsylvania college students graduating with more debt than in other states one major factor is college costs the average annual in state college tuition in pennsylvania was 22 794 for the 2018 2019 academic year 8 387 higher than the u s average reports collegecalc org pennsylvania is the 5th most expensive and one of the least affordable states 48th of 50 to attend college those dire numbers and the effect on the future of pennsylvania s workforce are getting some attention in harrisburg two lawmakers new to the legislature this year from bucks and delaware counties have formed a student debt caucus to examine the problem according to a recent report in the morning call rep jennifer o mara d delaware county and rep meghan schroeder d bucks both of whom are in their 30s understand the problem firsthand they told the call that their approach is a deep dive that will result in a package of legislation thirty two other lawmakers have joined them in the effort alongside that effort is a task force examining state funding of higher education a higher education funding commission formed last august held a session last week at west chester university coordinated by state sen andy dinniman d chester county o mara was among the legislators who attended the commission is tasked with developing a higher education funding formula and identifying factors that may be used to determine the distribution of funding according to a release from dinniman s office the hearing examined the cost effectiveness of what colleges are providing in pennsylvania noting that oftentimes graduates have the degree and the debt to go with it but lack the workforce skills to meet employers needs we have to be a lot more data driven in looking at how we deliver higher education and how it fits into job creation dinniman said we are living in the greatest era of change in human history that means what we prepare for today could change tomorrow at the same time our systems of education and higher education must adapt to meet the needs and develops the skills of a growing variety of individuals the hearing included speakers who stressed the need for middle skills that require some college training but also rely on technical or community college specialty training particularly in the health care field much of the discussion focused on whether colleges are preparing young people for the needs of the workforce whether or not they can pay for that training is the focus of several other legislative efforts as well as legal actions to ferret out unfair loan practices some of the ideas are increased loan forgiveness incentive programs for firefighters and others who give back to their communities but there is widespread belief that the state s underfunding of higher education and the resulting tuition increases among state schools is at the root of the problem we urge the higher education funding commission to examine the costs side of the coin as well as the workforce side the next generation of pennsylvania citizens need to be prepared not only with necessary skills but also financially solvent to be consumers home buyers and contributing citizens college in pennsylvania has become out of reach for the middle class without taking on debt failure to address this problem not only crushes the opportunity for young people but also tramples economic growth we urge the legislature to make it a priority in 2020 to bring down college costs and give the next generation the opportunities they deserve and that our commonwealth needs

only a blank white space here s one example on this annotated bill of rights a california textbook explains that rulings on the second amendment have allowed for some gun regulations two states eight textbooks two american stories american history textbooks can differ across the country in ways that are shaded by partisan politics we analyzed some of the most popular social studies textbooks used in california and texas here s how political divides shape what students learn about the nation s history the textbooks cover the same sweeping story from the brutality of slavery to the struggle for civil rights the self evident truths of the founding documents to the waves of immigration that reshaped the nation the books have the same publisher they credit the same authors but they are customized for students in different states and their contents sometimes diverge in ways that reflect the nation s deepest partisan divides hundreds of differences some subtle others extensive emerged in a new york times analysis of eight commonly used american history textbooks in california and texas two of the nation s largest markets in a country that cannot come to a consensus on fundamental questions how restricted capitalism should be whether immigrants are a burden or a boon to what extent the legacy of slavery continues to shape american life textbook publishers are caught in the middle on these questions and others classroom materials are not only shaded by politics but are also helping to shape a generation of future voters conservatives have fought for schools to promote patriotism highlight the influence of christianity and celebrate the founding fathers in a september speech president trump warned against a radical left that wants to erase american history crush religious liberty indoctrinate our students with left wing ideology the left has pushed for students to encounter history more from the ground up than from the top down with a focus on the experiences of marginalized groups such as enslaved people women and native americans the books the times analyzed were published in 2016 or later and have been widely adopted for eighth and 11th graders though publishers declined to share sales figures each text has editions for texas and california among other states customized to satisfy policymakers with different priorities at the end of the day it s a political process said jesús f de la teja an emeritus professor of history at texas state university who has worked for the state of texas and for publishers in reviewing standards and textbooks the differences between state editions can be traced back to several sources state social studies standards state laws and feedback from panels of appointees that huddle in sacramento and austin hotel conference rooms to review drafts requests from textbook review panels submitted in painstaking detail to publishers show the sometimes granular ways that ideology can influence the writing of history a california panel asked the publisher mcgraw hill to avoid the use of the word massacre when describing 19th century native american attacks on white people a texas panel asked pearson to point out the number of clergy who signed the declaration of independence and to state that the nation s founders were inspired by the protestant great awakening all the members of the california panel were educators selected by the state board of education whose members were appointed by former gov jerry brown a democrat the texas panel appointed by the republican dominated state board of education was made up of educators parents business representatives and a christian pastor and politician mcgraw hill the publisher whose annotated bill of rights appears differently in the two states said it had created the additional wording on the second amendment and gun control for the california textbook a national version of the pages is similar to the texas edition which does not call attention to gun rights the company said in a written statement pearson the publisher whose texas textbook raises questions about the quality of harlem renaissance literature said such language adds more depth and nuance critical language about nonwhite cultural movements also appears in a texas book from mcgraw hill it is partly a result of debates in 2010 between conservative and liberal members of the texas board of education over whether state standards should mention cultural movements like hip hop and country music their compromise was to ask teachers and textbook publishers to address both the positive and negative impacts of artistic movements texas struck that requirement in 2018 but its most recent textbooks published in 2016 will reflect it for years to come publishers are eager to please state policymakers of both parties during a challenging time for the business schools are transitioning to digital materials and with the ease of internet research many teachers say they prefer to curate their own primary source materials online how textbooks are produced 1 authors often academics write a national version of each text 2 publishers customize the books for states and large districts to meet local standards often without input from the original authors 3 state or district textbook reviewers go over each book and ask publishers for further changes 4 publishers revise their books and sell them to districts and schools still recent textbooks have come a long way from what was published in past decades both texas and california volumes deal more bluntly with the cruelty of the slave trade eschewing several myths that were common in textbooks for generations that some slave owners treated enslaved people kindly and that african americans were better off enslaved than free the books also devote more space to the women s movement and balance the narrative of european immigration with stories of latino and asian immigrants american history is not anymore the story of great white men said albert s broussard a history professor at texas a m university and an author of both the texas and california editions of mcgraw hill s textbooks here is how the politics of american history play out in california and texas textbooks on subjects like race immigration gender sexuality and the economy white resistance to black progress is covered differently in the two states mcgraw hill united states history geography continuity and change california p 505 california notes the suburban dream of the 1950s was inaccessible to many african americans mcgraw hill united states history since 1877 texas p 436 texas does not california and texas textbooks sometimes offer different explanations for white backlash to black advancement after the civil war from reconstruction to housing discrimination in the 20th century southern whites resisted reconstruction according to a mcgraw hill textbook because they did not want african americans to have more rights but the texas edition offers an additional reason reforms cost money and that meant higher taxes whole paragraphs on redlining and restrictive deeds appear only in the california editions of textbooks partly as a result of different state standards texas social studies guidelines do not mention housing discrimination at all california texas takeaway texas says that white southerners opposed reconstruction because of tax increases as well as racial resentment california instead includes primary source quotations from black historical figures about white resistance to civil rights mcgraw hill united states history geography growth conflict california p 586 mcgraw hill united states history to 1877 texas p 555 both states say that breaches of racial etiquette led to lynchings after reconstruction but only california whose edition was written more recently makes clear that the perpetrators of lynchings also hoped to discourage black political and economic power hmh american history reconstruction to the present california p 245 hmh the americans united states history since 1877 texas p 288 nevertheless kerry green a high school social studies teacher in sunnyvale tex a small town east of dallas said she discussed redlining with her 11th graders adding it as a counterpoint to lessons about postwar prosperity the optimistic story of consumerism television and the baby boom that is emphasized by her state s standards ms green said she preferred to assign primary sources that encourage students to explore history on their own but she said she would welcome textbooks that contain more historical documents and a greater diversity of voices and themes from the past the textbook companies are not gearing their textbooks toward teachers they re gearing their textbooks toward states she said on gender and sexuality california textbooks include history that is not in texas editions mcgraw hill united states history geography growth conflict california p 624 california states that the federal government failed to recognize nonbinary gender identities and female leaders in its early relations with native americans mcgraw hill united states history since 1877 texas p 111 texas does not mention gender roles or gender identity in its discussion of efforts to americanize native americans in texas textbooks mentions of l g b t q issues tend to be restricted to coverage of events in recent decades such as the stonewall uprising the aids crisis and debates over marriage rights but for recent california editions publishers wrote thousands of words of new text in response to the fair education act a law signed by governor brown in 2011 it requires schools to teach the contributions of lesbian gay bisexual transgender and disabled americans peppered throughout california books are passages on topics like same sex families under slavery and early sex reassignment surgery in the 1950s text that does not appear in texas versions california texas takeaway california states that enslaved women faced sexual violence from owners and overseers mcgraw hill united states history geography growth conflict california p 449 mcgraw hill united states history to 1877 texas p 443 california mentions the lavender scare that targeted thousands of gay men and lesbians pearson united states history the twentieth century california p 486 pearson

history the twentieth century california p 498 pearson united states history 1877 to present texas p 470 both states focus on women s fight against discrimination in the workplace only california says birth control played a role by allowing women to exert greater control over their sexuality and family planning mcgraw hill united states history geography continuity and change california p 627 mcgraw hill united states history since 1877 texas p 525 stephanie kugler an eighth grade history teacher in west sacramento calif said she had expanded an idea mentioned briefly in her classroom s textbook about women who dressed as men to fight in the civil war and continued to live as men into an entire lesson on troops who today would be considered transgender the students read accounts of those soldiers lives alongside more traditional sources such as letters written by a black union soldier and a confederate soldier her goal ms kugler said was to make it really authentic to talk about diversity in the context of each historical period while both states devote many pages to the women s movement texas books in general avoid discussions of sex or sexuality immigration and nativism are major themes in american history textbooks mcgraw hill united states history geography continuity and change california p 736 california includes an excerpt from a novel about a dominican american family mcgraw hill united states history since 1877 texas p 609 in the same place texas highlights the voice of a border patrol agent michael teague a border patrol agent is featured in the texas edition of mcgraw hill s 11th grade textbook he discusses his concerns about drug trafficking and says if you open the border wide up you re going to invite political and social upheaval mr teague s story is featured at the end of a chapter on recent immigration alongside accounts from a vietnamese immigrant and a second generation mexican american that section in the california edition of the same book is devoted to a long excerpt from the novel how the garcía girls lost their accents by julia alvarez it deals with intergenerational tensions in a dominican american family in a written statement mcgraw hill said the full page border patrol narrative was not included in the california edition because it would not fit beside the literary excerpt and at the time the texas edition was produced six years ago state standards called for students to analyze both legal and illegal immigration to the united states in contrast california textbooks are more likely to note when a historical figure was an immigrant and they include more detail on the role immigrants such as japanese and filipino farmworkers played in labor movements california is one of many states to ask teachers and textbooks in recent years to cover the contributions of specific immigrant groups including asian americans pacific islanders european americans and mexican americans california texas takeaway only california states that levi strauss was a german jewish immigrant mcgraw hill united states history geography growth conflict california p 416 mcgraw hill united states history since 1877 texas p 417 california tells the story of wong kim ark whose 1898 supreme court case established birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants texas s edition which is older does not mention this case but does cover the chinese exclusion act hmh american history reconstruction to the present california p 247 hmh the americans united states history since 1877 texas p 289 these additions are part of the reason california books are almost always longer than their texas counterparts california s board of education adopted an expansive 842 page social studies framework in 2016 two years later texas school board streamlined its social studies standards which are now laid out in 78 tightly compressed pages critics of california s approach say that making state standards and textbooks longer and more inclusive can be overwhelming to teachers trying to move quickly through hundreds of years of material both states emphasize the role of big business from the gilded age to the present hmh american history reconstruction to the present california p 160 california is critical of wealth inequality and the impact of companies like standard oil on the environment hmh the americans united states history since 1877 texas p 235 texas is more likely to celebrate free enterprise and entrepreneurs like andrew carnegie texas policymakers feel strongly about giving students a positive view of the american economy since 1995 state law has required that high school economics courses offer an emphasis on the free enterprise system and its benefits that emphasis seems to have made its way into the history curriculum as well california s curriculum materials by contrast sometimes read like a brief from a bernie sanders rally the yawning gap between the haves and have nots and what is to be done about it is one of the great questions of this time says the state s 2016 social studies framework as a result california textbooks are more likely to celebrate unionism critique the concentration of wealth and focus on how industry pollutes the environment california texas takeaway california refers to the income gap and explains that changes in tax structures and safety net programs and higher costs for education child care and housing played a role both state editions discuss economic inequality in reference to the occupy wall street movement and the decline of labor unions pearson united states history the twentieth century california p 728 pearson united states history 1877 to present texas p 687 the older texas edition highlights additional republican critiques of president barack obama s environmental policies while the california book discusses the threat of rising sea levels pearson united states history the twentieth century california p 749 pearson united states history 1877 to present texas p 709 both the california and texas 11th grade textbooks from pearson state the main argument against environmental legislation is that it hurts the economy and the nation s industries the texas edition goes further to highlight criticism of federal efforts to subsidize the green energy industry republicans accuse the government of wasting taxpayers money for example by supporting the failed solar manufacturer solyndra the solyndra controversy was a fixation for conservatives in 2011 when the company went bankrupt after accepting half a billion dollars in federally guaranteed loans the texas book also states that american action on global warming may not make a difference if china india russia and brazil do not also act the california edition does not mention solyndra or the other nations however it does include a section on the threat to american states and cities from rising sea levels noting that the impact on tourism in florida could hurt that state s economy and that transportation networks and buildings could be threatened pearson said in a written statement that the differences between the books could be attributed mostly to the fact that the california book was published several years later and that concerns over coastal flooding have become more heightened in recent years

money in 2020 without being invested in any u s company in fact while the phase one agreement is a big deal which we donâ t mean to diminish itâ s actually a bit of a distraction from this other opportunity so whatâ s going on for the answer we need to look beyond the trade war and focus on theâ peopleâ s bank of chinaâ pboc the tidal wave of money flowing into the chinese economy â the pboc is similar to our federal reserve in both cases these central banks do their best to steer their respective economies as youâ re likely aware the primary way that the federal reserve does this is by lowering or raising short term interest rates this makes it either less or more expensive for companies to borrow money which has a significant impact on economic growth for example lower borrowing rates makes it cheaper easier to borrow which hopefully stimulates economic activity and grows the economy in china the pboc attempts to steer its economy not as much through interest rates but rather by bank reserve requirements when the chinese central bank wants to encourage economic expansion it reduces these reserve requirements freeing banks to lend more despite the different tools the intended outcome is the same â make access to money widely available in hopes it will rev up the economy now while most u s investors have been focusing on the fed over recent months theyâ ve missed whatâ s been happening in china last week the pboc cut banksâ reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points bringing the level for big banks down to 12 5 this was the eighth cut since early 2018 it also signaled it will likely continue to reduce borrowing costs for companies in 2020 but the pboc didnâ t stop there â it also pumped 115bn into the chinese financial system beyond this last year chinese local governments carried out additional measures to pump money into the economy through tax cuts on companies and individuals valued at 298 billion in essence weâ re seeing chinese policymakers dead set on growing their economy now turning toward the investment implications of all this â is there any recent precedent for what can happen to a stock market when a government floods an economy with liquidity you probably know this answer we saw what happened under similar circumstances here in the u s in the wake of the global financial crisis below you can see how gains in the s p mirrored the fedâ s quantitative easing programs though the fed was buying government securities back then the goal was the same as it is today in china â increase the money supply the chart below reveals a clear correlation â more liquidityâ equals â more stock market gains â â source clark planning â the question is how will the chinese stock market be affected by the flood of capital the pboc is directing into the chinese economy if it follows the trajectory of the u s stock market bet on big gains to come with this in mind letâ s turn our attention to the chinese market now specifically if an investor was interested in putting some chips alongside the pboc whatâ s the state of chinese stocks are they expensive today or trading at a bargain the huge discount in chinese stocks â steve sjuggerud is an analyst at our sister publication stansberry research steve is a china bull and recently noted the buying opportunity in chinese stocks highlighting their valuation amongst other reasons to be excited from steve chinese stocks are dirt cheap compared with their u s counterparts we can see this by first looking at the price to earnings p e ratio for the ftse china 50 index â the p e ratio is one of the simplest and most commonly used valuation measures the lower the ratio the cheaper the investment right now chinese stocks are trading for a p e of 9 1 thatâ s dirt cheap compared with the s p 500â s p e of 21 5 said another way chinese stocks trade for a 58 discount based on this measure thatâ s massive bottom line â the combination of a central bank hell bent on growth as well as low stock market valuations makes china a very attractive investment opportunity that many are overlooking so how can investors play china â one of the easiest ways is fxi the ishares china large cap etf if youâ re looking for one click convenience fxi offers investors a way to own some of the biggest companies in the chinese stock market including tencent china mobile and the bank of china similar to the ftse china 50 index which steve referenced above fxi trades at a low pe just 10 9 meanwhile as youâ re waiting for gains its current yield is 2 55 pretty great compared to the s p 500â s current dividend yield of 1 75 below you can see fxi climbing 8 since the phase one trade deal was announced back in december the s p is up 4 4 over that period â â but while fxi is a great way to get broad exposure to the chinese growth story if youâ re looking for potentially far bigger gains you should look to specific stocks for example our own matt mccall is wildly bullish on theâ one of mattâ s picks weâ ve profiled here in theâ digestâ isâ itâ s an innovative early stage biotech that focuses on transformative medicines for cancer autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases it boasts one of the strongest portfolios of late stage oncology treatments in china itâ s up 42 since mattâ s recommendation as i write itâ s trading at nearly 41 mattâ s buy up to price is 38 so watch for a pullback before initiating a new position but matt isnâ t the onlyâ investorplaceâ analyst watching china this fall louis navellier recommendedâ new oriental education and technology groupâ edu always the numbers guy louis zeroed in on eduâ s financial situation back in his october update the chinese education company reported that first quarter student enrollments soared 50 4 year over year to 2 61 million for the first quarter edu reported earnings of 1 44 per ads and revenue of 1 07 billion in revenue that represented 24 6 annual revenue growth and 24 6 annual earnings growth the consensus estimate called for earnings of 1 37 per ads on 1 07 billion in revenue so edu posted a 5 1 earnings surprise and in line revenue edu is up more than 15 since louisâ recommendation how to separate the good chinese companies from the not so good â fxi is going to give you exposure to lots of chinese companies some of which you may not actually want in your portfolio but if you try to pick specific chinese stocks how do you separate the good from the bad to help you with this remember louis offers a free grading tool thatâ s rooted in his proprietary numbers based market approach to illustrate i just ran mattâ s zlab bitotech pick through louisâ portfolio grader hereâ s the snapshot takeaway â â and what about louisâ pick edu itâ s below this time iâ m showing you the portfolio graderâ s detailed report which is free as well â â the portfolio grader is a great way to check the inherent earnings and income strength of a prospective investment but the tool isnâ t just about picking the right stocks itâ s also about avoiding the wrong ones take a look atâ china mobileâ chl itâ s actually one of the biggest holdings in the china etf fxi which we just profiled hereâ s how china mobile looks through louisâ portfolio grader â â with this â fâ rating in mind letâ s see how china mobile has performed over the last year â as youâ ll see below over the past 12 months though fxi is up 13 chl is down almost 15 â â there are two ways to look at this 1 you could argue this is a big drag on the overall return of fxi which is a reason not to invest in such an etf 2 you could argue this is a reason not to gamble on specific chinese stocks since any one can do poorly even while most others are rising of course thereâ s a third interpretation â use a tool like louisâ portfolio grader to help you find the best chinese stocks that outperform while avoiding those that drag down returns you can access louisâ tool byâ wrapping up the phase one deal getting signed is good news but donâ t miss the other big story behind it â china stocks are headed higher thanks to the pboc weâ ll continue to keep you up to speed here in theâ
