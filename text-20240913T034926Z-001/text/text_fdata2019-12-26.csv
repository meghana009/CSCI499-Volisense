yu hairong wu hongyuran huo kan cheng siwei and han wei caixin where is the chinese economy heading and how will policymakers react as the new year approaches debate over the outlook of the world s second largest economy is heating up and all eyes are searching for clues to the next policy steps china s economy struggled with slowing growth throughout 2019 and touched the slowest pace of expansion in nearly three decades in the third quarter a prolonged trade war with the united states took a toll on momentum and sent jitters to the world economy major research institutions have widely projected that the government will lower the annual target for growth in gross domestic product gdp in 2020 to around 6 from the 2019 target of 6 6 5 reflecting the tougher climate but disagreements emerged on the fundamental factors causing china s economic slowdown whether it reflects long term structural issues such demographic changes or short term risks such as the trade frictions and the scale of stimulus that should be taken to counter the cooling yu yongding an influential economist and former people s bank of china adviser in a recent article stirred heated debate by calling for greater fiscal and monetary stimulus to prevent gdp growth from sliding below 6 liu shijin vice chairman of the china development research foundation a government sponsored think tank argued that using simulative measures to keep growth at a certain rate will only exhaust future growth and postpone problems lu ting chief china economist at nomura international ltd echoed liu and said there is no need to keep growth at a certain level unless a dramatic slump occurs but yu said the key point of his argument is not about how fast china s economy should grow but about whether the government should take greater measures to prevent further slowdown rising pessimistic expectations amid a continued slowdown are very dangerous yu said as they could lead to weaker investment and consumption even if china s gdp growth slows to 5 8 in 2020 as projected by the international monetary fund it would still be one of the fastest rates of expansion among the world s major economies exceeding the predicted global increase of 3 4 and the projected rise of 2 1 for the u s the world s largest economy some analysts said that despite the tough year of 2019 china s economy has remained in a reasonable growth range based on gdp market prices employment and trade balance others warned that persistent risks at home and abroad will continue applying downward pressure in 2020 a team led by liu projected in a study that china s economic growth will hold at less than 6 for the next five years despite varied views on the outlook economists have formed a consensus that china must continue structural reforms for the sake of long term growth the key issue facing china s economy is structural problems which restrain macro control policies from taking effect said zhu baoliang chief analyst with the government linked think tank state information center without real reform measures china s growth will not last long even if it is able to stabilize the pace in the short term yu said a key annual policy setting meeting in beijing last week signaled top leadership s commitment for further economic restructuring china is facing growing downward pressures amid intertwined structural institutional and cyclical problems the top level central economic work conference cewc said in a statement after this year s session china will continue to step up efforts to build a high standard market system push forward reforms in state owned enterprises improve property rights protection and promote reforms in land fiscal and tax systems as well as the financial system the country will further open its economy in a wider and deeper way the statement said policy room top policymakers at this year s cewc vowed to stabilize growth and make contingency plans as the country faces growing downward pressures and rising global turbulence and risk signaling a moderate easing stance to bolster the economy but the meeting also emphasized the need to control the pace and strength of countercyclical measures and pledged to comprehensively assess the impacts of major policies indicating leadership s caution on more aggressive policy moves policymakers and economists have warily scrutinized the country s room for policy maneuver since the last round of stimulus in response to the global financial crisis a decade ago left lingering debt risks official data showed that local governments had outstanding debt totaling 18 trillion yuan 2 58 trillion as of the end of 2018 but researchers estimated the size of hidden government debts in which local authorities provide an implicit guarantee could amount 60 trillion yuan the massive debt overhang would restrain local governments capacity to expand infrastructure spending analysts said but under pressure to keep the economy growing it is likely that beijing could marginally ease controls on the housing market and give local authorities more discretion to manage it based on local conditions analysts said caixin learned from bank sources that regulators have recently sent informal instructions to state banks to gradually loosen restrictions on property loans controls on developers bond sales are also easing slightly sources said on the monetary policy front the room for credit expansion is narrowing as china s current account surplus and foreign exchange reserves dwindle lu said china s current account surplus declined from 10 of gdp in 2008 to less than 0 4 in 2018 according to lu meanwhile forex reserves shrank by 900 billion between 2014 and 2018 as chinese companies foreign debt surged nearly three fold it greatly reduced the space for policies to bolster the economy by adding leverage lu said targeted fiscal expansion many analysts have argued that china should permit bigger budget deficits to allow for more proactive fiscal policies china has strictly kept its official budget deficit below 3 of gdp over the past two decades citing concerns about fiscal risks but analysts said the government s obsession with keeping the official budget deficit at such a low level could have little meaning because of different measurements china s official calculations of budget deficit are often lower than common estimates of the actual deficit making it a less reliable indicator of fiscal policy analysts said since 2015 china has continued to expand the issuance of special purpose bonds to fund local governments infrastructure spending the bonds which surged more than 200 fold from around 10 billion yuan annually in 2015 to 2 15 trillion yuan in 2019 are not included in official budget deficit calculations analysts have widely predicted that next year s quota for new special purpose bond issuance would further rise to 3 trillion yuan if borrowing through special bonds were included china s budget deficit ratio would rise to 6 5 this year from 3 7 last year said ding shuang chief economist for greater china and north asia at standard chartered ltd the actual deficit ratio could be even higher if local governments hidden debts were taken into account an imf report in august found that a broad measurement of china s deficit ratio reached 12 7 in 2019 up from 11 2 in 2018 wang dehua an analyst at cass said the central government s strict control over the official deficit reading reflects concerns that any signal of a higher deficit tolerance would encourage local governments reckless borrowing impulses ubs economists said they expect the headline government budget deficit to stay unchanged at 2 8 of gdp in 2020 or perhaps edging up to 3 fiscal policy would be more focused on spending and infrastructure than tax cuts they wrote the policy room for further tax cuts is narrow in 2020 after the government unleashed reductions of 1 3 trillion yuan 143 billion in 2018 and 2 trillion yuan in 2019 analysts said the cewc statement highlighted projects that would be a focus of 2020 s fiscal spending including telecom networks natural disaster prevention projects urban gas pipeline and water systems city parking spaces logistics networks and rural road systems and information and water projects mild monetary easing the cewc statement continued to describe the government s monetary policy stance in 2020 as prudent but used the words flexible and appropriate compared with last year s appropriately loose or tight the wording change suggests policymakers may adopt a more dovish tone and a mild loosening bias analysts said however policymakers will remain reluctant to adjust monetary policy in a more aggressive way they said because of concerns over inflation the central bank may prefer low profile easing measures in the near term such as rolling over its maturing medium term lending facility mlf and targeted mlf tmlf and offering additional liquidity via such lending tools nomura s lu said preventing financial risks will remain among the top three tasks for 2020 along with poverty relief and pollution control according to the cewc statement but risk prevention was dropped to third place from the top spot of the past two years indicting reduced urgency analysts said after a nearly three year crackdown on financial risks the short term target has been achieved and further goals will require long term efforts they said several analysts told caixin that they expect mild easing in the financial sector in 2020 with efforts to keep risks under control the policies will focus on supporting the real economy especially solving financing challenges facing private businesses the cewc statement hinted at efforts to continue defusing risks at small and medium sized banks a focal point of financial regulation over the past year following the seizure of baoshang bank lu said city commercial banks and rural banks especially those in small cities that enjoyed a land market boom over the past few years are likely to be the targets of risk clampdowns next year caixin learned that regulatory departments have set up plans to deal with risks in small banks involving differentiated measures to defuse their troubles based on the conditions of individual banks
united auto workers assemblyman installs the front doors on a 2018 ford f 150 truck being assembled at the ford rouge assembly plant in dearborn mich on sept 27 2018 carlos osorio ap file the u s economy proved remarkably resilient in 2019 defying recession fears that dominated the headlines throughout the year the economy has entered the longest expansion in american history surpassing the economic boom of the 1990s united states consumers buoyed by the strong labor market have continued to drive economic growth during the past year against a backdrop of weak business sentiment increased hiring and rising wages have powered consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of the u s economy the stock market also rose steadily throughout the year boosting household income and allowing people to spend more the consumer is really driving growth and hasn t been impacted by weakness in manufacturing export and business investment federal reserve chairman jerome powell said during a press conference on oct 30 the trade dispute with china hasn t affected consumer spending either despite tariffs on chinese imports changes in retail prices kept pace with broader inflation mainly due to china s devaluation of its currency according to economists the united states economy grew at an annual rate of 2 1 percent in the third quarter growth for 2019 is predicted to be 2 3 percent weaker than last year s 3 percent however the slowdown is worldwide and the u s economy held up relatively well compared to other advanced economies according to gary cohn and kevin hassett former white house economic advisers the united states is the only group of seven countries that will post growth above 2 percent this year they wrote in a wall street journal op ed adding that tax reform boosted productivity and wages the united states economy expanded for a record 126th straight month in december the longest expansion on record and the country finished an entire decade without entering a recession for the first time ever according to a cnbc report meanwhile the global economy recorded its weakest growth in the past 10 years according to the international monetary fund rising trade tensions poor business climate and activity as well as country specific weaknesses in emerging markets have been a significant drag on global growth in 2019 trump has called the united states economy the envy of the world it s also been a good year for u s stocks the market valuation of the united states stock market has recently climbed to a record 1 5 times gross domestic product global slowdown and trade risks however weighed on business confidence in the united states the trade war with china in particular led united states firms to slow their investment decisions in 2019 economists however started to see a silver lining business equipment investment remains weak related to the global slowing in manufacturing activity citigroup economists wrote in a global economic outlook report however there are signs that global manufacturing weakness is bottoming they said adding that a pickup in united states domestic activity could also boost equipment investment and manufacturing in the first half of 2020 fed policy despite the solid economic activity downside risk from slowing global growth and trade tensions led the u s central bank to cut its benchmark federal funds rate three times in 2019 the federal reserve slashed its target interest rate by a combined 75 basis points in july september and october fed officials however signaled that the current cycle of cutting rates is over they stated that monetary policy is currently in a good place and that a material reassessment of the outlook would be necessary to ease policy further this suggests a higher bar for future rate reductions citigroup economists suggested but added that interest rate cuts would be more likely than rate increases in 2020 strong dollar the strong united states economy has continued to attract investment in 2019 from all over the world because of the perceived safety of united states markets as a result the u s dollar has risen to a record high relative to emerging market currencies geopolitical tensions also boosted demand for the dollar the dollar s high value relative to other currencies will likely continue in 2020 according to the institute of international finance the major driver of the dollar is excess demand for dollar denominated stocks and bonds and other assets robert scott senior economist at the economic policy institute told the epoch times we ve got a problem with too much capital coming into the united states he said adding that the trade deficit is widening as the strong dollar keeps making imports cheaper and united states exports more expensive trade wins in december president donald trump got a major win on trade after the united states mexico canada trade agreement passed the house also the united states and china announced that they would sign the phase one trade deal in january these two deals will allow trump to go into 2020 with a very strong economy according to stephen moore an economist and former trump campaign adviser the state of the economy is the overriding factor in how people vote moore told the epoch times i believe that americans vote with their pocketbooks it s the economy stupid he said recalling the famous motto coined by bill clinton s campaign strategist that summed up clinton s election in 1992 the trade deals would boost trump s reelection chances in 2020 moore said fiscal future while the economy is in a stable position the fiscal future deserves more attention in 2020 according to jim glassman head economist for jpmorgan chase s commercial banking operation as of november s end the united states government s budget deficit over the past 12 months exceeded 1 trillion for the second month in a row due to a surge in federal spending and the federal government s debt surpassed 23 trillion for the first time in history while recessionary and other economic fears loomed large in 2019 the expansion proved quite resilient glassman wrote in a report that said fiscal reforms may be needed in 2020 to keep the united states on a sustainable path from the epoch times
the past year has been excellent for investors but it is now drawing to a close and as always past performance offers little guide to how markets will perform in the year ahead the new year is upon us so which asset classes will fly in 2020 and which ones look vulnerable and will investors be celebrating this time next year as well global economy the global economy is going through a synchronised slowdown according to the international monetary fund s latest world economic outlook report in october with a projected growth rate of only 3 per cent in 2019 the weakest since the financial crisis global growth should improve modestly in 2020 to 3 4 per cent but that is down from a 3 6 per cent forecast in april worryingly this recovery is not broad based and is precarious amid rising trade and geopolitical tensions advanced economies will fare worse with growth of just 1 7 per cent as us growth slows to 2 1 per cent from 2 4 per cent in 2019 emerging markets should compensate by increasing their growth rates to 4 6 per cent from 3 9 per cent however most of the increase is expected to come from a rebound in stressed countries such as argentina and turkey and countries that slowed significantly this year including brazil mexico india russia and saudi arabia in contrast growth in the middle east and asia should rise to 2 9 per cent from 0 9 per cent without monetary stimulus global growth would be 0 5 per cent lower the imf said rick lacaille global chief investment officer at state street global advisors says the good news is that 2020 is not a year of recession we expect the global economic recovery to continue against a backdrop of continued monetary easing policy shifts and persistent pockets of resilience he says low inflation robust consumer spending and a relatively strong global services sector will help he adds mr lacaille says there are still plenty of risks out there notably brexit us china trade tensions iran and impeachment proceedings against us president donald trump climate change is also a growing long term risk that is now embedded in virtually every market and industry climate change poses risks for financial markets as they attempt to digest climate s impact on economic growth on society and on the global energy mix mr lacaille says ross jennings head of sales and relationship management at rbc wealth management says loose monetary policies from central banks plus some additional fiscal stimulus should keep most developed economies growing through 2020 and probably longer which will continue to support growth in corporate earnings dividends and share buybacks investors should respond by having a well balanced portfolio low interest rates means that the search for yield becomes even more important he says the global stock markets enjoyed a stellar 2019 with the us europe and asia ending the year far higher photo ap stock markets vijay valecha chief investment officer at century financial says global stock markets enjoyed a stellar 2019 with the us europe and asia ending the year far higher boosted by the us federal reserve s decision to cut interest rates three times over the year thanks to dovish central banks markets should do well in 2020 too the fed and european central bank have both indicated they will do whatever it takes to prevent a market downfall mr valecha says robert alster head of investment services at close brothers asset management says the us may perform better than many believe its economy continues to grow at a healthy rate underpinned by low unemployment and healthy wage growth he says president trump will be desperate to keep the momentum going ahead of november s presidential election fawad razaqzada senior analyst at forex com says optimism over the us china trade deal is a boost for both countries but also the eurozone whose exporters have been caught in the crossfire seeing a sharp drop in shipments to china the world s second largest economy a partial trade deal should alleviate some of the growth concerns and the focus will now turn to phase two of the trade deal mr razaqzada says this means more lengthy back and forth negotiations keeping investors on their toes the issue of intellectual property theft may prove particularly difficult to resolve so this is not the end of the trade war but it could be the beginning of the end mr razaqzada adds the same could be said of brexit although perhaps it is time for the underperforming ftse to play catch up with the rest of the world he says nannette hechler fayd herbe head of global economics at credit suisse says we are unlikely to see a repeat of the extraordinary market performance of 2019 nevertheless we expect good results from emerging market equities particularly in china where technology firms trade at a large discount to their us peers she says the uae economy investors in the uae had a disappointing year with the market rising only 3 14 per cent in the year to november 29 according to msci the dubai economy grew marginally with the imf projecting growth at 1 6 per cent this year although rising to 2 5 per cent in 2020 niels zilkens lead market head of arabian gulf and non resident indians at ubs global wealth management says the uae economy is still on a slow recovery path following the 2014 2017 oil shock and significant fiscal buffers remain in place headwinds will persist this year and next due to lingering trade tensions the global economic slowdown low energy prices opec led production cuts and tensions with iran he says despite these mr zilkens says growth should pick up thanks to the ongoing fiscal stimulus measures spending related to hosting dubai expo 2020 rate cuts in line with the us fed and continuing diversification efforts bonds many private investors use government and corporate bond funds to diversify their portfolio and provide some defence against falling stock markets bonds pay a fixed rate of interest which looks attractive when interest rates are falling and therefore performed well in 2019 thanks to easing from the fed we could see a repeat next year however do not expect much of a return from fixed income investments mr valecha warns investors at the time of writing 10 year us treasuries yield only 1 8 per cent although he says that looks lucrative when compared to european and japanese bonds where yields are in negative territory ms hechler fayd herbe says government bonds remain unattractive due to their low yields and are likely to disappoint again except in a recessionary risk off environment which she does not anticipate emerging market bonds will likely perform best she adds property there were clear signs of a global property market slowdown this year and simon kinnie head of real estate pricing at the aberdeen standard investments research institute expects a slow 2020 too after nine years of strong returns real estate pricing is looking stretched he says however he expects medium term returns to be reasonable and does not expect a crash property market fundamentals remain robust despite a weakening global economy and pessimistic outlook but low interest rates should support the sector we continue to favour the americas and european regions as a result of their stronger than average three year total return forecasts mr kinnie says kate everett allen partner at real estate specialists knight frank tips paris to grow faster than any other prime global market at 7 per cent in 2020 boosted by tight supply strong demand and the paris 2024 summer olympics berlin and miami should both grow around 5 per cent followed by geneva and sydney at 4 per cent with madrid singapore melbourne and los angeles close behind british prime minister boris johnson s landslide election victory should support london house prices although growth will be marginal as brexit uncertainty rumbles on ms everett allen anticipates a drop of 2 per cent in dubai but is generally bullish due to expo 2020 which is triggering significant investment in new infrastructure such as the expansion of the metro line these changes along with the introduction of long term visas of up to 10 years will boost prime demand she says she expects modest falls in new york and vancouver amid widespread caution in a late cycle low yield environment prime buyers are monitoring risk carefully many with a heavy dose of realism oil oil prices stabilised in 2019 at around 60 for a barrel of wti crude and 65 for brent as global growth and demand held steady despite the us china trade war those hoping for a surge next year may be disappointed with goldman sachs predicting wti at 58 50 and brent at 63 in 2020 slightly lower than today jp morgan predicts 64 50 and 60 respectively mr valecha expects brent crude prices to decline slightly to 60 in 2020 with the price underpinned by opec s current stance of extending production cuts combined with a fall in us shale oil production as ever a geopolitical shock could drive the price sharply in either direction gold the gold price rose an impressive 18 per cent this year according to goldprice org boosted by economic nervousness and the fed s interest rate cuts gold is traditionally seen as a safe haven in times of falling stock markets but giles coghlan chief currency analyst at hycm says the downside is that it pays no interest shares have dividends bonds have coupons but gold offers no such incentive for holding it that is now less of an issue with the fed and other bankers slashing interest rates destroying the returns on cash and bonds the european central bank has cut its deposit rate to minus 0 5 per cent while the bank of japan also has negative rates of minus 0 10 per cent and the swiss national bank has gone even further cutting to minus 0 75 per cent in this environment with the market nervous of equities and bonds offering smaller and smaller yields gold has found its time to shine again mr coghlan says recent us china trade optimism which could drive a global equity rally could hit demand however if the trade war continues expect gold buyers to keep buying he says chris forgan portfolio manager of the fidelity multi asset open range investment fund says gold should remain steady next year due to its defensive qualities we have seen heightened valuations in recent months and strong price appreciation year to date and think gold is still attractive falling interest rates could add to the impetus as could growing investor nervousness bitcoin cryptocurrency bitcoin has delivered another year of high volatility starting 2019 at around 3 600 a coin topping 12 000 in the summer then ending the year around 7 000 that means it roughly doubled in value although by the time you read this its value may have lurched again gary mcfarlane cryptocurrency analyst at online platform interactive investor says the virtual coin has retained its appeal because none of the problems that triggered the financial crisis have been successfully addressed instead unconventional monetary policy has stored up yet more problems as seen in the emergence of negative interest rates in some markets political uncertainty distrust in financial institutions and social revolts around the world have further underpinned its price mr mcfarlane says this further enhances bitcoin s appeal as a safe haven of sorts but also as an alternative store of value bridging currency in the most distressed economies other uses include getting around capital controls in china or avoiding the dollar in countries faced by us sanctions he adds more than any investment the future is impossible to predict bitcoin could rescale its all time high of 20 000 or crash to 2 000 approach with caution

spread and commission are the two main ones that apply spread is the difference between the buy and sell price of any pair and commissions are additional charges that are set by your broker on every trade can i use multiple forex market brokers copy link to section yes you can hold multiple accounts at the same time generally it is easier to place all your trades in the same place however unless you re scalping and trying to profit from the difference in spreads between platforms why do brokers have different prices copy link to section there are a couple of main reasons for this one is that each broker has to make money so they may mark up their fee on top of the live market price the mark up is known as spread and is different on every platform so the prices vary because of it the second is that they source their prices from different places as there is no single forex exchange each broker may buy and sell currency from different liquidity providers on the interbank market and there might be small variations in the price they charge are forex brokers regulated copy link to section not all of them but the best are regulated by recognised financial bodies the commodities and futures trading commission cftc regulates top forex brokers in the united states trading with an unregulated broker puts your capital at risk as you have no protection if the platform turns out to be

the largest broker by region can vary however often online brokers in asia experience the most trading of the usd jpy pair for example while european brokers trade more of the euro against other currencies can i trade without a broker copy link to section no you need an online forex broker to trade fx currency rates are set by the interbank rate the rate at which banks buy and sell currencies from each other in order to trade forex you have to be able to access that market and the only way to do so is through a broker there are different kinds of brokers however and some merely act as a vehicle through which you send your trades to the interbank market others actually take the other side of your trade read more can i trade forex without a broker can i hedge my forex trades copy link

rejected the request to print more money said rep sloh majority of the house members signed a resolution authorizing the executive to print l 4 billion conscience inspired boycott rep declined to confirm or deny reports that each of the signatories to the resolution received a signature fee of us 5 000 but defended his vote i boycotted because my conscience has not led me to printing

county district no 11 alex poure national union for democratic progress district no 1 river gee county richard koon unity party montserrado county district no 11 and dr george b samba independent district no 12 montserrado county late last week the cbl issued a statement assuring the public and its international partners that following the approval by the legislature authorizing the bank to print l 4 0 billion liberian dollars to ease the liquidity situation in the country the procurement process relating to the printing shipment and delivery of the money will be implemented in conformity with transparent accountable and credible procedures as well as in strict adherence to national laws internal regulations and acceptable professional practices and standards this has bolstered by the united states aid for international development statement thursday that it is partnering with the cbl in coordination with the government of liberia and international partners to sign off on a technical assistance program according to the statement the aim of the technical assistance program is to assist the cbl to more effectively perform its core functions of managing the liberian currency and creating the necessary monetary stability for broad based inclusive economic growth given liberia s current liquidity situation in which liberians are having difficulties acquiring sufficient liberian dollars ld and with many of the ld banknotes in circulation mutilated the central bank of liberia has determined that at least a limited amount of additional ld banknotes is needed to support the liberian banking system and its customers ordinary liberians who need to pay for school healthcare and other essentials while the cbl has been toeing the line on the issue explaining that the decision to print liberian dollar banknotes is in accordance with parts ii v of the central bank of liberia cbl act of 1999 skeptics are not sure many have been critical of the decision to print new money when the recommendations of both the usaid backed kroll and presidential investigative team report have not been carried out the cbl however says the provisions under which it is proceeding grants it upon approval by the national legislature to print and issue liberian dollar banknotes in the economy mutilated banknotes prompts new printing says cbl for liberia political observers say the lack of transparency and accountability in the voting process in the national legislature is allowing many elected officials to take their constituents for granted often making promises they can t keep to the detriment of those languishing at the bottom of the economic ladder looking to explain recent social media uproar regarding the photographs of plane bringing in money at the roberts international airport the cbl insists that the printing shipment and delivery of banknotes which are usually guided by standard procedures are normal operation of all central banks across the world the bank explains that the printing of liberian dollar banknotes has been triggered by the lingering liquidity squeeze in the financial sector potentially arising from the mismatch between fixed stock of liberian dollars in the economy over the last three years and the high liberian dollar liquidity demand this demand according to the cbl is also largely explained by the increasing volume of mutilated liberian dollar banknotes the introduction of a surrender policy on remittances of foreign exchange increased collections of duties taxes in liberian dollars other demand factors include the spiraling inflation that is fueling more need of spending in liberian dollars perennial lack of bank branches in few counties to mobilize deposits in liberian dollars and the demographic effects of newer age groups entering the labor force thus inducing demand for liberian dollars as a lender of resort of liberian dollar the cbl has the responsibility to ensure the smooth operations of the financial sector and effective implementation of monetary policy to support the economy at large with the aim of promoting macroeconomic stability the bank says ongoing reform will hopefully convince liberians that the upcoming process will be transparent and accountable the cbl reassures the public of its commitment to strengthening its internal processes as part of the much needed reform of the bank the cbl shall work with international audit experts with the objective of improving the cash control management and internal audit function of the bank as well as ensuring corrections of internal controls transparency lacking in tallying recording votes the cbl hopes that businesses and the liberian populace would be encouraged to be receptive to non cash means of payments for transactions the cbl believes that liquidity pressures can be eased with the general acceptability of electronic modes of payments such as mobile money and points of sale pos terminals the use of digital payments provides efficient benefits to the economy including economizing future cost of currency printing countering money laundering and terrorist financing strengthening efficiency of revenue mobilization and accelerating financial inclusion local and international investors are encouraged to bring their innovations to the fore by investing in financial digitization and the overall digitization of the liberian economy while many have embraced liberia s bourgeoning transitioning democracy the lack of transparency and accountability regarding how elected officials vote on key issues have been lacking frontpageafrica had to rely on information from the clerk s office to come up with the list of those who voted for or against the printing of new money a similar debate followed the decision by the legislature to impeach former associate justice kabineh j aneh a state of an equipment along with a public address system donated to the legislature in 2010 by the world bank and the national democratic institute in a bid to bolster transparency in the legislative branch and also allow the legislature to keep records of how its members voted on particular issues remains a lingering mystery a similar machine is used on the floor of the us congress where votes are compiled through the electronic voting machine by the house tally clerks under the direction of the clerk of the house in the senate floor votes are compiled through the senate legislative information system by the senate bill clerk under the direction of the secretary of the senate for liberia political observers say the lack of transparency and accountability in the voting process in the national legislature is allowing many elected officials to take their constituents for granted often making promises they can t keep to the detriment of those languishing at the bottom of the economic ladder

access to online platforms that allow them to bet on the price movement of currency pairs the best forex platforms are easy to use well regulated and carry strong reputations acquired through years of steady operation and stellar customer service what is spread betting in forex trading copy link to section spread betting is an investment vehicle that lets you speculate on the movement of currency pairs without actually transacting in the forex market the practice which can be done for forex or other markets consists of three main components the spread of the instrument the direction of the trade up or down the size of the bet in its most simple terms a forex spread bet is when you decide which way the price of a currency pair is going to move and place a bet on the outcome how do forex spread betting brokers work copy link to section these platforms enable clients to bet on the price of assets online or via a mobile app simply open your account deposit funds and you can start spread betting on the forex markets a broker offering usually provides two price quotes for a currency pair the bid and the ask the gap between the bid price and the ask price is called the spread traders bet on whether the price of the currency pair will be lower than the bid price or higher than the ask price for spread bettors the narrower the spread is the more attractive the currency pair becomes that s because narrower spreads mean lower transaction costs for those wanting to enter and exit a trade let s use an example to illustrate how it works when you place a forex spread bet on a currency pair say a broker quotes you an ask price of 1 1155 on the eur usd euro u s dollar pair with a bid price of 1 1150 if you think the euro will strengthen compared to the dollar you could bet 0 5 for every point also known as a pip the euro rises above 1 1155 if the eur usd pair climbs to 1 1165 you would earn a profit of 5 0 5 x 10 pips 0 5 x 10 pips if the price of the euro instead falls to 1 1145 you would lose 5 the better you get at spread betting the more you might consider using leverage this allows you to borrow money from the broker to place bigger bets than you would normally be able to make using your own money alone so i don t own the assets i m trading copy link to section technically no you don t own the assets however this is normal when trading forex in the same way that trading commodities doesn t require you to actually own any of the commodities whose price movement you re betting on doing so with forex doesn t require you to own any of the currency pairs whose price movement you re betting on most forex trading is done using cfds which is a very similar process to spread betting rarely do you ever want to or need to own any of the individual currencies yourself spread bets are just a variation on the theme and allow you to bet on how you think forex markets are going to perform you will however have to have money in your account in order to execute transactions the currency you need usually corresponds to wherever the spread betting platform you re using is located for instance a site in the united kingdom would require british pounds

with the fears of the global economic recession hovering around big organizations and governments have a key decision making role to set the tune ahead here are the five wild predictions across industries which can decide the future course of the global economy in 2020 this year of 2019 turned out to action packed with respect to the cryptocurrency market and the global economy in general undergoing a massive crypto winter in 2018 the crypto market saw some recovery especially in q2 2019 if we look at the year to date performance the overall cryptocurrency market cap surged by 60 thanks to bitcoin s performance giving 100 returns during the same period also if we look at the traditional markets they have performed beyond investors expectations indices like dow jones and s p 500 are trading at their all time highs despite the prolonged effects of the u s china trade war although as per the latest discussions both these economic giants are working things out to end this hostility this could possibly give a major boost to the markets however several market analysts have predicted a possible recession in 2020 so as we bid goodbye to 2019 and prepare for 2020 here s a look at the top 5 wild predictions which can have a major impact on the global economy apple putting its cash to work by acquiring a media streaming company last year in 2018 apple became the world s first company to hit trillion dollar valuations apple s journey in 2019 has been nothing less than spectacular this year the aapl stock has surged by a whopping 90 making its investors rich having dominated the smartphone industry for a decade with its flagship iphone handsets apple is keenly observing the industry shift with iphone sales declining in recent years apple is expanding its services in home and wearables accessories apple ceo tim cook has been much vocal about the next big technology of augmented reality the latest reports suggest that apple might launch its ar glasses in the next 2 3 years with hoards of cash in its reserves apple is likely to put it in use the next year industry reports suggest that apple will try to get a big pie of the media streaming and content distribution industry last month apple launched its apple tv services in the market reports suggest that apple might acquire existing giants like disney or netflix that can give the cupertino based tech giant a larger footprint while setting up another steady revenue stream with the subscription based model tesla join hands with another giant automaker the global automobile industry is undergoing a massive change with a larger focus on electric cars needless to say that american automaker tesla has been at the forefront of the revolution moreover tesla s continuous push for e vehicles has got automobile giants to join the bandwagon however tesla is relatively very young and new to compete against the already established behemoths the automobile giants like bmw and volkswagen have the required financial muscles to deal with this transformational change there is news in the market that cope up with its financial requirements tesla could possibly merge with korean automaker hyundai in 2020 tesla hyundai could be a good merger on cards as even hyundai has been struggling off lately to match to the market shift tesla s technical prowess matched with hyundai s market presence can give both the companies a considerable lift moreover hyundai can also alleviate some of hyundai s cash flow struggles japanese intervention to stop its growth decline while we are talking about the global economy we just can t ignore japan the asia economic giant is strugglingly badly with its gdp growth falling below 1 in 2019 to arrest this falling growth the japanese government led by shinzo abe has released a fiscal stimulus package however the markets haven t reacted positively to this stimulus as it just appears to be a rehearsed version of the existing promises as per the report by business insider the bank of japan has hit the limits of monetary policy they have negative policy rates they are holding long term interest down through yield curve control they are buying bonds equities and real estate and they altered their inflation target to allow an overshoot the report adds that japan can consider a more aggressive path of currency intervention this means that japanese policymakers could consider weakening the yen giving a boost to the country s exports back in 2011 japan had announced its largest currency intervention ever inclusion of cbdc in the u s banking sector well major economies have already started exploring the benefits and risks of having a central bank digital currency cbdc china has accelerated its development for the digital yuan which supposedly aims at getting an edge over the u s in the financial space and reduce the dependency on the u s dollar on the other hand internal sources from the federal reserve suggest that the u s is also working on the digital dollar moreover the entry of big tech in the financial market is putting up a big challenge to the traditional banking systems if the traditional banks do not keep up with the fintech wave they are likely to find it difficult keeping up the upcoming competition moreover with the fears of recession growing up we can see some major changes in the u s banking sector a federal reserve official recently warned about the u s debt going higher and higher in such a situation if the usd loses its dominant position as the global reserve currency the u s can face a major blow in terms of interest payments on its debt the u s brings control over the capital flows while the two big economies are working on ending the differences in the u s china trade war the u s might think ahead of controlling the capital flows president donald trump and his administration are working aggressively to give u s goods an edge in international trade there are chances that the government s key focus next year will be on the country s key strengths corporate governance and intellectual property it is a known fact that foreign companies are trying to penetrate the u s markets by acquiring valuable startups in silicon valley needless to say china has been an active investor in u s companies u s bonds and even the u s real estate citing this threat of growing chinese dominance president trump introduced the foreign investment risk review modernization act firrma in 2018 this gives additional powers to the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius which looks after approving foreign takeovers in u s companies with the new powers cfius can possibly stop chinese acquisition of u s companies and real estate some of the recent steps include blockchain china based kunlun tech from acquiring dating app grindr this happened on the reasons for national security threats similarly singapore based broadcom was stopped from acquiring u s based qualcomm note that the chinese government has been quite hesitant in the past for allowing foreign companies to operate big tech giants like google and facebook have faced enough trouble from the chinese authorities it is just a matter of time that the u s can play a tit for tat card and block the chinese crusade in its homeland

in this well crafted interview grover norquist discusses tax reform the trump effect and creating a coalition for exercising personal rights as written in the u s constitution he also shares the rewards to the economy the ineffectiveness of socialism and quality of life through small government and bi partisan cooperation enjoy with us the viewpoints of this much touted political activist and tax reformer as he outlines strategy for workable tax reform president of americans for tax reform he founded the atr at the request of president reagan and has been active as the leader of the american taxpayer protection movement in 1993 he launched his wednesday meetings series for conservatives in washington d c and contributed significantly to the republican victory in the 1994 republican revolution he congratulated trump after his victory in the 2016 presidential election on his website and played a significant role in the white house and congress tax cut policy of 2017 interviewer hanako cho the dangers and allure of big government interviewer japan has been going down the big government route for a while it s because the liberal democratic party s policies are no different than the liberal policies of the democratic party and we can no longer see a difference between right and left how do you see the situation in japan grover norquist well governments tend to get larger because they keep coming up with new projects to fund and hire new friends and everybody likes to be in a big department rather than a small department companies would like to be bigger but you have to invent more and sell more to have a bigger company in government you just have to tax more you don t have to do more you don t have to do anything productive or useful you just have to get more money and you re off to the races so the natural tendencies of government are to grow to the point where they re abusive the genius of the u s constitution is it specifically says government s allowed to do these things it s not allowed to do these things and that has stopped a lot of problems the government doesn t get to choose what religion you re in which they used to have wars for hundreds of years in europe over what religion you re supposed to be and so we just said we re not doing that so that s a whole collection of things not to worry about we re not going to run newspapers and television shows and tell people what to think or what they re allowed to say first amendment so it limits both the government and it sets up the rules so it s harder harder it s not impossible harder for people to cheat and make the government bigger than it needs to be or should be but yes if you look at all the european countries they tend to get bigger and bigger and bigger and the problem is as you get bigger you get less efficient you get less effective you do things less well and you d think people would say change direction this is bad fix things but once the government gets big enough it controls your education it controls your retirement it controls your healthcare you re not going to fight with that government that has all that maybe your job is actually a government job so by expanding government it actually reduces the number of its opponents that can be effectively used against you and increases the number of people who are active in support of whatever the government wants give it more money because i am the government give the government more money i am the government and to stop it you have to get there before 50 of the population is paid by the government or their life is controlled by the government and get them to vote more limits on the government and sometimes that s a tax cut where you say this new tax is too oppressive we should get rid of it sometimes it s a regulation sometimes it s a war the government s involved in a war where this is a bad idea let s stop this and wars are just big government projects and i get it s sometimes necessary sometimes it s not necessary but always expensive and in the u s we ve had some success in limiting government but many failures so we have a lot of work to do the drawbacks of consumption taxes interviewer the raised consumption tax has negatively affected medium and small sized businesses who don t export their goods and services to other countries the smaller businesses are taking the greatest toll from japan s bipolarized economy the consumption rate has dropped and 1000 convenience and department stores have closed down it is also resulting in lower wages and employment cuts affecting the per household income how do you see this situation the difference between the us and europe grover norquist the value added tax that is the favorite tax of big government proponents it is in some ways a hidden tax in that you don t it s in everything you do every day but your income tax they give you a bill at the end of the year and tell you you pay this much in income tax your property tax on your home there s a bill at the end of the year you see how much you paid into your property tax people don t have you know at the end of the year how much did you pay in sales tax or vat i don t know it s a lot what that is i don t know and because you don t add up all the stuff and in the states only some things are under the sales tax nobody has a sales tax more than 10 if you add up state and local and it s more like 5 in the states european union it s 20 on the value added tax so it is big and the goal of the left in the united states of america is to establish a vat because a vat would put 20 of the gdp or almost 20 of gdp into the hands of government instead of being 30 of gdp state local and federal it d be over 50 we d be france and by becoming france you become neurotic and everything that we don t want to be the left loves that it s a money maker just gushers of cash they like to pretend that they re in favor of progressive income taxes but they d rather have the cash than progressive income taxes and there s only so much money you can make taxing rich people there just aren t enough so they really need to get the middle class the difference between the united states and europe is not how they tax rich people it s how they tax the middle class the middle class gets hit with a 20 value added tax they don t do it in the united states the middle class gets hit with an income tax rate that s 10 20 in some cases 30 percent higher than in the united states so european denmark sweden france they pay 10 20 even 30 percent more than the american does family of four on income tax then add the vat whereas rich people basically pay similar amounts of money or percentages us and europe so the way to sell people on a new tax on the massive middle class is to say we re going to tax rich people and we re going to do it like this and everybody s supposed to look at that while you pick the pockets of the middle class with a value added tax with higher income tax and you say to them well you shouldn t complain because this guy over here he s really getting taxed if you take my money why in the world do i care how much money you take from somebody i ve never met my life is impacted by how much of my income you take from me not how much you take from him but the press likes to say elizabeth warren running for president that she wants to tax rich people she has a 6 wage tax in her proposal taxing the middle class on everybody who works 6 she has some wealth tax that she says she ll put in that she ll never actually put in european countries that have tried wealth taxes largely got rid of them most of them got rid of them because they don t raise much money and they re very awkward and they you know people s privacy has to be completely shredded and at some point you re chasing after money that doesn t exist or won t come back the wealth tax fallacy so on taxes the left talks let s tax the rich but what it does empower is taxing the middle class because they need the money they need the money they need the money and the other is just to distract you to fool you into thinking that this is a tax increase on rich people when in point of fact it s a tax increase on the middle class the perceived myth of social welfare interviewer street interviews in japan show that people think a tax raise was necessary for them to get social welfare they think of taxes like a bank account or like an investment for their children grover norquist that s the way they sell people on social security in the states that your fica taxes your social security taxes are being saved for you in point of fact they re being spent the next week for somebody else s grandmother then when you get old and retire they will steal money from your grandchildren and give it to you and you think they ve been saving your money all along but they haven t social security vs personal savings plans interviewer how can we change this kind of thinking grover norquist in the states what we ve done is starting under reagan we expanded 401k s and iras which allow you to save tax free for your retirement or for buying a house or for healthcare but retirement s the big number and we have 100 million 401k s in the united states and 40 million iras in the united states that means that more than half of adults have their own personal savings account some other people have like a traditional pension like social security you put in something and we promise to pay you a certain amount whether or not you ve saved enough for that or whether you ve saved more than enough for that so right now more and more people have a 401k then they begin to compare i put this much in my savings account and i m going to get this much i give the social security people this much and i m going to get a fraction of it you d be much better off taking your social security taxes 15 of your wages and putting it into your savings account into your personal ira 401k then you d retire with much more money because you d be getting actually interest and increase in the stock market in all your savings whereas in this case they take your money spend it and promise to go tax somebody else and pay you a certain fixed amount which is not a but then there s no savings you can t pass on something to your heirs you die it s finished if you had a 401k you die and it goes to your heirs has the 401k made a change in the way people save interviewer so after the introduction of the 401k have the people in the u s greatly changed their way of savings grover norquist well in 401k s more people are putting more money into that the private sector which had traditional defined benefit pensions those don t work in the real world so they re moving over into defined contribution now only the government and unionized companies have defined benefits we promise to pay you this much well how are you going to make the money i don t know but we promise to pay you that much we ll see what happens but the more people have a defined benefit plan then they go what if i took my social security savings and invested them i d be better off to get people to say let s do something different with social security you need an alternative that they ve seen and touched and felt and go i know how this works i trust this the impact of the stock market back in the 30s and 40s and 50s very few people less than 10 owned stock now more than half of americans own stock through 401ks and iras but until you ve done that well is it just a big risk disappear tomorrow how safe is it but now you ve got a whole generation that have been saving for their retirement more than one generation saving for their retirement through a 401k ira they would be perfectly happy to take any government program and just fold it into their personal savings and ultimately that s what bush wanted to do bush 43 george bush 43 and social security he wanted to take your social security and give it to you to invest into the future so you d be in control i wish we d been able to do that that would have been very helpful the left was never going to agree as soon as everybody in the country saves 10 of their income in a 401k that they control and retire with almost a million dollars in the bank and money to survive on the modern democratic party s finished because the modern democratic party everything they do shrinks the value of your 401k or your ira they tax it or regulate it or and they can t promise you anything we ll give you more social security no no but we earn our own social security our own 401k privatizing social security i think that privatizing social security in the states and in other countries and a bunch of european countries have done some of it but latin america followed chile s model have been the best at it where the money you would otherwise pay into your taxes goes straight into a 401k for you so that s been very positive changing the government mindset interviewer unless the people change their mindset the government will probably use social welfare as an excuse to keep raising the tax rate in this case they could very well start raising the consumption tax to 30 and then 40 what are your thoughts on this proposing a constitutional amendment grover norquist i would recommend starting a campaign that says we just went from 8 to 10 before that it came up to 8 then 10 here are all the quotations from politicians we re never going to raise it again people promised they wouldn t but then they did so to put into the constitution that the value added tax cannot be more than 10 and then the politicians have to say oh we have no intention of raising it past 10 then put it in the constitution no that would make it too difficult to raise it higher than 10 which we don t plan to do so stop asking us but we don t want to do it we don t want to say no but we don t want to do it we ll never do it but we won t say no we won t put it in the constitution well then everybody goes wait a minute you want to raise it beyond 10 you jerk and they wanted to wait 5 or 10 years until everybody cooled off and then raise it again so i think now when people are sore angry about 10 is the time to put into the constitution no more than 10 and then you could have a discussion down the road of let s go to 9 let s see what we can do there but at a minimum stop the bleeding stop the bleeding this could work the effect of the u s tax cut interviewer president trump enforced a huge 1 3 trillion tax cut in 2017 it s been 2 years now how much has the u s economy grown in that time grover norquist okay we started turning the economy around the day trump was elected so even though he hadn t passed any new laws people knew that the trump administration was going to undo some of the regulations that obama had put in but they hadn t taken effect yet so they passed a law that said next year in january in november this new regulation will take effect which meant the press didn t write about it nobody seemed to know about it and that is one where that was the first big thing that trump did was he undid expected regulations the stock market went up because instead of having one future they were going to have a different future and that was very helpful then they cut the corporate income tax the individual rates did full expensing reduced the cost of capital investment in the united states and then expanded energy production and made it easier when the other team would not let a pipeline get built the trump people are moving on pipelines steps to strengthen u s economy there s some very real steps forward they took to strengthen the economy and that s worked very well to give us a much healthier economy going forward we have unemployment rates that we haven t seen in 50 years much lower unemployment more people are working than under obama during obama people quit working so some of the unemployment oh the unemployment went down yes because 1 to 2 percent of the population that used to be looking for work stopped looking for work because they gave up on work and that makes unemployment look down because they no longer if you re not looking at this you don t count as unemployed then under trump people have come back into the workforce and more jobs have been created so the unemployment number kept going down for african americans it s at historic lows for women for any way you want to look at it it s historic lows in terms of that and the growth of the stock market the value of everything in the country of income wages have all grown very well and strong what would a second trump election look like for the economy interviewer if the trump administration continues a second term what will the economic growth be grover norquist i think if we don t get caught up in trade wars we ll be at 3 and 4 percent there will be another tax cut if trump wins reelection and gets the house and senate back he will pass a bill that will be introduced this spring about april may and that will be the political document where we say if you reelect me and the republicans we will do this it will be expanding iras and 401k s it will be ending the taxation of inflation on your ira it ll be a whole series of tax reductions aimed at middle income people a lot focused on 401k s and iras because that s the middle class savings plan and making sure that s stronger can republicans take back the house interviewer can republicans take back the majority in the house grover norquist right now they re 18 seats down 13 of those were in trump plus six districts if you took the trump plus six districts you only need five more and there are 40 somewhat competitive ones it s not guaranteed but it s very doable so if trump either wins or comes close we will be in a position to save the senate and look to take the house so a lot of that depends on how the democrats play impeachment and right now the support for impeachment s been falling because they ve kind of overplayed their hand and it s not clear there s an investigation about the fbi going after the president and so as that comes out that can be very embarrassing to the left that could help trump a great deal there are a series of issues that affect only a few million people but then you only need 10 000 people in wisconsin and 20 000 people in michigan and 10 or 20 000 people in pennsylvania to win the election home schooling and charter schools in danger two million american children are home schooled and the democrats want to restrict regulate end home schooling all those parents will all be voting for trump because the democrats will take away their ability to raise their kids and educate them themselves then you have three million people who have their kids in charter schools charter schools are public schools government run schools but independent of the teacher s union and of the political structures that screw up the public schools and those people have sweated to get their kids in charter schools and now elizabeth warren wants to shut them down will the democrats desire to regulate elect trump and so you have three million people they were out demonstrating against her it was in the papers yesterday when she goes somewhere the charter school people demonstrate against her you have 19 million americans with a concealed carry permit the right to carry a gun concealed and the democrats want to end that so you have 19 million americans who have made the decision how they re going to protect themselves and their family a third of them are women it s increasing a million and a half every year the number of people with concealed carry permits so that s a group that fears the government taking away their ability to protect themselves you have 10 million vapers people who quit smoking and they vape there s an effort by the democrats to ban that the president right now is opposing that this will be helpful and so for 10 million adults they are saving their life by vaping instead of smoking cigarettes and the democrats want to take that away that will move millions of votes so that s why i think trump will win if the economy s doing well there s no war and there s no big scandal i mean they can talk about attacking him but first it was russia that turns out to be nothing and now the new ukraine thing is also nothing and so i don t know what the d s are going to do but they quite correctly fear losing the next election we have a lot of work to do on that but the republicans have a lot more money in the bank than the democrats democrats are in debt the democrat party trump has raised more money than all the democrats together so i think it ll be a pretty big deal the phenomenon of socialism in the u s interviewer in the u s more and more young people are being drawn to socialism why is this phenomenon happening grover norquist two things they don t know anything about socialism they haven t read about the soviet union looking at china it s because of the lousy public education and the good news is over time people will learn more and that will be and the other one is we conservatives republicans need to explain to people better what socialism is and the history of it and that sweden is not socialist and denmark is not socialist their government s too big but they re not government run industries this is not east germany or russia or china oh china has been successful their economy is everything china did to make their economy grow was to walk away from state control they gave farmer s more control of their assets they let people move in the country let local governments make decisions not everything from the top at first now they re beginning to slow some of that down and i think it ll cost them the ability to keep growing because they think that they created this growth instead of recognizing every time you stopped doing things things got better every time you went away things got better now they want to come back and take credit for it and start telling people what to do that will give them a slowdown plus there s a tremendous amount of investment in china where political investment kind of like during the decade in japan the politicians would have all this infrastructure and that was supposed to make everybody rich and so you have these big concrete roads that go nowhere well china has a lot of that local people making decisions building cities where there aren t necessarily people for them you know structures they spend 8 on infrastructure the united states spends 4 on infrastructure and we waste a lot of our 4 but you can imagine if you had 8 much of it waste that s not very helpful so i think that they ve got some challenges coming in the next 15 years the number of people in china under the age of 55 will decrease by 250 million so there ll be 250 million fewer people of working age and there ll be 250 million people over 55 the society is aging they don t do immigration and a lot of their growth over the last 20 years was moving hundreds of millions of people to the shores into the big cities on the ocean or alongside the rivers or near the three gorges dam which you can now run barges up and down so you can run factories on both sides of these rivers but there aren t any more people in the countryside to go scrape up and bring into the city so the growth that they re going to have is not as robust as in the past they will have to spend more money taking care of old people and have fewer people to do it and they ve got problems with everybody on their border blocking infrastructure interviewer with regard to trump administration s infrastructure policy he is planning to invest 1 5 trillion dollar in investments over the 10 years but it hasn t really taken effect right grover norquist correct the congress would not work with him on that the democrats wouldn t they don t want him to have a success on it two the democrats just want higher taxes okay well there are two things trump was counting when he said the 1 5 trillion or whatever he was counting money spent by federal state and private companies together so he said the federal government would put up 200 billion and the rest would come from the private sector so of course the democrats don t know there s a private sector and so they kept hearing 1 5 trillion in higher taxes and spending now he never said that but i think 200 million s a lot of money for the federal government to kick in period but it s a lot less stupid than 1 5 trillion the need for bi partisan support so he said to the democrats you know i m ready to go if you are there is a movement that has bipartisan support that i ve been helping with that says let s take 200 billion worth of loans to farmers so the federal government loans money to farmers why i don t know that s pretty stupid but we do we loan money to farmers and then they pay the government back and crop insurance stuff like that what we recommended there s a bill in congress to do this which has bipartisan support from the black caucus and the conservative republicans together is take 200 billion sell it take the cash and say who wants to build roads with 200 billion and that that would be the federal government s contribution you don t have to raise taxes you just sell assets that you have i like that a lot i think we can do it i ve certainly argued to the administration that you ought to look to do it that way because then you say look here s 200 billion it s right on the table democrats when you re ready come and we ll divide this up on projects we ll build this highway we ll build these bridges and so on get with the program and if i was the president i would say to any city or state you come to me with a plan that s written down and approved by all of your regulatory guys don t come and tell me we d like your money and then spend five years delaying the process because you have regulations they could do this very quickly if that was the cost of getting the money come to me and then i ll give you this voucher which says you got a half a billion dollars for your bridge for your road so when the democrats come to the table and we release this 200 billion you re in now go talk to your democratic congressmen and tell them to get with the program promises promises so we could drive i think a lot of support for taking the 200 billion and getting it committed to specific projects because politicians love to go we re going to do 200 billion and then they promise a trillion dollars out to people because they promised everybody everything and people vote for the whole i vote yes thinking they re getting their bridge they re not getting their bridge then they come back and say help us next time when we want to raise taxes then we ll get your bridge promise using ppp interviewer will the trump administration also use ppp as a way to invest infrastructure grover norquist oh pub yeah that s what the president was looking at you can do things with toll roads certain bridges can all be tolled the technology now makes it very easy i mean you could toll all the roads if you wanted to and just say here s who owns the roads and who will take care of them you don t have to have the government run the roads if you don t want to now back when you had to have a toll and all that stuff now with technology you could make it very clear you know these roads are owned by at t and if you want to ride on them they cost this much okay and you had the little thing in your car and you drive around and they send you a bill so you can toll things easily and improvement on a road let s say you don t privatize the old roads but you have a wider road or a bigger road or a different road and you got to build it now well then toll it have a toll in effect public private partner because then the private sector comes and says we ll build the road if we can have a 1 toll so that s the big i think opportunity there i think the challenge is the democrats don t want an infrastructure bill meaning more roads infrastructure number of months ago schumer and pelosi said we want to do infrastructure and they had a list of all the things they wanted to do with their tax increase roads weren t on the list roads weren t on the list bridges were not on the list it was education it was parks it was mass transit it was green things you know didn t mention roads i mean how do you not mention road well because they have no intention of ever building roads with any money you give them developing activists interviewer you mentioned during your speech that you have been very successful in establishing activists in 41 states out of 50 states what was the key to be effectual in establishing these kind of activists grover norquist sure we started by having a meeting in dc which started at 20 people and moved to 150 but we also started talking to people in the states now i knew leaders of taxpayer groups around the states i knew leaders of the libertarian party i knew think tank leaders and over time we now have five people who in addition to me fly around the country and go to meetings and help get them going and stronger and 41 states are going 9 we have yet to i mean we ve had a meeting in them but then they folded it was too difficult we didn t have the right leader and so now we re going to those states and getting those back up again but 41 states some states have more than one meeting there are three meetings in california three in ohio three in florida two in west virginia two in kentucky stuff like that so our goal is to have every state capitol and then in the larger states two or three four different meetings so that everybody on the right works together knows what they re doing plays well with other children working together so that s kind of a and what you do there is you just keep finding leaders who are willing to work with everybody the person who chairs a meeting doesn t run the meeting he manages the meeting the people in the meeting put themselves on the agenda they decide if they re going to speak it s not like the chairman goes you speak you don t you know everybody works together everybody has to understand that nobody tells anybody else what to do nobody works for anybody else we work together or not somebody has a project nobody else has to do anything on it if they want to they can but nobody s required to agree with anything that anybody else said we don t vote on issues we don t say oh you re wrong you re right sometimes different concerns have a different approach do what you re doing let everybody know what you re doing we ll call it that the tax cut movement interviewer what made you join the tax cut movement grover norquist i was active in the effort to cut taxes in massachusetts my home state very early on i was supportive of california s proposition 13 which is a significant property tax cut i was offered a job as the head of the national taxpayer s union which was the only national taxpayer group in the country back in the 80s and then when reagan was president he created americans for tax reform and asked me to run it so basically i was convinced am convinced that taxes are the key dividing point between people who want the government to get larger and more powerful and more abusive and people who want it to be less expensive and lighter touch and allow society to be more organic in how they get together and do things whereas government is top down do this do that it s not sustainable it s just blunt force owning the land i found out this from studying history i started reading all the cold war history during the cold war the nature of the soviet union and so on but then american history and how we developed property rights in the united states because the united states is either the only country in the world or one of very few where when you own this building and the land on it you also own everything to the center of the earth so if there s oil or gravel or gold it s yours in europe and i think everywhere else in argentina you own the surface but also some sort of if there s gold on the surface you can go down a little bit but you can t go down 100 feet there s some sort of weird it s sort of yours but not clear whereas in the united states once you own this land if there s water down there you can have access to it if there s sand or gravel there are lots of things that are not really expensive but they re valuable and sometimes there s gold and silver and oil and natural gas and that has tremendously strengthened the united states we ve had more holes poked in the united states looking for oil than all the rest of the world together because in poland if they poke a hole in your farm and they find oil well then they ll bring all the cranes and drill for oil and mess up your farm and the government takes all the money because the government owns what s under the ground you don t whereas the united states in north dakota if they find oil under your ground people come and pay you large quantities of money to come and take it out and they won t tear up your land or if they crunch it a little bit you don t care because they re giving jillions of dollars so in the united states people come poke a hole in my backyard take a look tell me if it s anything there i might have won the lottery and i have not learned how or why in the united states the individual owned everything under the land in europe the king owned everything underground you know if you find anything interesting it s mine problem is nobody looks for anything interesting if the king s going to get it so that was pretty goofy whether it s coal or something else of value down there individual freedoms and limited government i think we re in a very good situation we just have a lot of work to do we kind of know what we re trying to get done we have a structure where the people we want in our political movement are people who on their vote moving issue want to be left alone so in the states you home school you want to be left alone that s the most important thing in your life you re in you have a second amendment your ability to keep your gun you want to be left alone that s your vote moving issue you re in you re an entrepreneur the most important thing in your life is to be able to be an entrepreneur and not get told what to do and taxed or regulated you re a taxpayer you just don t want higher taxes you re in you re any of the various communities of faith the most important thing in your life is practicing your faith passing it on to your kids and you want to be left alone then everybody there doesn t agree on what s the most important thing they have very different ideas about what s the most important thing what they all agree on is the government should be small enough and non threatening enough to allow me to have my gun and you to home school and you to make money and you to be a small business guy and you to be able to go to church synagogue or mosque and we can all be friends because were not in disagreement about any vote moving issues i may think that your favorite project is silly boring or ridiculous but it s not threatening that s what you do that s what i do how to have a winning conservative coalition and so when you find new issues like vaping we want to be left alone to vape people who want to ride motorcycles without helmets there are a lot of states that have helmet laws other states said no you don t have to wear a helmet if you don t want to it s very important to some people don t make us wear a helmet so if what you want to be is left alone on key issues you re welcome at our table you re welcome at our meeting you re welcome at our coalition and all we ask is that our candidates stand in the middle of the room and say i m going to leave your guns alone your kids alone your education alone your money your business your faith boom and then we can all be happy

spread this news by jeffrey moyo new york times people lined up early to have the opportunity to buy subsidized cornmeal from the government managed grain marketing board deposit at harare at prices they could afford after three hours a guard appeared to announce that the supply of the deposit was rotten so there would be none for sale that day the crowd of 150 reacted with disbelief and anger life is hard all things are expensive there are no price controls and inflation continues to get worse said benjamini dunha 57 a plumber who earns 700 zimbabwean dollars a month about 38 at rates of official change less than a year ago his salary was worth much closer to 700 another buyer nyasha domboka 52 spoke cynically about a truck full of cornmeal also known as flour flour which he had just seen in the warehouse parking lot how can you say that recently packed meals have suddenly spoiled he asked a combination of government dysfunction an economic collapse droughts and a calamitous cyclone last march led zimbabwe to a hunger disaster that has become the most serious in southern africa and one of the most alarming in the world while food is still not necessarily scarce it is becoming inaccessible to everyone except for the privileged few i cannot emphasize enough the urgency of the situation in zimbabwe hilal elver a united nations independent human rights expert in food security he said after a 10 day visit in november 60 percent of the country s 14 million people elver said are food insecure and live in a home that can t get enough food to meet basic needs hunger in africa is a widespread problem but in zimbabwe once known as the mainland s barn it has been aggravated by the dysfunction that has left the country in its most severe economic crisis in a decade the annual inflation rate which the international monetary fund has rated as the highest in the world is 300 percent cornmeal a staple of the zimbabwean diet doubled its price in november to 101 zimbabwean dollars per sack of 10 kilograms now it costs 117 in early december a two liter bottle of cooking oil cost 59 zimbabwean dollars now it costs more than 72 the money here is worthless now said dunha who has eight children all they can afford to eat he said are vegetables and sadza a thick porridge of boiled cornmeal gerald bourke spokesman for the operations of the world food program in south africa the united nations anti hunger agency said that until recently 60 percent of its assistance to zimbabweans was in cash but that recipients no i don t want the money anymore inflation is a rampant problem and people said we would prefer food said bourke then in january he said the agency intends to switch to a completely in kind food programme for the first time in zimbabwe distributing monthly rations of grains oil and nutritional supplements for children under 5 the agency will also double the number of recipients to four million this is certainly the worst we are seeing in south africa bourke said during a field visit in mid december to harare the capital while cases of acute hunger have not been uncommon in rural areas of zimbabwe it is now seen in cities he said hungry people in the countryside move to the cities in search of food the finance minister mthuli ncube he said friday that the government would spend 180 million zimbabwe dollars a month in subsidies as part of an effort to keep the price of cornmeal stable but for many zimbabweans there is a fear that the inflation problem would presage a return to the days of more than a decade ago when a trip to buy groceries required cash trolleys even now shopping for anything beyond cornmeal is considered a luxury we used to buy favorite foods like ice cream cheese bacon sausages and ham and prepare good breakfasts for our families said moreblessing nyambara a 35 year old harare school teacher these things are a vision of the past now many historians attribute zimbabwe s plight to the legacy of robert mugabe the father of independence in 1980 an icon of african anti colonialism mugabe became a despot and presided over the decline of what had been one of the most prosperous lands in africa he was expelled in 2017 and died in september at age 95 any hope that mugabe s former ally and successor emmerson mnangagwa could revive zimbabwe s economy has almost completely vanished last june mr mnangagwa rejected a policy known as dollarization in which the united states dollar and other foreign currencies were used as legal tender that policy had been introduced in 2009 and helped end an era of hyperinflation which had made the zimbabwean dollar literally less valuable than the paper it was printed on but a newly introduced version of the zimbabwean dollar has fallen in value drastically increasing the prices of goods that are quoted in the currency foreigners are reluctant to invest in zimbabwe despite mr mnangagwa s proclamation that the country is open to business export sales and remittances from the zimbabwean diaspora important sources of us dollars needed to import food and fuel have declined mr mnangagwa has rejected calls to restore dollarization no progressive nation can progress without its own currency he told the members of the ruling zanu pf party at his annual conference in mid december we will not return even so for now the problem of inflation remains less severe than the one that prevailed over a decade ago at that time prices doubled every day reaching a point where a single sheet of two layer toilet paper cost almost as much as a 500 dollar bill from zimbabwe then the smallest in circulation that comparison generated somber jokes about a better use of currency four million zimbabweans are now not so far from famine according to a scale commonly used internationally to classify the severity of food insecurity and malnutrition in the five phases of the scale phase 1 is minimal and phase 5 is hunger bourke the show s spokesman said that the most hungry zimbabweans are now in phase 3 or phase 4 with zimbabwe s last corn crop halved compared to the previous year due to drought he said aid will continue until at least until the end of april when the next harvest is expected but he was not optimistic meteorologists basically say that we are seeing a very dry growing season said bourke ursula mueller deputy emergency assistance coordinator at the united nations who visited zimbabwe in june said the country s difficulties were partly related to a broader climate crisis in south africa that has spread across all facets of life drought breeds less food which in turn leads to declines in health and education and increases in crime and other negative coping mechanisms he said this is not just a food

source xinhua 2019 12 26 07 26 53 editor zd video player close washington dec 25 xinhua after four rate hikes in 2018 the u s federal reserve cut interest rates three times in 2019 making a remarkable and sharp u turn in its monetary policy the big shift reflected that fed officials assessment of potential risks to the u s economy has dramatically changed over the course of the year due to slowing global growth rising trade tensions and muted inflation pressures fed officials seemed confident that the three insurance rate cuts in 2019 have helped engineer a soft landing of the economy barring a material change in the economic outlook they plan to hold rates steady through 2020 policy u turn a year ago the fed raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent the fourth rate hike in 2018 and the ninth such move since late 2015 when the central bank started the process of monetary policy normalization meanwhile fed officials anticipated that they need to raise interest rates at least twice in 2019 to slow the economy and keep inflation from spiking toward the end of 2018 there was still a sense the economy was growing at around 3 percent fed chairman jerome powell recalled at a press conference earlier this month we took steps to make it rates less accommodative and that seemed to be the right thing however prompted by rising risks to u s growth in the months ahead the fed shifted its stance at the beginning of 2019 pledging to be patient about future rate hikes in march the fed signaled no rate hikes in 2019 and announced plans to conclude shrinking the balance sheet in september taking another step to avoid overtightening monetary policy in july the fed lowered interest rates for the first time in more than a decade amid rising concerns over trade tensions a slowing global economy and muted inflation pressures after the u s bond market in august sent warning signs of a possible economic recession the fed cut rates again in september and october these policy adjustments put the current federal funds rate target range at 1 5 percent to 1 75 percent i don t think anybody saw it coming the challenges that we faced this year i think they were a surprise powell said adding that weaker global growth and persistent trade tensions weighed on the u s economy as the year progressed we adjusted the stance of monetary policy to cushion the economy from these developments and to provide some insurance against the associated risks he said the u s economy expanded at an annual rate of 2 1 percent in the third quarter of 2019 slightly up from the 2 percent growth rate in the second quarter but a sharp deceleration from 3 1 percent in the first quarter according to the u s commerce department in mid october the fed also announced that it would begin expanding its balance sheet by buying about 60 billion u s dollars a month in treasury bills in an attempt to provide more accommodation to the economy it partly reversed the process of shrinking the fed s balance sheet which started since october 2017 but powell emphasized that the action differed from the bond buying program or quantitative easing qe that the central bank deployed during the financial crisis because it was intended to facilitate short term lending to help control its benchmark interest rate mid cycle adjustment powell has characterized the recent rate cuts as a mid cycle adjustment similar to the adjustments the fed had made in 1995 and 1998 as opposed to the beginning of a prolonged easing cycle during both periods in 1995 and 1998 the fed also slashed rates three times a total of 75 basis points to prevent an economic downturn and sustain the expansion before raising rates again but there are still key differences particularly around inflation between now and those two periods in the 1990s according to powell inflation is barely moving up notwithstanding that unemployment is at 50 year lows and expected to remain there so the need for rate increases is less powell told reporters at a press conference in december i think we ve learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation he said the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce the fed s favorite inflation indicator increased 1 5 percent over the 12 months through november still below the central bank s target of 2 percent the threshold to raise rates is still much higher than the threshold to cut rates going forward powell made it clear that he would need to see a sustained period of inflation before he raises rates said diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton a major accounting firm steady rates in 2020 the median estimate for the federal funds rate is at 1 6 percent at the end of 2020 suggesting no rate cuts or hikes in 2020 according to fed officials interest rate forecasts released in december this reinforces our view that with the 2020 elections approaching the fed will keep interest rates on hold said joseph brusuelas chief economist with rsm us llp an audit tax and consulting firm in short the fed thinks it can err on the side of caution and has room to maneuver should the trade war intensify or if there is an exogenous shock to the economy he added tiffany wilding an economist at pimco a global investment management firm believed that positive signs in the u s economy since the rate cut in october seem to have increased the fed s confidence that its mid cycle adjustment has helped engineer a soft landing and that further cuts are unnecessary eric rosengren president of the federal reserve bank of boston also said last week that he didn t see a reason for the central bank to change interest rate policy as the u s economy is currently well positioned for the coming year given that monetary policy works with lags and federal reserve policymakers have already eased monetary policy three times in 2019 my view is that it is appropriate to take a patient approach to considering any policy changes unless there is a material change to the outlook he said but swonk bet that persistently low inflation could force the fed to cut rates at least once again in 2020 meanwhile u s president donald trump has repeatedly pressured the fed to lower interest rates to boost economic growth would be sooo great if the fed would further lower interest rates and quantitative ease the dollar is very strong against other currencies and there is almost no inflation this is the time to do it trump tweeted last week

open this photo in gallery peter navarro a top trade adviser to president donald trump in duluth minn on june 20 2018 tom brenner the new york times news service when u s president donald trump gathered his top economic advisers at the white house to decide whether to make a deal with china peter navarro his hawkish trade adviser was ready with a flurry of arguments against the move a deal that removed any of mr trump s tariffs would make the united states look weak mr navarro argued at the meeting two weeks ago and he assailed those who endorsed the idea as globalists according to an administration official in the room it was a familiar argument for mr trump s top trade adviser who has spent the past three years fanning the president s protectionist instincts and encouraging him to embark on a punishing trade war with china mr navarro s dark warnings about china s ambitions and its threat to the u s have fuelled mr trump s embrace of tariffs overcoming the objections of other senior advisers this time however mr trump was not persuaded with the 2020 election approaching mr trump dismissed mr navarro s concerns opting for an initial deal with china that would reduce some tariffs on chinese goods in exchange for a commitment from beijing to buy more u s products and a series of promises to resolve other concerns the deal with china is a massive deal mr trump said at an event about deregulation at the white house last week adding no i m not a globalist mr navarro declined to comment on the events of the meeting what happens in the oval should stay in the oval both for the sanctity and security of the internal discussions and for the good of the country mr navarro said for three years mr navarro 70 has been mr trump s trade warrior pushing the president to rip up trade deals and rewrite them so they are more favorable to american workers an academic with little previous government or business experience mr navarro has managed to exert enormous influence over u s trade policy by tapping into the president s disdain for globalization and encouraging his view that china has been robbing us blind china specialists tend to view mr navarro warily he does not speak mandarin and had visited the country only once before travelling there in 2018 as part of a white house delegation some scholars sneered in october when it emerged that mr navarro had taken creative licence to quote a fictitious source ron vara in several of his non academic books even his own colleagues have chafed at his aggressive approach to china and have at times tried to block mr navarro s access to the president still mr navarro s thinking has become deeply influential even those who disagree with him on economic policy and china increasingly tend to credit him for having guided the political debate for all the criticism he gets from the free trade wing of the republican party he was one of the first people to ring the alarm on china years ago said stephen moore a heritage foundation economist who also advised mr trump s 2016 campaign now i think more people including myself look at china s trade policies as really predatory and economically harmful with mr trump moving to ease tensions with his favorite geopolitical foil and with trade deals with canada mexico japan and south korea now complete mr navarro is at a something of a crossroads a trade warrior looking for a new fight mr navarro has embraced under the radar projects aimed at curbing china s economic power including efforts to increase inspections of chinese packages at the ports and renegotiating chinese postal fees and many china hawks believe that government s long history of shirking economic pledges will ultimately vindicate his distrust of an agreement that does little to alter china s behaviour at home i would be very skeptical of any significant agreement being made said greg autry a professor at the university of southern california s marshall school of business and author with mr navarro of the book death by china if you ve spent any time watching the chinese they don t honour their agreements mr navarro s entry into mr trump s orbit was not exactly predictable a business professor at the university of california irvine mr navarro ran and lost five elections as a progressive democrat including unsuccessful bids for mayor of san diego and california s 49th congressional district as a candidate in the 1990s and 2000s mr navarro supported abortion rights gay rights environmental protection and higher taxes on the rich he even spoke at the 1996 democratic convention and campaigned that year with hillary clinton in his book san diego confidential mr navarro described clinton as one of the most gracious intelligent perceptive and yes classy women i have ever met it is such as dramatic change from how he portrayed himself when he was in the political field in san diego said doug case a former president of the san diego democratic club it looks like maybe his true colors have come out after his political career sputtered mr navarro continued teaching and writing books about business and investing but before long his attention turned to china and its trade practices which many left leaning democrats including labour leaders believed were killing u s jobs mr navarro s skepticism first emerged in the 1970s while he was a peace corps volunteer building and repairing fish ponds in thailand he travelled extensively in asia and said he observed the negative effect china was having on the economies of its neighbours he became increasingly critical of how china s trade practices were affecting the u s after its admission to the world trade organization in 2001 particularly as many of his business students complained of losing their jobs as a result of chinese competition mr navarro s views soon hardened and he began publishing a series of anti china screeds including the coming china wars which mr trump in 2011 listed as one of his favourite books about china and death by china in that book and the accompanying documentary mr navarro and prof autry excoriated china for unscrupulous economic practices and manufacturing deadly products such as flammable toddler overalls and fake viagra they also faulted multinational companies such as walmart for using china to source cheap goods that were putting u s manufacturers out of business mr navarro s views caught the attention of then candidate mr trump who shared similar opinions about china s effect on u s manufacturing and was seeking experts with unconventional views that matched his own mr navarro joined the campaign as an economic adviser in 2016 and quickly gained the trust of mr trump who refers to mr navarro as my tough guy on china my whole philosophy in life and in this job is the gretzky perspective skate to where the puck is going to be anticipate problems that the president is going to want to solve and get on them mr navarro said in an interview early on in mr trump s term mr navarro s influence was not assured mr navarro joined the white house with multiple trade actions written and ready for the president s signature including a directive to begin withdrawing the u s from the north american free trade agreement or shafta as mr navarro liked to call nafta but opposition from other advisers including gary cohn the former head of the national economic council stayed the president s hand for months it seemed as if mr cohn and his allies had succeeded in muzzling mr navarro blocking at least three attempts to trigger the nafta withdrawal process as well as an earlier directive to impose steel tariffs and withdraw from a south korea trade agreement but as mr trump s signature tax cut neared fruition in late 2017 the president grew more anxious to translate his trade promises into policy where are my tariffs bring me my tariffs the president would say and call in his advisers to debate trade policy in front of him mr navarro sometimes joined by commerce secretary wilbur ross would recommend tariffs arguing they would protect domestic industries demonstrate the president was serious about reversing lopsided trade agreements and raise revenue mr cohn treasury secretary steven mnuchin and former staff secretary rob porter regularly rebutted those arguments saying tariffs would harm businesses the stock market and the president s re election chances to help buttress his case mr navarro developed a red black and yellow chart outlining china s acts policies practices of economic aggression including cyberespionage and theft of u s intellectual property mr navarro warned mr trump that china had long promised and failed to alter its behaviour and said tariffs were the most effective way to force beijing to change by 2018 mr trump was ready to pounce and mr navarro s vision of confronting china became reality an initial 25 per cent tax on us 34 billion of chinese goods in july 2018 quickly escalated to tariffs on us 360 billion of products with a threat to tax nearly every chinese product the economic pressure brought beijing to the negotiating table but mr trump ultimately backed down agreeing to a phase 1 trade deal that would reduce some tariffs and remove the threat of additional levies in exchange for china buying more farm goods and giving u s companies more access to the chinese market almost none of the big structural changes that mr navarro had pushed for were included mr trump has said those will be addressed in future talks with china and many of the tariffs mr navarro recommended will stay in place mr navarro has found other ways to counter china earlier this year he waged a successful offensive against a global postal treaty that had allowed chinese businesses to ship international packages at much cheaper rates than the u s he has helped step up inspections of chinese packages to crack down on online counterfeiting and gotten involved with a project to revive u s shipyards earlier this year when executives at crowley maritime told mr navarro that the u s navy was in the process of procuring a transport ship from china that would be modified to u s specifications mr navarro personally intervened to scuttle the bid he has come to view his office as akin to a special forces unit within the federal bureaucracy with a small office i learned early that the real power of being at the white house and the real effectiveness stems from leverage on any given day one or more government agencies are helping with this office s mission he said you don t need to be a big bloated bureaucracy all you need be is lean and flat and nimble enough to harness agency resources for the president and his agenda

second quarter but a sharp deceleration from 3 1 percent in the first quarter according to the u s commerce department in mid october the fed also announced that it would begin expanding its balance sheet by buying about 60 billion u s dollars a month in treasury bills in an attempt to provide more accommodation to the economy it partly reversed the process of shrinking the fed s balance sheet which started since october 2017 but powell emphasized that the action differed from the bond buying program or quantitative easing qe that the central bank deployed during the financial crisis because it was intended to facilitate short term lending to help control its benchmark interest rate mid cycle adjustment powell has characterized the recent rate cuts as a mid cycle adjustment similar to the adjustments the fed had made in 1995 and 1998 as opposed to the beginning of a prolonged easing cycle during both periods in 1995 and 1998 the fed also slashed rates three times a total of 75 basis points to prevent an economic downturn and sustain the expansion before raising rates again but there are still key differences particularly around inflation between now and those two periods in the 1990s according to powell inflation is barely moving up notwithstanding that unemployment is at 50 year lows and expected to remain there so the need for rate increases is less powell told reporters at a press conference in december i think we ve learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation he said the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce the fed s favorite inflation indicator increased 1 5 percent over the 12 months through november still below the central bank s target of 2 percent the threshold to raise rates is still much higher than the threshold to cut rates going forward powell made it clear that he would need to see a sustained period of inflation before he raises rates said diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton a major accounting firm steady rates in 2020 the median estimate for the federal funds rate is at 1 6 percent at the end of 2020 suggesting no rate cuts or hikes in 2020 according to fed officials interest rate forecasts released in december this reinforces our view that with the 2020 elections approaching the fed will keep interest rates on hold said joseph brusuelas chief economist with rsm us llp an audit tax and consulting firm in short the fed thinks it can err on the side of caution and has room to maneuver should the trade war intensify or if there is an exogenous shock to the economy he added tiffany wilding an economist at pimco a global investment management firm believed that positive signs in the u s economy since the rate cut in october seem to have increased the fed s confidence that its mid cycle adjustment has helped engineer a soft landing and that further cuts are unnecessary eric rosengren president of the federal reserve bank of boston also said last week that he didn t see a reason for the central bank to change interest rate policy as the u s economy is currently well positioned for the coming year given that monetary policy works with lags and federal reserve policymakers have already eased monetary policy three times in 2019 my view is that it is appropriate to take a patient approach to considering any policy changes unless there is a material change to the outlook he said but swonk bet that persistently low inflation could force the fed to cut rates at least once again in 2020 meanwhile u s president donald trump has repeatedly pressured the fed to lower interest rates to boost economic growth would be sooo great if the fed would further lower interest rates and quantitative ease the dollar is very strong against other currencies and there is almost no inflation this is the time to do it trump tweeted last week
this post is also available in spanish german joseph stiglitz is an american economist who received the nobel prize in economics in 2001 he is a former senior vice president and chief economist of the world bank in recent years he has been a harsh critic of globalised neoliberalism which he calls free market fundamentalism and of international institutions such as the international monetary fund and the world bank not bad for a system insider his unmissable recent piece on this subject published by the guardian describes in no uncertain terms how decades of free market orthodoxy have taken a toll on democracy after 40 years of neoliberalism the verdict is in the fruits of growth went to the few at the top the credibility of neoliberalism s faith in unfettered markets as the surest road to shared prosperity is on life support these days and well it should be the simultaneous waning of confidence in neoliberalism and in democracy is no coincidence or mere correlation neoliberalism has undermined democracy for 40 years the form of globalisation prescribed by neoliberalism left individuals and entire societies unable to control an important part of their own destiny as dani rodrik of harvard university has explained so clearly and as i argue in my recent books globalization and its discontents revisited and people power and profits the effects of capital market liberalisation were particularly odious if a leading presidential candidate in an emerging market lost favour with wall street the banks would pull their money out of the country voters then faced a stark choice give in to wall street or face a severe financial crisis it was as if wall street had more political power than the country s citizens even in rich countries ordinary citizens were told you can t pursue the policies you want whether adequate social protection decent wages progressive taxation or a well regulated financial system because the country will lose competitiveness jobs will disappear and you will suffer now he has given his blessing to the choice of economy minister by the new argentinian government headed by alberto fernandez acknowledging the disastrous macri government imf interaction he writes argentina chooses right man at right time to reignite the economy martín guzmán is a leading expert on sovereign debt and the problems it can cause when the former president mauricio macri took office his economic team openly admitted that while they had inherited many problems they started with one major advantage a low level of debt they gambled on a set of policies making for instance untimely and unnecessarily large cuts in export taxes paying off old defaulted debt to so called vulture funds with unconscionably high returns and taking on new high interest long term dollar denominated debt all in the hope that market friendly signals would lead to a rush of growth spurring foreign investment even at the time i thought it was a foolhardy gamble the rest is history it didn t work out and as matters went from bad to worse macri compounded the mistakes more borrowing including a 57bn programme with the international monetary fund austerity misguided sterilisation efforts to prevent inflation which built up a debt overhang the worst of all possible worlds was soon at hand more inflation reaching almost 60 in the current year higher unemployment already at double digits and rising and the re imposition of the exchange controls the removal of which macri had lauded at the outset of his administration as the cornerstone of his economic policy as fernández has put it one doesn t solve a problem of excessive debt by taking on more debt as a result fernández inherits a far worse economic situation than macri confronted higher inflation higher unemployment and now a debt beyond argentina s ability to service doubling down on a failed policy will not work nor will returning to what preceded it that is why it is so important that fernández has appointed a knowledgeable brilliant economist who combines youthful energy with a wisdom well beyond his 37 years stiglitz is less vocal about the way most of the money lent to the macri government went not to treat the country s structural problems but to the usual corrupt members of the administration and many international investors taking advantage of now well established bizarre high returns which have dominated argentina s economy for many years but his positive view of the new economy minister who he knows personally and has worked with opens interesting possibilities of solid advice it is not a matter of idealising the new government problems may arise from its mixed bag of new appointees as shown before and the old enemies the right wing media and us foreign policies towards progressive latin american governments will no doubt reappear with renewed energy but let s hope that stiglitz and co if they are prepared to give a hand realise that the boom bust cycles of the country are not accidents but a well planned strategy on a country that has been proven able to recover from each crisis of stolen wealth and has produced more wealth during progressive governments at which point the kleptocrats ready themselves for another cycle of stealing and dehumanising social policies how to break this cycle will need both a good local strategy and some international support

u s media bias creates false pictures of russia by moon of alabama december 24 2019 information clearing house the latest putin bashing piece in the new york times is headlined it s putin s world we just live in it its economy is sputtering and its young are frustrated but with america and europe in tumult russia and its leader of two decades are on a roll its first sentence already includes two falsehoods its economy already smaller than italy s may be sputtering but two decades after a virtually unknown former k g b spy took power in the kremlin on dec 31 1999 russia and its president vladimir v putin have just had what could be their best year yet bigger the nyt can claim that russia s gdp is smaller than italy s because it only looked at the nominal gross domestic product gdp of those countries but nominal gdp like nominal wages are not meaningful comparisons the question is how much can be bought for each nominal unit andrei martyanov has recently looked at two quite comparable houses one near moscow and one near washington dc the russian house costs some 93 000 while the u s one is offered for 440 000 so let us calculate gdp created by building these two houses in russia and in us right as you may have guessed it already the united states created 4 5 times more gdp than russia by building comparable house in a place which let s be frank is not exactly moscow mind you that russia builds all kinds of real estate from apartments to houses like there is no tomorrow here is how ppp purchase power parity gdp works or rather confuses most western think tank free loaders who do not understand that most of what they know about the world outside is a baloney or a caricature like the fact that china s real middle class which has incomes comparable to that of the average us income is larger than the whole population of the united states that is a good hint now can you scale down or scale up russia s and american economies difficult still but it shows you at least what all those proverbial 22 trillion of the us gdp are worth not as much as you may have thought before nor is the argument that russians do not earn as much entirely valid yes many russians do not earn as much and that is ongoing problem but say r60 000 which roughly converts into 965 gets you pretty comfortable living practically everywhere in russia bar some places like moscow or sochi especially if you own you apartment very many russians do and by own i mean own not paying mortgage there is a lot of what is going into those economic considerations but it has to be understood today that nominal numbers in usd are absolutely meaningless and in fact dangerous because they create a false sense of confidence the gdp of russia by purchase power parity is 4 349 423 m are you tired of the lies and non stop propaganda get your free daily newsletter the gdp of italy by purchase power parity is 2 442 768 m so it surely does not look as if russia s economy is already smaller than italy s corrected by purchase power russia s official gdp ppp is about as big as germany s but even that comparison is skewed russia s official gdp is chronically underestimated as the country has a large unofficial economy it is estimated that 20 30 of all work in russia is done in exchange for cash and is never officially registered or taxed when one considers that russia currently has no noticeable population growth its economy growth is still fine it slowed down this year but it is certainly not sputtering economic growth in russia will be higher than expected in 2019 and is likely to pick up in the next few years thanks partly to higher state spending and looser monetary policy the world bank said on wednesday the world bank in a regular report on the russian economy said it expected gross domestic product to expand by 1 2 this year up from the 1 0 it projected in october in 2018 russian gdp grew by 2 3 in 2020 russian gdp is seen at 1 6 and in 2021 1 8 versus 1 7 and 1 8 respectively projected in october the world bank said unlike the fed and european central banks which have pushed interest rates to zero to create artificial growth in unproductive financial markets the russian central bank held back and still has lots of ammunition left and the russian federation has a very sound budget and little debt should a growth spurt be needed russia still has unlike others the economic ammunition to provide it a less restrictive monetary policy and increased spending on the national projects is expected to help foster growth renaud seligmann world bank country director in the russian federation said in the report the central bank will next meet on interest rates on dec 13 where it may consider cutting the key rate now at 6 5 for the fifth time so far in 2019 the rest of the nyt piece is not any better than its very first paragraph it simply repeats false stereotypes about putin as an autocratic leader or about the non existing russian influence on u s elections nearly thirty years ago when the soviet union broke apart russia had a deep fall the liberalization of its economy had catastrophic consequences but it has since reformed itself it is now back to its traditional position in the world a large eurasian power which is in nearly all aspects independent from the rest of the world and able to protect itself it must therefore be taken into account when one thinks of global polices that is simply a fact and not the effect of a mindgame that russia allegedly plays with the west that the u s still has problems to understand that is not russia s fault but the result of the skewed descriptions of it this article was originally published by moon of alabama do you agree or disagree post your comment here

despite political unrest and criticism from trading partners turkey continues to draw foreign direct investment can fdi help it return to economic expansion going by the numbers economic matters are looking up for turkey second quarter performance came in better than anticipated prompting two leading forecasters to bump up their growth forecasts for the year fitch now anticipates the economy will contract just 0 3 in 2019 versus the 1 1 contraction it had earlier penciled in and the european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd predicts a decline of just 0 2 both anticipate growth over the next two years credit growth fiscal stimulus and rising consumer confidence will propel the economy next year the ebrd says in its latest annual forecast suggesting gdp will rise 3 1 in 2020 and 3 6 the following year good news on the inflation front has also helped though some doubt official turkish statistics and others anticipate a rise in inflation in coming months the headline number fell to 8 6 in october sparking predictions that the benchmark interest rate trimmed three times since hitting 24 last fall to less than 14 in october will drop to 12 5 by january president recep tayyip erdoan wants to see rates in the single digits as soon as possible to further kick start the economy yet if this is a recovery it s starting from a most difficult place for investors even the more optimistic forecasts concede that the economy is contracting this year meanwhile growing authoritarianism is undermining democratic institutions and the army s incursion into northern syria to push back kurdish fighters has upset a tenuous balance of power in turkey s war torn neighbor but the threat of new us sanctions lifted following erdoan s recent visit to washington and an agreement between ankara and moscow to jointly patrol the buffer zone adjacent to turkey s border with syria and while individual members of the ruling justice and development party may face sanctions and there remains a threat hanging over turkish state owned bank halkbank over its alleged violation of sanctions on iran the wider danger to turkey s economy seems to have eased one indisputable positive for turkey has been foreign direct investment fdi the latest global investment report by unctad released last summer found that fdi into turkey last year rose by 13 at a time when global fdi battered by geopolitical fears fell by the same amount in 2018 turkey signed some 40 international investment agreements more than any other country and became the largest recipient of fdi in west asia this year fdi had increased 6 3 to 12 4 billion as of late october led by companies from azerbaijan qatar and the uk this suggests that many investors are discounting present realities and instead taking the long view based on turkey s strategic location its young and generally well educated workforce and its considerable potential as it moves hopefully out of the middle income trap and toward a high value added economy turkey s location at the crossroads of europe central asia and the middle east provides easy access to european middle eastern north african central asian and gulf markets says arda ermut president of turkey s investment office these markets comprise more than 1 5 billion people and account for a total gdp of 24 trillion more than half of the world s trade takes place within a four hour flight radius of turkey a key reason why multinational companies have chosen turkey as a strategic regional hub for their operations much of turkish fdi is in the form of joint ventures with large turkish conglomerates such as sabanci and prioritizes moving the economy toward more knowledge based value added investments says arvid tuerkner managing director for turkey at the ebrd although the picture is uneven at present the longer term prospects are positive he says i m sure turkish fdi will overcome this current difficult phase he predicts we are seeing strong companies in turkey who are investing not just our clients but elsewhere one such project is volkswagen s planned 1 4 billion investment in a new car plant in the western city of manisa expected to turn out 300 000 cars annually and create 5 000 jobs although a final decision about building the plant is still pending turkish officials hope that the cessation of hostilities in syria following the russian agreement will lead to a final go ahead vw would join ford honda toyota renault and mercedes which already have large automotive fdi projects underway in turkey other key investments this year include azerbaijani energy company socar s planned 600 million injection into the 6 3 billion star oil refinery which has the capacity to process 10 million tons of crude oil a year boosting turkey s long term energy security away from the headlines turkey has been working to create a friendly environment for foreign fdi it has consistently improved its position in the annual world bank doing business survey moving from 60th place out of 190 countries in 2017 to 43rd in 2018 and 33rd this year it has some 100 special economic zones the most outside east asia and the development and investment bank of turkey tkyb has announced plans to establish subfunds supporting development in key areas of the economy including technology venture capital machinery and agribusiness with assets of more than 3 billion tkyb has moved its headquarters from ankara to istanbul and says it will play an active role in helping meet the government s objectives for vision 2023 the list of goals erdoan announced to commemorate the centenary of the turkish republic in 2023 turkey is expected to become one of the world s top 10 economies with a gdp per capita of over 12 000 the main source of interest in fdi in turkey tuerkner says has been from companies looking to produce goods for export as recent devaluations of the lira make turkish exports more attractive the export orientated companies and sectors including the likes of the auto industry and white goods are still very attractive he says if turkey is to maintain its appeal however it will need to continue improving the business environment close observers say nagging deficiencies range from the general such as improving transparency and speeding up the judiciary process for resolving commercial disputes to the specific the ebrd has long prioritized green and renewables investments and half of its 11 5 12 7 billion billion invested in 300 projects in turkey promote the sustainable use of energy and resources but investment in renewables has been held back in part because of the regulatory environment needing to be fully clarified tuerkner says whether renewable or not the energy sector has been one of the most attractive for fdi ermut says fueled by rising domestic demand due to a growing population and recent years of healthy economic growth there has been a dramatic rise in total installed electricity generation capacity he says to satisfy increasing needs current capacity is expected to reach 110 gigawatts by 2023 through further investments to be commissioned by the private sector liberalization has bought about 18 billion of fdi to turkey s energy sector in the past decade he adds

washington when president trump gathered his top economic advisers at the white house to decide whether to make a deal with china peter navarro his hawkish trade adviser was ready with a flurry of arguments against the move a deal that removed any of mr trump s tariffs would make america look weak mr navarro argued at the meeting two weeks ago and he assailed those who endorsed the idea as globalists according to an administration official in the room it was a familiar argument for mr trump s top trade adviser who has spent the past three years fanning the president s protectionist instincts and encouraging him to embark on a punishing trade war with china mr navarro s dark warnings about china s ambitions and its threat to america have fueled mr trump s embrace of tariffs overcoming the objections of other senior advisers this time however mr trump was not persuaded with the 2020 election approaching mr trump dismissed mr navarro s concerns opting for an initial deal with china that would reduce some tariffs on chinese goods in exchange for a commitment from beijing to buy more american products and a series of promises to resolve other concerns
there were interesting memes on the millennium challenge corporation mcc agreement making rounds after the election one said when a pohottuwa supporter was asked what mcc was the answer had been maliban cream crackers as it was during the 2015 presidential election campaigns when colombo port city was flogged with no end the 480 million dollar mcc compact also flogged this presidential election as an american imperialist deal the wickremesinghegovernment had agreed to ven rathana thera gammanpila and weerawansa met with president sirisena to oppose the signing of the agreement addressing a media briefing on november 5 gammanpila said mcc was the most dangerous agreement sri lanka had ever come across immediately after the presidential election vasudeva nanayakkara said he would leave the government if mcc was inked and then said president gotabaya rajapaksa would not sign it later on december 10 gammanpila was quoted in the media as saying 70 of the mcc compact is beneficial and they are no fools to reject it merely because it comes from america and the memes started making rounds this government in a more constructive approach has appointed a four member committee to review the compact headed by professor lalithasiri gunaruwan the committee has met with pm rajapaksa to discuss concerns over the compact and its agreement as it now turns out the fate of mcc would not be any different to the hambantota port agreement president gotabaya rajapaksa has virtually accepted the hambantota port agreement as it is yet few issues should be paid attention to that were played out with political mischief during elections the social media warned about an econo military corridor linking colombo to trincomalee it was also said this special corridor would be managed by an american company and allow total exploitation of natural resources like graphite phosphate and ilmenite found abundantly within the corridor implied was the message this will lead to the once speculated sofa and free entry to us forces on the opposite side there was the complete whitewashing of mcc free market economists argued the mcc would provide for agricultural growth with new investments on technology and commercial farming for export markets potential growth in agriculture contribution to the country s gdp that now stands at around 7 with fisheries 1 2 and livestock 0 6 included understanding and reviewing the compact therefore need a wholly different and holistic approach beyond free market economics and nationalistic warnings fate of mcc will not be any different to h tota port agreement since wwii with the adoption of the bretton woods agreement in 1944 when gold as the monetary standard was replaced by us dollar tied to gold the us consolidated its position as a global superpower dollars were pumped into countries like england france germany and japan on the marshall plan for their war devastated reconstruction to open up trade and keep communism curbed that led to the cold war and led to their power conflicts taking hold of smaller countries like korea vietnam and afghanistan the cia backed coup in 1953 ousted the elected government of mohammad mosaddegh in iran and established shah pallavi as the dictatorial monarch giving usa overall control of iranian oil in the arab world and north africa the us interventions were decided on easy and cheap access to fuel reserves in 1963 there was the failed attempt in invading bay of pigs in an attempt to overthrow castro s government in cuba whatever the strategy overt or covert the us intervention has always prioritised us interests and foreign aid kept within that thus the mcc should be read along with trump s foreign policy and his us national security strategy 2017 nss trump calls his foreign policy an america first foreign policy in his nss under pillar 11 titled promote american prosperity in the section titled promote free fair and reciprocal economic relationships where priority actions are listed the first is adopt new trade and investment agreements and modernise existing ones on page 30 of nss 2017 it reads as the united states will pursue bilateral trade and investment agreements with countries that commit to fair and reciprocal trade and will modernise existing agreements to ensure they are consistent with those principles agreements must adhere to high standards in intellectual property digital trade agriculture labour and the environment emphasis added this is where the mcc falls in place with trump s nss 2017 this emphasis in the us nss 2017 should not be lost when reading the mcc agreement added is the fact that mcc is directly under the oval office the governing board of mcc is chaired by secretary of state as its ex officio member the other ex officio members of the governing board include secretary of the treasury who is deputy chair a representative of the trade department and administrator of usaid the us will have india as its proxy to counter chinese influence in the region the ceo and four others representing their mega private sector are appointed by the us senate as nominated by the president present ceo of mcc is sean cairncross former deputy assistant to president trump and an advisor to the chief of staff of white house that much for the independence of the mcc and where the mcc would stand on us interests what is also important is that trump has expanded the previous indian ocean security concept to indo pacific to include japan and australia in a bid to strengthen a coalition against china for sri lanka what has to be recognised in this nss is the importance india receives the us has now established a new bilateral dialogue with india called the 2 2 meeting between us secretary of state and secretary of defence and their counterparts the second 2 2 meeting was held in washington ten days ago on december 18 during the joint media briefing after the meeting answering a journalist indian foreign affairs minister dr jaishankar said they discussed in detail issues related to south asia and sri lankatoo that perhaps implies the us would have india as its proxy to counter chinese influence in this region the us has been setting about it for a few years now in october this year at the time of the ninth meeting of the india us defence technologies and trade initiative dtti held in new delhi pentagon announced bilateral defence trade between the two countries would reach 18 billion us dollars by year end under secretary ms ellen m lord who co chaired the meeting told media us granted india strategic trade authority tier 1 status in august this year that makes india equal to nato allies japan south korea and australia in such geopolitical context the mcc directly controlled by trump s administration offers sri lanka 480 million us dollar compact with two projects one on land 67 million and the other on transport 350 million with 63 million dollars for administration research and logistics of the two though the transport project is dollar wise larger the land project is more important and for good market reasons of the total agricultural land 63 of state owned land is on deeds that retain legal ownership with the state in a rural society that had not been adequately developed since independence agriculture continues to depend on subsidies and agri loans there would not be paddy cultivation in sri lanka other than as a cultural habit if fertiliser subsidy and agri loans were removed over 7 million that depend on paddy farming remain underemployed agri labour except during the maha season the census department statistics show 83 in paddy farming during 2018 2019 maha season were small parcelled landholders and the majority are with untitled deeds another 10 are ande farmers although all are not samurdi recipients all are poor and uprooted rural labour with no proper and regular incomes thus the exodus from villages in search of a living income women end up as domestics in the middle east or sweat shop factories men try their hands on anything possible all that has led to the most exploitative labour contractors called manpower agencies a very lucrative trade this background justifies the demand to provide titles to swarnabhoomi jayabhoomi and isurubhoomi land deeds and turn them into a commodity in the market social media warn about econo military corridor linking colombo to trinco this project will help the government identify underutilised state land that can be put to more productive use and maximise rents from lands that the government leases it would also increase tenure security and tradability of land for smallholders women and firms by digitising deed records is how the land project is described in the project document in a heavily pauperised agri society left in a free market economy this tradability of the land is for big investors for more productive use what these big investors would turn these farmlands into will be their choice and would depend solely on profits that can be anything from african oil palm cultivation to crocodile farming for leather transport project for improving infrastructure is only an essential component for big time commercial farming people will no doubt use them but no government will be able to negotiate the transport project without the land project for a government that knows only free market economics the land project is also a must how the gunaruwan committee would review the mcc agreement will be interesting will they propose safety clauses and on what will be an interesting discussion the committee would take us to the new year 2020 with mcc i would leave the mcc discussion and the new year 2020 to others wishing all dm readers a new year with good things happening as they want

you are here washington dec 25 xinhua after four rate hikes in 2018 the u s federal reserve cut interest rates three times in 2019 making a remarkable and sharp u turn in its monetary policy the big shift reflected that fed officials assessment of potential risks to the u s economy has dramatically changed over the course of the year due to slowing global growth rising trade tensions and muted inflation pressures fed officials seemed confident that the three insurance rate cuts in 2019 have helped engineer a soft landing of the economy barring a material change in the economic outlook they plan to hold rates steady through 2020 policy u turn a year ago the fed raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent the fourth rate hike in 2018 and the ninth such move since late 2015 when the central bank started the process of monetary policy normalization meanwhile fed officials anticipated that they need to raise interest rates at least twice in 2019 to slow the economy and keep inflation from spiking toward the end of 2018 there was still a sense the economy was growing at around 3 percent fed chairman jerome powell recalled at a press conference earlier this month we took steps to make it rates less accommodative and that seemed to be the right thing however prompted by rising risks to u s growth in the months ahead the fed shifted its stance at the beginning of 2019 pledging to be patient about future rate hikes in march the fed signaled no rate hikes in 2019 and announced plans to conclude shrinking the balance sheet in september taking another step to avoid overtightening monetary policy in july the fed lowered interest rates for the first time in more than a decade amid rising concerns over trade tensions a slowing global economy and muted inflation pressures after the u s bond market in august sent warning signs of a possible economic recession the fed cut rates again in september and october these policy adjustments put the current federal funds rate target range at 1 5 percent to 1 75 percent i don t think anybody saw it coming the challenges that we faced this year i think they were a surprise powell said adding that weaker global growth and persistent trade tensions weighed on the u s economy as the year progressed we adjusted the stance of monetary policy to cushion the economy from these developments and to provide some insurance against the associated risks he said the u s economy expanded at an annual rate of 2 1 percent in the third quarter of 2019 slightly up from the 2 percent growth rate in the second quarter but a sharp deceleration from 3 1 percent in the first quarter according to the u s commerce department in mid october the fed also announced that it would begin expanding its balance sheet by buying about 60 billion u s dollars a month in treasury bills in an attempt to provide more accommodation to the economy it partly reversed the process of shrinking the fed s balance sheet which started since october 2017 but powell emphasized that the action differed from the bond buying program or quantitative easing qe that the central bank deployed during the financial crisis because it was intended to facilitate short term lending to help control its benchmark interest rate mid cycle adjustment powell has characterized the recent rate cuts as a mid cycle adjustment similar to the adjustments the fed had made in 1995 and 1998 as opposed to the beginning of a prolonged easing cycle during both periods in 1995 and 1998 the fed also slashed rates three times a total of 75 basis points to prevent an economic downturn and sustain the expansion before raising rates again but there are still key differences particularly around inflation between now and those two periods in the 1990s according to powell inflation is barely moving up notwithstanding that unemployment is at 50 year lows and expected to remain there so the need for rate increases is less powell told reporters at a press conference in december i think we ve learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation he said the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce the fed s favorite inflation indicator increased 1 5 percent over the 12 months through november still below the central bank s target of 2 percent the threshold to raise rates is still much higher than the threshold to cut rates going forward powell made it clear that he would need to see a sustained period of inflation before he raises rates said diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton a major accounting firm steady rates in 2020 the median estimate for the federal funds rate is at 1 6 percent at the end of 2020 suggesting no rate cuts or hikes in 2020 according to fed officials interest rate forecasts released in december this reinforces our view that with the 2020 elections approaching the fed will keep interest rates on hold said joseph brusuelas chief economist with rsm us llp an audit tax and consulting firm in short the fed thinks it can err on the side of caution and has room to maneuver should the trade war intensify or if there is an exogenous shock to the economy he added tiffany wilding an economist at pimco a global investment management firm believed that positive signs in the u s economy since the rate cut in october seem to have increased the fed s confidence that its mid cycle adjustment has helped engineer a soft landing and that further cuts are unnecessary eric rosengren president of the federal reserve bank of boston also said last week that he didn t see a reason for the central bank to change interest rate policy as the u s economy is currently well positioned for the coming year given that monetary policy works with lags and federal reserve policymakers have already eased monetary policy three times in 2019 my view is that it is appropriate to take a patient approach to considering any policy changes unless there is a material change to the outlook he said but swonk bet that persistently low inflation could force the fed to cut rates at least once again in 2020 meanwhile u s president donald trump has repeatedly pressured the fed to lower interest rates to boost economic growth would be sooo great if the fed would further lower interest rates and quantitative ease the dollar is very strong against other currencies and there is almost no inflation this is the time to do it trump tweeted last week enditem

editor s note mark zandi is chief economist of moody s analytics he was an advisor to john mccain s 2008 presidential campaign and supported hillary clinton in the 2016 presidential election the opinions expressed in this commentary are his own recession is a collective loss of faith in the economy investors businesses and consumers decide en masse to head for the bunker selling stocks and real estate cutting investments and jobs and pulling back on spending just over a year ago i predicted to cnn business that a recession in the united states was likely in 2020 of course i didn t know for sure what i did know is that the preconditions for recession were coming into place and that recession risks were rising this may sound incongruous with the unemployment rate hovering near a 50 year low of 3 5 and a record stock market there has also been better news on the trade front president trump recently called a truce in his trade war with china and the usmca trade agreement which will replace nafta is on track to become law indeed recession worries that were running high just a few months ago have abated but i wouldn t exhale while recession in 2020 has become less likely recession early in the next decade remains a serious threat most significantly the economy is growing slowly barely enough to generate the jobs needed to keep unemployment low the president promised that his large tax cuts to mostly big corporations and high income households would fuel sustainably stronger growth they haven t instead the nation is struggling with trillion dollar budget deficits and an increasingly heavy debt load if the economy were to slow any further for whatever reason then unemployment would begin to rise once unemployment increases even from low levels recession becomes more likely than not consumers immediately sense the weakening economy since it means fewer job openings smaller pay increases and no bonuses they become more cautious businesses see this and pull back further on their hiring they may even begin laying off workers unemployment rises more and a self reinforcing negative dynamic a recession takes hold this hasn t happened but it is prudent to be nervous that this vicious cycle could take hold despite trade progress with china there s still debilitating uncertainty created by president trump s trade war while businesses may now believe the president won t escalate the war before the 2020 election they remain unsure what he will do if reelected since his trade war has not solved the big problems we have with the chinese such as intellectual property protection cybersecurity and more access to their markets it is almost certain he will double down on his war should he win a second term the coming election certainly adds to the uncertainty president trump s economic policies are 180 degrees different from his democratic rivals who if elected will flip economic policy on its head at a minimum the trump tax cuts for higher income and wealthy households will likely expire as they are set to do after 2025 under current law foreign immigrants will be welcomed with open arms regulations on fossil fuel companies and banks will be revived and while a democratic president will take a hard stance in trade negotiations with china the tariff wars are unlikely to continue the differences in economic policy and perceptions about the economy are so stark that uncertainty over the election s outcome may have an outsized impact on consumer and business behavior historically elections have had no discernible impact on the economy the candidates policy views were similar enough that voters didn t feel compelled to change their spending and investing that may not be true this go round also there are some tried and true leading indicators of recession that are signaling danger dead ahead in my cnn business commentary over a year ago i said that if the yield curve were to invert meaning if short term interest rates rise above long term rates recession would be about a year off when global investors believe the economy is going to struggle that inflation will recede and that the federal reserve will cut interest rates they buy long term bonds and that pushes down long term rates if investor demand for bonds is so strong that long term rates fall below short term rates then a recession invariably ensues the curve inverted this past summer the next stop on the road to recession is a substantial sell off in the stock market stock investors dump stocks as they sniff out declining profits at the companies they are investing in yes investors are very upbeat as this year comes to an end but that can change very fast typically stock prices fall about six months before a downturn prior to the financial crisis stock prices were hitting records just three months before the severe downturn began my tongue in cheek prediction of a june 2020 recession will almost surely turn out to be wrong but i am certain that the risk of a recession will remain uncomfortably high next year as we face the prospects of a slowing growth and uncertain economic future

a dose of the free market president nicolás maduro is making tentative moves away from the socialist policies that once regulated the prices of basic goods heavily taxed imports and restricted the use of the u s dollar as a result the south american nation s economic free fall is beginning to decelerate the national inflation rate still the world s highest has slowed from a blistering 1 5 million last year to a relatively breezy annualized rate of 15 000 the changes might be temporary and amount largely to an economic band aid there are no signs for instance of a larger strategy to reverse the agricultural land grabs and company seizures that helped lay the groundwork for one of the worst economic implosions of modern times but as the new measures take hold once empty store shelves have overflowed this holiday season with beef chicken milk and bread albeit at prices so high that a significant segment of the population is actually worse off more moneyed venezuelans however are flocking to dozens of newly opened specialty stores including at least one fake walmart brimming with stacks of cheerios slabs of italian ham and crates of kirkland signature olive oils much of it bought and shipped in containers to venezuela from costco and other bulk retailers in miami maduro remains deadlocked in a political standoff with opposition leader juan guaidó and his backers in washington who have ratcheted up pressure to force his ouster but u s sanctions against venezuela do not appear to have crimped surging imports mostly because they prevent americans from doing business only with the government not private venezuelans the government had been unable to restart the economy any other way so it s doing what the people want by giving in to the free market said ricardo cusano president of fedecamaras venezuela s chamber of commerce the socialists are still in power he said but they have lost the ideological war plagued by hyperinflation and economic collapse depressed venezuelans dubbed last dec 25 the christmas without lights a day largely bereft of the traditional holiday bunting and toys for children but as the economy begins to show modest signs of life particularly in the relative bubble of caracas the capital there have been visible changes on the streets meager christmas markets opened to peddle baubles to a slightly more optimistic populace more holiday decorations popped up inside stores along with proprietors say more parents buying toys and clothing for children the capital is suffering its worst traffic jams in years as car owners with greater access to imported spare parts drag long out of commission vehicles back onto clogged roads the eased restrictions have made the holiday season merrier for a small minority of rich venezuelans many of whom live in mansions behind high walls in eastern caracas there were things you just couldn t get dishes you just couldn t make said pablo gianni manager of anonimo a lavish new caracas eatery that opened this month complete with a glass walled wine cellar stocked with shelves of four figure vintages of dom pérignon but now it s like legal contraband he said they re letting everything in the changes taking shape here are the product of a combination of factors for years the government strictly limited the use of the u s dollar long portrayed as an instrument of yanqui imperialism but last year the government freed the exchange rate and more broadly legalized dollar transactions it also eliminated massive import taxes on a host of goods but those measures have begun to work through the economy really only in recent months as the government has taken the further step of abandoning attempts to control retail prices stocks of bread chicken and beef that once sold for nearly nothing are now being sold at market rates at least partly normalizing farm production and sales through supply chains just as importantly there are simply far more dollars in the venezuelan economy now about 4 5 million venezuelans have fled starvation and poverty in recent years creating a global diaspora that collectively sent 3 5 billion in remittances this year more than triple the amount two years ago according to ecoanalitica a caracas based economic analysis firm in addition economists say the economy is awash in dollars from illegal mining drug trafficking and other illicit activities by some estimates there are three times as many dollars in circulation as bolivars creating a de facto dollarization of the economy that is stabilizing inflation last month even maduro seemed to hail the almighty dollar i don t see the process they call dollarization as bad he said in nationally televised comments it can aid the recovery of the productive areas of the country and the functioning of the economy across venezuela mechanics and electricians engineers and architects are increasingly charging in greenbacks more companies are supplementing their employees salaries with u s currency collectively economists say 60 to 70 of families here are now regularly receiving some dollars buying even some venezuelans of more modest means a merrier christmas this year last year was very hard for us there was practically no christmas yelitza mineros 33 said as she eyed the prices in dollars at a caracas toy store with her 7 year old son and 3 year old daughter her husband a mechanic began earning in dollars a few months ago she said giving them the extra money they needed to buy new clothes for their children her son rodrigo held up a spider man action figure with a big grin as she spoke this year we re doing better and we can get them their toys she said that gives me a lot of joy venezuela remains deeply mired in the worst economic crisis in modern latin american history years of chronic mismanagement and to a lesser extent u s sanctions including an oil embargo have severely damaged the lifeblood of the economy petroleum production venezuelans including residents of the relatively shielded capital are struggling with worsening gasoline shortages lingering blackouts and broken state hospitals and more food on store shelves doesn t mean everyone can eat in western caracas for instance a grocery store that last year sold price controlled products and suffered from shortages was now well now stocked with goods ranging from imported motorcycle helmets to diet coke but with two chicken thighs at 1 70 and butter at 2 in a nation with a minimum wage of 6 a month the aisles were mostly devoid of shoppers for the poorest venezuelans with no access to dollars life is harder mariutka oropeza a 54 year old woman who lives with her three adult children in a small apartment in eastern caracas has struggled to afford medicines and treatment for her arthritis hypertension and uterine cancer she was shocked recently to discover that one of her new prescriptions was going for 70 a box well out of reach for a family with a household income of 30 a month her family once survived by waiting in hours long lines for regulated goods but now that the government has stopped enforcing fixed prices a bag of cornmeal that once cost her 25 cents now costs four times that amount it s painful oropeza said people say oh we are doing a little better because many of them receive remittances from their families abroad but oh my god we are not doing better at all i remember when this government started ruling and called the dollar the big enemy look where they have brought us now she said the dollarization of the country what they re really doing is killing us
an america first economic policy specialist praised president donald trump s record on trade and the domestic economy while calling for more action to nurture american industry and protect it from chief mercantilist rival china alan tonelson who founded the public policy blog realitychek told the epoch times that trump s international economic policies have delivered on the promise of stemming the decline of american manufacturing certainly i think there has been a reshoring back to this country that would not have taken place without the so called trump trade wars and at least as importantly they seem to have stemmed continued offshoring tonelson said there do seem to be more and more companies that are more reluctant to send production overseas for fear that they will be hurt by u s tariffs somewhere down the road he added or they simply don t want to come into president trump s crosshairs while hailing the administration s policies on trade overall the policy expert called for bolder steps to nurture american industries although i ve been very pleased generally with the trump performance on trade i do think there s a lot more to do on what people would call the industrial policy front tonelson argued for an expanded federal role in developing technologies particularly those of strategic importance to the united states he said he would like to see the white house take bolder steps to break through the reluctance of republican lawmakers to move away from their hard ideological resistance to the idea that government can do anything right except possibly national defense president donald trump exits after speaking at a white house mental health summit in the south court auditorium of the eisenhower executive office building at the white house in washington on dec 19 2019 drew angerer getty images despite the hits u s manufacturing had taken pre trump it still generates nearly two thirds of all of the funding for research and development that s spent each year by the u s private sector so if you want the u s to remain a high tech economy it s very difficult to see how that happens or how that continues unless you maintain a strong domestic manufacturing base tonelson said the america firster added that he wished to see a mechanism that would condition trump s corporate tax cuts on capital investment in america noting that companies have used much of the tax relief for stock buy backs which doesn t increase or strengthen the american economy s productive base tonelson said trump s trade policy was driven by the notion that unless america seizes the historic opportunity to challenge china on unfair trade practices like technology theft the fight to save american manufacturing could be lost if you re still in a position where you re permitting your main trade rivals to subsidize your key industries out of existence or steal your intellectual property willy nilly or to extort that intellectual property once your companies start to expand overseas you re likely to go be going nowhere fast tonelson said a production line employee works at the ames companies shovel manufacturing factory in camp hill pennsylvania on june 29 2017 reuters tim aeppel america first versus made in china 2025 tonelson said the chinese communist party s hostile actions in the economic arena including cyber attacks and intellectual property theft represent the number one threat to american prosperity and security i m certainly concerned that a china at least under the kind of regime that s been ruling it since 1949 that kind of china grabbing the global technological lead could very greatly endanger american security and prosperity simply through all the various tools of cyber warfare that have been developed recently and that surely will continue to be developed he said the chinese have shown no reluctance to wage war along those lines he added policy experts argue that through its made in china 2025 policy which aims for global dominance in 10 key technological verticals including robotics and artificial intelligence the chinese regime seeks to displace the united states as the world s foremost superpower and harm its interests the goals of the plan are not only to put china at the top of the technology research and manufacturing food chain but in doing so destroy western competitors said epoch times contributor james gorrie at its core the chinese economy is founded on graft theft and horrific violence gorrie said from 1949 to 1979 china s economy was based on the state stealing the meager fruits from the labor of the chinese people and killing tens of millions of them in the process once china invited western companies to make goods there china s economy continued to steal from its own but expanded its scope of theft to stealing capital technology ip even whole manufacturing plants from western companies sen john cornyn r texas at the senate judiciary committee hearing on china s non traditional espionage against the united states the threat and potential policy responses in washington on dec 12 2018 jennifer zeng the epoch times tonelson pointed out that not only does china depend on stolen u s technology in its bid to take world center stage it also depends on american consumers to buy the products of chinese manufacturing this poses an ethical problem in its own right as labor in communist china isn t always voluntary and sometimes occurs with grave violation of human rights one example is the roughly one million uyghurs widely reported to have been incarcerated in a complex of detention centers and forced labor facilities in xinjiang another is the persecution of the falun gong spiritual movement some of whose members have been tortured to death in labor camps making products for export to western markets american leaders too acknowledge the threat posed by chinese economic hostility last year s report pdf concluding an investigation by the u s trade representative into claims of unfair chinese trade practices found that the regime had resorted to tactics like illegal subsidies that hurt american companies forced technology transfers cyber intrusions and intellectual property theft more recently at a congressional hearing called china s non traditional espionage against the united states the threat and potential policy responses judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley r iowa expounded on the communist threat when it comes to espionage fbi director wray has said there s no country that s even close to the people s republic of china grassley said at the dec 12 hearing general keith alexander called china s estimated gains from economic espionage of up to 600 billion the greatest transfer of wealth in history china is believed to be responsible for 50 to 80 percent of cross border intellectual property theft worldwide and over 90 percent of cyber enabled economic espionage in the united states reports issued this year by the white house office on trade and manufacturing the u s trade representative and odni all report detailed findings on china s role as a prime cyberattacker and thief of american intellectual property and technology sen charles grassley r iowa chair of the senate judiciary committee at the panel s hearing on china s non traditional espionage against the united states the threat and potential policy responses in washington on dec 12 2018 jennifer zeng the epoch times tonelson said he hopes trump will stay tough on china while he only rolled back a minor percentage of existing u s tariffs he did suspend his threat to impose tariffs on the remaining 160 billion dollars worth of chinese imports into the united states that had been coming in duty free so far and i thought it was exactly the wrong time to ease up on the chinese tonelson said tonelson argued that china is now more vulnerable and therefore likely to blink first in the trade war due to extremely high chinese debt to gdp ratio and dependence on dollars from export markets to buy commodities like oil that undergird china s economic growth china can t make up the shortfall by building more roads and bridges forever tonelson said of china s need for foreign currency adding that political tension was another vulnerability facing the chinese regime not only considering the growing economic problems that they ve been experiencing there s also a lot of political pressure that s been caused by the hong kong crisis tonelson said manufacturing is key if we re talking about manufacturing specifically i would point out that it s historically been the nation s leader in productivity growth tonelson said if you value productivity growth as you should then you should be very concerned that this sector has lost that lead one reason is that so much of its own most productive element has been either dumped out of existence or sent overseas tonelson has written books on free trade globalization and industrial decline in race to the bottom why a worldwide worker surplus and uncontrolled free trade are sinking american living standards he argued that around the time of china s accession to the world trade organization wto at the turn of the century the united states entered a no win global competition against low wage countries by leveraging weak workers rights and lax workplace safety standards countries like india and mexico but especially china won investment from the west causing wages and labor standards around the world to fall alan tonelson america first economic policy expert and author of the race to the bottom courtesy of alan tonelson he also argued that low wage competition hit many of america s highest wage industries like aerospace and software adding that the detrimental impact on u s manufacturing was not the result of free market forces of comparative advantage where countries naturally specialize in the production of certain goods i d say that relatively little of that comparative advantage has been the result of the free play of market forces tonelson said it s been created and continually distorted by foreign governments so if you really believe that free market capitalism is the way to go and that free market capitalism is the best bet for the entire world to maximize prosperity efficiency technological progress and so on then you should be very concerned that subsidization of key industries is so prevalent everywhere the trade policy critics especially of the america first stripe were very concerned during the pre trump years that the then ongoing failure of u s presidents and u s congresses to push back adequately against trade predation not only by china but by japan germany and virtually every other national economy you could think of genuinely threatened to turn american domestic manufacturing into what you might call a second class global citizen tonelson said workers sort parts at an electronics company in tengzhou in china s eastern shandong province on feb 1 2016 str afp getty images he added that america firsters were never convinced that the united states could maintain satisfactory levels of prosperity national security and sovereignty without a strong manufacturing base while tonelson praised trump s trade policies arguing that we have seen some signs of some of those damaging trends reversing themselves he acknowledged that the progress certainly hasn t come as fast as i would like to see tonelson blamed the slower than hoped for reversal of the decline of u s manufacturing on trump s need to secure republican backing in the face of threats to his presidency in trump s defense he was hamstrung during his first two years in office by his clear conclusion that he couldn t buck republican orthodoxy too many times because he needed republican support to prevent impeachment tonelson said you can say he still faces that threat but his position in grassroots republican ranks is so overwhelmingly strong now that he doesn t have to worry so much what is america first economic nationalism tonelson who has lectured widely on u s trade and broader economic policies for 30 years told the epoch times that at its core the america first school of economic nationalism prioritizes ensuring america s wealth and security before seeking to manage global affairs the main idea is to enhance american security prosperity economic competitiveness and also political independence by capitalizing on this country s unique ability to thrive independent of global conditions he explained the economic nationalist school of thought was the dominant u s approach to foreign economic policy for the first roughly 60 percent of the country s history through the mid 1930s it was replaced starting with pearl harbor by what is now called globalism and what in pre trump days used to be called internationalism tonelson said he added that what replaced economic nationalism was the idea that the united states could only achieve adequate levels of security prosperity and independence by fostering great improvements in the global economy and global security conditions tonelson said america firsters seek to turn on its head the notion that the united states should sacrifice economically and expose itself to threats like a nuclear attack in an effort to steer global conditions in a certain direction and that america should instead focus on managing its domestic circumstances over which it has far more control we re certainly strongly opposed to what s been the clear internationalist practice for decades before trump of regularly sacrificing big portions of the country s economic base for the sake of maintaining smooth alliance relations for the sake of maintaining that global economic order in fact we see that globalist internationalist approach as a great way to expose the united states needlessly to various dangers and various vulnerabilities the america first approach is that in tonelson s telling the united states is not likely to be capable enough of steering global affairs in a favorable enough direction to serve as an anchor of its national security but it is more than amply strong and wealthy and wise enough to figure out how to prosper whatever happens outside its borders the america first strategy depends in the last analysis on the country trying to control what it can plausibly control he said which is to say developments and events inside its own borders rather than trying to control what clearly is at least much harder to control and that is development and events outside its own borders i do think that trump deserves tremendous credit for opening the american political system s eyes to a fundamentally new way to achieve critical economic and also national security goals tonelson added and my hope is simply that if he does get re elected that the focus becomes sharper that the implementation becomes more consistent

brief ceasefire seems imminent in donald trump s trade war on the world the united states and china may sign a deal as early as next month but make no mistake the protectionist impulse behind the trade war remains as ineradicable as ever nor should it be forgotten that economic nationalism has guided the destiny of all major nations since the 19th century according to the ideological prejudices of the present built up over nearly four decades of globalization free trade and deregulation represent the natural order of things history however tells us that the united states was a

agriculture we lead all nations in mining we lead all nations in manufacturing these are the trophies which we bring after twenty nine years of a protective tariff the argument for economic nationalism against a manufacturing giant such as britain was simple british free traders claimed that their ideology was best placed to bring prosperity and peace to the world their critics in countries less economically advanced than britain such as germany s friedrich list the 19th century s most influential economic theorist argued that free trade could only be a goal rather than the starting point of modern development economic self strengthening for nations required that they protect their nascent industry until it becomes internationally competitive notwithstanding britain s rhetoric which periodicals like the economist amplified it had arrived at free trade after a successful policy of tariffs it also used military power to acquire foreign markets for its surplus goods

japan nurtured domestic manufactures while trying to shield them from foreign competition even britain following its settler colonies australia canada and south africa came to abandon free trade by 1932 the united states protectionism peaked with the infamous smoot hawley tariff act of 1930 the u s moved swiftly to embrace free trade after the second world war only because its manufacturing industries dominant over the world s war ravaged economies needed access to international markets even then the cold war s military and diplomatic urgencies turned the united states into an unlikely protector of japan s manufacturing industries as they were rebuilt into world beaters trade practices of the kind deemed unfair by trump today ranging from loans and subsidies to national conglomerates and restriction of imports were key to the rise of not only japan but also such east asian tigers as south korea and taiwan advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has

lived experiment with trade liberalization which resulted in a 53 billion trade deficit with china india today has retreated into its old protectionist crouch it is hard to see what else it can do the rise of china as a manufacturing powerhouse has made even the united states renounce the posture of international co operation it assumed after the second world war the multilateral institutions such as the world trade organization that the u s helped set up no longer seem to serve its purposes moreover the argument first widely heard in the u s during the debate over nafta in the 1990s that free trade enriches the wealthy at the expense of the poor and the middle class not to mention the environment has become politically much more potent it is clear today that the advocates of free trade ignored for too long the volatile political problems rising from wage stagnation and income inequality upholding the economic law of comparative advantage they also managed to downplay the higher law that governs international economic relations might is right advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content following the british imperialism of free trade powerful countries have consistently practiced what they denounce in others for instance the united states while insisting that other countries reduce state

called in the 19th century by an industrializing america against britain lies exposed yet again as china aspires to be the 21st century s new hegemon free trade turns out to be something that helps a rising great power until it doesn t and which most countries claim to practice while trying to subvert its principles as much as possible trump s trade wars are of course dangerously reckless in a

this hour originally aired nov 13 2019 tackling today s trickiest global challenges with the winners of the nobel prize in economics esther duflo and abhijit banerjee guests esther duflo professor of poverty alleviation and development economics at mit winner of the 2019 nobel memorial prize in economic sciences co founder of abdul latif jameel poverty action lab co author of good economics for hard times abhijit banerjee ford foundation international professor of economics at mit winner of the 2019 nobel memorial prize in economic sciences co founder of abdul latif jameel poverty action lab co author of good economics for hard times what is it that we get wrong about our understanding of the major drivers of migration conventional economic wisdom says were the barriers to migration lower the u s would be immediately flooded with migrants following a gradient of wages because wages and incomes are higher in the u s than in say latin america that is actually wrong esther duflo says that is one way to understand that it is just wrong to look at internal migration where there are no such barriers and we can see that people just don t move really in very large numbers from rural areas to towns in developing countries from cities and towns affected by trade shocks in the u s to other cities and towns where there might be jobs hear her explain more in the video below from the reading list excerpt from good economics for hard times by esther duflo and abhijit banerjee what undermines trust in economists a part of the answer is that there is plenty of bad economics around those who represent the economists in the public discourse are not usually the same academic economists who are part of the panel convened by the booth school of business at the university of chicago to answer questions on core economic topics the self proclaimed economists on tv and in the press chief economist of bank x or firm y are with important exceptions primarily spokespersons for their firms economic interests who often feel free to ignore the weight of the evidence moreover they have a relatively predictable slant toward market optimism at all costs which is what the public associates with economists in general unfortunately in terms of how they look suit and tie or the way they sound lots of jargon the talking heads are hard to tell apart from academic economists the most important difference is perhaps in their willingness to pronounce and predict which unfortunately makes them all the more authoritative but they actually do a pretty poor job of predicting in part because predictions are often well nigh impossible which is why most academic economists stay away from futurology one of the jobs of the international monetary fund imf is to forecast the rate of growth of the world economy in the near future without a whole lot of success one might add despite its team of many very well trained economists the economist magazine once computed just how far the imf s forecasts were off on average over the period 2000 2014 12 for two years from the time of prediction say the growth rate in 2014 predicted in 2012 the average forecast error was 2 8 percentage points that s somewhat better than if they had chosen a random number between 2 percent and 10 percent every year but about as bad as just assuming a constant growth rate of 4 percent we suspect these kinds of things contribute substantially to the general skepticism of economics another big factor that contributes to the trust gap is that academic economists hardly ever take the time to explain the often complex reasoning behind their more nuanced conclusions how did they parse through the many possible alternative interpretations of the evidence what were the dots often from different domains they had to connect to reach the most plausible answer how plausible is it is it worth acting upon or should we wait and see today s media culture does not naturally allow a space for subtle or long winded explanations both of us have had to wrangle with tv anchors to tell our full story often to have it edited out of what gets shown so we recognize why academic economists are often unwilling to take on the responsibility of speaking out it takes a lot of effort to be heard properly and there is always the risk of sounding half baked or having one s careful words manipulated to mean something quite different there are of course those who do speak out but they tend to be with important exceptions those with the strongest opinions and the least patience for engaging with the best work in modern economics some too beholden to some orthodoxy to pay attention to any fact that does not square with it repeat old ideas like a mantra even though they have long been disproved others are there to pour scorn on mainstream economics which it may sometimes deserve but that often means they are unlikely to speak for today s best economic research our sense is that the best economics is frequently the least strident the world is a sufficiently complicated and uncertain place that the most valuable thing economists have to share is often not their conclusion but the path they took to reach it the facts they knew the way they interpreted those facts the deductive steps they took the remaining sources of their uncertainty this is related to the fact that economists are not scientists in the sense physicists are and they often have very little absolute certainty to share anyone who has watched the comic tv series the big bang theory knows that physicists look down on engineers physicists think deep thoughts while engineers muck around with materials and try to give shape to those thoughts or at least that s how the series presents it if there were ever a tv series that made fun of economists we suspect we would be several rungs below engineers or at least the kind of engineers who build rockets unlike engineers or at least those on the big bang theory we cannot rely on some physicist to tell us exactly what it would take for a rocket to escape the earth s gravitational pull economists are more like plumbers we solve problems with a combination of intuition grounded in science some guesswork aided by experience and a bunch of pure trial and error this means economists often get things wrong we will no doubt do so many times in this book not just about the growth rate which is mostly a hopeless exercise but also about somewhat more limited questions like how much carbon taxes will help with climate change how ceos pay might be affected if taxes were to be raised a lot or what universal basic income would do to the structure of employment but economists are not the only ones who make mistakes everyone gets things wrong what is dangerous is not making mistakes but to be so enamored of one s point of view that one does not let facts get in the way to make progress we have to constantly go back to the facts acknowledge our errors and move on besides there is plenty of good economics around good economics starts with troubling facts makes some guesses based on what we already know about human behavior and theories elsewhere shown to work uses data to test those guesses refines or radically alters its line of attack based on the new set of facts and eventually with some luck gets to a solution in this our work is also a lot like medical research siddhartha mukherjee s wonderful book on the fight against cancer the emperor of all maladies tells a story of combining inspired guesswork with careful testing and many rounds of refinement before a new drug gets to the market 13 a big part of the economist s work is very much like that as in medicine we are never sure we have reached the truth just that we have enough faith in an answer to act on it knowing we may have to change our minds later also like in medicine our work does not stop once the basic science is done and the core idea is established the process of rolling out the idea in the real world then begins at one level one could think of this book as a report from the trenches where that research happens what does the best economics of today tell us about the fundamental issues our societies are grappling with we describe how today s best economists think about the world not just their conclusions but also how they got there all the while trying to separate facts and pipe dreams brave assumptions and solid results what we hope for and what we know it is important that in this project we be guided by an expansive notion of what human beings want and what constitutes the good life economists have a tendency to adopt a notion of well being that is often too narrow some version of income or material consumption and yet all of us need much more than that to have a fulfilling life the respect of the community the comforts of family and friends dignity lightness pleasure the focus on income alone is not just a convenient shortcut it is a distorting lens that often has led the smartest economists down the wrong path policy makers to the wrong decisions and all too many of us to the wrong obsessions it is what persuades so many of us that the whole world is waiting at the door to take our well paying jobs it is what has led to a single minded focus on restoring the western nations to some glorious past of fast economic growth it is what makes us simultaneously deeply suspicious of those who don t have money and terrified to find ourselves in their shoes it is also what makes the trade off between the growth of the economy and the survival of the planet seem so stark a better conversation must start by acknowledging the deep human desire for dignity and human contact and to treat it not as a distraction but as a better way to understand each other and to set ourselves free from what appear to be intractable oppositions restoring human dignity to its central place we argue in this book sets off a profound rethinking of economic priorities and the ways in which societies care for their members particularly when they are in need that said on any single issue we will cover in the book or perhaps all of them you may well come to a different conclusion than we do we hope to persuade you not reflexively to agree with us but to adopt a little bit of our methods and share some part of our hopes and fears and perhaps by the end we will really be talking to each other excerpted from good economics for hard times by abhijit v banerjee and esther duflo copyright 2019 available from publicaffairs an imprint of hachette book group inc foreign policy economics biggest success story is a cautionary tale when i was a graduate student of economics in the early to mid 1990s a new idea was just starting to emerge in the field of global development using randomized controlled trials rcts of the sort that had long been common in medicine to assess efforts to assist the poor one of the very first of these studies tested the impact of eradicating parasitic worms on school attendance among children with the researchers picking schools randomly to determine not only how children in these schools were affected but also neighboring ones researchers have since tested the impact of placing additional teachers in a classroom or monitoring teachers attendance with cameras the effect of access to bank or microfinance loans and even the effect of specific appeals made by candidates in an election campaign on voting behavior the growing interest in rcts has culminated in the awarding of the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences last week to several of its pioneers esther duflo abhijit banerjee and michael kremer the rcts they have promoted were described by the royal swedish academy of sciences as having come to entirely dominate development economics the prize committee suggested the rise to centrality of this previously marginal idea was evidence of scientific progress and of a breakthrough that much better enabled us to improve the lives of the worst off people around the world we should all be glad if it were so simple the fact that rcts now so thoroughly shape development economics may be less a success story than a cautionary tale the rct trend has been fueled by two factors one from within economics the other from outside it within the discipline rcts promised to address a problem that had bedeviled economists efforts to empirically assess development programs namely that the people who fared better when there was a change in circumstances were often those who were also more motivated or better positioned in some way to take advantage of it there was no sure way of telling apart which interventions seemed to work because of such factors from which ones worked well because they worked a premise among those who used statistical methods to address this problem had been that experiments on people were not possible the randomistas as they later came to be called cheekily turned this idea on its head proposing precisely to try such experiments yahoo finance nobel prize winning economist esther duflo talks her new book good economics for hard times mit economist esther

warming up for a giant campaign rally in venice on dec 21 bernie sanders the three term u s senator from vermont making his second run for the democratic presidential nomination sat down for an hour with the los angeles times editorial board to talk about the economy healthcare immigration homelessness and other top issues the following is a partial transcript edited for clarity and brevity sanders so this is a major improvement over the old building god the traffic i don t have to tell you it wasn t bad today we went it must have been a mile and it took us what 45 minutes or something nick goldberg editor of the editorial pages you complain about that at the rally later you ll make some sanders that ll win me some votes laughter goldberg so let s get started welcome this is the editorial board only the meeting is for the purpose of helping us make decisions about who we re going to endorse in the race we re on the record you re being videoed you re welcome if you want to make a very short one minute or so intro advertisement sanders i m used to 60 second remarks goldberg and we have a couple of our members on the phone sanders we are at an unprecedented and dangerous moment in american history we have a president who is a pathological liar who is running in my view one of the most corrupt administrations in american history who rightfully was impeached was a racist and a sexist and a homophobe and a xenophobe and a religious bigot and it gives me no pleasure to say that but that is who the president of the united states is i will do everything in my power to defeat him and in fact i believe i am the strongest democratic candidate to do that we could discuss that later but the crisis that we re facing as a nation as a world is not just donald trump and we d be wrong to think that just defeating trump will solve all of our issues we re dealing with massive levels of income and wealth inequality i m deeply concerned about big money controlling the political process and undermining american democracy not to mention all the voter suppression that s going on among republican governors the more i study the issue the more frightened i become about climate change and the scientists now are telling us that they have underestimated the severity and the degree to which climate change is ravaging this country and the world and there is no middle ground in terms of dealing with climate change i wish that it was but right now we ll need to throw all of the resources and intelligence that we can in leading the world because this is not just an american issue to literally save the planet for our kids and future generations this is a major major major crisis so i mean there are many many other issues out there obviously but i just wanted to lay out some of the concerns that i have goldberg let me kick it off then by asking you do you think that the u s can repair the damage that donald trump has done can it be done quickly and easily and how would you go about it sanders the answer is i think it will be difficult i really do think it will require extraordinary leadership i think what trump did in the 2016 campaign is rather intelligently pick up on the fact that there are what tens and tens of millions of people in this country who are suffering who are in pain who are going nowhere in a hurry are seeing decline in their standard of living seeing a decline literally in their life expectancy worried about their kids and they re looking around them and they re saying who is concerned about me is the democratic establishment worried about my kids worried that i m working for nine bucks an hour that i don t have any healthcare that my kid can t go to college and he played on that advertisement now he turned out to be a fraud and a liar but he certainly exposed i think the weakness of the democratic and the political establishment in general including the republican establishment so what we are going to need is leadership in this country that brings people together around the issues that are of concern to all of us so if you re a conservative republican you want healthcare if you are a conservative republican you want to be able to send your kid to college and i think the issues that we have been talking about in this campaign that i talked about four years ago when i was here those issues have resonated with the american people and in fact as i think you all know they have become kind of mainstream now in at least in the democratic party when they were seen as pretty out there four years ago so i think when you talk about raising the minimum wage when i think you talk about making educational opportunity available to all regardless of income where you re talking about canceling student debt when you talk about healthcare for all as a human right medicare for all when you talk about climate change criminal justice reform immigration reform sensible gun policy in this country a woman s right to control her own body and many other issues those issues in fact do resonate with a whole lot of americans and we bring those people together around those issues goldberg before we move around the table let me exercise my prerogative and ask you one other question what do you say to voters who worry that in a general election a candidate as far to the left as you are is gonna alienate swing voters and moderates and independents sanders excellent question i ve heard it once or twice laughter i want you to think about this in my view and i ve thought about this a whole lot anyone who underestimates donald trump as a candidate for a variety of reasons will be very mistaken he is going to be a very very strong candidate he certainly has a very strong base he will have unlimited amounts of money to campaign on he is a pathological liar he will merge in an unprecedented way agencies of government with his campaign because he doesn t particularly believe in the rule of law so he is going to be a very very tough opponent advertisement the only way that you beat trump is by having an unprecedented campaign an unprecedentedly large voter turnout and we ll have to combat every single day the voter suppression which you ve recently seen manifest itself in wisconsin and georgia and we can expect that to take place all over the country we are living in perilous times and republicans understand that if they can keep poor people and people of color and young people from voting they ve got a better shot to do it and i have zero doubt that they will do it they ve appointed right wing judges who will sustain their efforts so we have to combat that in every way we can but the reason i believe that i am the strongest candidate and the reason i believe our approach is right is if you want a large voter turnout if we understand that there are tens of millions of people in this country who don t vote who ve kind of given up on the political process that young people although we re seeing some real gains there and we re working really hard on this thing young people who are by and large progressive my guess is roughly speaking for every three people under 30 who vote two of them are going to vote progressive okay but many of them don t vote i think i am by far the strongest candidate to reach out to those people i think i m the strongest candidate to bring together a multiracial coalition of african americans of latinos of asians so to answer your question i don t believe that the this election is to just speak to republican women in the suburbs that s one theory and i think many of those women will vote for me because they are appalled correctly so about trump s personal behavior and his temperament i think we can win many of them not all of them but on the other hand the key to this election is can we get millions of young people who have never voted before into the political process many working people who understand that trump is a fraud can we get them voting that is the key to this election so i ve heard that hypothesis i just don t agree with it and let me add to that if i might people who run the same old same old type of campaign and you know joe biden is a personal friend of mine so i m not here to you know to attack him but my god if you are if you re a donald trump and you got biden having voted for the war in iraq biden having voted for these terrible in my view trade agreements biden having voted for the bankruptcy bill trump will eat his lunch jon healey deputy editorial page editor so you ve noted the widening income inequality when you look at the consumer confidence indices they suggest that most people are feeling better about where we are and their expectations for the future are better and better if you look the trend lines since the it s gone steadily up and in fact the numbers now in both consumer confidence and expectations for the future are where they were in 99 2000 so how do you reconcile those two things where you ve got a campaign which is trying to reach out to people who feel that they ve been left behind but much of the country thinks things are going pretty well right now sanders i read statistics til i m blue in the face and i ve got to tell you i read polls til i m blue in the face today there s a poll that says this and yesterday there s a poll that says that half of the people in this country are living paycheck to paycheck agreed that s a fact all right advertisement i don t know the exact number but there s a hell of a lot of people in this country who if their car broke down and they needed 500 to fix that car don t have that 500 bucks they ll have to go to some payday lender to get to come up with the money we got 45 million people who are dealing with student debt and some of it is outrageous levels of student debt in this city you got 50 000 people who are sleeping out on the streets so i don t accept the premise i mean i think what people say is you know what if i want to go out and get a job today i can get a job that s true but on the other hand and i do this all over the you know i ve held a whole lot of town meetings and you talk to people yeah i can go out and get a job but i can t find a job that pays me a wage that allows me to deal with healthcare and pay my rent or put gas in the car so the economic crisis that we re facing now is not unemployment which is low it is wages and last year in the midst of the so called booming economy the media talks about it trump talks about it you know what real inflation wages went up last year anyone happen to know healey less than a percent sanders yeah one point exactly 1 1 what we are looking at is a continuation of a trend in which the very very wealthy do phenomenally well i mean it s a fact i keep mentioning i don t know if anyone pays any attention at all of my rallies that in the last 30 years the top 1 have seen a 21 trillion increase in their wealth bottom half of america has seen a decline in their wealth so to answer your question unemployment is low you want to go out you can get a job but by the way what s also frightening is according to the studies most of the new jobs being created are low wage jobs and you know when we re on the campaign trail we go to restaurants all the time that s what we do and invariably the kids the young people who will come up to me who are waiters and waitresses you know these are people who often have a college degree and they re waiting tables today and i ll never forget this i was in new hampshire a month ago talking to teachers and a teacher said you know my son just graduated college wanted to be a music teacher he ended up being a salesman at a liquor store in new hampshire he made more money doing that than being a teacher so to answer your question unemployment is low but wages are terribly low in this country and many people are struggling to get the healthcare they need to take care of their basic needs advertisement kerry cavanaugh editorial writer there s been a lot of focus on a 15 minimum wage but how does the federal government create more 30 an hour jobs 45 an hour jobs sanders that s right if i m allowed to toot my own horn here when i was here four years ago and i talked about a 15 minimum wage everyone thought that i was kind of extreme since then seven states including this state have passed a 15 minimum wage as has the u s house of representatives so your point is well taken nobody should think for one moment that ahh we got a 15 an hour minimum wage we ve solved our economic problems it is a minimum it is a minimum and i have been to this state i ve been to iowa needless to say new hampshire i ll never forget a woman in des moines iowa making 10 25 an hour trying to raise three kids she can t alright so i m not here to tout that a 15 an hour minimum wage is the end of the world it s not but it is the minimum we have to do that the question of how we create good paying jobs 25 30 an hour jobs is the more important question i think one way we do that and obviously it s going to be a combination of federal policy and the private sector as president of the united states what i will do is demand and do everything that i can to end the kind of corporate greed and irresponsibility that we see right now we were just over in san bernardino we had a rally there yesterday where amazon apparently has a lot of influence there s a lot of pollution and kids come down with asthma and all that stuff and people in the warehouses are making 11 or 12 an hour while amazon is as you know an enormously profitable corporation that paid 0 in federal income taxes last year so i think what a progressive president has got to do is say to these corporations you know what make money that s great create jobs we want you to do that but it cannot just go to ceo compensation or your stockholders we ve got to break this mentality which has been prevalent for so many decades that the only thing that a corporation has to do is make as much money as possible for its stockholders and pay it ceos outlandish levels of compensation and we have to do it culturally and we have to do it legislatively to say you know what make money that s fine you want to be rich that s fine but you cannot have it all you can t break unions or deny workers the right to join a union you can t continue to harass women on the job you can t pay abysmally low wages and expect you know to be treated respectfully by the federal government you re going to have to be good corporate citizens you can t shut down plants in america and move to low wage countries you have a certain responsibility so that s the bottom line that s the role i think leadership plays with the private sector advertisement we also want to stimulate small business growth in america but then the role that the federal government can play is enormous i happen to believe in a federal job guarantee program and i ll tell you why because there is an enormous amount of work to be done in this country and i think about it differently than maybe others do but i look at our childcare system which is completely dysfunctional which is so unfair to working families and more importantly to the children i don t know the exact number but hundreds of thousands of good jobs with well trained well paid childcare workers i look at our infrastructure which there is no argument is crumbling whether it s roads bridges highways god i ve been driving around in l a in the last few days what a traffic disaster you have here you know water systems everyone knows about flint mich and we were there my wife and i were there and it was one of the most emotional and difficult meetings we ve ever had you know behind closed doors dealing with parents whose kids were poisoned but it is not just flint mich it is all over this country it is california i don t know if you know this of course you know this you live here but there are tens of thousands of homes where we turn on the water you can t drink the water so we have major infrastructural crisis and last but not least if we are going to combat climate change we need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy and in doing that we can create up to 20 million good paying jobs so the federal government can be very aggressive teachers what a pathetic state of affairs when you have good teachers who are leaving the profession because they ve got to work two or three jobs so we pay teachers i mean when we rebuild our country infrastructure education climate environmental protection we create a whole lot of good paying jobs that s the role of the federal government dr patrick soon shiong executive chairman los angeles times well first of all thank you i was upstairs because i m with the most inspiring 15 kids from a jesuit high school in compton senator listen first of all thank you for coming i want to talk about healthcare just so you know background i came from south africa apartheid grew up in south africa was the first chinese doctor came to this country it s the greatest country in the world so during the debate we held a focus group at the l a times with 25 undecided voters the concern that they related to us was that your medicare for all plan as communicated would not win in the swing states question is what do you mean by medicare for all sanders look healthcare as everybody knows and even the president of the united states recognizes is a complicated issue and we have got to do better and sometimes it is difficult because you re on a debate when you have 75 seconds i m not so sure as a doctor you can explain healthcare in 75 seconds correct maybe you can advertisement soon shiong if you give me two minutes maybe sanders okay all right well you don t get two minutes when you re up on the stage by the way that s too much unless you cheat and go beyond the red light soon shiong but that s a problem right sanders it is a problem soon shiong because you really should have enough time to and maybe in your rallies where you do have time sanders i do have time and come to the rally this afternoon as soon as we leave here we re going to a good rally and i will talk about but that is one of the problems on a complicated issue you are often asked to explain it in 10 or 20 seconds or 75 seconds but we have more than that now so let me explain what i mean first of all we go all over the country and we say ok tell me about healthcare and the stories that you hear and we have them on tape we video these things we put them out there are just unbelievable so i start off patrick with the strong belief that there is something fundamentally wrong when we are spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as the people of any other country i live 50 miles away from canada is the canadian healthcare system perfect no it is not but they guarantee healthcare to all of the people spending half as much we spend about 11 000 they re something around 5 000 or 6 000 a year meanwhile you got 87 million people in this country who are uninsured or underinsured and the keyword here is underinsured everybody s ah well you don t have any health insurance that s a problem but you know what you may have health insurance but if you have a 10 000 deductible then your health insurance doesn t mean a damn thing to you because you can t go to the doctor when you need to ok you don t have the money to do that you have 30 000 people who die this year because they don t get to a doctor on time and here s what is unbelievable and i ve been talking about this more and this resonates with people by the way some half a million people go bankrupt in this country for medically related reasons now that might be the only reason now you re struggling financially you re diagnosed with cancer just think about it you tell me you make 50 000 or 60 000 a year you re diagnosed with cancer you run up a bill for 50 000 100 000 how do you pay that bill i mean it s insane so we are living in a country which says that you can suffer financial ruin for the rest of your life for what crime did you commit you were diagnosed with cancer or heart disease how disgusting is that it really is i use that word advisedly so this system i think is dysfunctional and it s really quite indefensible and we can argue about where we go from here but i think on top of everything else i mean we don t have five hours to discuss it is the complexity of the system ok and i think it s not only healthcare it s everything else people are sick and tired of filling out a million forms for every thing my wife has a phd all right and she goes crazy trying to fill out the healthcare things choosing what healthcare program you want you know when you re fighting for the coverage that you think you are entitled to we need a simple system and the beauty of a simple system and the advantage of single payer over a system which has thousands of separate policies is that it is easier to administer advertisement you re asking me what medicare for all is it is no more premiums not for you as an employer you must spend a fortune i imagine right now on healthcare all right no more premiums for the worker for the employer no more co payments no more deductibles no more out of pocket expenses all gone medicare for all expands medicare to cover dental care which last i heard is healthcare hearing aids eyeglasses and home healthcare and we do that how we do fund it we fund it through a progressive tax system such that i suspect your company by the way will save money you ll be paying more in taxes but less in your overall healthcare costs and the savings will go to the workers you ll be better off on the medicare for all and one of the things that we have not succeeded at i think is getting large corporations to understand that because we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare they re competing against international concerns who don t have to worry about paying their workers healthcare because it s government sponsored goldberg do you think there s a problem with the way is being sold sanders yep the answer is yes i think there is enormous ignorance about the nature of healthcare why we spend so much why our outcomes are not particularly good yes life expectancy childbirth infant mortality so i m not arguing i think you re right but please understand which i think you do know that there are people who are benefiting big time from this dysfunctional healthcare system robert greene editorial writer senator you ve made your position on president trump quite clear i want to ask you is there anything that he s done any policy that he has any actions he s taken that you think are worthy and worth building on sanders i have such contempt for somebody who is trying intentionally to divide this country up based on the color of people s skins or where they came from or their religion or their sexual orientation that disgusts me so much so we re in the midst of that and somebody who was a you know is a pathological liar and a corrupt person i mean he has talked about the need for infrastructure repair yes that s true has he done anything no he s talked about the need to lower the cost of the prescription drugs has he taken on the pharmaceutical industry no he has not advertisement he has talked about trade policy and in fairness probably what has recently happened is probably modestly better than the previous nafta so you want to give him credit and and the democrats in the house credit for that fine but i think the overwhelming result of his administration is contemptible mariel garza editorial writer so there s been a lot of talk about electability in this race what is electability who s electable there are a fair amount of women who believe that when we talk about electability when we use that word it s really code for a woman can t beat trump and i wonder if you if you believe that that s true sanders i surely do not i mean it 100 has to do with the candidate but i will say that whether you re a man or a woman trump is going to be harder to beat than many people think they think this guy is a buffoon of course he s going to be beaten not so easy but it gets back to the question the original question is it s not a woman or a man or whatever it s a question of the kind of campaign that you run and i think in this unprecedented moment in american history you need an unprecedented campaign and i think you need ideas that are going to excite and energize millions of people who right now are not particularly active in politics and who may not vote at all so i think the question that we want to ask is which candidate out there is capable of growing voter turnout that s the real question and if you re not dealing with that i think trump is going to be hard to defeat that s true whether you re a man or a woman but if the question is can a woman beat trump of course carla hall editorial writer you mentioned the thousands of people sleeping on the streets here in the city and in the county president trump s approach to homelessness has been pretty much to scapegoat homeless people and vaguely hint that he would move them all into a big empty federal building somewhere how would you address homelessness sanders you know we started talking about the economy and what i suggested is that there is so much work to be done in this country i mean starting with childcare starting with healthcare we need more doctors we need more nurses we need people who are not pushing paper but providing care to older people we have a proposal that would build 10 million units of housing in terms of low income housing i m proud to tell you that i co sponsored successfully with barbara lee of oakland what was called low income i think i forget the name the low income housing trust fund or something which obama s people put i think several hundred million dollars into nowhere near enough but it was the first piece of legislation to actually address low income housing but to answer your question and i ve learned as you travel around the country boy you do learn this the housing crisis is not just in l a it s not just in san francisco or seattle it is virtually in almost every part of the country and it has to do not only with homelessness which is a disgrace a half a million people homeless in america it has to do with the fact that 18 million families are spending 50 of their income on housing it has to do with gentrification all over this country which is driving rents up to levels that that working families just cannot afford we have a proposal that would build some 10 million units of housing and put a hell of a lot of people back to work at good wages union wages and it would in fact end homelessness as we know it advertisement we were down in what do you call it here greene skid row sanders skid row not a highly technical term laughter i thought you had a more sophisticated name for it where for example instead of arresting people you bring them into a shelter which seemed to me a pretty sensible thing but the problem with homelessness is not just providing a home often you ve got to deal with addiction you ve got to deal with counseling you need wraparound services etc soon shiong correct can i follow up on that and two maybe three different topics really the homelessness issue here is really mental health issues sanders right soon shiong so the mental health issue is really sanders and addiction is part of it soon shiong and being thrown out of the jails there s a real issue the other question i really want to ask you about and it relates to privacy it relates to tech it relates to facebook google etc it relates actually to our democracy because it leads now to local news newspapers completely being destroyed in california we have it s a largest incidence of small local town newspapers being destroyed because frankly the fair use is not being fairly used where these platforms can take this data say they re not media and use them what s your feeling about that how do we save across this nation local newspapers that can speak truth to power sanders it s a huge issue and you re absolutely right i can tell you from personal experience when i was mayor of burlington which was a larger city in vermont of 40 000 people i can t remember how many radio stations we had we had newspapers we had small weekly newspapers all over right newspapers are in trouble i would say that what we want to do and by the way this is not just media this is many other sectors of our society is have an attorney general who understands antitrust law and that s true in agribusiness it s true in many parts of our economy start breaking up these huge conglomerates which have just an unbelievable influence over our general economy media is something different because without a free media you don t have a democracy so it raises another issue and we have some ideas out there about and it s a tricky thing you don t want government control over media you don t want a handful of giant conglomerates to control the media but we re going to have to sit down and have a conversation about how we support local independent media i don t have a magical answer advertisement soon shiong but facebook and google hide behind the fact that they can give fake news because they re not media sanders and also i may add in terms of you tell me if i m wrong you know more about this than i do they gobble up a huge amount of the advertising revenue soon shiong they gobble up everything in fact that s exactly why papers are being destroyed sanders that s right soon shiong so one of the ideas is data s now the next oil basically equal to a utility why is there not a data tax on these organizations that is where that should actually be sanders well i think the idea is that a handful what have we got google facebook who else is out there twitter right twitter controlling what percentage of the advertising revenue healey google and facebook together are north of 80 i think sanders wow is that right this is an issue that cannot be ignored i agree with you michael mcgough senior editorial writer senator when you were here last time four years ago we had a discussion about whether you were maybe too averse to military intervention you thought hillary clinton was the opposite and one of the things you said when we were talking was as proof that you weren t pacifist was that you had voted for the war in afghanistan after 9 11 you had some second thoughts about that in the debate and i m wondering are you more averse to intervention now than you were when you were running in 2016 and what sort of standards would guide you as president in deciding whether to send u s forces abroad advertisement sanders well it s not a question of more or less obviously you have to look at the particular circumstances no 1 i think unlike trump who has exploded military spending while cutting back on diplomacy and our state department i would do exactly the opposite i think you need and i ve been around the world and met with some of our diplomats you ve got some really strong and good people who know the language who know the culture so we had got i mean the bottom line is that war has got to be the last response not the first response it is very easy for politicians because it s almost always very popular to say you know what the only thing that fill in the blank understands is force and we re going to go to war it s a good speech it polls very well but it ends up in some cases with horrible circumstances i e the war in iraq so i voted against the first war in the gulf literally it s one of the first votes that i cast that i thought i would be unelected two years later because that war was popular i voted against it led the effort against the war in iraq god i wish check out what i said then it turned out to be a pretty prescient and i wish that wasn t the case but it was i helped lead the effort to end u s intervention in yemen following the dictatorship in saudi arabia s lead so no 1 you ve got to do everything you can to bring people together diplomatically without the use of military force are there some circumstances where genocide is going to be committed where you may have to use military force or other reasons yeah i suspect there will be but also you want to be mindful that you need to the degree you can get it to use international support strengthen the united nations people say the u n is ineffective yeah compared to what nuclear war you know so we ve got to strengthen the united nations and see where we can resolve international conflict the other thing that i would say on this is that in issues like israel palestine issues like saudi arabia iran the united states for many years has had a kind of one sided policy we have loved the brutal dictatorship in saudi arabia we have been very 100 pro israel and i say this as somebody who s proudly jewish who spent time as a kid on a kibbutz in israel but we need to have an evenhanded foreign policy which brings people together and i won t deny for one second this is complicated stuff it is not easily resolved but we throw all of the resources that we can to bring people together and you gotta do things like rethinking this war on terror which has cost us some 5 trillion and i guess people can argue the situation is worse than it was before we got into it so there s a lot of rethinking got to deal with authoritarianism all over the world scott martelle editorial writer hi good morning thank you senator you call for comprehensive immigration reform and that s been tried multiple times before and it s been failing for decades as president what can you do to get a comprehensive immigration reform package through congress advertisement sanders yeah i don t want to tell you i ve been one of the leaders of that in terms of the discussions or the negotiations in congress but i have been involved in it and the truth is i do believe it can be done i absolutely do believe it trump of course because of his xenophobia and his obsession with building a wall has exacerbated the situation i think despite trump s xenophobia the american people do want comprehensive immigration reform and i think when you have a president who can speak and i m the son of an immigrant as a matter of fact who came to this country with nothing when you can speak to the contributions of the immigrant community the fact that so many immigrants are working so hard raising their families abiding by the law are so important to our economy when you can explain that to the american people rather than demonize immigrants i think we could strengthen the support that exists at the grass roots level for immigration reform now as you also know a president has certain authority regarding executive orders so on day one what i have promised and will fulfill is to reinstate the legal status of the 1 8 million young people and their parents in the daca program that we can do and we can stop the very ugly practices at the border in which you know babies are literally snatched from the arms of their mothers or children thrown into cages we can do that as well but to answer your question i think there is broad support among the american people i think there s more republican support which i think would be able to play out without having a xenophobe as president of the united states garza i have a pretty quick question and that is normally i wouldn t ask somebody about their health because you know we all know that 80 is the new 60 sanders 50 40 30 laughter garza but the truth is you have had a heart attack fairly recently and i wonder you know convince us that that you are hale and hearty enough for what s going to be a brutal campaign and probably a pretty well we know it s a tough job sanders yes it s a tough job look all i can say is you re quite right i did have a heart attack two and a half months ago in las vegas i had two stents put in i was in the hospital for 2 ½ days and got quite good healthcare thank god i had an artery that was blocked and i think that was dealt with as i understand it and to soon shiong doctor you can tell me if i m wrong but i think that procedure s done about a million times a year roughly speaking in the united states it s not an unusual procedure i have been blessed with good health my entire life i think you can ask my staff the last time other than the heart attack that i missed work i m in just i was a kid a long distance runner so i have a lot of endurance since the heart attack we have been running a pretty vigorous campaign these guys had me working what did we do four rallies in the last couple of you know i work hard and you re right i mean it is needless to say president of the united states might be slightly stressful job laughter and a difficult job but i suspect i ll be on the golf course a lot less than donald trump is i don t play golf but i mean that s a fair question all that i can say is in some respects i feel better than i did before the heart attack i guess having three arteries that work is better than having two right advertisement soon shiong especially the most important one goldberg i was going to give patrick the last three minutes now we can give you the last one minute soon shiong first of all i want to thank you so much for coming i would like again to revisit the question of what do you believe when they say electability especially in the swing states do you believe that the electability issue is this concept of medicare for all it scares people that you take away your insurance which is going to be the buzzword versus you will have your choice your conditions and the program currently exists called medicare advantage if in fact you just repositioned the same plan it comes to the same point as concierge medicine for the poor an absence of bankruptcy which is exactly the program do you believe that is your electability issue sanders i think we ve got to do better in messaging but i believe that the program that we are talking about i believe this not only is it right morally right i believe that it works politically let me tell you something else which you didn t talk about if i were to tell you that if you re an average worker today let s say you re making your family s making 60 000 a year you are paying about 12 000 a year for healthcare that s 20 of your income that is a hell of a lot of money healey that s not even including your employer s contribution sanders that s right that s right correct just the worker okay and i can make sure that you pay substantially less that s a point we have not made as well as soon shiong the point is it s not about the money we re spending more money than anybody in world right advertisement sanders exactly exactly soon shiong and the point is now we can actually have better outcomes at lower costs better outcomes at lower costs but the key is this fee for service sanders yes right and and the challenge it s a longer discussion is ending the enormous administrative complexity soon shiong which is the fee for service sanders ok and the what you said 200 billion i ve heard more than that frankly soon shiong 200 to 500 billion sanders that s right soon shiong per year sanders to administer thousands of separate programs all right and that has nothing to do with healthcare that s all bureaucracy ok all right good let s maybe continue that discussion goldberg thank you so much senator sanders thank you very much goldberg we appreciate it sanders you know it s interesting we got an hour and we barely touched the surface on so many issues garza we gave you more than 30 seconds to respond sanders you did and i appreciate that ok well thank you so much

t and which most countries claim to practice while trying to subvert its principles as much as possible trump s trade wars are of course dangerously reckless in a world more interconnected than ever

by dr george venturini the greatest international scam the biggest corruption of its kind in australia s history resulted in international condemnation and litigation the united states successfully pursued criminal charges against several citizens and others in its borders but the australian criminal investigation into a w b was eventually dropped civil charges however were initially successful on 11 july 2006 north american farmers claimed us 1 billion in damages from a w b before a court in washington d c alleging that the australian wheat exporter used bribery and other corrupt activities to corner grain markets the growers claimed that a w b used the same practices to secure grain sales in other markets in asia and other countries in the middle east the lawsuit was dismissed in march 2007 in august 2009 the australian federal police dropped the investigation into any criminal actions undertaken by a w b and others in this matter the reason seemed to be that the chance of obtaining a conviction was limited and not in the public interest a civil case was brought by shareholders of a w b and was settled out of court for au 39 5 million in february 2010 nobody really knows why the australian securities and investments commission proceeded with several civil cases against six former directors and officers of a w b some of those cases were discontinued on condition that the parties would bear their own costs a s i c decided to discontinue the proceedings after forming the view that it was no longer in the public interest to pursue its claims a s i c s proceedings against trevor flugge the former chairman of a w b and peter geary the former group general manager trading of a w b continued there were lateral discoveries such as the one involving big hearted big australian b h p has always liked to be seen as a business with a big heart as well as a hefty and healthy balance sheet most uninformed australians went along with that story yet in 1996 b h p had been warned by dfat that its big hearted plan to send wheat to iraq as a humanitarian gesture and then recoup the money with interest through instalment payments would breach united nations sanctions against the saddam hussein s régime still it seemed the big australian was unperturbed so it went ahead bought 20 000 tonnes of wheat from a w b and shipped it to iraq then it did some unusual business with a w b to build the repayments of us 5 million to a b h p related company using sham contracts with further inflated wheat prices these contracts involved a b h p related company called tigris petroleum the cole inquiry was given an opportunity to hear that b h p s head of energy philip s aiken had brokered the deal between a w b and tigris petroleum the company collecting the us 5 million owed to b h p tigris had agreed to pay us 500 000 to a w b for recovering the debt michael long a w b s head of marketing said in evidence that aiken had written a reference letter in september 2000 confirming tigris had been assigned the debt to b h p by the iraq government asked if he was concerned the money paid to tigris might go to the iraqi government mr long told the inquiry he was reassured by correspondence from b h p four years later six former a w b top executives would be able to escape criminal charges over the kickbacks the australian securities and investments commission would not have tried to revive civil cases against those accused of breaching u n sanctions against saddam hussein key figures in the a w b kickbacks affair were set to avoid criminal charges after another retreat by the nation s corporate regulator five former a w b officers including the former chairman trevor flugge were told in june 2010 that the corporate regulator would not have prepared a criminal brief for the commonwealth director of public prosecutions but the end of the criminal investigation revealed in the victorian supreme court had cleared the way for a s i c to revive civil penalty cases that it had initiated against the five in late 2007 a s i c was the last corporate regulator still examining possible criminal charges over a w b s systematic payment of more than us 225 million in illicit fees and commissions to saddam hussein s régime between 1999 and 2004 in pursuit of contracts to sell australian wheat the australian federal police and victoria police had abandoned their criminal investigations in august 2009 after the federal director of public prosecutions had decided that there would have been no chance of success eventually the most serious of a s i c s charges against trevor flugge the former chairman of a w b and peter geary the former group general manager trading of a w b would be dismissed p durkin asic loses awb case against trevor flugge a decade after oil for food the australian financial review 15 december 2016 but a s i c s decision to abandon its a w b criminal investigation paved the way for the corporate regulator to revive civil penalty cases it had initiated in late 2007 against five former senior officers of a w b the five were the former chairman trevor flugge who was accused of seven instances of breaching his fiduciary duties the former a w b chief financial officer paul ingleby 16 counts the former head of trading peter geary 10 counts the former head of sales and marketing michael long 17 counts and the former senior marketing executive charles stott 12 counts their cases were postponed in november 2008 while the supreme court of victoria awaited confirmation from either a s i c or the commonwealth d p p about possible criminal action a s i c s lawyers told the court on 3 june 2010 that the regulator would soon file an application seeking court approval to restart the civil cases a sixth set of proceedings against a w b s former managing director andrew lindberg was under way however in another development that day a s i c s lawyers informed justice ross robson that they would have filed an application the following week to have him removed from lindberg s case because the judge had admitted to being a close friend of the former a w b director warwick mcclelland a w b s counsel norman o bryan s c told the court that all directors who were on a w b s board at relevant times including mcclelland would be called to give evidence about what they knew and what they were told mr o bryan said that while a s i c at this stage did not expect to challenge mcclelland s credibility it ultimately might and a s i c believed it was a moral certainty that lindberg would challenge directors credibility justice robson said that he would not hear the application to recuse himself until lindberg had the opportunity to read a statement or outline of mcclelland s evidence a s i c had not finalised its witness statements or outlines the case was not expected to return to court before 13 july 2010 at the earliest justice robson had presided over all the a w b cases in the victorian supreme court including the 2008 application to postpone the five civil cases he had allowed a s i c s civil penalty case against lindberg to proceed on the basis that he was highly unlikely to face any criminal proceedings and he presided over several weeks of opening submissions from a s i c when lindberg s stop start trial had begun in 2009 a s i c s counsel first raised the recuse application in november at the time justice robson said he did not feel any embarrassment whatsoever about hearing the application for a stay unless you say why i should be embarrassed adding that mcclelland was not a relative and not some person i am responsible for looking after he is a director of a major public company lindberg s case while it had hardly begun had been tense and dramatic a s i c initially alleged that he had breached his fiduciary duties by failing to stop the kickbacks but just as a s i c opened its case in october 2009 it launched a second parallel action against the former chief executive early in 2010 the court of appeal had allowed a s i c to run its second case and the parties agreed to run the two cases as one it was unclear when lindberg s trial would have resumed as there were now disputes about the formulation of a s i c s statement of claim a s i c s expanded case alleged that as well as failing to halt the kickbacks lindberg did not tell fellow a w b directors what he knew about either the payments or the gravity of allegations levelled at a w b by the united states investigators and that he allegedly misled directors about an internal a w b investigation into the kickbacks a s i c would later confirm that its comments to the court regarding the end of criminal investigations related only to the six former officers facing court proceedings l wood six former awb chiefs escape criminal charges over kickbacks the sydney morning herald 4 june 2010 during the inquiry b h p had promised to co operate fully for that reason mr cole had been looking to have his terms broadened so it could consider charges against the world s biggest miner mr cole said that it was incongruous and inappropriate that he had been unable to make findings about b h p s activities the inquiry heard that b h p funded the 1996 humanitarian gesture in a bid to win petroleum exploration rights in iraq once the united nations sanctions were lifted b h p had of course denied all along that the money was intended to help secure b h p oil rights in iraq despite an assertion to that effect made by a w b s c e o andrew lindberg to the australian stock exchange that it was the intention of b h p to get the inside running on the oil exploration rights appearing before the inquiry a w b chairman brendan stewart would say that the company would accept responsibility the board deeply regrets the damage done to the company the board accepts accountability for the actions of management and the culture at a w b during the oil for food program at the end of the day the board ultimately accepts responsibility for what happened and is committed to making significant changes to ensure it never happens again awb chairman accepts responsibility 7 30 abc net au 29 november 2016 more than a decade after the cole inquiry former a w b chairman trevor flugge and the former group general manager trading peter anthony geary would be facing trial on charges of dereliction of duty in the kickbacks scandal mr flugge denied helping negotiate the sweeteners to the saddam hussein s régime and welcomed the chance to clear his name the corporate regulator had begun a civil case against mr flugge in 2007 but froze the case while it pursued criminal charges these were then discontinued in 2010 but now a s i c had returned to court wanting to prove that mr flugge was aware or at least should have been aware that a w b was violating u n security council resolutions meanwhile a s i c was alleging that mr geary had personally authorised six payments to jordanian front company alia totalling around au 31 million between march 2002 and february 2003 a s i c had won two civil cases in 2013 against andrew lindberg who had paid a penalty of 100 000 and former chief financial officer paul ingleby who had paid a penalty of 40 000 the civil trial of mr flugge and mr geary was expected to last ten weeks the volcker investigation had found no evidence to suggest that the monopoly wheat exporter had acted dishonestly concluding on the evidence it had that a w b did not knowingly pay kickbacks on its part the cole inquiry was finding some evidence that in fact a w b did act dishonestly did knowingly pay the kickbacks and did more the cole inquiry concluded that from mid 1999 a w b had knowingly entered into an arrangement that involved paying kickbacks to the iraqi régime in order to retain its business it cleared government bureaucrats and ministers from wrongdoing however it recommended criminal prosecutions be begun against former a w b executives the kickbacks also breached the o e c d anti bribery convention the cole inquiry recommended that 12 people be investigated for possible criminal and corporations offences over the scandal the scandal resulted in international condemnation and litigation the united states successfully pursued criminal charges against several citizens and others in its borders but the australian criminal investigation into a w b was eventually dropped civil charges were however modestly successful on 11 july 2006 north american farmers claimed 1 billion in damages from a w b at washington d c alleging the australian wheat exporter used bribery and other corrupt activities to corner grain markets the growers claimed that a w b used the same techniques to secure grain sales in other markets in asia and other countries in the middle east the lawsuit was dismissed in march 2007 in august 2009 the australian federal police dropped their investigation into any criminal actions undertaken by a w b and others in this matter this decision came after paul hastings q c declared that the prospect of convictions was limited and not in the public interest a civil case was brought by shareholders of a w b and was settled out of court for 39 5 million in february 2010 mr flugge was later fined 50 000 and banned from managing a company for 5 years for failing to inquire about a w b s payments to saddam hussein s régime a w b s managing director at the time andrew lindberg and chief financial officer paul ingleby were fined 100 000 and 40 000 and banned from manager roles for 2 years and 15 months respectively corruption scandals have institutionally engulfed a number of australian companies operating overseas the incidents raise questions about shortfalls in management supervision of staff who act corruptly for the good of their employer some of australia s largest companies such as mining giant rio tinto have been involved in widely reported examples in 2005 the unruly behaviour of a w b hit the headlines usually corrupt governments attempt to overcome the temporary embarrassment relying on the lack of attention of a hill informed uncaring fatalistic indifferent populace there is little interest beyond the scandalous often juicy details some cases are not sexy enough to attract attention long time ago bribes were reported to have been paid by securency international the company which invented and markets polymer banknotes and is half held by the central bank the reserve bank of australia in the case two companies totally held by the reserve bank of australia securency and note printing australia were fined a record 21 6 million in 2012 for their criminal conduct however the cases against four accused individuals collapsed after bungling by law enforcement agencies transparency international the global anti corruption coalition has been releasing several progress reports on the enforcement of the organisation for economic co operation and development s anti bribery convention already in 2009 transparency s report pointed to australia s weak record of enforcing the agreement in fact australia had not prosecuted anyone generally enforcement was extremely uneven among the 36 out of 38 signatories to the convention covered by the report there is active enforcement in only four countries germany norway switzerland and the united states and little or no enforcement in 21 of the parties said the report increased efforts are also needed in countries with moderate enforcement because their level of enforcement is not high enough to provide effective deterrence in mid 2009 when rio tinto s australian head of iron ore marketing in china mr stern hu was charged with bribery it was suggested that the chinese government was taking revenge for a rebuff of its earlier takeover bid for the company yet a later court judgement of the case detailed how hu had demanded a 30 per cent commission disguised as a consultancy agreement in return for giving a chinese company a long term contract for the supply of iron ore through an agent he had also laundered a us 798 000 cut through a friend s bank account other bribes were handed over in a restaurant in the office tower where rio tinto has its shanghai headquarters hu s colleagues also rigged rio tinto s spot market tendering processes in favour of those who bribed them australian federal police continued to investigate a whistleblower s allegations that securency international offered au 50 million in bribes and procured prostitutes to win contracts all around the world in the a w b case the grains marketeer admitted that the au 290 million in fees it paid to a jordanian transport company were loaded with payments which were passed onto saddam hussein s régime this contradicted its earlier responses to the australian securities exchange and to paul volcker who investigated corruption in the u n oil for food programme in 2005 the cole inquiry was told by too many of the cartel s executives something like this a w b has consistently maintained its position that it did not know and could not know what alia did with the money a w b paid to it by way of transport fees the prime minister and the two ministers most closely connected with a w b s operation and supervision new absolutely nothing nothing here to see seemed to be the pass word corruption is pervasive and contagious the australian taxation office ruled that the au 290 million that a w b paid was not illegal under iraqi law consequently they were not bribes under australian law and the tax office determined a w b was well within its rights to claim the costs as a tax deduction in 2009 the australian federal police dropped its investigation on the ground that it was not clear that breaching a united nations sanction is a criminal offence and a conviction was not in the public interest in 2010 a w b was defending a au 100 million shareholder class action by claiming that australian and united nations officials knew of the kickbacks and anyway they did not breach the u n oil for food programme of course there is always the paramountcy argument of the national interest and the ultimately venal consideration that the australian government has a conflict of interest as kickbacks for contracts leads to profit for government coffers through more exports and more tax revenue at this point the healthy the doctrine of paramountcy expressed in the legal principle which reconciles contradicting or conflicting laws so the securency and a w b cases appeared to have the tacit support almost justification by the australian government way to go continued saturday our mate saddam hussein al tikriti part 6 previous instalment our mate saddam hussein

according to the ideological prejudices of the present built up over nearly four decades of globalization free trade and deregulation represent the natural order of things history however tells us that the united states was a protectionist power for much of its existence and the tariff was a crucial factor in its dethronement of britain as global economic leader by the early 20th century nor should it be forgotten that economic nationalism has guided the destiny of all major nations since the 19th century as the year ends a partial and brief ceasefire seems imminent in donald trump s trade war on the world the united states and china may sign a deal as early as next month but make no mistake the protectionist impulse behind the trade war remains as ineradicable as ever as william mckinley put it in 1890 we lead all nations in agriculture we lead all nations in mining we lead all nations in manufacturing these are the trophies which we bring after twenty nine years of a protective tariff the argument for economic nationalism against a manufacturing giant such as britain was simple british free traders claimed that their ideology was best placed to bring prosperity and peace to the world their critics in countries less economically advanced than britain such as germany s friedrich list the 19th century s most influential economic theorist argued that free trade could only be a goal rather than the starting point of modern development economic self strengthening for nations required that they protect their nascent industry until it becomes internationally competitive notwithstanding britain s rhetoric which periodicals like the economist amplified it had arrived at free trade after a successful policy of tariffs it also used military power to acquire foreign markets for its surplus goods and capital in the late 19th century one aspiring power after another set out to match the british the americans were not alone italy while seeking to modernize its economy imposed massive tariffs on france germany and japan nurtured domestic manufactures while trying to shield them from foreign competition even britain following its settler colonies australia canada and south africa came to abandon free trade by 1932 the united states protectionism peaked with the infamous smoot hawley tariff act of 1930 also read struggling global economy just got a double shot in the arm for 2020 the u s moved swiftly to embrace free trade after the second world war only because its manufacturing industries dominant over the world s war ravaged economies needed access to international markets even then the cold war s military and diplomatic urgencies turned the united states into an unlikely protector of japan s manufacturing industries as they were rebuilt into world beaters trade practices of the kind deemed unfair by trump today ranging from loans and subsidies to national conglomerates and restriction of imports were key to the rise of not only japan but also such east asian tigers as south korea and taiwan trying albeit much less successfully to build a manufacturing economy india imposed some of the world s highest tariffs after a short lived experiment with trade liberalization which resulted in a 53 billion trade deficit with china india today has retreated into its old protectionist crouch it is hard to see what else it can do the rise of china as a manufacturing powerhouse has made even the united states renounce the posture of international co operation it assumed after the second world war the multilateral institutions such as the world trade organization that the u s helped set up no longer seem to serve its purposes moreover the argument first widely heard in the u s during the debate over nafta in the 1990s that free trade enriches the wealthy at the expense of the poor and the middle class not to mention the environment has become politically much more potent it is clear today that the advocates of free trade ignored for too long the volatile political problems rising from wage stagnation and income inequality upholding the economic law of comparative advantage they also managed to downplay the higher law that governs international economic relations might is right following the british imperialism of free trade powerful countries have consistently practiced what they denounce in others for instance the united states while insisting that other countries reduce state intervention has nurtured high tech industries in ways that violate wto agreements and which are shielded from sanction only by the fig leaf of defense requirements the bluff of free trade first called in the 19th century by an industrializing america against britain lies exposed yet again as china aspires to be the 21st century s new hegemon free trade turns out to be something that helps a rising great power until it doesn t and which most countries claim to practice while trying to subvert its principles as much as possible trump s trade wars are of course dangerously reckless in a world more interconnected than ever before but they have served to clarify the challenge ahead to devise multilateral institutions that acknowledge protectionism rather than free trade as the deeper and more enduring reality of global economic history bloomberg also read world economy limps into 2020

looking back at 2019 is incredibly disorienting the country is horribly divided in fact the president of the united states was just impeached along partisan lines the government is running trillion dollar and growing annual budget deficits even though the economy is doing well still listening to many politicians and pundits you d think the nation is doing terribly and the government isn t spending a dime that s 2019 in a nutshell the economy is entering its 11th year of expansion poverty is at an all time low so are african american and hispanic unemployment rates the 3 5 overall unemployment rate hasn t been that low since 1969 the unemployment rate for women hasn t been this low since 1952 the employment rate for workers ages 25 to 54 is finally back above its pre great recession level wages are on the rise especially at the bottom of the income distribution the stock market is on fire small businesses and many industries are complaining that they can t find enough workers to fill all the jobs they have not everything is perfect of course there s still relative poverty but that s an immutable fact of life and of the way we define poverty many economists are concerned that productivity isn t growing as fast as it could this matters because productivity growth is an important source of rising living standards manufacturing isn t doing great either thanks to the president s self destructive trade war farmers are hurting badly due to the tariffs as are many of the companies downstream of the tax yet the economy continues to show resilience in spite of this so what explains the gargantuan budget deficits during good times spending on many programs meant to alleviate poverty and economic hardship typically goes down but not as much anymore ever easier eligibility for programs like food stamps have deviated from the program s original intent medicare and medicaid expansion have guaranteed that the programs will continue growing and adding to the deficit whether times are good or bad both political parties are carelessly spending on a whim they just passed a spending package of 1 4 trillion alongside 500 billion in irresponsible tax breaks and democrats are actively trying to restore the state and local tax deduction or salt a handout to rich people in high tax states more intriguing is the political discourse listening to democratic presidential candidates you d think that americans are living in abject poverty that can only be remedied by government taking over all student debt all medical costs and boosting the incomes of a politically powerful group who are already overrepresented in the top income quintile namely seniors listening to republicans you d think that it s never been as hard to be a woman or raise a family in america in fact gopers today call for programs like mandated paid leave which they assert is an idea whose time has finally come and large increases in the child tax credit others condemn the free market system as if it hasn t delivered anything but grief to low skilled workers and destruction to the environment the truth is quite different when the economy is doing well most people do well including women and their families more importantly it s the same free market economy that republicans and democrats today so vociferously condemn that has produced the wealth that everyone takes for granted according to research from the massachusetts institute of technology in order to get the standard of living that ordinary americans enjoyed in 1975 today we would only have to work 23 weeks out of the year to achieve 1950 s standard of living now requires a mere 11 weeks of work people were fairly content back then in fact many who complain that the free market has failed us point to those decades as america s golden age this is an illusion of course most of us make the choice to work more and acquire a significantly better living standard yet few people realize and appreciate how very much more we have now at the end of this year then i d venture to guess that the problem in 2019 isn t that free markets don t work but that we may have reached peak entitlement mentality let s hope we come back to earth in 2020 and start to appreciate that while all isn t perfect we re incredibly lucky to be alive today happy new year to all of you copyright 2019 creators com

as the year ends a partial and brief ceasefire seems imminent in donald trump s trade war on the world the united states and china may sign a deal as early as next month but make no mistake the protectionist impulse behind the trade war remains as ineradicable as ever nor should it be forgotten that economic nationalism has guided the destiny of all major nations since the 19th century according to the ideological prejudices of the present built up over nearly four decades of globalization free trade and deregulation represent the natural order of things history however tells us that the united states was a protectionist power for much of its existence and the tariff was a crucial factor in its dethronement of britain as global economic leader by the early 20th century as william mckinley put it in 1890 we lead all nations in agriculture we lead all nations in mining we lead all nations in manufacturing these are the trophies which we bring after twenty nine years of a protective tariff the argument for economic nationalism against a manufacturing giant such as britain was simple british free traders claimed that their ideology was best placed to bring prosperity and peace to the world their critics in countries less economically advanced than britain such as germany s friedrich list the 19th century s most influential economic theorist argued that free trade could only be a goal rather than the starting point of modern development economic self strengthening for nations required that they protect their nascent industry until it becomes internationally competitive notwithstanding britain s rhetoric which periodicals like the economist amplified it had arrived at free trade after a successful policy of tariffs it also used military power to acquire foreign markets for its surplus goods and capital in the late 19th century one aspiring power after another set out to match the british the americans were not alone italy while seeking to modernize

this hour originally aired nov 13 2019 tackling today s trickiest global challenges with the winners of the nobel prize in economics esther duflo and abhijit banerjee guests esther duflo professor of poverty alleviation and development economics at mit winner of the 2019 nobel memorial prize in economic sciences co founder of abdul latif jameel poverty action lab co author of good economics for hard times abhijit banerjee ford foundation international professor of economics at mit winner of the 2019 nobel memorial prize in economic sciences co founder of abdul latif jameel poverty action lab co author of good economics for hard times what is it that we get wrong about our understanding of the major drivers of migration conventional economic wisdom says were the barriers to migration lower the u s would be immediately flooded with migrants following a gradient of wages because wages and incomes are higher in the u s than in say latin america that is actually wrong esther duflo says that is one way to understand that it is just wrong to look at internal migration where there are no such barriers and we can see that people just don t move really in very large numbers from rural areas to towns in developing countries from cities and towns affected by trade shocks in the u s to other cities and towns where there might be jobs hear her explain more in the video below from the reading list excerpt from good economics for hard times by esther duflo and abhijit banerjee what undermines trust in economists a part of the answer is that there is plenty of bad economics around those who represent the economists in the public discourse are not usually the same academic economists who are part of the panel convened by the booth school of business at the university of chicago to answer questions on core economic topics the self proclaimed economists on tv and in the press chief economist of bank x or firm y are with important exceptions primarily spokespersons for their firms economic interests who often feel free to ignore the weight of the evidence moreover they have a relatively predictable slant toward market optimism at all costs which is what the public associates with economists in general unfortunately in terms of how they look suit and tie or the way they sound lots of jargon the talking heads are hard to tell apart from academic economists the most important difference is perhaps in their willingness to pronounce and predict which unfortunately makes them all the more authoritative but they actually do a pretty poor job of predicting in part because predictions are often well nigh impossible which is why most academic economists stay away from futurology one of the jobs of the international monetary fund imf is to forecast the rate of growth of the world economy in the near future without a whole lot of success one might add despite its team of many very well trained economists the economist magazine once computed just how far the imf s forecasts were off on average over the period 2000 2014 12 for two years from the time of prediction say the growth rate in 2014 predicted in 2012 the average forecast error was 2 8 percentage points that s somewhat better than if they had chosen a random number between 2 percent and 10 percent every year but about as bad as just assuming a constant growth rate of 4 percent we suspect these kinds of things contribute substantially to the general skepticism of economics another big factor that contributes to the trust gap is that academic economists hardly ever take the time to explain the often complex reasoning behind their more nuanced conclusions how did they parse through the many possible alternative interpretations of the evidence what were the dots often from different domains they had to connect to reach the most plausible answer how plausible is it is it worth acting upon or should we wait and see today s media culture does not naturally allow a space for subtle or long winded explanations both of us have had to wrangle with tv anchors to tell our full story often to have it edited out of what gets shown so we recognize why academic economists are often unwilling to take on the responsibility of speaking out it takes a lot of effort to be heard properly and there is always the risk of sounding half baked or having one s careful words manipulated to mean something quite different there are of course those who do speak out but they tend to be with important exceptions those with the strongest opinions and the least patience for engaging with the best work in modern economics some too beholden to some orthodoxy to pay attention to any fact that does not square with it repeat old ideas like a mantra even though they have long been disproved others are there to pour scorn on mainstream economics which it may sometimes deserve but that often means they are unlikely to speak for today s best economic research our sense is that the best economics is frequently the least strident the world is a sufficiently complicated and uncertain place that the most valuable thing economists have to share is often not their conclusion but the path they took to reach it the facts they knew the way they interpreted those facts the deductive steps they took the remaining sources of their uncertainty this is related to the fact that economists are not scientists in the sense physicists are and they often have very little absolute certainty to share anyone who has watched the comic tv series the big bang theory knows that physicists look down on engineers physicists think deep thoughts while engineers muck around with materials and try to give shape to those thoughts or at least that s how the series presents it if there were ever a tv series that made fun of economists we suspect we would be several rungs below engineers or at least the kind of engineers who build rockets unlike engineers or at least those on the big bang theory we cannot rely on some physicist to tell us exactly what it would take for a rocket to escape the earth s gravitational pull economists are more like plumbers we solve problems with a combination of intuition grounded in science some guesswork aided by experience and a bunch of pure trial and error this means economists often get things wrong we will no doubt do so many times in this book not just about the growth rate which is mostly a hopeless exercise but also about somewhat more limited questions like how much carbon taxes will help with climate change how ceos pay might be affected if taxes were to be raised a lot or what universal basic income would do to the structure of employment but economists are not the only ones who make mistakes everyone gets things wrong what is dangerous is not making mistakes but to be so enamored of one s point of view that one does not let facts get in the way to make progress we have to constantly go back to the facts acknowledge our errors and move on besides there is plenty of good economics around good economics starts with troubling facts makes some guesses based on what we already know about human behavior and theories elsewhere shown to work uses data to test those guesses refines or radically alters its line of attack based on the new set of facts and eventually with some luck gets to a solution in this our work is also a lot like medical research siddhartha mukherjee s wonderful book on the fight against cancer the emperor of all maladies tells a story of combining inspired guesswork with careful testing and many rounds of refinement before a new drug gets to the market 13 a big part of the economist s work is very much like that as in medicine we are never sure we have reached the truth just that we have enough faith in an answer to act on it knowing we may have to change our minds later also like in medicine our work does not stop once the basic science is done and the core idea is established the process of rolling out the idea in the real world then begins at one level one could think of this book as a report from the trenches where that research happens what does the best economics of today tell us about the fundamental issues our societies are grappling with we describe how today s best economists think about the world not just their conclusions but also how they got there all the while trying to separate facts and pipe dreams brave assumptions and solid results what we hope for and what we know it is important that in this project we be guided by an expansive notion of what human beings want and what constitutes the good life economists have a tendency to adopt a notion of well being that is often too narrow some version of income or material consumption and yet all of us need much more than that to have a fulfilling life the respect of the community the comforts of family and friends dignity lightness pleasure the focus on income alone is not just a convenient shortcut it is a distorting lens that often has led the smartest economists down the wrong path policy makers to the wrong decisions and all too many of us to the wrong obsessions it is what persuades so many of us that the whole world is waiting at the door to take our well paying jobs it is what has led to a single minded focus on restoring the western nations to some glorious past of fast economic growth it is what makes us simultaneously deeply suspicious of those who don t have money and terrified to find ourselves in their shoes it is also what makes the trade off between the growth of the economy and the survival of the planet seem so stark a better conversation must start by acknowledging the deep human desire for dignity and human contact and to treat it not as a distraction but as a better way to understand each other and to set ourselves free from what appear to be intractable oppositions restoring human dignity to its central place we argue in this book sets off a profound rethinking of economic priorities and the ways in which societies care for their members particularly when they are in need that said on any single issue we will cover in the book or perhaps all of them you may well come to a different conclusion than we do we hope to persuade you not reflexively to agree with us but to adopt a little bit of our methods and share some part of our hopes and fears and perhaps by the end we will really be talking to each other excerpted from good economics for hard times by abhijit v banerjee and esther duflo copyright 2019 available from publicaffairs an imprint of hachette book group inc foreign policy economics biggest success story is a cautionary tale when i was a graduate student of economics in the early to mid 1990s a new idea was just starting to emerge in the field of global development using randomized controlled trials rcts of the sort that had long been common in medicine to assess efforts to assist the poor one of the very first of these studies tested the impact of eradicating parasitic worms on school attendance among children with the researchers picking schools randomly to determine not only how children in these schools were affected but also neighboring ones researchers have since tested the impact of placing additional teachers in a classroom or monitoring teachers attendance with cameras the effect of access to bank or microfinance loans and even the effect of specific appeals made by candidates in an election campaign on voting behavior the growing interest in rcts has culminated in the awarding of the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences last week to several of its pioneers esther duflo abhijit banerjee and michael kremer the rcts they have promoted were described by the royal swedish academy of sciences as having come to entirely dominate development economics the prize committee suggested the rise to centrality of this previously marginal idea was evidence of scientific progress and of a breakthrough that much better enabled us to improve the lives of the worst off people around the world we should all be glad if it were so simple the fact that rcts now so thoroughly shape development economics may be less a success story than a cautionary tale the rct trend has been fueled by two factors one from within economics the other from outside it within the discipline rcts promised to address a problem that had bedeviled economists efforts to empirically assess development programs namely that the people who fared better when there was a change in circumstances were often those who were also more motivated or better positioned in some way to take advantage of it there was no sure way of telling apart which interventions seemed to work because of such factors from which ones worked well because they worked a premise among those who used statistical methods to address this problem had been that experiments on people were not possible the randomistas as they later came to be called cheekily turned this idea on its head proposing precisely to try such experiments yahoo finance nobel prize winning economist esther duflo talks her new book good economics for hard times mit economist esther

there s something about a nice round number that puts people in the mood to assess the passage of time the changes that have occurred and the ones on the horizon now on the cusp of 2020 we re looking back at where we thought we d be by now and asking agents and brokers for their predictions for the next ten years a look back at 2010 predictions ten years ago we ran an editorial project called 2020 re envision the future of real estate brokerage here were some of best predictions that came out of those surveys and a few that didn t quite measure up 1 fee based compensation model in 2010 we thought that most real estate professionals would be working on an à la carte fee based compensation model more than half of those surveyed predicted that competition and online services would drive down commissions and eventually do away with them altogether in favor of flat fees and standard rates 2 technology changes most agents were focused on the role that technology would play for better and for worse in driving the real estate industry the technology they thought would be most game changing 3 d and virtual and augmented reality followed by improved statistics and value estimates as well as social networking platforms 3 less offices more service this prescient article accurately predicted the decline of commercial offices in favor of co working and flexible office space as well as the importance of content creation as a marketing tool in addition it spells out the transformation from traditional real estate brokerage and services to a knowledge information services firm 4 no more agents this article went further with a vision of a fully automated future where the real estate agent has been entirely replaced the emphasis here is on how important it is to focus on the client experience since they are ultimately the ones who choose to continue working with real live agents and brokers 5 new tech bringing new markets finally skype video messaging and other everyday tech is highlighted in a day in the life vignette about how technology can not only simplify and speed up transactions but open up entirely new markets as well predictions for the next ten years drew uher founder and ceo homelight many have surmised that innovation and disruption will mark the end of the real estate agent i don t buy that the modern real estate agent the trusted advisor at the heart of this transaction is more important now than ever at the same time the way people buy and sell homes must change if the past decade was defined by innovation around how to find a home the next decade will be defined by innovation around the mechanics of the transaction simplicity and certainty for clients and real estate agents should be a fundamental service a public utility that the real estate industry provides real estate agents are at the core of this business and will be a driving force behind how customers navigate new real estate technology paul saperstein broker associate the saperstein group brokered by exp realty delray beach florida much of what i see is a shift in values where homeowners want to spend more of their time doing what they love we will see a continuing shift into urban and exurban markets due to buyers who want to trade long commutes for the increased amenities available there condos and townhomes will become more desirable than single family houses because there is less time consuming upkeep and maintenance rather than settle buyers will wait to buy until they can actually afford exactly what they want sellers will have to be more willing to negotiate as the market shifts to a buyers market big picture the states with the most incoming seniors will be the strongest real estate markets while the states with the highest real estate taxes will be the weakest real estate markets jeremy kamm warburg realty new york city since the end of summer there has been a noticeable shift in the market with respect to buyer eagerness what remains certain is that there are still active buyers out there but the urgency to pull the trigger submit an offer and sign a contract is no longer present buyers are taking their time and dragging their feet knowing that they have the upper hand furthermore offers are being submitted and accepted only for sellers to see their buyers walk away from the deal properties that require renovation sit on the market for far too long until they are offered at a major discount those just bring your toothbrush listings are moving as long as pricing reflects current market values louis adler principal and co founder of real new york the rise of technology technology will increasingly play a major role in the real estate sector next year this will be shown in the rise of online home selling apps and platform the use of social media and the growth of smart home technology think of digital assistants or security cams for 2020 we also expect an increase in the number of real estate related technology startups aiming to speed up real estate transactions sustainable real estate the world s increasing interest in environmentally and socially conscious business practices will stimulate the real estate industry to design properties in a greener way in the near future a building s real estate value will be very dependent on its sustainability rating increase in co living arrangements affordable or low cost housing can be very hard to find increasing the market for co living co living is one of the best approaches to finding affordable housing and can have great financial benefits for next year it won t be uncommon to see a rise in co living arrangements among older and younger people santiago arana managing partner of the agency los angeles this coming year is not going to be very different from 2019 although there is a possibility that the second half of the year could slow down due to the elections and political uncertainty bottom line though supply and demand is evident in the area i work in l a s westside the amount of very good homes that are priced well and in good locations is far less than the amount of buyers broker wendy arriz warburg realty new york city buyers are looking for deals and sellers want to maximize profits sale prices this mantra holds true in every market that makes it a broker s market to get deals done i think 2020 will be the year of the native new yorker i think natives who have been sitting on the sidelines are feeling ready to get on with their lives they are a bold smart successful bunch who realize new york city is the greatest place to live in and now is a good a time as ever to address their real estate needs elections typically signal uncertainty which is not conducive to a productive real estate market perhaps with bloomberg entering the election things will be different and more uplifting jessica swersey of warburg realty new york city my overall feeling about 2020 in terms of real estate is to expect more of the same in 2019 with perhaps more hesitation to pull the buying trigger oversaturation of unabsorbed inventory with more inventory to be released will lead us to inventory sitting on the market i think things will hold steady and remain a buyer s market i find there is always uncertainty around an election year no matter who is running i think this will cause a lot of buyers to sit further back and wait to see how things shake out the strategy for 2020 is to make sure sellers are pitch perfect when listing their properties in this market everything from the price to the furniture to the paint must be right if it isn t right the apartment will sit on the market and become stale richard haggerty ceo hudson gateway association of realtors and president onekey gazing into crystal balls for 10 year forecasts can be a tricky business at best we certainly have come a long way during the previous decade with much of the real estate activity centered around the recovery from the recession that began in 2008 as we end the decade we have made up much of the ground we lost during the recession but we continue to be mired in a real estate environment of low inventory and sluggish creation of new housing stock will we be able to escape that cycle in the next decade i think so though it may take several years some of the forces i think will define the 2020s are affordability transportation and infrastructure and climate change affordability continues to haunt real estate markets nationwide with many millennials mired in student loan debt and the rising costs of housing how are they going to enter the market what kind of housing are they going to be seeking what about gen z who will start to enter the market in the coming decade as i look out of my office window in white plains new york i see a hole in the ground that will be replaced by almost 800 multifamily units priced in the 3 000 to 4 500 range per month when i look out of my north facing window of my apartment on the upper east side of manhattan i see a new 24 story luxury condominium being built with asking prices ranging from 2 5 million to 10 million my crystal ball says when it comes to millennials and gen z the multifamily new construction will thrive in the next decade from an affordability perspective and the luxury condo towers will face stiffer headwinds one trend we saw in the 2010s that i believe will continue to be an even greater force in the 2020s is the importance of transportation access to mass transit is a driving force in housing choice and in the coming decade we will see that driverless vehicles and the evolution of drones will reshape our transportation needs which will have a direct impact on real estate development what is interesting is that more and more counties and municipalities are starting to incorporate major transit and infrastructure elements in their development planning as opposed to relying on state or federal initiatives the city of new rochelle in westchester county just north of new york city is a perfect example of the type of comprehensive planning that blends residential commercial and transit components into one master plan that can be marketed to potential residents this type of integrated planning that incorporates major transit and infrastructure elements will become more prevalent in the next decade a significant issue i see shaping real estate development and consumer choice in the next decade is climate change and i certainly hope it will not be the force i anticipate it will be the fact that we are still in a political environment where deniers are rolling back legislation meant slow down the effects of climate change is deeply troubling and disheartening the science has illustrated the causes and effects of climate change a headline in the december 21 issue of the los angeles times read in 2019 california was rocked by earthquakes blackouts and wildfires what does that portend for the next decade how will continued extreme weather impact property insurance and property values it s my fervent hope that the next decade will see development that occurs outside those areas that will be most susceptible to climate change that we embrace new energy sources that have less impact on our environment and that we take dramatic steps to reduce our carbon footprint in how we live and consume resources obviously many other factors will shape real estate in the next decade the growing impact artificial intelligence will have on our daily lives the growing trend of communal living especially in urban areas and reduced reliance on traditional forms of transportation the next decade will also come with many challenges we do not yet see in our crystal balls but i m confident we have the collective tenacity to overcome those challenges when we work together for long term solutions brad pauly broker owner pauly presley realty austin tx i am bullish on the real estate market for 2020 but i don t like to predict too far in the future interest rates should stay low inventory is still low in austin tx and there remains a healthy influx of new austin residents there are some concerns for the next 5 10 years in some cities who have older homeowners but do not have fast growing economies as baby boomers get older and need to sell their properties there may be more homes chasing buyers than the other way around however this should not affect the austin market george case warburg realty new york city i think in areas like manhattan where new construction has been booming there will be a certain amount of buyers fatigue with what seems like an endless number of choices with ironically very limited finish and floor plan distinctions or variations people may be looking to pre war and earlier post war options user friendly amenities will remain important with dog runs roof decks and work friendly spaces becoming increasingly important specifically in manhattan i think the pricing of existing homes will stay relatively flat and new construction will offer lower pricing with added sponsor incentives we ve completely changed our approach to marketing this year and have established a communication plan that will more effectively communicate our skillset and the importance of a full service team to both buyers and sellers as staging marketing and pr are increasingly important to trade real estate so is the effectiveness of communicating who we are as people what skills we bring to our profession and how well we navigate this market political uncertainty a slowing job market global trade friction and new legislation that adversely affect investment in new york real estate will have consequences on the market in 2020 i think as development continues to exhaust demand for housing in the city and as almost every neighborhood has been rediscovered by first time home buyers we ll see a recalibration of priorities in buying and selling in ny interestingly this morphs the role of the agent into a different animal as well as understanding market cues compiling and interpreting analytics and negotiating prowess the new realtor needs to understand design trends marketing trends and stay abreast of evolving avenues for exposure he is a hybrid of marketing and design guru with a reliable financial advisor thrown in for good measure this election year is definitely a nail biter year for everyone conservative or liberal republican or democrat as the country grows increasingly more polarized in terms of political priorities and the potential for another political upheaval the sensitivity will run high in areas on the front of change industry regulation and global trade and their effect on an already slowing job market will certainly influence timing for buyers and sellers buyers with strong financials can take advantage of a lethargic market with low interest rates ruth pfeffer associate broker charles rutenberg realty inc plainview ny in ten years americans will continue to look at real estate investments as a primary source of wealth interest rates have been relatively stable and the economy has been strong there will be corrections along the way but there is no reason to believe that we will see a burst in the housing market bubble like we did 10 years ago broker arlene reed warburg realty new york city slow and steady more of the same us home prices have been growing steadily but at a slower rate than the previous year with slow price growth slight home value appreciation moderate sales and short supply we are seeing conditions leveling 2020 should remain much like 2019 despite a global economic slowdown the us real estate market remains stable our economy is good the job market remains strong and the unemployment rate is down mortgage rates are very low and expected to stay that way there is much talk of a recession but if there is one it will not be due to the housing market what might trigger a recession is trade policy a stock market correction or a geopolitical crisis there is a broad feeling of uncertainty investors are finding a shortage of deals with desirable yields there is plenty of money around but investors are taking a conservative approach 2020 looks to be shaping out as a balanced market prices are high and inventory is tight buyers can take advantage of the low rates and sellers can take advantage of the low inventory it is a seller s market for affordable homes and a buyer s market at the luxury end there is a severe shortage of affordable housing with most housing being built for the wealthier it is important to note that trends do vary by region new york city seems to be on a different path than most of the country for nyc it is definitely a buyer s market there are buyers around but there is no sense of urgency buyers are looking for bargains prices have been declining inventory is up as is the number of days on the market i foresee a sustained slowdown for 2020 in nyc jeff holzmann ceo irm the multi family sector will continue to outperform single family middle sized deal performance will continue to exceed that of small and large sized deals class a markets san francisco nyc and boston will continue to decline while smaller markets in the middle of the country will boom the luxury market will decline as investors anticipate an impending economic slowdown but they will look to other places to put their investments including crowdfunding real estate crowdfunding will enter phase 2 maturing as an industry diversity in investment will become of utmost importance sinéad deróiste era parrish legacy group raleigh durham nc the next 10 years in real estate will be just adventurous as the last 10 years hopefully minus any banking issues or financing crisis now that the market has been cleared for take off plenty of areas are seeing steady growth from new construction communities establishing in pocket areas to high rise developments in urban areas looking to expand housing availability while providing the convenience of location let us not forget how technology is connecting the real estate market internationally which includes new investment groups approaching new markets to develop and improve residential housing the next 10 years will be whatever our economy supports it to be right now with relatively low interest rates zero down financing and other options for obtaining a mortgage it is easier to purchase a home today however the criteria remains strict in an effort to keep us away from overspending on things that impact housing affordability as long as we are continuing to have new life brought into this world there will be a continued need for housing right now in raleigh we are still in a seller s market and 2020 does not look to be changing that so long as the inventory is low and there is a high demand from buyer s for housing we will remain in a seller s market being in a seller s market is neither a good thing or a bad thing in terms of real estate in general understanding that all things in life go in cycles so does the real estate market unless we experience huge job shortages or another financial crisis we could remain in a seller s market for some time broker joel moss warburg realty new york city i think 2020 will continue to be slow and steady with very little change from our current market if anything i think it will be a little slower than 2019 which will lead to an even stronger buyer s market election years are filled with uncertainty and that causes buyers and sellers to proceed cautiously jeremy browne senior vice president ttr sotheby s international realty arlington va i am looking closely at the so called silver tsunami in which 77 million baby boomers will have to sell homes to downsize or move to retirement facilities in the coming years according to researchers at zillow 9 million of these residences will hit the market between 2017 and 2027 by 2037 roughly 21 million homes will have to be sold as a result of baby boomers as real estate agents we need to stay on top of technological advancement in our industry and take a consultative approach with these sellers to navigate through their home sales brandon marianne lee salesperson triplemint new york city people are going to revolt against the terrible quality new construction that we ve seen pop up all over the city already a large portion of my clientele wants renovated pre war construction because they ve heard the horror stories some new construction is amazing but others are a mess the paper thin walls and low grade everything is taking a toll and in the future the craftsmanship and ability to last will be the main thrusts dina ufberg coo of hellorented the real estate industry from rental and residential to commercial will rapidly transition from a manual and paper laden process to an end to end digital experience in the next ten years investors have been pouring money into proptech ventures that utilize machine learning artificial intelligence and real time big data analytics to cater to the needs of tech savvy millennials and gen z who continue to take over the market as the main demographics of renters new tech will make it so renters can lease an apartment in a matter of minutes by filling out a few questions and snapping a selfie that enables an algorithm to quickly build and vet their application in real time real estate tech is working to disrupt all constructs of the market from screening renters and completing background checks in seconds to helping families purchase homes and enabling easier leasing processes that allow a higher number of short term leases and landlords to compete with airbnb and hoteliers jacob henderson salesperson citi habitats brooklyn ny markets tend to follow an eight to ten year cycle so when the market is down it will always come back up it s only a matter of time what happens in the upcoming 2020 presidential election will definitely have an impact on the real estate industry as the leadership in washington exerts considerable influence through the passage of new tax laws and other legislation that affects homeowners the next decade will bring inevitable advances in technology which will likely simplify the home buying process both for consumers and real estate agents i believe that with the increased availability of information insider knowledge of both local market conditions and inventory will be essential for agents we need to embrace the role of trusted advisor and advocate home seekers can already view thousands of properties for sale online but it takes an expert to help them make the dream a reality agents can help buyers decide if a home is a good value understand financing options and educate them on how the local market has been trending with the rise of information the ability of an agent to bring creative solutions to the table will be even more important in the future patrick fogarty hilton hyland los angeles i forecast the market continuing with stable growth for 2020 and the next 10 years i believe interest rates will remain historically low and attractive to buyers spurring continued purchases i see buyers having confidence in the market and continuing to buy but being very considered with regard to price in light of the upcoming us elections i think as long as sellers price their properties appropriately they will continue to sell promptly raf howery ceo kukun roofing and window demand will grow disproportionately climate change severe storms aging homes and millennials buying in urban areas will fuel the demand and as a result drive up costs millennials will drive more renovation in big cities as they buy older smaller homes and flip them to modern architecture sfr single family rentals companies will gobble up more homes in mid tier cities driving home prices up and fueling more renovations there will be a shortage of available construction workers as older contractors retire and fewer young contractors enter the field all of the above will raise the cost of renovations specifically labor costs jim armstrong jg real estate philadelphia i live and sell real estate in philadelphia the sixth largest market in the us with more than 1 58 million people philadelphia real estate has appreciated 147 percent since 2000 while the inventory has decreased by 4 8 percent over the last year due to a strong economy growing labor market and affordable housing prices attracting new yorkers who ve been priced out of their own market philadelphia s population is growing faster than the national average factor in the large number of millennials turning 30 and buying their first homes next year and philly will continue to be an increasingly competitive housing market in addition the short and long term rental market will continue to grow as philly has the third largest student population on the east coast and is a hot destination with numerous recent honors based on these factors my 10 year predictions include a continued shortage of housing inventory increased demand for traditional rentals increased demand for airbnb rentals increased demand for first time homes nicholas oliver principal broker homedax real estate new york city we anticipate sustained price appreciation in residential real estate over the next decade fueled by rising incomes and a resurgence in household formation driven by a strong us economy key risks to residential real estate prices include the passage of tenant friendly legislation such as what was passed recently in new york global conflicts an increase in redistributive policies or taxes in the united states or a prolonged slowdown in economic growth jason kraus broker re max advanced realty indianapolis in the housing market is set to continue on course for 2020 the market has remained strong for the last two years mainly because of a lack of inventory and new buyers continue to enter the market with historically low mortgage rates don t expect a distinct change in the market until inventory balances as long as we have a large pool of buyers vying for a limited amount of homes in their price range we will continue to see prices rise in addition we will continue to have multiple offers and a fast moving real estate market this is especially true for homes priced within reach of a growing market of first time home buyers we have seen a balancing of the market and inventory in higher priced homes due to the strong demand lenders have continued to roll out loan options for well qualified buyers you don t need to have 20 percent down to realize your dream of home ownership in fact lenders have continued to provide low down payment options including 3 percent and 1 percent down conventional loan options that is even lower than the 3 5 percent down traditionally needed for an fha loan the first time home buyer options that disappeared after the housing crash are making a comeback as well expect this trend to continue as lenders look to bring more millennial buyers into the housing market for seller be prepared to support the strong values and high prices that buyers are providing as prices continue to rise buyers are being much more detailed during the inspection process in situations where buyers have been in multiple offer situations and paid a premium to be the selected offer they are expecting a product worth the expenditure so in 2020 the inspection period will be increasingly important to the transaction buyers will be scrutinizing the home to ensure their investment is sound so sellers will need to have repairs addressed before listing or face a growing challenge to keep deals together through the inspection process 2020 will continue a focus on outdoor living space this is true for entertaining but also pet ownership studies indicate that the largest influx of buyers into the market are millennials and they also represent the largest population of animal and dog ownership that unique stat means they have a greater interest to make sure their home is pet friendly so fenced backyards will continue to be a highly sought after feature in addition a patio deck or relaxing area to watch fido or spot run and play will continue to be important so if you are a seller don t just focus on kitchens and bathroom to add value a great spot to add value often for less of an investment is that outdoor living space nicholas henton associate re max professionals stillwater mn the outlook for home buyers in 2020 will be similar to how it was in 2019 for the most part interest rates are projected to remain low with almost all banks and economists in agreement that they will stay below 4 percent for a 30 year fixed mortgage throughout 2020 housing inventory will remain tight with affordable homes for first time home buyers being harder to come by for the first time millennials will make up 50 percent of the home buying market more than the baby boomers and gen xers combined we will have an average first time home buyer age around 30 that number continues to rise as homes become increasingly expensive buyers are still carrying student loan debt and generational philosophies and goals have changed from previous years urban homes close to work are going to continue to increase in demand as the millennials typically prioritize shorter commute times over larger homes and yards the next largest segment of the market will be those in the 35 45 year old bracket they are buying their 2nd or possibly third home that they plan to live in until they are nearing retirement these will be your suburban home buyers focused on larger homes that are well designed with open floorplans and located in desirable school districts along with school districts another motivating factor for these buyers will be proximity to popular dining and entertainment spots jamie safier douglas elliman new york city it s always hard to predict the future with 100 percent certainty but i think 2020 will be a good year for both buyers and sellers across the us with mortgage rates low and actually predicted to keep dropping it s a great time to get a loan which benefits both sides and with the job market likely holding steady more millennials who have been renters for most of the last decade will begin to take the plunge from renting into home ownership over the course of the next decade i think the industry will continue to change as it has over the last few years but some things will stay the same while we have seen technology impact the industry in a number of ways and a lot of talk about how agents are being replaced at the end of the day buying or selling a home is a long and tiresome process and frankly something that an expert in the field will always make much much less of a hassle just like webmd and other sites of that ilk will never replace medical professionals real estate technology can never fully replace the benefits one gains from having an expert real estate agent facilitate the home buying and selling experience ryan hardy broker gold coast realty chicago chicago in the next 10 years i think people will look back and wish they bought a house or condo in 2020 homeowners who bought a home in 2010 made a great decision in hindsight but it wasn t so obvious at the time there was a lot of uncertainty and nervousness in the real estate market back then and i think that s true today as well buyers today are battling with uncertainty about the economy politics and prices and that s caused the market to slow and has also put pressure on prices there are good deals out there right now and interest rates are extremely low it s impossible to pick the exact bottom but with real estate time is your friend even if the market dips a little lower in 10 years i think today s buyers will be very happy with their decision ruth shin founder and ceo propertynest brooklyn ny concierge services for resells most home buyers are looking for places that are move in ready with no or minimal improvements and alterations required in 2020 more brokerage services will start offering concierge services dedicated to sprucing up the value of homes prior to their sale these concierge services include inspections repairs cleaning de cluttering and staging among other services growing availability of bridge loans in 2020 home buyers will get broader access to bridge loans these loans more and more offered by brokerages and independent lending firms enable resellers to borrow money to purchase a new home before selling the old one typically bridge loans don t require monthly payments for the first few months bridge loans reduce uncertainty and take the pressure off to sell and buy and finance all at the exact same time more importantly the delayed monthly payments give homeowners the time to sell their home and pay off the loan after the move we will see the number of residential brokerage firms that offer bridge loan programs to their clients increase next year brian beatty team leader brian beatty team of keller williams realty charleston sc host of the brian beatty real estate show on 1250 wtma moving forward millennials are going to start to make up the vast majority of the market this is the generation who puts more value on experiences than assets but that s starting to change these people many of whom are already doing really well financially are starting to put down roots and because they are advancing in their careers they don t necessarily need to hop into the starter home market in fact we are working with millennials who are buying 400 000 to 700 000 homes in their 20s and 30s and skipping the more inexpensive and smaller homes altogether here s the challenge there isn t a ton of inventory available in the mid tier 400 000 to 700 000 range the people who currently own homes in that range are looking on zillow trulia realtor com before putting their homes on the market only if they find their perfect house will they then make a move to put their own home on the market this is creating a traffic jam at those price points so now we have two groups of people in the same boat millennials who have enough wealth to skip the traditional starter homes and gen x boomers who aren t selling their 400 000 homes because the inventory just isn t there to entice them to move what does it all mean the 100 000 to 350 000 are going to keep selling there will continue to be buyers at that level but as the traffic jam continues in the mid tier market we could start to see prices getting driven up in order to entice sellers to finally make that move and sell to a pool which includes older millennials will that over inflate later into the 2020s only time will tell tracy mclaughlin director of luxury estates the agency marin county ca since the financial markets remain very strong interest rates remain very low there is talk of rising inflation and continued low inventory which are all excellent barometers for a continued strong residential market especially in places like the bay area in northern california which continues to have excellent job growth with high wages and significant opportunities for these reasons i do not anticipate any decline or real softening in the residential markets that being said i do feel buyers feel the market is still a bit inflated and there continues to be a struggle between seller s expectations for price and what buyers want to pay even in a strong market typically election years are challenging for our business however again based on all of these strong economic indicators i feel very bullish about 2020 for residential real estate christy murdock edgar is a

in an earlier article fair org 12 18 19 regarding the washington post s afghanistan papers 12 9 19 i discussed how the post s exposé also exposed the post as one of the primary vehicles us officials use to spread their lies and why it s impossible for corporate media outlets like the post to raise more substantive questions about the deceptive nature of us foreign policy but those aren t the only significant takeaways the afghanistan papers should also be considered an excellent case study of contemporary colonial propaganda and yet another example of corporate media criticizing us wars without opposing us imperialism edward herman and noam chomsky s famous analysis of media coverage of the vietnam war in manufacturing consent found that questions of the invasion s tactics and costs to the us dominated the debate because the media absorbed the framework of government propaganda regarding the necessity of military intervention the righteousness of the american cause and the us s nobility of intent decades later herman and chomsky s propaganda model of corporate media is still a useful tool in understanding the post s afghanistan papers the post advanced the centuries old colonial narrative of the empire s good intentions gone awry when it argued that the us inadvertently built a corrupt dysfunctional afghan government and that this illustrated that even some of the most well intentioned projects could boomerang in fact the post dedicated a whole section of the afghanistan papers to propagating this standard colonial narrative called stranded without a strategy which argued at length us and allied officials admitted they veered off in directions that had little to do with al qaeda or 9 11 by expanding the original mission they said they adopted fatally flawed warfighting strategies based on misguided assumptions about a country they did not understand diplomats and military commanders acknowledged they struggled to answer simple questions who is the enemy whom can we count on as allies how will we know when we have won their strategies differed but bush and obama both committed early blunders that they never recovered from according to the interviews the post is so eager to push this colonial narrative of noble incompetence that a later report 12 11 19 on key takeaways from the afghanistan papers claimed that us officials failed to align policy solutions with the challenges they confronted having strategic drift in place of coherent us policy for afghanistan as noted earlier one method of discerning whether us officials are being dishonest not incompetent is to check whether the pretexts for invading and occupying another country are constantly changing but the imperial utility of a cost benefit or tactical critique of us wars is the implication that immoral and illegal invasions like the afghanistan war are justifiable if the us can achieve its goals and it enables future invasions provided us wars are better fought next time it s an intentionally nebulous criterion since there are always tactical and cost benefit questions to be raised for any military endeavor which is why this kind of critique can enable perpetual interventions in the service of us imperialism indeed the post actually admits this when it mentioned that the afghanistan inspector general s secretive lessons learned project was meant to diagnose policy failures in afghanistan so the united states would not repeat the mistakes the next time it invaded a country or tried to rebuild a shattered one furthermore at several times the post parroted statements from us officials claiming that some of the lessons learned about their strategic failures were that the us should have killed more people in pakistan and threatened to stay in afghanistan indefinitely without any pushback the post parroted claims that obama s strategy of imposing strict deadlines and promising to bring home all troops by the end of his presidency was destined to fail because the taliban could just wait him out why was obama s broken promise an artificial date for ending the war before it was over if the us truly prioritized preserving taxpayer dollars and the lives of us troops and afghans the open secret is that the us could simply end the afghanistan war any time it wanted to by announcing an unconditional unilateral withdrawal without negotiating with the taliban in his december 2016 lessons learned interview crocker said the only way to force pakistan to change would be for trump to keep us troops in afghanistan indefinitely and give them the green light to hunt the taliban on pakistani territory in another lessons learned interview cited in the afghanistan papers 12 9 19 regarding the strategic challenge of pakistan supporting the taliban and sheltering their leaders despite receiving billions of dollars a year to fight terrorism the post uncritically cited a us official s bloodthirsty support for indefinite occupation and killing taliban members anywhere in pakistan it would allow him to say you worry about our reliability you worry about our withdrawal from afghanistan i m here to tell you that i m going to keep troops there as long as i feel we need them there is no calendar that s the good news the bad news for you is we re going to kill taliban leaders wherever we find them baluchistan punjab downtown islamabad we re going to go find them so maybe you want to do a strategic recalculation while pushing this colonial narrative the post actually tried to make the absurd case that some of the us s strategic failures stemmed from being too generous to afghans and lying to the american public about not wanting to do nation building asserting that nation building is exactly what the united states has tried to do in war battered afghanistan on a colossal scale americans praising their own generosity is a hallmark feature of american colonialism which extended to framing atrocities like slavery the displacement of native americans and the extermination of vietnamese people as generous and the post continues this long tradition by parroting us officials who believed that congress and the white house made matters worse by drenching the destitute country with far more money than it could possibly absorb apparently the problem is not that the us intentionally funnels money to enrich us investors and prop up puppet governments subservient to the us but that the us engages in thoughtless charity the scale of the corruption was the unintended result of swamping the war zone with far more aid and defense contracts than impoverished afghanistan could absorb there was so much excess financed by american taxpayers that opportunities for bribery and fraud became almost limitless according to the interviews the post 12 9 19 claimed that no nation needed more building than afghanistan following continuous warfare since 1979 when it was invaded by the soviet union the post cited frustrated statements from officials working for usaid and the national endowment for democracy ned complaining that the us was wasting too much money on nation building for primitive people in a largely non market society who bartered for items instead of using currency and lacked the education and technical expertise necessary to maintain huge infrastructure projects with officials claiming we were bringing 21st century stuff to a society living in a different time period left unmentioned were us efforts in 1979 to sabotage an indigenous afghan communist movement that was making strides toward ostensible us goals like the education of girls eradicating opium production and expanding access to healthcare by knowingly increasing the probability of luring the russians into their own vietnam war carter s national security advisor zbigniew brzezinski later defended this ruthless strategy that secret operation was an excellent idea it had the effect of drawing the russians into the afghan trap and you want me to regret it nor was there any mention of usaid and the ned being corrupt propaganda arms of the us state department to subvert leftist governments often serving as a pipeline of taxpayer dollars into investors pockets under the guise of promoting development and democracy some us officials even argued that the rampant fraud and waste from american aid contractors were so parasitic that it would be better to funnel contracts to corrupt afghans who would probably take 20 for their personal use or for their extended families and friends than a bunch of expensive american experts who would waste 80 to 90 of the funds on overhead and profit and despite the post s attempts to portray the us as inadvertently building a corrupt dysfunctional afghan government that remains dependent on us military power for its survival it s hard to see how other candid statements about the us military and agencies like the cia giving cash to purchase loyalty from afghan government officials religious leaders and warlords viewed by many afghans as cruel despots don t contradict that assertion in fact herman and chomsky s study the washington connection and third world fascism found that corruption is a primary feature of us client states like the corrupt afghan government with us aid and a favorable foreign investment climate being negatively related to the condition of human rights in these countries hence the numerous reports of afghanistan being open for business tellingly us officials in the afghanistan papers remarked that while the us actively replaced officials seeking to combat corruption or knowingly looked away and let the thievery become more entrenched than ever and retained support for us installed cia assets like hamid karzai who committed mass voter fraud us officials had a dogmatic adherence to free market principles this is supposed to explain why despite their good intentions they consciously imposed economic policies that enriched foreign investors and increased poverty instead of policies that would help afghanistan because us officials considered them incompatible with capitalism this is consistent with michael parenti s study of us foreign policy the sword and the dollar finding that us commitments to democracy and anti corruption are dispensable and easily abandoned indicating insincerity while commitments to opening countries like afghanistan to foreign investment and free market capitalism are uncompromisable but does the us have good intentions then what explains the bush administration s ultimatum to the taliban on behalf of building a pipeline with the unocal corporation to accept our offer of a carpet of gold or we bury you under a carpet of bombs informing the pakistani and indian governments at least five weeks prior to the 9 11 attacks that it would attack afghanistan before the end of october why install a former unocal consultant like karzai as afghanistan s new president after the invasion what explains the refusal to put afghanistan on the state department s list of states sponsoring terrorism despite knowing the taliban were sheltering bin laden other than the fact that it would prevent us oil and construction companies from entering into an agreement with kabul to construct pipelines to central asian oil and gas fields the immediate construction of us military bases and the resulting private businesses servicing them generated massive corporate profits for the military industrial complex and served as guardians for us corporations extracting mineral wealth indications of a planned long term occupation and a launching pad for attacks within and beyond afghanistan s borders explicit statements from the bush doctrine which continued to guide the obama and trump administrations national security strategy explained that real freedom means free trade the moral principle that if others make something that you value you should be able to buy it these are the serious logically consistent explanations for the us invasion and occupation of afghanistan the washington post s afghanistan papers and trove of documents are worth reading through but it s also a contradictory mess containing many distortions and lies by omission the scandal of the afghanistan war is not that the us entered into and prolonged an unwinnable war the scandal is that the us empire s invasion of afghanistan is a war crime in violation of international law and has inflicted imperial violence on the afghan people and it would remain a scandal even if the us accomplished all of its ostensible goals even as the post s scoop exposes us officials as liars and highlights the danger of credulously accepting their ideological framework because they rely so heavily on those officials narratives the afghanistan papers still manage to propagate the old colonial narrative of the empire s good intentions thwarted by backwards foreigners

unfettered strategic competition would almost certainly lead eventually from an escalating cold war to a hot war with disastrous implications for the world new york financial markets were cheered recently by the news that the united states and china have reached a phase one deal to prevent further escalation of their bilateral trade war but there is actually very little to cheer about in exchange for china s tentative commitment to buy more us agricultural and some other goods and modest concessions on intellectual property rights and the renminbi the us agreed to withhold tariffs on another 160 billion worth of chinese exports and to roll back some of the tariffs introduced on september 1 the good news for investors is that the deal averted a new round of tariffs that could have tipped the us and the global economy into recession and crashed global stock markets the bad news is that it represents just another temporary truce amid a much larger strategic rivalry encompassing trade technology investment currency and geopolitical issues large scale tariffs will remain in place and escalation may well resume if either side shirks its commitments as a result a broad sino american decoupling will likely intensify over time and is all but certain in the technology sector the us regards china s quest to achieve autonomy and then supremacy in cutting edge technologies including artificial intelligence 5g robotics automation biotech and autonomous vehicles as a threat to its economic and national security following its blacklisting of huawei a 5g leader and other chinese tech firms the us will continue to try to contain the growth of china s tech industry cross border flows of data and information will also be restricted raising concerns about a splinternet between the us and china and owing to increased us scrutiny chinese foreign direct investment in america has already collapsed by 80 percent from its 2017 level now new legislative proposals threaten to bar us public pension funds from investing in chinese firms restrict chinese venture capital investments in the us and force some chinese firms to delist from us stock exchanges altogether the us has also grown more suspicious of us based chinese students and scholars who may be in a position to steal us technological know how or engage in outright espionage and china for its part will increasingly seek to circumvent the us controlled international financial system and to shield itself from america s weaponization of the dollar to that end china could be planning to launch a sovereign digital currency or an alternative to the western controlled society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication swift cross border payments system it also may try to internationalize the role of alipay and wechat pay sophisticated digital payments platforms that have already replaced most cash transactions within china in all of these dimensions recent developments suggest a broader shift in the sino american relationship toward de globalization economic and financial fragmentation and balkanization of supply chains the 2017 white house national security strategy and the 2018 us national defense strategy regard china as a strategic competitor that must be contained security tensions between the two are brewing all over asia from hong kong and taiwan to the east and south china seas the us fears that chinese president xi jinping having abandoned his predecessor deng xiaoping s advice to hide your strength and bide your time has embarked on a strategy of aggressive expansionism china meanwhile fears that the us is trying to contain its rise and deny its legitimate security concerns in asia it remains to be seen how the rivalry will evolve unfettered strategic competition would almost certainly lead eventually from an escalating cold war to a hot war with disastrous implications for the world what is clear is the hollowness of the old western consensus according to which admitting china into the world trade organization and accommodating its rise would compel it to become a more open society with a freer and fairer economy but under xi china has created an orwellian surveillance state and doubled down on a form of state capitalism that is inconsistent with the principles of free and fair trade and it is now using its growing wealth to flex its military muscles and exercise influence across asia and around the world the question then is whether there are sensible alternatives to an escalating cold war some western commentators such as former australian prime minister kevin rudd advocate a managed strategic competition others speak of a sino american relationship built around co opetition likewise cnn s fareed zakaria recommends that the us pursue both engagement and deterrence vis à vis china these are all variants of the same idea the sino american relationship should involve cooperation in some areas especially where global public goods such as the climate and international trade and finance are involved while accepting that there will be constructive competition in others the problem of course is us president donald trump who does not seem to understand that managed strategic competition with china requires good faith engagement and cooperation with other countries to succeed the us needs to work closely with its allies and partners to bring its open society open economy model into the twenty first century the west may not like china s authoritarian state capitalism but it must get its own house in order western countries need to enact economic reforms to reduce inequality and prevent damaging financial crises as well as political reforms to contain the populist backlash against globalization while still upholding the rule of law unfortunately the current us administration lacks any such strategic vision the protectionist unilateralist illiberal trump apparently prefers to antagonize us friends and allies leaving the west divided and ill equipped to defend and reform the liberal world order that it created the chinese probably prefer that trump be re elected in 2020 he may be a nuisance in the short run but given enough time in office he will destroy the strategic alliances that form the foundation of american soft and hard power like a real life manchurian candidate trump will make china great again nouriel roubini is chairman of roubini macro associates and professor of economics at new york university s stern school of business his website is

part iii of five part series austerity on the island while arguably necessary in the long term the puerto rico oversight board s austerity may be painful to many residents puerto rico s residents are especially vulnerable with 44 9 living in poverty compared with 13 4 of the u s populace who are under the poverty line according to the puerto rico institute of statistics a third of the island s residents are food insecure a homeless man rests in front of a closed restaurant in puerta de tierra sector in san juan march 11 2014 puerto rico on tuesday sold 3 5 billion of junk rated bonds at a

puerto rico s economy which has been shrinking nearly non stop since 2006 and suffers from a dwindling population high unemployment now topping 15 percent and chronic government budget deficits reuters ana martinez puerto rico tags politics business gm1ea3c0htk01 ana martinez reuters the board s first fiscal plan adopted in march 2017 specified that effects on the budget of measures cutting spending would be 1 85 times that of tax revenue measures that plan covered fiscal years 2017 through 2026 the latest fiscal plan adopted in may indicated that the spending cuts would be expected to create 5 33 times the effect of the revenue measures the plan covered fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2024 at points the board has rejected the use of the term austerity to describe its actions rather it has said the fiscal plan s increases in taxes and fees would be to right rate them similarly it has said the plan s cuts in departmental spending would be to right size them yet the cuts to spending and increases to taxes meet the definition of austerity though such austerity may be at least somewhat necessary scholars tell us it has a social cost david stuckler and sanjay basu argued in 2013 that austerity policies lead to suicides deaths and poor health in an opinion piece in the new york times titled how austerity kills they said in the great recession countries that slashed health

his book austerity the history of a dangerous idea economist mark blyth said when government services are cut to balance budgets it is those on the bottom 40 of the economic ladder who are generally hurt by contrast in their book austerity when it works and when it doesn t by alberto alesina and two other economists say that many governments can make cuts to spending without hurting the poor many observers have raised concerns about the impact of the puerto rico board s social policies in a march 2017 paper posted to the site of the center for a new economy policy director sergio marxuach said that economists have varying models about the negative economic impacts of spending cuts and tax increases on economic activity he said the board s then current 10 year fiscal plan would lead to reductions in the island s gross national product of between 11 5 and 18 2 depending on which model one used this in an economy that has already contracted about 14 since 2006 marxuach said the board disagrees with marxuach s economic predictions they say that the fiscal adjustments will have a negative impact however stabilization is a precondition of growth oversight board executive director jaresko said the positive economic impact of federal aid will outweigh the negative effects of the fiscal adjustments she said the board has mandated increases in revenues through measures to improve tax paying compliance and through tax increases on gaming tobacco licenses and other things and by introducing taxes on medical marijuana and airbnb rentals none of these are broad scale increases on the poor however a greater percentage of low income people than high income people smoke so the tobacco increase will hit them disproportionately other poor people will have a hard time paying the increased fines and license and permit costs the board s spending cuts are more likely to incur pain on residents the agencies expected to experience the biggest cuts from fiscal 2019 to fiscal year 2024 are k 12 education with 2 226 billion and corrections with 665 million current fiscal year general fund spending totals 2 4 billion for k 12 education and 396 million for corrections the board through its fiscal plan has made an effort to minimize the spending cuts impact on the populace in many circumstances the board plans to gain savings through reorganizing the provision of services rather than through cuts in services it s unclear whether this approach in the best of circumstances could succeed in reducing spending as much as the board hopes by the board s own admission in its document commonwealth fiscal plan risks from september there is a real danger that the approach won t be properly implemented in that document the board said there was a danger that municipalities and the university of puerto rico won t make enough progress in reducing their costs forcing the commonwealth government to continue to subsidize them the document also mentions the possibility that poor implementation and new federal benefit requirements might make health care costs rise more quickly than projected according to the urban institute 35 4 of puerto ricans report fair or poor health versus 17 9 of u s residents so if the board was to go beyond structural approaches to cutting health care costs it would be affecting an already suffering population in the fiscal plan the board acknowledges the possibility that its health care spending cut approach won t lead to adequate savings as a backup it suggests that the island s medicaid program vital might end coverage of certain things that some other states don t cover examples of these include dentistry vision and hearing exams prescription glasses and physical therapy cuts of these things would certainly incur real pain in the populace even the cuts to funding of the healthcare industry may harm provision of healthcare on the island according to the u s department of health and human services the island has half the per capita presence of critical field medical specialists compared to the mainland according to the board prior to hurricane maria in september 2017 500 doctors per year were leaving the island on july 1 2017 puerto rico reduced fees paid to medical providers and particularly specialists this led some to leave the island for the continental u s from january 2018 to september 2019 the federal government provided additional funding for vital through the bipartisan budget act of 2018 allowing puerto rico s health administration to relax the reduction in medical fees in response to a sharp increase in emigration of specialty providers that was hindering delivery of necessary care the board said in its may certified fiscal plan with the loss of that the act s money puerto rico s government has increased its contribution to vital to maintain the level of funding in december that government got president trump to approve two years of medicaid funding at a somewhat lower level than the local government had requested the local government had also requested four years of funding among the features of the approved funding will be continued payments to providers at levels equal to 70 of medicare scheduled levels without this funding the payments would have gone to well below 70 if reimbursement levels go down again in two years or thereafter the island may again experience rapid emigration of needed doctors this is an example of how the board s cuts to non service items can end up having a harmful impact on services the board is also requiring cuts to pensions being paid to puerto rico retirees while these are fairly modest at 8 5 they do address all seniors being paid more than 1 200 a month in pensions about 61 of retirees will see no cut because they make less than that most of the rest are paid less than 2 000 per month so the cut will have a real impact according to the gov alejandro garcía padilla 2016 proposed fiscal plan the average annual pension benefit per beneficiary in puerto rico was 14 112 compared with an average of 26 455 for public pensions across the u s in april 2018 center of a new economy policy director sergio marxuach wrote of the deeper cuts in pensions that were then proposed the social effects are foreseeable chronic illnesses become acute when spending on medicines is cut increases in the poverty rate and malnutrition among the elderly segment of the population there is an increase in people postponing retirement and the number of people who literally die working an increase in the abandonment of the elderly and an eventual decline in life expectancy in response jaresko said the board was seeking to avoid the social impacts described by marxuach without some cuts there would be no pensions for anyone she argued adding that the board isn t cutting pensions for people near the poverty level given the retirees are unsecured creditors the court won t approve a plan of adjustment without cuts to pensions she said the goal has been to do the minimum necessary to get it approved next on 12 27 what critics say the oversight board overlooked
