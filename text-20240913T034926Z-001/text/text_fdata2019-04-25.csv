update on economic and monetary developments summary the information that has become available since the governing council s monetary policy meeting in march confirms slower growth momentum extending into the current year while there are signs that some of the idiosyncratic domestic factors dampening growth are fading global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets at the same time further employment gains and rising wages continue to underpin the resilience of the domestic economy and gradually rising inflation pressures however an ample degree of monetary accommodation remains necessary to safeguard favourable financing conditions and support the economic expansion and thus to ensure that inflation remains on a sustained path towards levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term significant monetary policy stimulus is being provided by the governing council s forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the new series of targeted longer term refinancing operations tltros survey indicators of global economic activity have weakened in the first quarter of 2019 in particular global trade has continued to slow down amid the turning of the global industrial cycle and heightened trade tensions global inflation has subsided in the first months of this year largely on account of a lower contribution from the energy component euro area government bond yields overall declined somewhat as global risk free rates decreased and the eonia forward curve shifted downwards developments in sovereign bond spreads exhibited some heterogeneity across the euro area equity prices rose amid lower risk free rates and stable and low volatility accordingly yield spreads on corporate bonds narrowed in foreign exchange markets the euro remained broadly unchanged in trade weighted terms euro area real gdp rose by 0 2 quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2018 following an increase of 0 1 in the third quarter incoming data continued to be weak mainly on account of the slowdown in external demand compounded by country and sector specific factors as the impact of these factors is turning out to be somewhat longer lasting the slower growth momentum is expected to extend into the current year looking ahead the effect of these adverse factors is expected to unwind the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions further employment gains and rising wages and the ongoing albeit somewhat slower expansion in global activity according to eurostat s flash estimate euro area annual hicp inflation was 1 4 in march 2019 after 1 5 in february 2019 reflecting mainly a decline in food services and non energy industrial goods price inflation on the basis of current futures prices for oil headline inflation is likely to decline over the coming months measures of underlying inflation have remained generally muted but labour cost pressures have strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets looking ahead underlying inflation is expected to increase gradually over the medium term supported by the ecb s monetary policy measures the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth regarding monetary developments broad money m3 growth increased to 4 3 in february 2019 from 3 8 in january m3 growth continues to be backed by bank credit creation and the narrow monetary aggregate m1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth the annual growth rate of loans to non financial corporations rebounded to 3 7 in february 2019 and has moderated in recent months reflecting the typical lagged reaction to the slowdown in economic growth the annual growth rate of loans to households remained broadly unchanged at 3 3 in february the euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2019 suggests that overall bank lending conditions remained favourable combining the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis the governing council concluded that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term on the basis of this assessment the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged and continues to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term the governing council confirmed that the eurosystem will continue to reinvest in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when the governing council starts raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation the precise terms of the new tltro series will be communicated at one of the governing council s forthcoming meetings in particular the pricing of the new tltro iii operations will take into account a thorough assessment of the bank based transmission channel of monetary policy as well as further developments in the economic outlook in the context of the ecb s regular assessment the governing council will also consider whether the preservation of the favourable implications of negative interest rates for the economy requires the mitigation of their possible side effects if any on bank intermediation the governing council reiterated its readiness to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the governing council s inflation aim in a sustained manner external environment global survey indicators point to some deceleration in global activity in the first quarter of 2019 the global composite output purchasing managers index pmi excluding the euro area rose in march see chart 1 as an increase in the services sector more than offset a marginal decline in manufacturing in quarterly terms however the pmi in the first quarter of 2019 is below the level recorded in 2017 and the first half of 2018 consistent with some deceleration in the global growth momentum across advanced economies the us markit pmi was broadly unchanged while the all industry survey indicator published by the institute for supply management ism declined from rather high levels during the first quarter pmis also decreased in the united kingdom and japan on the back of weaker readings in march in emerging market economies the quarterly pmi picked up strongly in brazil while decreasing in india and russia the pmi remained unchanged in china in the first quarter although it recorded a strong increase in march chart 1 global composite output pmi diffusion index sources haver analytics markit and ecb staff calculations notes the latest observations are for march 2019 long term average refers to the period from january 1999 to march 2019 global trade indicators signal a continued weakness at the start of the year the volume of merchandise imports decreased by 1 9 in january 2019 in three month on three month terms particularly on account of sharp declines in asian countries this decrease is partly related to the significant volatility of chinese trade data around the lunar new year which makes it difficult to interpret the january data at the same time the pmi new export orders remained below the expansionary threshold in march see chart 2 a broader measure based on a principal component of leading indicators of global trade qualifies this picture and points to a marginal increase in world trade in the first quarter of 2019 following subdued developments in the second half of last year the ongoing slowdown in world trade is partly driven by the turning of the global industrial cycle a maturing global business cycle typically leads via lower investment activity to a moderation in global trade this pattern has been amplified at the current juncture by the fact that much of the weakness in the global economy has been concentrated in industrial activity in fact the industrial and trade cycles tend to be highly correlated chart 2 global trade and surveys left hand scale three month on three month percentage changes right hand scale diffusion index sources markit cpb netherlands bureau for economic policy analysis and ecb staff calculations note the latest observations are for january 2019 for global merchandise imports and march 2019 for the pmis world trade has also been affected by other factors including heightened trade tensions us imports from china have fallen particularly sharply in the industries affected by the tariffs but a sharp moderation has also occurred across other asian economies while this could be a sign of weaker domestic demand in china it could also be the result of industry specific developments particularly in electronic products and cars both sectors are highly trade intensive and have a high share in asian trade box 1 discusses the role that a maturing tech cycle may have played in the trade slowdown observed in china and other key asian economies global inflation remained stable in february annual consumer price inflation in the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd countries remained unchanged in february at 2 1 following a sequence of declines since the peak registered in october last year excluding food and energy prices oecd annual inflation slowed marginally to 2 1 tight labour market conditions across major advanced economies have so far translated into only moderate wage increases suggesting that the underlying inflation pressures remain subdued looking ahead inflation is expected to remain subdued in the short term while diminishing spare capacity at the global level is expected to support underlying inflation in the medium term oil prices have continued to increase since mid march after the surge in mid february which followed the release of data showing an improvement in opec compliance with its supply cut agreements oil prices have risen further since early march to a level of around 70 usd barrel after opec reset its two year old agreement at the end of last year in an effort to reduce oil supply overall production by the cartel has decreased since january 2019 moreover us sanctions against iran and venezuela continued to affect supply exacerbated further by power outages in venezuela which weighed on output among non oil commodities metal prices and food prices have remained broadly unchanged since early march the expansion in the us remains sustained but shows signs of maturing us real gdp expanded at an annual rate of 2 2 in the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase in real gdp in the fourth quarter mainly reflected positive contributions from private consumption and non residential fixed investment while the contributions from net exports and government spending were negative while overall gdp growth remains supported by strong fundamentals economic activity is expected to decelerate in the first quarter of this year amid one off adverse factors such as the partial government shutdown and mixed incoming data at the same time inflationary pressures remain contained in spite of rising wages annual headline cpi inflation slowed down slightly to 1 5 in february the decline in inflation was mainly driven by a sharp drop in energy prices cpi inflation excluding food and energy prices dropped marginally to 2 1 in february by contrast in line with a tight labour market average hourly earnings rose by 3 4 year on year continuing an upward trend that started in 2015 economic activity slowed in japan in early 2019 following a rebound towards the end of last year real gdp increased by 0 5 quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2018 mainly supported by domestic demand particularly non residential investment however high frequency indicators point to a slowdown in underlying momentum at the start of the year industrial production was very weak currently standing below the q4 2018 levels january february average real goods exports are lower than last year suggesting ongoing weakness in external demand consumer price inflation continued to slow at the start of 2019 largely reflecting developments in food and energy prices annual headline inflation declined to 0 2 in both january and february reflecting mostly a decline in the energy price contribution and strong declines in fresh food prices core inflation i e excluding food and energy has picked up slightly to 0 3 in the united kingdom gdp growth slowed markedly in the final quarter of 2018 in an environment of high uncertainty related to brexit quarterly real gdp growth slowed to 0 2 in the fourth quarter of last year following robust growth in the previous quarter short term indicators suggest continued subdued gdp growth in the first quarter of 2019 as elevated brexit related uncertainty dampens consumption and investment despite slowing global growth momentum uk exports rebounded strongly in the second half of the year aided by a slight depreciation of the pound sterling however net trade continues to contribute negatively to growth as imports rebounded even more strongly in large part as a result of stockpiling by firms and consumers in anticipation of brexit after a slight up tick in the middle of 2018 annual cpi inflation has continued to decline falling to 1 8 in the first two months of 2019 this is well below the depreciation induced peak at 3 0 seen one year earlier and reflects both the waning impact of earlier strong rises in import prices and rapid declines in energy prices from the autumn of 2018 economic growth is stabilising in china weaker activity in the manufacturing sector is partly offset by resilience in services in the first two months of the year industrial production softened further and fixed asset investment growth recovered slightly while growth in nominal retail sales remained robust this mixed picture was confirmed by the manufacturing and services pmis in the first quarter with services holding up better at the same time trade activity has been very volatile in recent months partly reflecting distortions related to the lunar new year following weak data for february the authorities expect some rebound in march annual headline cpi inflation eased to 1 5 in february due to the sharp decline in food price contribution inflation excluding food and energy also slowed to 1 8 at the same time annual producer price inflation remained steady at 0 1 in february as lower oil prices were offset by a price increase in the mining and quarrying sector financial developments long term yields have declined in the euro area and in the united states during the period under review from 7 march to 9 april 2019 the gdp weighted euro area ten year sovereign bond yield declined marginally to 0 72 by around 5 basis points in a context of decreasing global risk free rates and stable or declining financial market volatility see chart 3 ten year sovereign bond yields fell by around 15 basis points in the united states and by slightly less than 10 basis points in the united kingdom to 2 50 and 1 10 respectively chart 3 ten year sovereign bond yields percentages per annum sources thomson reuters and ecb calculations notes daily data the vertical grey line denotes the start of the review period on 7 march 2019 the latest observation is for 9 april 2019 developments in euro area sovereign bond spreads relative to the risk free ois rate showed some cross country heterogeneity spreads on italian sovereign bonds rose by 16 basis points to just above 2 2 while those on spanish bonds rose by 10 basis points to 0 74 german spreads rose marginally by 2 basis points to 0 34 while french spreads remained unchanged at around zero by contrast spreads on portuguese sovereign bonds declined by 7 basis points to 0 86 broad indices of euro area equity prices rose amid lower risk free rates and in an environment of broadly stable volatility over the review period equity prices of euro area banks and non financial corporations increased by 3 4 and 2 9 respectively despite some negative macroeconomic surprises which led to swings in equity valuations equity prices rose throughout the review period this was possibly on account of the declines in risk free rates in the context of stable and historically low expectations among market participants regarding future equity volatility among other factors continued positive earnings and fewer concerns about geopolitical tensions also contributed to support equity valuations euro area corporate bond spreads narrowed somewhat over the review period reflecting the abovementioned gains in equity prices the spread on investment grade nfc bonds relative to the risk free rate has declined by around 10 basis points to stand at 70 basis points since early march yields on financial sector debt have also fallen by around 12 basis points to 89 basis points overall although corporate bond spreads are currently higher than the temporary lows reached in early 2018 they remain some 30 basis points below the levels observed in march 2016 prior to the announcement and subsequent launch of the corporate sector purchase programme the euro overnight index average eonia stood on average at 37 basis points over the review period excess liquidity increased by approximately 6 billion to stand at around 1 904 billion the eonia forward curve shifted downwards over the review period the downward movement of the curve peaked at around 15 basis points for maturities close to five years overall the curve remains at below zero for horizons up to the end of september 2022 reflecting market expectations of a prolonged period of negative interest rates in foreign exchange markets the euro remained broadly unchanged in trade weighted terms see chart 4 over the review period the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro as measured against the currencies of 38 of the euro area s most important trading partners appreciated by 0 1 this reflected a modest strengthening of the euro against the us dollar by 0 1 and the chinese renminbi by 0 1 as well as a more pronounced appreciation against the pound sterling by 0 5 and the currencies of most other non euro area eu member states with the exception of the swedish krona and the polish zloty these developments were only partly offset by a depreciation of the euro against other major currencies notably the japanese yen by 0 4 and the swiss franc by 0 7 as well as against the currencies of some emerging market economies chart 4 changes in the exchange rate of the euro vis à vis selected currencies percentage changes source ecb notes eer 38 is the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro against the currencies of 38 of the euro area s most important trading partners all changes have been calculated using the foreign exchange rates prevailing on 9 april 2019 economic activity the slowdown in euro area growth has continued as incoming data have overall been weaker than expected in the first quarter of 2019 real gdp increased by 0 2 in quarter on quarter terms in the last quarter of 2018 only marginally up compared with the previous quarter but still below the economic expansion observed in the first half of last year see chart 5 domestic demand and net trade contributed positively to gdp growth in the fourth quarter while changes in inventories had a substantial curtailing effect in annual terms this resulted in a 1 8 increase in real gdp in 2018 which is well below the 2 4 rate of growth recorded in the previous year although soft economic indicators remain robust overall compared with historical averages they have continued to fall short particular vulnerabilities in the manufacturing and tradable goods sectors reflect a downturn in external demand which combined with some country and sector specific factors suggests a continued weak growth momentum in the first quarter of 2019 chart 5 euro area real gdp and its components quarter on quarter percentage changes and quarter on quarter percentage point contributions source eurostat note the latest observations are for the fourth quarter of 2018 consumer spending continued to rise albeit at a lower growth rate than in previous years private consumption rose by 0 2 quarter on quarter in the final quarter of 2018 following a slightly lower rate of increase in the previous quarter the main factors behind the recent weakness in consumption have been the higher oil price in the first half of 2018 delivery bottlenecks in the car industry increased macroeconomic uncertainty and some country specific factors on an annual basis consumption rose by 1 0 in the fourth quarter of 2018 which is the same rate as in the previous quarter annual growth of households real disposable income accelerated from 1 5 in the third quarter of 2018 to 1 7 in the fourth quarter disposable income continues to be supported mainly by steady labour income growth reflecting the robustness of the labour market consequently the saving ratio expressed as a four quarter moving average increased from 12 0 in the third quarter of 2018 to 12 1 in the fourth quarter euro area labour markets remain robust despite some slowdown employment increased by 0 3 in the last quarter of 2018 following an increase of 0 2 in the third quarter overall employment increased by 1 5 in 2018 employment growth slowed down somewhat in the second half of 2018 but remained strong compared with developments in gdp growth continued employment growth combined with a drop in gdp growth in 2018 led to a moderation in productivity growth following a modest pick up in 2017 this may partly reflect the fact that adjustments in employment tend to lag behind changes in output one reason for this may be that firms are cautious in their recruitment decisions in part owing to limited flexibility regarding adjustments to longer term employment contracts recent short term labour market indicators continue to point to positive but moderating employment growth in the first quarter of 2019 the euro area unemployment rate stood at 7 8 in both january and february 2019 down from 7 9 in the last quarter of 2018 this together with the survey indicators on employment points to further employment growth but at a lower rate than before chart 6 euro area employment purchasing managers index assessment of employment and the unemployment rate left hand scale quarter on quarter percentage changes diffusion index right hand scale percentage of labour force sources eurostat markit and ecb calculations notes the purchasing managers index pmi is expressed as a deviation from 50 divided by 10 the latest observations are for the fourth quarter of 2018 for employment march 2019 for the pmi and february 2019 for the unemployment rate private consumption is expected to continue to rise at robust rates recent data on retail trade and new passenger car registrations point to continued growth in consumer spending in the first quarter of this year the latest survey results signal ongoing albeit moderating employment growth this should continue to support household income and thus consumer spending moreover households net worth continued to increase in the fourth quarter of 2018 thereby providing further support to private consumption considered together these factors should explain why during the first quarter of 2019 consumer confidence partly recovered from its decline over the course of 2018 and continued to stand at a level well above its long term average business investment slowed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and short term indicators point to a possible further slowdown in the first quarter of 2019 despite remaining positive quarter on quarter non construction investment growth declined from 1 0 in the third quarter of 2018 to 0 4 in the fourth quarter of 2018 available short term indicators for the first quarter of 2019 also point to a weakening in growth compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 available data for the first quarter of 2019 suggest a fall in the production of capital goods this also reflects the recorded decline in industrial confidence as well as higher financial volatility on a more positive note capacity utilisation remains high pointing to supply side constraints which might call for increased investment looking forward investment dynamics are expected to remain moderate as the business cycle matures business investment is expected to decelerate in tandem with weakening external and domestic demand in this context the assessment of export order books and production expectations in the capital goods sector points to continued weakness so far in 2019 by contrast while profit dynamics i e internal funds for investment slowed banks continued to report a positive net demand for loans used for investment purposes in the first quarter of 2019 euro area trade regained some momentum at the start of 2019 but according to leading indicators it may be short lived according to the latest monthly nominal data for january 2019 intra euro area exports recovered by 1 5 month on month following a decrease of 0 6 in december 2018 extra euro area exports expanded at a stronger rate of 0 8 month on month compared with 0 3 in december 2018 growth in total imports remained weak in january 2019 at 0 3 in month on month terms up from 0 1 in december 2018 intra euro area and extra euro area flows advanced at the same pace while euro area trade in goods strengthened at the start of 2019 the recovery was nevertheless insufficient to fuel stronger growth over the first quarter looking forward euro area trade is expected to remain weak in the first part of 2019 the latest economic indicators suggest a sizeable moderation in the pace of economic expansion industrial production excluding construction experienced a rebound in the first quarter of 2019 production showed positive signs for the first time since 2017 increasing slightly by 0 4 in quarter on quarter terms compared with the 1 2 drop in the fourth quarter of 2018 survey data signal a slowdown in growth dynamics in the near term the composite output purchasing managers index pmi averaged 51 5 in the first quarter of 2019 compared with 52 3 in the fourth quarter of 2018 meanwhile the european commission s economic sentiment indicator esi dropped to an average of 106 0 in the first quarter of 2019 compared with 108 9 in the fourth quarter of 2018 while the esi stood above its long term average the pmi remained between the threshold of 50 which separates contraction from expansion in activity and its historical average of 52 9 this moderation reflects in part a slowdown in external demand compounded by some country and sector specific factors while the impact of some country and sector specific idiosyncratic factors on economic activity is dissipating global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth and the rebound is sluggish overall growth is expected to continue at a slow pace looking forward the ecb s monetary policy measures will continue to back domestic demand private consumption is supported by healthy labour market conditions and ongoing employment gains residential investment should continue to improve supported by growing household wealth business investment is expected to continue to expand albeit at a subdued pace driven by high levels of capacity utilisation and supportive financing conditions in addition although the outlook for global trade has weakened the expansion in global activity is expected to continue the results of the latest round of the ecb survey of professional forecasters conducted in april 2019 show that private sector gdp growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020 were revised down by 0 3 and 0 1 percentage points respectively compared with the previous round conducted in late january at the same time the figure for 2021 remained unchanged at 1 4 the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside this reflects the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets prices and costs according to eurostat s flash estimate euro area annual hicp inflation declined to 1 4 in march 2019 from 1 5 in february see chart 7 this decline took place despite higher energy price inflation and reflected lower food price inflation and more especially lower hicp inflation excluding energy and food chart 7 contributions of components of euro area headline hicp inflation annual percentage changes percentage point contributions sources eurostat and ecb calculations notes the latest observations are for march 2019 flash estimates growth rates for 2015 are distorted upwards owing to a methodological change see the box entitled a new method for the package holiday price index in germany and its impact on hicp inflation rates economic bulletin issue 2 ecb 2019 measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted and continued their recent sideways movement hicp inflation excluding energy and food declined to 0 8 in march from 1 0 in february the extent to which this decline was affected by developments in more volatile prices for instance for travel and clothing or by the timing of the easter holidays can be assessed only with the release of the full hicp breakdown other measures of underlying inflation including the persistent and common component of inflation pcci indicator and the supercore indicator which are only available for the period to february also pointed to a continuation of the broad sideways movement of recent months nonetheless all of the statistical and model based measures remained above their respective lows in 2016 looking ahead measures of underlying inflation are expected to increase gradually driven by stronger wage growth and the pick up observed in domestic producer price inflation supply chain price pressures for hicp non energy industrial goods continued to increase this build up is visible in the later stages of the supply chain with domestic producer price inflation for non food consumer goods increasing further to 1 1 in february its highest rate since march 2012 and twice its historical average import price inflation for non food consumer goods also continued to strengthen further in february standing at 1 2 up from 0 8 in january at the very early stages of the pricing chain price pressures recovered somewhat the annual percentage changes in both oil and non oil commodity prices moved back into positive territory in february and continued to increase in march recent developments in wage growth continue to support the notion of a gradual build up in domestic cost pressures annual growth in compensation per employee was 2 2 in the fourth quarter of 2018 remaining above its long term average the decline from 2 5 in the previous quarter was linked to one off payments in that quarter as negotiated wage growth had continued to increase rising from 2 1 in the third quarter of 2018 to 2 2 in the fourth quarter the decline in growth of compensation per employee was reflected in a declining wage drift more generally wage growth indicators now stand visibly higher than in the first half of 2016 these developments are in line with increasing tightness in the labour market the impact of rising labour cost pressures on overall domestic price developments was cushioned by profit margins price pressures as captured in unit labour costs continued to intensify in the fourth quarter of 2018 mainly reflecting a continued weakening in labour productivity growth notwithstanding the annual percentage change in the gdp deflator remained relatively stable hovering between 1 3 and 1 5 in 2018 as the overall weakening in the cyclical momentum of the economy together with deteriorations in the terms of trade related particularly to the past increases in oil prices weighed on profit margin developments market based measures of longer term inflation expectations declined while survey based expectations remained stable the five year forward inflation linked swap rate five years ahead stood at 1 36 around 15 basis points lower than the level prevailing in early march see chart 8 despite its further decline which continues a downward trend beginning in november 2018 the risk neutral probability of negative average inflation over the next five years implied by inflation options markets remains negligible nevertheless the forward profile of market based measures of inflation expectations continues to point to a prolonged period of low inflation with only a very gradual return to inflation levels below but close to 2 the results of the ecb survey of professional forecasters spf for the second quarter of 2019 show average headline inflation expectations for the euro area of 1 4 in 2019 1 5 in 2020 and 1 6 in 2021 this represents downward revisions of 0 1 percentage points for each of these years compared with the previous survey mainly attributable to a weaker growth outlook and downward surprises in recent inflation outcomes according to the spf average longer term inflation expectations remained at 1 8 chart 8 market and survey based measures of inflation expectations annual percentage changes sources ecb survey of professional forecasters spf ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area and consensus economics notes the spf survey for the second quarter of 2019 was conducted between 18 and 22 march 2019 the market implied curve is based on the one year spot inflation rate and the one year forward rate one year ahead the one year forward rate two years ahead the one year forward rate three years ahead and the one year forward rate four years ahead the latest observations for market implied inflation are for 9 april 2019 money and credit broad money growth rebounded in february the annual growth rate of m3 increased to 4 3 in february from 3 8 in january thereby continuing to hover around the rates observed since early 2018 see chart 9 the phasing out of net asset purchases at the end of 2018 has led to a smaller positive impact of the asset purchase programme app on m3 growth the annual growth rate of m1 the main contributor to m3 growth from a component perspective increased to 6 6 in february up from 6 2 in january given that real m1 growth tends to lead real gdp growth by about one year see box 4 the predictive power of real m1 for real economic activity in the euro area these developments are consistent with the current moderation in real economic activity looking ahead the current level of real m1 growth indicates a low probability of a recession in the euro area in the coming year chart 9 m3 and its counterparts annual percentage changes contributions in percentage points adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects source ecb notes credit to the private sector includes mfi loans to the private sector and mfi holdings of securities issued by the euro area private non mfi sector as such it also covers the eurosystem s purchases of non mfi debt securities under the corporate sector purchase programme the latest observation is for february 2019 m3 growth remained resilient to the fading out of the contribution of the app from a counterpart perspective the positive contribution to m3 growth from general government securities held by the eurosystem decreased further see the red bars in chart 9 in the context of the aforementioned phasing out of net purchases under the app until october 2018 it had been largely offset by an increase in the contribution from credit to the private sector see the blue bars in chart 9 while credit to the private sector has remained the largest driver of broad money growth in recent months its contribution has stagnated since october 2018 an increasingly positive contribution from net external assets see the yellow bars in chart 9 which among other things reflects a reduced preference on the part of euro area investors for foreign assets and a declining drag from credit to the government from euro area monetary financial institutions mfis excluding the eurosystem see the light green bars in chart 9 have contributed to the resilience of m3 growth at the same time increasing issuance activity of mfi longer term debt securities has somewhat dampened money creation see the dark green bars in chart 9 following a decrease in january the annual growth of loans to the private sector increased again in february the annual growth rate of mfi loans to the private sector adjusted for loan sales securitisation and notional cash pooling increased to 3 2 in february from 3 0 in january see chart 10 this was due to a rebound in the annual growth rate of loans to nfcs which increased to 3 7 in february from 3 4 in january mainly reflecting a base effect looking beyond short term volatility the annual growth rate of loans to nfcs has been on a moderating path in recent months in line with the typical lagged reaction to the slowdown in economic activity observed since early 2018 at the same time the annual growth rate of loans to households remained stable at 3 3 in february the expansion in loan growth has been supported by the significant decline in bank lending rates across the euro area since mid 2014 notably owing to the ecb s non standard monetary policy measures and by overall improvements in the supply of and demand for bank loans in addition banks have made progress in consolidating their balance sheets although the volume of non performing loans npls remains high in some countries and may constrain financial intermediation chart 10 loans to the private sector annual growth rate source ecb notes loans are adjusted for loan sales securitisation and notional cash pooling the latest observation is for february 2019 according to the april 2019 euro area bank lending survey loan growth continued to be supported by favourable overall bank lending conditions and increasing demand for housing loans in the first quarter of 2019 credit standards for loans to enterprises remained broadly unchanged which was somewhat more favourable than expected by banks in the previous survey round at the same time credit standards for households tightened banks cost of funds and balance sheet constraints contributed to a tightening of credit standards across all loan categories while competitive pressures continued to contribute to an easing of credit standards net demand for loans to enterprises remained stable in the first quarter of 2019 after having increased since the second quarter of 2015 and was mainly supported by the low general level of interest rates at the same time net demand for housing loans continued to increase in the first quarter of 2019 also driven mainly by the low general level of interest rates euro area banks again confirmed that the ecb s asset purchase programme had a positive impact on their liquidity position and market financing conditions and a negative impact on their profitability over the past six months which included the eurosystem s net asset purchases until december 2018 the app had an easing impact on banks credit terms and conditions and a positive impact on their lending volumes in addition while the ecb s negative deposit facility rate dfr had an adverse impact on banks net interest income it continued to support lending very favourable lending rates continued to support euro area economic growth in february 2019 the composite bank lending rate for loans to nfcs remained broadly stable at 1 65 which is close to its historical low in may 2018 the composite bank lending rate for housing loans remained stable in february at 1 80 also close to its historical low in december 2016 see chart 11 composite bank lending rates for loans to nfcs and households have fallen significantly and by more than market reference rates since the ecb s credit easing measures were announced in june 2014 the reduction in bank lending rates for loans to nfcs as well as for loans to small firms assuming that very small loans of up to 0 25 million are primarily granted to small firms was particularly significant in those euro area countries that were most exposed to the financial crisis this indicates a more uniform transmission of monetary policy to bank lending rates across euro area countries and firm sizes chart 11 composite bank lending rates for nfcs and households percentages per annum source ecb notes composite bank lending rates are calculated by aggregating short and long term rates using a 24 month moving average of new business volumes the latest observation is for february 2019 in january 2019 net issuance of debt securities by euro area nfcs recovered part of the decline that occurred during the last quarter of 2018 the latest ecb data indicate that on a net basis the total flow of debt securities issued by nfcs in january 2019 turned positive again after being negative in the last two months of 2018 this is in line with the seasonal patterns observed over the last few years in which issuance at the beginning of the year has tended to rebound following a period of weakness in the last few months of the previous year from a more medium term perspective see chart 12 the annual flows of debt securities were slightly above 40 billion in january 2019 close to the level at which the annual flows of debt securities seem to have settled since november 2018 available market data suggest that net flows of debt securities issued continued to be relatively strong in february but moderated in march 2019 albeit remaining positive in january 2019 total net issuance of quoted shares by nfcs continued the decline from its recent peak in the summer of 2018 nevertheless the annual flows of net issuance of quoted shares remained high and close to the levels recorded in 2014 chart 12 net issuance of debt securities and quoted shares by euro area nfcs annual flows in eur billions source ecb notes monthly figures based on a 12 month rolling period the latest observation is for january 2019 financing costs for euro area nfcs declined marginally in january 2019 from the level recorded at the end of the previous year the overall nominal cost of external financing for nfcs comprising bank lending debt issuance in the market and equity finance declined to 4 7 in january and is projected to have declined significantly further in february and march 2019 the cost of financing in march 2019 is estimated to be only 16 basis points above the historical low of december 2014 and much below the levels observed in the summer of 2014 the estimated decrease in the cost of financing since the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 reflects a decrease in both the cost of equity and the cost of market based debt the decline in both measures is mainly accounted for by the decline in the long term risk free rate and to a somewhat lesser extent by the decline in risk premia boxes what the maturing tech cycle signals for the global economy prepared by marcel tirpák a maturing tech cycle has been one of the factors behind the significant trade slowdown in china at the turn of the year the tech cycle argument rests on the fact that china and other key asian economies including japan are closely integrated through supply chains concentrated especially in the production of computers and other electronic devices the tech sector the maturing tech cycle may reflect a number of factors it could be associated with more structural sector specific drivers such as the possibility of an increasing level of saturation in the global market for smartphones and for new data centres it could relate to mini cycles linked to the launch of new models of tech products or it may signal more generally a turn in the global business cycle this box reviews basic characteristics of the asian tech sector and shows that it has played an important role in the recent weakness in china s trade at the same time the box also suggests that the trend in the global tech cycle associated with weaker trade in asia may be bottoming out emerging market currencies the role of global risk the us dollar and domestic forces prepared by massimo ferrari exchange rate movements against the us dollar are an important factor shaping the outlook in emerging market economies as a large share of their credit trade and debt is priced in dollars abrupt swings in emerging market exchange rates are typically linked to capital outflows tighter financing conditions and heightened financial instability the drivers of those movements are however difficult to disentangle as global and domestic forces jointly determine the relative strengths of these currencies this box presents a methodology for separating out the four main drivers of emerging market exchange rate swings spillovers from us shocks global risk appetite interest rate effects and idiosyncratic domestic shocks it uses the methodology to analyse the factors behind the sharp depreciation and subsequent recovery of emerging market currencies over the course of 2018 exploring the factors behind the 2018 widening in euro area corporate bond spreads prepared by lena boneva gregory kidd and ine van robays global corporate bond spreads trended upwards over the course of 2018 euro area investment grade non financial corporate nfc bond spreads increased by around 60 basis points and peaked at just above 1 close to the levels which had prevailed prior to the announcement of the ecb s corporate sector purchase programme cspp in march 2016 see chart a spreads on non investment grade nfc debt widened more significantly by around 200 basis points and peaked at around 4 the trend increase in euro area nfc bond spreads mirrored developments in global corporate bond markets in the united states and the united kingdom spreads increased by around 80 and 60 basis points over the same time frame and peaked at 1 80 and 2 10 respectively since the turn of the year global nfc bond spreads have reversed a large part of the 2018 increase but nevertheless remain at elevated levels relative to those which prevailed in 2017 furthermore the largely synchronised movement in global spreads over this time frame alludes to a role for a common global factor rather than a euro area specific driver the predictive power of real m1 for real economic activity in the euro area prepared by alberto musso real m1 growth in the euro area has been moderating in recent quarters adding to concerns about the economic outlook given the robust relationship between the business cycle and narrow money this box shows that the leading and pro cyclical properties of real m1 for real gdp remain a robust stylised fact in the euro area moreover there are indications that these properties reflect the predictive capacity of narrow money beyond the influence of interest rates at the current juncture models exploiting the predictive power of real m1 suggest that the steady decline in real m1 growth from its most recent peak in mid 2017 points to very low risks of recession in the euro area up to the beginning of 2020 articles the economic implications of rising protectionism a euro area and global perspective prepared by vanessa gunnella and lucia quaglietti the risk of a trade war came sharply into focus in 2018 as protectionist threats by the us administration and its trading partners were followed by concrete actions tensions rose over the summer and while these have been defused on some fronts the risk of further escalation remains material the impact of the measures implemented so far on the global and euro area economic outlooks is expected to remain contained however large negative effects could materialise if trade tensions were to escalate further uncertainty related to protectionism is weighing on economic sentiment and it may raise further potentially eroding confidence and affecting the euro area and the global economy more significantly the complexity of intertwined international production chains could also magnify the impact against this backdrop this article reviews the changes in the trade policy landscape over the past decade it discusses the macroeconomic implications of the recent surge in protectionism and evaluates the possible effects that an escalation in trade tensions could have on the global economy and the euro area fiscal rules in the euro area and lessons from other monetary unions prepared by nadine leiner killinger and carolin nerlich this article compares the fiscal rule framework in the euro area with the frameworks in the fiscally more integrated united states and switzerland with the aim of drawing lessons for ways in which fiscal rules could be reformed in european economic and monetary union emu both the united states and switzerland have a history of balanced budget rules that help stabilise government debt in individual states cantons at moderate and broadly comparable levels the recent shift towards balanced budget rules in the euro area is an important achievement in this direction and has contributed to better average underlying budgetary positions still the fiscal rule framework needs to be rendered more effective in reducing high levels of government debt and their dispersion across the euro area reducing the heterogeneity of government debt positions is also an important prerequisite for setting up a well governed common macroeconomic stabilisation function at the centre of emu in case of deep economic crises this in turn would help to contain the procyclicality of fiscal rules at the country level statistics
pundit bill bonner s article about our growing government debt grabbed my attention when it comes to government debt the borrower never pays the feds have no money the lenders big banks investment funds well heeled insiders don t want to pay generally they collude with the feds to make sure the real cost is put on innocent third parties taxpayers and consumers governments pass the real cost to taxpayers and consumers by creating high inflation mr bonner lives in argentina at the end of february the official annual inflation rate jumped to 51 3 per year he estimates it is over 100 the next article i picked up quoted fed chairman powell powell called out the need for the fed and other central banks to find better ways to deal with pervasive low inflation and said it ought to pay serious attention to strategies that would drive inflation higher my emphasis that is government lingo meaning pass the cost of government debt to taxpayers and consumers by devaluing the dollar the highest inflation for baby boomers came during the carter years inflationdata com provides the inflation data the inflation calculator tells us the accumulated inflation was 59 9 investments held in us dollars lost 40 of their buying power baby boomers 1946 1964 were still working and could offset some of that loss through wage increases today they are retiring at a rate of 10 000 per day more carter type inflation could decimate the life savings of the entire baby boomer generation it s time to go to our inflation expert chuck butler editor of the daily pfennig dennis chuck readers really appreciate you taking your time for our benefit retirees want to minimize risk with their life savings when the government sold taxpayers on bank bailouts low interest rates were supposed to be temporary a decade later a 10 year cd pays 3 and probably won t keep up with inflation my parents never recovered from the carter years prices skyrocketed and their income didn t if the fed chairman gets his wish and inflation escalates baby boomers could face some serious problems how do boomers balance their need for current income and protect themselves against inflation at the same time chuck thanks dennis well i ve been preaching this for many years when i started preaching the dead sea wasn t even sick an investor must have a diversified portfolio by doing so they reduce the overall risk to their investments a correct diversification includes an allocation of physical gold or silver and a combo of foreign currencies harry markowitz developed modern portfolio theory he was the first person to prove that by diversifying one s investments with different asset classes you reduce the overall risk of the portfolio that includes keeping ahead of inflation protecting the real buying power of your money i ve long followed markowitz in all of my conference presentations i made it a point to give credit to markowitz s modern portfolio theory dennis let s start with gold hugo salinas price tracks the transition from gold back dollars to federal reserve promises in his article the road ahead for the dollar consider the following table 1776 to dec 1913 price of gold 20 67 oz 20 67 silver dollars 1914 to 1933 price of gold 20 67 oz 20 67 federal reserve fr dollars 1934 to 1971 price of gold 35 00 oz 35 00 fr dollars 1971 to 2019 price of gold rises from 35 oz to 1300 oz 1300 00 fr dollars this explains why the fed dollar is now worth only 0 000769 oz of gold during the carter years gold prices rose higher than inflation while gold has offset inflation retirees also need income how does an investor hedge their bets and still earn some income chuck when interest rates around the world were normal and not kept low to support stock markets investing in currencies usually garnered some additional interest along with any currency gains that were available today with the exception of russia and brazil there s very little in interest on currency deposits i know you hold some stocks offshore denominated in foreign currency that pays dividends so that is another alternative today we are focusing on the currency itself when we look at currencies during the high inflation years 1976 to 1981 we can see how foreign currencies helped offset the loss of buying power of the us dollar i ll use swiss francs and japanese yen in 1971 very few currencies no euros at the time were considered major currencies which is why i selected francs and yen for illustration let s compare their gains for that period of time vs the dollar i converted the european price style to american price style so it s easier to deal with on 1 1 76 the swiss franc was worth around 40 cents on 12 31 81 the franc was worth around 55 cents when you take it out a couple decimal places the franc gained 36 8 versus the dollar on 1 1 76 the japanese yen was worth around 0034 cents on 12 31 81 the yen was worth around 0045 cents a 33 3 gain versus the dollar owning these two currencies during the carter years would have offset much of the loss of buying power in the dollar holdings looking at a longer time period from 1 1 71 12 31 81 the cumulative rate of us dollar inflation was 138 3 the swiss franc gained 243 and the japanese yen gained 227 versus the dollar dennis wow it was more than just the carter years no wonder my parents struggled i want to use your carter years data to show readers the effect on buying power of the taxpayers and consumers let s assume you had four safety deposit boxes one contained 100 000 us dollars the other three contained the equivalent dollar amount denominated in swiss francs japanese yen and gold how did the buying power change over the five year period at 12 31 81 you still had your original 100 000 you could sell your gold for 295 539 swiss francs for 136 879 and yen for 133 439 what happened to the buying power of the dollar assume on 1 1 76 your favorite buick cost 20 000 five years that same new vehicle assuming they raised prices at the inflation rate would cost 31 984 five years later while the yen or franc didn t totally keep up with us dollar inflation they sure outperformed the us dollar chuck as you tell our readers currency is sold in pairs if the dollar goes down in value another will rise there are so many to choose from today what criteria would you use today when selecting currencies for inflation protection chuck i tell people that the way to value a currency is to treat it like the stock of a country you use a set of criteria to value a stock before buying it right apply your criteria to a country to see if their stock currency is worthy of owning i use the following criteria does the country have a good balance sheet does the country pay yield interest does the country have something other countries want does the country have strong leadership central bank using those criteria i come up with a handful of currencies that make sense to me to own today i feel that russian rubles swiss francs euros aussie kiwi canadian dollars along with norwegian krone are worthy of owning another consideration is that countries that produce oil will also gain when the price of oil rises due to inflation i call these countries the petrol currencies and include russian rubles norwegian krone brazilian real and canadian dollars and to a lesser extent mexican pesos and u k sterling dennis thanks again for your time one final question we are regularly warning readers about inflation i feel it is not a matter of if but when i was frightened a few years ago when speaker pelosi floated the idea of requiring iras and 401k programs to hold safe government debt much like fdr confiscated gold the government could soon follow by deflating the value of the currency inflation hedges are like fire insurance the catastrophic damage could be terrible the carter years fire was bad enough what do you say to brokers and financial advisors who laugh and minimize those concerns chuck thanks again for the opportunity i tell them that they need to go back to school learn real economics and study modern portfolio theory i learned my economics from some of the greatest economic minds of our time and i just wish everyone would have had the opportunities like i had in that regard i m a baby boomer and i worry that many people are not adequately protected against inflation which is why i continue to write the daily pfennig people need to be protected dennis here when the fed chair is calling for inflation that should be a warning to all unlike the 1970s many baby boomers are no longer working the catastrophic consequences of inflation are scary preservation of capital not losing money is no longer the entire goal we must preserve the buying power of our life savings for more

instruments financial assets and liabilities are recognized when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or have been transferred to an independent third party and the company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported on the consolidated statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intent to settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously all financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the consolidated statement of financial position depending on the purpose for which the instruments were acquired the company has classified each financial instrument into one of the following categories i fair value through profit and loss ii loans and receivables and iii other financial liabilities subsequent measurement of financial instruments is based on their classification i financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss a financial asset or liability classified in this category is recognized at each period at fair value with gains and losses from revaluation being recognized in profit or loss additionally a financial asset or liability is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the short term derivatives are included in this category unless they are designated as hedges ii loans and receivables loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently recorded at amortized cost using the effective interest method long term receivables are non derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market long term receivables are initially recognized at fair value based on the discounted cash flows the discount rate is based on the credit quality and term of the financial instrument the financial instrument is subsequently valued at amortized costs by accreting the instrument over the expected life of the assets the accretion associated with instruments valued at amortized cost is reported in profit loss each reporting period the fair value of the company s trade and other receivables approximates their carrying values due to the short term nature of these instruments iii other financial liabilities other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently recorded at amortized cost using the effective interest method long term loans and other long term liabilities are non derivative financial assets with either fixed or determinable payments or no payment terms and which are not quoted in an active market long term loans are initially recognized at fair value based on the amounts received cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand term deposits and short term highly liquid investments with the original term to maturity of three months or less which are convertible to known amounts of cash and which in the opinion of management are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value long term receivables long term receivables plus applicable accrued interest are initially recognized at their fair value based on the discounted cash flows the discounted cash flows are reviewed at least every year to adjust for variations in the estimated future cash flows with the change in estimate reported in profit or loss the discount rate is based on the credit quality and term of the financial instrument the financial instrument is subsequently valued at amortized costs by accreting the instrument over the life of the asset the accretion is reported in profit or loss e e exploration assets e e costs including costs of licence acquisition technical services and studies exploratory drilling whether successful or unsuccessful and testing and directly attributable overhead are capitalized as e e assets according to the nature of the assets acquired these costs are accumulated in cost centres by well field or exploration area pending determination of technical feasibility and commercial viability e e assets are assessed for impairment if i sufficient data exists to determine technical feasibility and commercial viability and ii facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a resource is generally considered to be determinable when proven and or probable reserves are determined to exist a review of each exploration licence or field is carried out at least annually to ascertain whether it is technically feasible and commercially viable upon determination of technical feasibility and commercial viability intangible e e assets attributable to those reserves are first tested for impairment with the unimpaired amounts reclassified from e e assets to a separate category within tangible assets within pp e referred to as oil and gas interests costs incurred prior to the legal awarding of petroleum and natural gas licences concessions and other exploration rights are recognized in profit or loss as incurred pp e oil and natural gas properties items of pp e which include oil and gas development and production assets are measured at cost less accumulated depletion and depreciation and accumulated impairment losses pp e assets include costs incurred in developing commercial reserves and bringing them into production such as drilling of development wells tangible costs of facilities and infrastructure construction together with the e e expenditures incurred in finding the commercial reserves that have been reclassified from e e assets as outlined above the projected cost of retiring the assets and any directly attributable general and administrative expenses expenditures on developed oil and natural gas properties are capitalized to pp e when it is probable that a future economic benefit will flow to the company as a result of the expenditure and the cost can be reliably measured the initial cost of an asset is comprised of its purchase price or construction cost any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation the initial estimate of any decommissioning obligations associated with the asset and borrowing costs on qualifying assets when significant parts of an asset with pp e including oil and gas interests have different useful lives they are accounted for as separate items major components costs incurred subsequent to the determination of technical feasibility and commercial viability and the costs of replacing parts of pp e are recognized as capitalized oil and gas interests only when they increase the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which they relate subsequent changes in estimated decommissioning obligation due to changes in timing amounts and discount rates are included in the cost of the asset such capitalized oil and gas interests generally represent costs incurred in developing proved and or probable reserves and bringing in or enhancing production from such reserves and are accumulated on a field or geotechnical area basis the carrying amount of any replaced or sold component is derecognized the costs of the day to day operating of pp e are recognized in profit or loss as incurred depletion the net carrying amount of pp e is depleted on a field by field unit of production method by reference to the ratio of production in the year to the related proven and probable reserves if the useful life of the asset is less than the reserve life the asset is depreciated over its estimated useful life using the straight line method future development costs are estimated considering the level of development required to produce the proven and probable reserves these estimates are reviewed by third party independent reserves engineers changes in factors such as estimates of reserves that affect unit of production calculations are dealt with on a prospective basis capital costs for assets under construction included in development and production assets are excluded from depletion until the asset is available for use that is when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management disposals oil and natural gas properties are derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset including farm out transactions or asset sales or asset swaps is calculated as the difference between the proceeds on disposal if any and the carrying value of the asset is recognized in profit or loss in the period of derecognition pp e office and other equipment office and other equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses depreciation of the cost of these assets less residual value is charged to profit and loss on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives of between three and five years decommissioning obligation decommissioning obligations are recognized for legal obligations related to the decommissioning of long lived tangible assets that arise from the acquisition construction development or normal operation of such assets a liability for decommissioning is recognized in the period in which it is incurred and when a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made with the corresponding decommissioning provision recognized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset the recognized decommissioning provision is subsequently allocated in a rational and systematic method over the underlying asset s useful life the initial amount of the liability is accreted by charges to the profit or loss to its estimated future value impairment non financial assets the carrying amounts of the company s non financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment e e assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount and when they are reclassified to pp e for the purpose of impairment testing e e assets are grouped by concession or field with other e e and pp e belonging to the same cgu the impairment loss will be calculated as the excess of the carrying value over recoverable amount of the e e impairment grouping and any resulting impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss the recoverable amount of a cgu is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset in assessing fair value less costs to sell the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using an after tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset fair value less costs to sell is generally computed by reference to the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from production of proved and probable reserves pp e will be tested for impairment whenever events and circumstances arising during the development and production phase indicate that the carrying amount of a pp e may exceed its recoverable amount for the purpose of impairment testing pp e will be grouped into the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets the cgu the aggregate carrying value will be compared against the expected recoverable amount of the cgu the recoverable amount of a cgu is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset in assessing fair value less costs to sell the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using an after tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset fair value less costs to sell is generally computed by reference to the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from production of proved and probable reserves cgu s are generally defined by field except where a number of field interests can be grouped because the cash inflows generated by the fields are interdependent impairment losses recognized in respect of cgu s are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill if any allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit group of units on a pro rata basis impairment losses recognized in prior years are assessed at each reporting date for any indication that the loss has decreased or no longer exists impairments are reversed when events or circumstances give rise to changes in the estimate of the recoverable amount since the period the impairment was recorded an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the cgu s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depletion if no impairment loss had been recognized an impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed financial assets a financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired a financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset an impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortized cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis the remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics all impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss an impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized for financial assets measured at amortized cost the reversal is recognized in profit or loss share capital the proceeds from the exercise of share options and the issuance of shares from treasury are recorded as share capital in the amount for which the option warrant or treasury share enables the holder to purchase a share in the company share capital issued for non monetary consideration is recorded at an amount based on fair market value of the shares issued share issuance costs commissions paid to underwriters and other related share issue costs such as legal auditing and advisory on the issue of the company s shares are charged directly to share capital net of tax share based payments the fair value of the options at the date of the grant is determined using the black scholes option pricing model and share based compensation is accrued and charged to profit or loss with an offsetting credit to equity reserve over the vesting periods a forfeiture rate is estimated on the grant date and is adjusted to reflect the actual number of options that vest capitalization of interest the company capitalizes interest expense incurred during the construction phase of the projects except e e assets which were funded by the related financing revenue recognition natural gas revenues are recognized upon the transfer of control over its gas to its customers tpdc and tanesco which is when delivery is made to them through the offtake network investment income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable which is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset s net carrying value income taxes tax expense comprises current and deferred tax tax is recognized in the profit or loss except to the extent it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income oci or directly in equity current income tax current tax expense is based on the results for the period as adjusted for items that are not taxable or not deductible current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that were enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation provisions are established where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities deferred income tax deferred taxes are the taxes expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position and their corresponding tax basis deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits are expected to be available against which deductible temporary differences to the tax basis can be utilized deferred income tax assets and liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill if any or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint arrangements except where the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient future taxable profits are expected to be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered deferred tax assets are recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and future taxable profits are expected to be available against which the temporary difference can be utilized foreign currency translation items included in the financial statements of the company and its subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the legal entity operates the functional currency foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of an entity are recognized in profit or loss the functional currency of all wentworth subsidiaries is us dollars except for wentworth resources uk limited which is pound sterling the assets and liabilities of this company are translated into us dollars at the period end exchange rate the income and expenses of the company are translated to us dollars at the average exchange rate for the period translation gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income however this subsidiary has limited operations so there is no significant amount of foreign exchange gains and losses to include in other comprehensive income all other foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss changes in accounting policies on 1 january 2018 the company adopted new standards with respect to ifrs 9 financial instruments and ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers ifrs 9 effective 1 january 2018 the company has adopted ifrs 9 financial instruments ifrs 9 ifrs 9 sets out requirements for recognizing and measuring financial assets financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non financial items this standard replaces ias 39 financial instruments recognition and measurement ias 39 on 1 january 2018 the company identified the business model used to manage its financial assets and classified its financial instruments into the appropriate ifrs 9 category applied the expected credit loss ecl model to financial assets classified as measured at amortized cost the following table shows the original measurement categories under ias 39 and the new measurement categories under ifrs 9 as at 1 january 2018 for each class of the company s financial assets and financial liabilities measurement category financial instrument ias 39 ifrs 9 cash and cash equivalents loans and receivables amortized cost trade and other receivables loans and receivables amortized cost trade and other payables loans and receivables amortized cost long term loans 1 loans and receivables amortized cost carrying value was adjusted by 0 75 million on adoption of ifrs 9 the classification and measurement of financial instruments under ifrs 9 did not result in any adjustments to the company s opening retained earnings as at 1 january 2018 except for an adjustment for debt modifications as the company renegotiated the repayment terms on its long term loan effective 31 january 2017 under ifrs 9 the amortized cost of the financial liability must be recalculated as the present value of the estimated future contractual cash flows that are discounted at the original effective interest rate the difference in the carrying amount and the calculated amount is recognized in profit and loss the company calculated a modification loss of 0 75 million on the 20 million tib loan the impact on the condensed consolidated interim statement

introduces ecl model for evaluating impairment of financial assets on 1 january 2018 the company applied the ecl model to financial assets classified as measured at amortized cost the new model will result in more timely recognition of expected credit losses the ecl model applies to the company s receivables as at 31 december 2018 the company s trade accounts receivable included gas sales to tpdc and tanesco and 51 percent were outstanding for less than 90 days the average ecl on the company s trade accounts receivable was nil percent to effect the changes under ifrs 9 the following revised policy has been applied to current period balances effective 1 january 2018 the company applied ifrs 9 retrospectively but elected not to restate comparative information as such the comparative information provided continues to be accounted for in accordance with the company s previous accounting policy as disclosed in the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 ifrs 15 the company adopted ifrs 15 revenue from contracts ifrs 15 on 1 january 2018 using the modified retrospective approach the company has completed the process of reviewing sales contracts with its two customers tpdc and tanesco using the ifrs 15 principles based five step model and concluded that there is no impact on opening retained earnings as of 1 january 2018 and on revenue recognition for 2018 earnings or loss per share eps basic earnings or loss per share is calculated by dividing profit or loss attributable to owners of the company the numerator by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding the denominator during the period the denominator is calculated by adjusting the shares outstanding at the beginning of the period by the number of shares bought back or issued during the period multiplied by a time weighting factor diluted eps is calculated by adjusting the earnings and number of shares for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares deemed to have been converted at the beginning of the period or if later the date of issuance the effects of anti dilutive potential ordinary shares are ignored in calculating diluted eps 3 critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty in applying the company s accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual amounts may differ materially from these estimates due to changes in general economic conditions changes in laws and regulations changes in future operating plans and the inherent imprecision associated with estimates significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements include the assessment of impairment triggers related to e e and pp e estimation of decommissioning obligations collectability of trade and other receivables and of long term receivables and recognition of a deferred tax asset accounting treatment of cmbl the group holds a 31 94 participation interest in the mnazi bay concession through two subsidiaries wentworth gas limited wgl which is a wholly owned subsidiary owns a 25 40 participation interest and cyprus mnazi bay limited cmbl owns a 16 38 participation interest of which the group s proportionate share is 6 54 i e wentworth s interest of 39 925 interest in cmbl multiplied by 16 38 participation interest cmbl is considered a jointly controlled entity and accounted for as a joint operation rather than a joint venture the group proportionately consolidates cmbl as related contractual agreements establish that the parties to the joint arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of ownership in proportion to their interest in the arrangement recoverable value of tembo e e and mnazi bay pp e costs e e are inherently judgemental to value the amounts for e e represent active exploration projects and investments these amounts are expensed to profit or loss as exploration costs unless the determination process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment at the reporting date or commercial reserves are established the outcome of ongoing exploration and evaluation activities and whether the carrying value of e e will ultimately be recovered is inherently uncertain and requires significant judgement and estimates management performs impairment tests on the company s pp e when indicators of impairment are present the assessment of impairment indicators is subjective and considers the various internal and external factors such as the financial performance of individual cgus market capitalization and industry trends in addition the impairment assessment is impacted by how management determines the composition of cgus reserve estimates oil and natural gas reserves prepared by an external independent reserve evaluator as at december 31 2018 are used in the calculation of depletion impairment and impairment reversal determinations and recognition of deferred tax asset reserve estimates are based on engineering data estimated future prices and costs expected future rates of production and the timing of future capital expenditures all of which are subject to many uncertainties and estimations the company expects that over time its reserve estimates will be revised upward or downward based on updated information such as the results of future drilling oil and gas production levels and reservoir performance and may also be affected by changes in commodity prices supply of gas from mnazi bay the gas sales price and cost base of production operations are largely fixed in nature the associated sensitivities ensure that field production and supply volumes are critical to the commerciality of the project whilst the benefits of increased production volumes are clear the opposite is equally true during operational downtime prolonged or permanent gas supply outages which may in turn impact upon the commerciality of the project mnazi bay currently has 5 producing wells and is committed to supplying a minimum quota of gas to tpdc and tanesco of 82 5 mmscf d the daily committed quotient dcq any significant adverse change to daily production operations may trigger an impairment review under ifrs 6 and ias 36 and a subsequent write down in the book value of the mnazi bay asset which currently totals 84 7 million demand for gas from mnazi bay gas sales in tanzania are not only constrained by the ability of the joint venture to supply gas to tpdc and tanesco but are also contingent upon their ability to offtake gas from the mnazi bay field there are other domestic gas producers in tanzania that sell to both tpdc and tanesco in addition to there being alterative sources of supply such as year round solar and seasonal hydro electric generation the continued commerciality of the project is contingent upon the continued demand for mnazi bay gas foreign currency exposure foreign exchange rate risk is the risk that the company suffers financial loss as a result of changes in the value of an asset or liability or in the value of future cash flows due to movements in foreign currency exchange rates wentworth operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures primarily with respect to the tanzanian shilling and pound sterling against the presentation currency of us dollars all group revenue is generated from gas sales in tanzania in which the production sharing agreement is currently in the gas testing and commissioning phase upon declaration of cod which is contingent upon the establishment of certain administrative and financial milestones by the government of tanzania the production sharing agreement will enter the commercial development phase under which both tpdc and tanesco may elect to pay the operator in either us dollars or tanzanian shillings for the gas that is produced and sold additionally while some costs are denominated in tanzanian shillings most of the operating expenditures are denominated in us dollars which would lead to an increased currency exposure the company does not currently undertake any currency hedges payment for mnazi gas payment terms for mnazi bay gas have improved during 2018 however there remains an arrears of approximately three months gas sales for mnazi bay gas the continued receipt and settlement of gas sales invoices to tpdc and tanesco is critical to the cash flows of the group to enable it to meet its liabilities as they fall due abandonment provision decommissioning and abandonment obligations have been estimated using technology at current prices inflated and discounted using discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each liability these assessments are subjective by nature and may be significantly more or less than management s current discounted cost estimations taxes the group operates in countries where the legal and tax systems are less developed which increases the requirement for management to make estimates and assumptions as to whether certain payments will be required related to matters such as income taxes value added taxes and other indirect taxes a provision is recognized in the financial statements for such matters if it is considered probable that a future outflow of cash resources will be required the provision if any is subject to management estimates and judgments with respect to the outcome of the event the costs to defend the quantum of the exposure and past practice in the country the commencement of commercial production and gas sales under the gas sales agreement currently in the gas testing and commissioning phase allowed for the recognition of a deferred tax asset within the financial statements the amount that the company recognizes is subject to the following judgements and uncertainties the timing and discounting of the utilization of tax losses from the current tax pools which are based on management assessments and forecasts of future performance the effective tax rate at which the losses will be utilized at throughout the group which is currently the prevailing tax rate of the ultimate parent company the status of any current tax assessments and disputes and their impact on the deferred tax pool on a probabilistic basis any material changes in legislation that may impact upon the fiscal regime on which the deferred tax asset is computed recoverability of trade and other receivables recoverability of the long term receivable from tpdc and the tanzanian government receivable involves estimating the volume and timing of future gas production from the mnazi bay concession and estimating a discount rate in addition to assessing credit risk timing of collection of the long term receivables is impacted by the rate of production and the timing of the increase of production volumes the assessment of collectability of amounts owed fromtanesco and tpdc for past gas sales is subject to significant estimates payment cycles from tanesco and tpdc vary and are not generally consistent with traditional industry terms of payment of between 30 and 90 days management is required to estimate the bad debt provision for this balance based on current and historical payment patterns prolonged periods of non payment will be provided against in the balance sheet with a corresponding expense being recognised in the income statement umoja receivable the company has an agreement with tanesco tpdc and the ministry of energy and mines mem in tanzania to be reimbursed at cost for past project development costs associated with transmission and distribution t d expenditures the undiscounted face value of the receivable is 6 51 million however there remain ongoing discussions and uncertainties with respect to final audited amount to be recovered and the timing of the ultimate recovery of this debt and it is for this reason that the directors have taken the decision to provide in full against the recovery of this debt in the 2018 accounts without prejudice to the ongoing commercial discussions with the government dissenting shareholders equity buyback on 26 october 2018 the company completed its redomicile from canada to jersey full details of which are disclosed within the directors report as part of the redomicile process and under canadian law certain shareholders exercised their rights to dissent to the continuance thereby exercising their rights to sell their shares back to the company at the fair market value on 26 october 2018 the company has received notifications over approximately 2 3 million shares and estimates the contingent liability to be 0 7 million some uncertainty remains over the final share price valuation and ultimate timing of the share buy back albeit this is not considered to be material to these financial statements 4 segment information the company conducts its business

findings for wgl the company s tanzanian subsidiary for taxation years 2013 to 2016 on 26 june 2018 following further discussion with the tra and exchange of information between the company and the tra the tra issued notice of adjusted assessments in respect of these taxation years the following two matters were raised in the adjusted assessments a impairment reversal of mnazi bay costs and other denied deductions the tra has reassessed the 2014 income tax filing of wgl and included in taxable income an impairment reversal of 23 81 million the impact of this reassessment is a non cash reduction of the company s deferred income tax asset by 7 1 million the tra has also denied 6 6 million of deductions in the 2014 and 2015 income tax filings of wgl in respect of interest and other costs the impact of this reassessment is a non cash reduction of the company s deferred income tax asset of 2 0 million b withholding taxes on loan interest employment and other taxes the tra issued an adjusted assessment certificate which included the principal taxes of 1 0 million tsh 2 3 billion the principal taxes have been included in the statement of net loss and comprehensive loss wgl was granted with tra an interest and penalties waiver of the 740k tshs 1 69 billion and made payment by instalments of principle taxes of 1 0 million tshs 2 3 billion changes on income tax act 2004 ita relating to petroleum operations effective 2018 the tra has introduced significant changes in respect to the computation of taxable income in tanzania the miscellaneous amendment act 2017 amended sections 65m and 65n of the income tax act 2004 ita the company is still evaluating the complete tax effects of the these changes however it has determined a reasonable estimate of the impact of them on its existing current and deferred tax balances based on this estimate the company has determined that while previously a contractor s share of cost and profit gas alongside their allowable deductions would be taxable under the new legislation no tax would be levied or allowances recognised on the cost gas element of its revenues profit gas would continue to be taxed in the usual way furthermore and more significantly this new legislation would only allow up to 70 tax relief of current year profits from historic tax loss pools the company has calculated an estimated deferred tax asset write down of 19 0 million with respect to these changes alone predominately with respect to timing differences and the under utilization of tax losses at the current licence expiry date of 2031 whilst the company is still evaluating the complete tax effects of the enactment of the legislation there are a number of uncertainties and ambiguities as to the specific interpretation and application of many of the provisions in the absence of precedence on these matters and until the 2018 tax returns are finalized which the company expects to occur in 2019 the company expects to use what it believes are reasonable interpretations and assumptions in applying the legislative changes for purposes of determining its cash tax liabilities and results of operations which may change as it receives additional clarification and implementation guidance income taxes the company s income tax expense for the year end 31 december is as follows 2018 000 2017 000 loss before income taxes 48

2b apr 25 2019 lbo the sixty ninth annual report of the monetary board of the central bank of sri lanka was presented to mangala samaraweera the minister of finance by dr indrajit coomaraswamy the governor of the central bank according to the report the real gdp growth was recorded at 3 2 percent in 2018 compared to 3 4 percent in the previous year this growth was largely supported by services activities that expanded by 4 7 percent and the recovery in agriculture activities which recorded a growth of 4 8 percent industry activities slowed down significantly to 0 9 percent during the year mainly as a result of the contraction in construction according to the expenditure approach both consumption and investment expenditure supported growth the vulnerability of the sri lankan economy to global and domestic disturbances became increasingly visible in 2018 with a modest expansion in real economic activity amidst a low inflation environment during the year real gdp growth was recorded at 3 2 per cent in 2018 compared to 3 4 per cent in the previous year this growth was largely supported by services activities that expanded by 4 7 per cent and the recovery in agriculture activities which recorded a growth of 4 8 per cent industry activities slowed down significantly to 0 9 per cent during the year mainly as a result of the contraction in construction according to the expenditure approach both consumption and investment expenditure supported growth investment as a percentage of gdp stood at 28 6 per cent in 2018 compared to 28 8 per cent in the previous year while the savings investment gap widened during the year indicating increased dependence on external resources to fill the shortfall the total size of the sri lankan economy was estimated at us dollars 88 9 billion while the per capita gdp was recorded at us dollars 4 102 in 2018 which was marginally lower than in the previous year amidst the moderate growth in economic activity a marginal increase in the unemployment rate and a decline in the labour force participation rate were observed during the year the external sector of the economy was volatile during the year due to both global and domestic factors globally monetary policy normalisation particularly in the united states of america usa resulted in global financial conditions tightening thus causing capital outflows from emerging market economies and increased pressure on exchange rates of twin deficit economies in particular sri lanka also experienced these headwinds particularly from mid april 2018 which were exacerbated following the political uncertainties and the downgrade of the country s sovereign rating in the fourth quarter of the year domestically the trade deficit surpassed us dollars 10 billion for the first time in history with higher growth in import expenditure outpacing the growth in export earnings which were at a record level in nominal terms although services exports are estimated to have grown substantially the deficit in the merchandise trade balance stagnant workers remittances and rising foreign interest payments resulted in a widened current account deficit of 3 2 per cent of gdp during the year the financial account benefitted from increased foreign direct investment fdi inflows which recorded its historically highest level in 2018 as well as borrowing from abroad particularly through the issuance of international sovereign bonds isbs the combined result of these developments was a deficit in the overall balance in the balance of payments bop in 2018 the central bank followed a market based exchange rate policy and allowed a sharper depreciation of the rupee but intervened in the domestic foreign exchange market particularly at times when large capital outflows and undue speculation caused excessive volatility in the market in order to address the widening trade deficit the central bank and the government implemented a series of measures to curb non essential imports by increasing tariffs imposing margin requirements tightening loan to value ratios on selected types of lending and suspending the issuance of letters of credit lcs on concessionary permits for vehicle imports in response to these measures and the global financial markets becoming less unfavourable the pressure on the bop and the exchange rate subsided during late 2018 and early 2019 and the sri lankan rupee appreciated against major currencies during the first quarter of 2019 thus correcting the overshooting of the exchange rate observed in the previous year to some extent the resumption of discussions and the achievement of staff level agreement with the international monetary fund imf on the programme under the extended fund facility eff arrangement in february 2019 also helped improve investor sentiments in spite of the sharp depreciation of the rupee and the introduction of the pricing formula for domestic petroleum price adjustments headline and core inflation remained well anchored in low single digit levels during the year supported by proactive monetary policy measures improved domestic supply conditions and also due to subdued aggregate demand conditions headline inflation fluctuated largely in line with the price movements of the food category where food prices declined mostly during 2018 owing to favourable weather conditions that prevailed during the year inflation is expected to remain well within mid single digit levels in the medium term particularly under the envisaged flexible inflation targeting fit regime subdued inflation and inflation expectations and lower than potential growth in real economic activity prompted the central bank to signal an end to the monetary tightening cycle in april 2018 by reducing the standing lending facility rate slfr by 25 basis points thereafter the central bank maintained a neutral monetary policy stance throughout the year in view of the continued pressure on the external sector amidst the subpar performance in the domestic economy nevertheless the large and persistent liquidity deficit in the domestic money market particularly since september 2018 compelled the central bank to inject liquidity on a permanent basis in november 2018 by way of reducing the statutory reserve ratio srr applicable on all rupee deposit liabilities of commercial banks by 1 50 percentage points however at the same time to neutralise the impact of the srr reduction and maintain its neutral policy stance the central bank increased the standing deposit facility rate sdfr by 75 basis points and slfr by 50 basis points further narrowing the policy rate corridor to 100 basis points accordingly by end 2018 sdfr and slfr stood at 8 00 per cent and 9 00 per cent respectively as the shortage in rupee liquidity persisted into early 2019 the central bank reduced the srr by a further 1 00 percentage point to 5 00 per cent effective 01 march 2019 meanwhile the year on year growth of broad money m decelerated in 2018 driven by the contraction in net foreign assets nfa of the banking sector however within broad money growth the overall expansion of credit granted to the private sector by commercial banks in 2018 was higher than expected in spite of tight liquidity conditions and high nominal and real market interest rates in the meantime fiscal operations during 2018 demonstrated some improvements with a higher primary surplus and a lower budget deficit notwithstanding the decline in revenue mobilisation the government revenue declined to 13 3 per cent of gdp in 2018 while expenditure and net lending declined particularly due to lower public investment which was affected by political tensions that prevailed towards the end of the year resulting in delays in the implementation of budgetary operations reduced capital expenditure also contributed to a dampening of economic activity the current account deficit increased in 2018 as a percentage of gdp reflecting dissavings of the government the primary balance which mirrors the difference between the government revenue and non interest expenditure registered a surplus of 0 buy singulair online buy singulair online no prescription6 per cent of gdp in 2018 compared to the surplus of 0 02 per cent of gdp in 2017 the budget deficit declined to 5 3 per cent of gdp in 2018 from 5 5 per cent of gdp in 2017 as a result of the substantial reduction in capital expenditure but a deviation from the target level of 4 8 per cent of gdp envisaged in the budget 2018 was also observed the outstanding central government debt increased to 82 9 per cent of gdp at end 2018 from 76 9 per cent at end 2017 which is attributed to the depreciation of the rupee that affected the rupee value of foreign debt relatively low nominal gdp and higher net borrowings during the period rollover risks can be contained through the implementation of the provisions of the active liability management act alma and the introduction of the medium term debt management strategy mtds which would help manage the government s debt obligations in the period ahead with the support of continued commitment towards revenue based fiscal consolidation the financial sector continued to expand in 2018 supported by the moderate but stable growth of the banking sector however the profitability of the banking sector declined during the year mainly due to some deterioration in the asset quality a rise in operating costs and higher taxes the central bank strengthened the prudential policy measures including the implementation of basel iii requirements and the adoption of sri lanka accounting standard slfrs 9 during the year meanwhile the licensed finance companies lfcs and specialised leasing companies slcs sector also recorded moderate growth amidst a challenging environment and the central bank took measures to resolve distressed finance companies and to address the lingering concerns in the sector the colombo stock exchange cse recorded yet another year of poor performance due to adverse developments on domestic and global fronts which affected investor sentiments amidst efforts to maintain the country s macroeconomic stability over the past several years the postponement of much needed structural reforms has moved the sri lankan economy to a modest growth path sri lanka s graduation to the middle income status almost a decade ago required far reaching policy reforms to move towards higher income status by avoiding the so called middle income trap however delays in addressing barriers to growth and introducing growth enhancing reforms in the areas of export promotion attracting fdi reducing budget deficits and debt levels reforming factor markets strengthening public administration and ensuring the rule of law have largely contributed to sri lanka s economic stagnation while peer economies have progressed rapidly as a result of growth supporting reforms therefore for sri lanka to succeed as a higher income economy and improve the wellbeing of its people it is essential that the root causes for the continued low economic growth are addressed by expediting the required structural reforms with a focus on improving productivity and efficiency of the economy in this background it is vital that all stakeholders make concerted efforts to expedite the reform agenda that is already in place which includes the national export strategy nes and new trade policy ntp to improve earnings from merchandise and service exports the fiscal consolidation programme to improve fiscal discipline and debt sustainability and the central bank s move towards adopting fit by 2020 to ensure sustained price stability the timely implementation of these reforms will not only improve sri lanka s economic outlook and its prospects as a highly sought after destination for investments given the country s strategic location in the indian ocean but also would be essential to uplift the overall standard of living and quality of life of its people the country can no longer afford to postpone such reforms if sri lanka is to progress along a high and sustainable growth trajectory over the medium term and catch up with countries that were behind sri lanka several decades ago

generation and aggressively executed on our share repurchases during this lower revenue period we will continue to implement our productivity initiatives in order to more efficiently align cost to current volumes and to improve the stability and profitability of our business we remain committed to our transformation strategy which we believe will drive more consistent diversified and sustainable results in the future our ccs portfolio review is mostly complete and we are encouraged by the related benefits as we continue to drive improvement in both of our segments we intend to maintain our balanced approach to capital allocation supported by a strong balance sheet non ifrs measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies that use ifrs or other generally accepted accounting principles gaap see non ifrs supplementary information below for information on our rationale for the use of non ifrs measures and schedule 1 for among other items non ifrs measures included in this press release as well as their definitions uses and a reconciliation of non ifrs measures to the most directly comparable ifrs measures as described in footnotes 3 and 4 to the reconciliation table in schedule 1 our calculation of each of non ifrs free cash flow and non ifrs adjusted roic has been modified commencing q1 2019 our ats segment consists of our ats end market and is comprised of our aerospace and defense a d industrial smart energy healthtech and capital equipment businesses consisting of semiconductor display and power signal distribution equipment our ccs segment consists of our communications and enterprise end markets and is comprised of our enterprise communications telecommunications servers and storage businesses segment performance is evaluated based on segment revenue segment income and segment margin segment income as a percentage of segment revenue see note 25 to our 2018 audited consolidated financial statements for further detail segment updates in the capital equipment component of our ats segment revenue from our semiconductor capital equipment customers has been adversely impacted by cyclical decreases in demand that started in the second half of 2018 as expected our capital equipment business operated at a loss in q1 2019 within our anticipated range additionally within our display business some programs that we had anticipated to ramp in the second half of 2019 have been delayed and are currently expected to ramp in 2020 we expect demand softness in our capital equipment business to continue throughout 2019 our focus continues to be on aligning this business to the current demand environment and to improve its profitability the industrial and healthtech businesses within our ats segment were adversely impacted in q1 2019 by costs associated with the ramping of multiple new programs as the ramping of these programs progresses we anticipate an increased level of profitability from these businesses in addition our a d business was adversely impacted by materials shortages in q1 2019 resulting in a backlog of orders and reduced profitability we expect this backlog to gradually improve as we move through 2019 in our ccs segment we continue to progress with the comprehensive review of our ccs revenue portfolio ccs review we commenced this review in the second half of 2018 to address under performing programs that no longer align with our strategic objectives the ccs review is currently expected to result in a decline in our ccs segment revenue of approximately 500 million over the next 9 to 15 months subject to change based on the growth or contraction of ccs programs not subject to the ccs review in q1 2019 we completed planned program disengagements in our enterprise end market and expect to complete the majority of the remaining actions identified by the ccs review in 2019 including intended restructuring actions which have been built into our current cost efficiency initiative and changes to our manufacturing network the decrease in ccs segment revenue in q1 2019 as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to planned program disengagements in our enterprise end market resulting from our ccs review as well as late quarter demand softness from certain communications customers we saw a reduction in orders from several communications customers as they consumed their inventory buffers previously built up to manage materials constraints additionally reduced demand for some programs resulted from the impact of next generation program transitions we expect these adverse market dynamics in our communications end market to continue into the second quarter of 2019 if demand softness in our communications end market persists into the second half of 2019 total company revenue for 2019 could decrease year over year at the high end of the single digit percentage range previously anticipated to result from the ccs review alone restructuring update we have recorded approximately 51 million in restructuring charges from the commencement of our cost efficiency initiative through the end of q1 2019 including 7 1 million of restructuring charges recorded in q1 2019 based on current plans we estimate total restructuring charges for this initiative to be near the high end of our previously disclosed range of 50 75 million and continue to expect the remainder of the charges to be recorded by the end of 2019 consummation of toronto real property sale on march 7 2019 we completed the sale of our toronto real property and in connection therewith received total proceeds of 113 0 million in addition to an 11 2 million deposit we received in july 2015 these proceeds were included in our determination of non ifrs free cash flow for q1 2019 we used substantially all of the proceeds to repay a portion of our outstanding revolving loans we

computer software toronto transition costs and restructuring charges see the tables in schedule 1 and note 10 to the q1 2019 interim financial statements for per item charges this aggregate charge is within the range we provided on january 31 2019 of between 0 18 to 0 24 per share for these items this range did not address potential gains in connection with the then anticipated consummation of our toronto real property sale ifrs eps for q1 2019 included an aggregate 0 67 per share net benefit attributable to other charges recoveries resulting from a 0 75 per share gain on the sale of our toronto property sale offset in part by related toronto transition costs 0 02 per share negative impact and restructuring charges 0 05 per share negative impact ifrs eps for q1 2018 included an aggregate 0 07 per share negative impact attributable to other charges recoveries primarily due to restructuring charges 0 05 per share negative impact see schedule 1 for the exclusions used to determine non ifrs adjusted eps for each of q1 2019 and q1 2018 2 for the second quarter of 2019 q2 2019 we expect a negative 0 15 to 0 21 per share pre tax aggregate impact on net earnings on an ifrs basis for employee stock based compensation expense amortization of intangible assets excluding computer software toronto transition costs described on schedule 1 hereto and restructuring charges based on the projected geographical mix of our profits we anticipate that our non ifrs adjusted effective tax rate for q2 2019 will be similar to q1 2019 as a result of the higher tax rate we are experiencing in the first half of 2019 we currently expect our full year non ifrs adjusted effective tax rate to be in the mid twenty percent range excluding foreign exchange impacts and one time tax settlements as we exit the year we are targeting to return to our previously guided annual range of 19 to 21 we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates the impact of such changes on our operating results or the degree to which we will be able to manage such impacts see non ifrs supplementary information below for information on our rationale for the use of non ifrs measures and

measures we do not provide reconciliations for forward looking non ifrs financial measures as we are unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort this is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various events that have not yet occurred are out of our control

disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as required by applicable law all forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements schedule 1 supplementary non ifrs measures our non ifrs measures herein include adjusted gross profit adjusted gross margin adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenue adjusted selling general and administrative expenses sg a adjusted sg a as a percentage of revenue operating earnings adjusted ebiat operating margin adjusted ebiat or operating earnings as a percentage of revenue adjusted net earnings adjusted earnings per share adjusted return on invested capital adjusted roic free cash flow adjusted tax expense and adjusted effective tax rate adjusted ebiat adjusted roic free cash flow including a description of modifications to our calculation of adjusted roic and free cash flow commencing in q1 2019 adjusted tax expense and adjusted effective tax rate are further described in the tables below in calculating these non ifrs financial measures management excludes the following items where applicable employee stock based compensation expense amortization of intangible assets excluding computer software restructuring and other charges net of recoveries as defined below impairment charges and acquisition inventory fair value adjustments all net of the associated tax adjustments which are set forth in the table below and non core tax impacts tax adjustments related to acquisitions and certain other tax costs or recoveries related to restructuring actions or restructured sites we believe the non ifrs measures we present herein are useful to investors as they enable investors to evaluate and compare our results from operations in a more consistent manner by excluding specific items that we do not consider to be reflective of our ongoing operating results to evaluate cash resources that we generate each period and to provide an analysis of operating results using the same measures our chief operating decision makers use to measure performance in addition management believes that the use of a non ifrs adjusted tax expense and a non ifrs adjusted effective tax rate provides improved insight into the tax effects of our ongoing business operations and is useful to management and investors for historical comparisons and forecasting these non ifrs financial measures result largely from management s determination that the facts and circumstances surrounding the excluded charges or recoveries are not indicative of the ordinary course of the ongoing operation of our business non ifrs measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies that use ifrs or who report under u s gaap and use non u s gaap measures to describe similar operating metrics non ifrs measures are not measures of performance under ifrs and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any standardized measure under ifrs the most significant limitation to management s use of non ifrs financial measures is that the charges or credits excluded from the non ifrs measures are nonetheless charges or credits that are recognized under ifrs and that have an economic impact on the company management compensates for these limitations primarily by issuing ifrs results to show a complete picture of the company s performance and reconciling non ifrs financial measures back to the most directly comparable ifrs financial measures the economic substance of the exclusions described above and management s rationale for excluding them from non ifrs financial measures is provided below employee stock based compensation expense which represents the estimated fair value of stock options restricted share units and performance share units granted to employees is excluded because grant activities vary significantly from quarter to quarter in both quantity and fair value in addition excluding this expense allows us to better compare core operating results with those of our competitors who also generally exclude employee stock based compensation expense in assessing operating performance who may have different granting patterns and types of equity awards and who may use different valuation assumptions than we do including those competitors who report under u s gaap and use non u s gaap measures to present similar metrics amortization charges excluding computer software consist of non cash charges against intangible assets that are impacted by the timing and magnitude of acquired businesses amortization of intangible assets varies among our competitors and we believe that excluding these charges permits a better comparison of core operating results with those of our competitors who also generally exclude amortization charges in assessing operating performance restructuring and other charges net of recoveries consist of costs relating to employee severance lease terminations site closings and consolidations write downs of owned property and equipment which are no longer used and are available for sale reductions in infrastructure toronto transition costs recoveries defined below acquisition related consulting transaction and integration costs acquisition costs legal settlements recoveries and the accelerated amortization of unamortized deferred financing costs recorded on the extinguishment of our prior credit facility during the second quarter of 2018 we exclude these restructuring and other charges net of recoveries because we believe that they are not directly related to ongoing operating results and do not reflect expected future operating expenses after completion of these activities we believe these exclusions permit a better comparison of our core operating results with those of our competitors who also generally exclude these charges net of recoveries in assessing operating performance toronto transition costs recoveries are costs recoveries recorded in connection with the sale of our toronto real property the relocation of our toronto manufacturing operations the move of our corporate headquarters to a temporary location while space in a new office building for such headquarters at our former location is under construction as well as the move to such new office space upon its completion toronto transition costs consist of direct relocation costs duplicate costs such as rent expense utility costs depreciation charges and personnel costs incurred during the transition period as well as cease use costs incurred in connection with idle or vacated portions of the relevant premises that we would not have incurred but for these relocations toronto transition recoveries consist of the gain we recorded in march 2019 on the sale of our toronto real property we believe that excluding these costs and recoveries permits a better comparison of our core operating results from period to period as these costs will not reflect our ongoing operations once these relocations are complete and the recovery pertains only to q1 2019 impairment charges which consist of non cash charges against goodwill intangible assets and property plant and equipment result primarily when the carrying value of these assets exceeds their recoverable amount our competitors may record impairment charges at different times and we believe that excluding these charges permits a better comparison of our core operating results with those of our competitors who also generally exclude these charges in assessing operating performance acquisition inventory fair value adjustments relate to the write up of the inventory acquired in connection with our acquisitions representing the difference between the cost and fair value of such inventory we exclude the impact of the recognition of these adjustments when incurred because we believe such exclusion permits a better comparison of our core operating results from period to period as their impact is not indicative of our ongoing operating performance non core tax impacts are excluded as we believe that these costs or recoveries do not reflect core operating performance and vary significantly among those of our competitors who also generally exclude these costs or recoveries in assessing operating performance the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the various non ifrs measures discussed

defined as earnings before income taxes finance costs defined below amortization of intangible assets excluding computer software and in applicable periods employee stock based compensation expense net restructuring and other charges recoveries defined above impairment charges recoveries and acquisition inventory fair value adjustments finance costs consist of interest expense and fees related to our credit facility including debt issuance costs and the amortization thereof our interest rate swap agreements our accounts receivable sales program and a customer s supplier financing program and beginning q1 2019 interest expense on our lease obligations under ifrs 16 see note 10 to our q1 2019 interim financial statements for separate quantification and discussion of impairment charges if any and the components of net restructuring and other charges recoveries 2 the adjustments for taxes as applicable represent the tax effects of our non ifrs adjustments and non core tax impacts described in the table below 3 management uses non ifrs free cash flow as a measure in addition to ifrs cash provided by used in operations to assess our operational cash flow performance we believe non ifrs free cash flow provides another level of transparency to our liquidity non ifrs free cash flow is defined as cash provided by used in operations after the purchase of property plant and equipment net of proceeds from the sale of certain surplus equipment and property lease payments including 8 3 million in q1 2019 for lease payments under ifrs 16 and finance costs paid excluding any debt issuance costs paid as a measure of liquidity and consistent with the inclusion of our toronto relocation capital expenditures and transition costs in non ifrs free cash flow in the periods incurred we have included the 113 0 million in proceeds from the sale of our toronto real property in non ifrs free cash flow in q1 2019 the period of receipt see note 10 b to the q1 2019 interim financial statements because we have recently arranged a new credit facility and incurred debt issuance costs which we do not consider to be part of our core operating expenses in connection therewith upon initial arrangement and in connection with subsequent security arrangements we have modified our non ifrs free cash flow calculation commencing in q1 2019 to exclude debt issuance costs paid from total finance costs paid as no such costs were paid in q1 2018 prior period comparatives will be restated when applicable to conform to the current presentation in addition commencing as of january 1 2019 as a result of our adoption of ifrs 16 leases we have also modified our non ifrs free cash flow calculation to subtract lease payments under ifrs 16 as such payments were previously but are no longer reported in cash provided by used in operations ifrs 16 did not require the restatement of prior period financial statements accordingly and in order to preserve comparability with prior calculations commencing in q1 2019 such lease payments are subtracted from cash provided by used in operations in our determination of non ifrs free cash flow see footnote 4 below note that non ifrs free cash flow however does not represent residual cash flow available to celestica for discretionary expenditures 4 management uses non ifrs adjusted roic as a measure to assess the effectiveness of the invested capital we use to build products or provide services to our customers by quantifying how well we generate earnings relative to the capital we have invested in our business non ifrs adjusted roic is calculated by dividing non ifrs adjusted ebiat by average net invested capital net invested capital calculated in the table below is defined as total assets less cash rou assets described below accounts payable accrued and other current liabilities and provisions and income taxes payable we use a two point average to calculate average net invested capital for the quarter a comparable measure under ifrs would be determined by dividing ifrs earnings before income taxes by net invested capital which we have set forth in the charts above and below however this measure which we have called ifrs roic is not a measure defined under ifrs in connection with our adoption of ifrs 16 as of january 1 2019 we now recognize rou assets and related lease obligations on the applicable lease commencement dates see note 2 to the q1 2019 interim financial statements for further detail as ifrs 16 did not require the restatement of prior period financial statements we have not restated prior period calculations of non ifrs adjusted roic to account for rou assets accordingly and in order to preserve comparability with prior calculations commencing in q1 2019 we exclude the impact of our rou assets from our calculation of net invested capital the following table sets forth a reconciliation of our ifrs tax expense and ifrs effective tax rate to our non ifrs adjusted tax expense and

accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs the q1 2019 interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our 2018 annual audited consolidated financial statements 2018 afs and reflect all adjustments that are in the opinion of management necessary to present fairly our financial position as at march 31 2019 and our financial performance comprehensive income and

financial information is presented in millions of u s dollars except percentages and per share amounts the q1 2019 interim financial statements were authorized for issuance by our board of directors on april 24 2019 use of estimates and judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our judgments estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the economic environment could also impact certain estimates necessary to prepare our consolidated financial statements including estimates related to the recoverable amounts used in our impairment testing of our non financial assets the discount rates applied to our net pension and non pension post employment benefit assets or liabilities and the discount rates applied to our right of use rou assets and related lease obligations our assessment of these factors forms the basis for our judgments on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of our costs and expenses actual results could differ materially from our estimates and assumptions we review our estimates and underlying assumptions on an ongoing basis and make revisions as determined necessary by management revisions are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and may impact future periods as well there have been no significant changes to our assumptions or the judgments affecting the application of our estimates and assumptions during q1 2019 from those described in the notes to our 2018 afs however see accounting policies below for a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards accounting policies the q1 2019 interim financial statements are based upon accounting policies consistent with those used and described in note 2 of our 2018 afs except for the recently adopted accounting standard discussed below as a result the following should be read as a modification to notes 2 j and x to our 2018 afs recently adopted accounting standard ifrs 16 leases we adopted ifrs 16 effective january 1 2019 which brings most leases on balance sheet for lessees under a single model in connection therewith commencing january 1 2019 we now recognize right of use rou assets and related lease obligations as of the applicable lease commencement dates rou assets represent our right to use such leased assets and our lease obligations represent our related lease payment obligations in adopting this standard we applied the modified retrospective approach permitting us to recognize the cumulative effect of such adoption as an adjustment to our opening balance sheet as of january 1 2019 without restatement of prior period comparative information in computing such adjustment we elected to apply the practical expedients available under ifrs 16 and accordingly have not recognized rou assets and related lease obligations for low value leases or for leases with terms of 12 months or less we continue to expense the costs of these low value and short term leases in our consolidated statement of operations on a straight line basis over the lease term in addition as ifrs 16 did not require us to reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease as of the date of initial application we maintained the lease determinations used under previous accounting rules upon initial adoption of ifrs 16 we recognized rou assets of 111 5 and related lease obligations of 112 0 and reduced our accrued liabilities by 0 5 on our consolidated balance sheet as of january 1 2019 there was no net impact on our deficit as of january 1 2019 when measuring our lease obligations we discounted our lease payments using a weighted average rate of 4 7 as of january 1 2019 representing our incremental borrowing rate as of such date the amortization of the rou assets is recognized as a depreciation charge and the interest expense on the related lease obligations is recognized as finance costs in our consolidated statement of operations prior to the adoption of ifrs 16 we recognized operating lease expenses on a straight line basis over the lease term generally in cost of sales or sg a in our consolidated statement of operations there were no changes to our existing finance leases required by the adoption of ifrs 16 which we continue to capitalize at their commencement included in property plant and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet and include the corresponding liability net of finance costs on our consolidated balance sheet see note 8 at march 31 2019 our rou assets were 115 8 and our related lease obligations were 118 1 during q1 2019 we recognized lease depreciation charges of 7 9 and interest expense on our lease obligations of 1 5 in our consolidated statement of operations we also made lease payments of 8 3 related to lease obligations under ifrs 16 the following table sets forth the adjustments to our operating lease commitments at december 31 2018 as disclosed in our 2018 afs used to derive the lease obligations recognized on our initial application of ifrs 16 at january 1 2019 operating lease commitments at december 31 2018 107 4 discounted using our incremental borrowing rate at january 1 2019 13 2 recognition exemption for short term and low value leases 1 9 extension options reasonably certain to be exercised 19 7 lease obligations recognized at january 1 2019 under ifrs 16 112 0 lease obligations previously classified as finance leases under ias 17 10 4 total lease obligations at january 1 2019 122 4 we are the lessee of property plant and equipment primarily buildings and machinery at the inception of a contract we assess whether the arrangement is or contains a lease in accordance with ifrs 16 if we determine that it does we recognize an rou asset and a related lease obligation on the applicable lease commencement date an rou asset is initially measured based on the initial amount of the lease obligation subject to certain adjustments if any and then subsequently measured at such cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment depreciation expense on an rou asset is recorded using the straight line method over the lease term in cost of sales or sg a in our consolidated statement of operations primarily based on the nature and use of the asset the lease obligation is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments on the commencement date discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate cannot be readily determined we use our incremental borrowing rate taking country specific risks into consideration based on information available on the lease commencement date we generally use our incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate the interest expense on the lease obligations is recognized as finance costs in our consolidated statement of operations the lease obligation is remeasured when there are adjustments to future lease payments arising from a change in applicable indices or rates changes in the estimated amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee or if we change our assessment of whether we will exercise an applicable purchase extension or termination option upon any such remeasurement a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the related rou asset or is recorded in our consolidated statement of operations if the carrying amount of such rou asset has been impaired 3 segment and customer reporting segments celestica delivers innovative supply chain solutions globally to customers in two operating and reportable segments advanced technology

earnings before income taxes 19 4 94 8 customers for q1 2019 we had two customers one from each of our segments that individually represented more than 10 of total revenue first quarter of 2018 q1 2018 two customers from our ccs segment seasonality from time to time we experience some level of seasonality in our quarterly revenue patterns across some of our businesses in recent periods revenue from the storage component of our ccs segment has increased in the fourth quarter of the year compared to the third quarter and then decreased in the first quarter of the following year reflecting the increase in customer demand we typically experience in this business in the fourth quarter of each year in addition we typically experience our lowest overall revenue levels during the first quarter of each year there is no assurance that these patterns will continue the addition of new customers may also introduce different demand cycles than our existing businesses creating more volatility and unpredictability in our revenue patterns as we adjust to this shift these and other factors make it difficult to isolate the impact of seasonality on our business 4 acquisitions in april 2018 we completed the acquisition of u s based atrenne integrated solutions inc atrenne a designer and manufacturer of ruggedized electromechanical solutions primarily for military and commercial aerospace applications the final purchase price for atrenne was 140 3 net of cash acquired the original purchase was reduced by 1 4 as we finalized a working capital adjustment the purchase price was financed

allocation above our annual amortization of intangible assets will increase by approximately 15 as a result of the impakt acquisition the goodwill arising from this acquisition is not tax deductible we engaged third party consultants to provide valuations of certain inventory property plant and equipment and intangible assets in connection with our purchases of atrenne and impakt the fair value of the acquired tangible assets was measured based on their value in use by applying the market sales comparison brokers quotes cost or replacement cost or the income discounted cash flow approach as deemed appropriate the valuation of the intangible assets by the third party consultants was primarily based on the income approach using a discounted cash flow model and forecasts based on management s subjective estimates and assumptions various level 2 and 3 data inputs of the fair value measurement hierarchy were used in the valuation of the above mentioned assets we incur consulting

reasons including as a result of the mix and volume of business in various tax jurisdictions within the americas europe and asia in jurisdictions with tax holidays and tax incentives and in jurisdictions for which no net deferred income tax assets have been recognized because management believed it was not probable that future taxable profit would be available against which tax losses and deductible temporary differences could be utilized our effective income tax rate can also vary due to the impact of restructuring charges foreign exchange fluctuations operating losses cash repatriations and changes in our provisions related to tax uncertainties no net tax impact was recorded on the gain from the sale of the toronto real property in q1 2019 as the gain was offset by the

for better or for worse oil is the lifeblood of the global economy with the commodity being the single most important energy source and while the developed economies are its biggest consumers emerging market assets can end up being the biggest beneficiaries crude oil prices have enjoyed a fantastic rally so far this year and received fresh impetus after the united states recently announced an end to sanction exemptions for iran oil buyers by may for china japan india turkey south korea and others as that rally rages on investors would do well to keep a close eye on the msci em currency index this index has been a notable winner producing double digit returns during each of the three largest oil rallies over the past two decades source philstar let s break it down by currency 1 russian ruble ytd change vs dollar 7 8 source x rates as the world s largest producer of natural gas russia s economy is highly sensitive to o g prices it s therefore hardly surprising that the russian ruble is the biggest winner of the oil rally with the currency having rallied 8 3 percent against the u s dollar so far this year the ruble has mostly recovered lost ground against the dollar after getting hammered last year due to the oil selloff and is now looking to replicate its world beating gain of 21 percent from february 2016 to october 2018 during the last major oil rally the leading em currency has also been benefiting from record uptake of ruble denominated debt and a robust current account surplus 2 colombian peso ytd change 3 0 traders have been swooning over the colombian peso thanks to its qualities as a carry trade higher oil prices and a favorable political backdrop colombia s relatively high interest rates make the currency a carry trade destination while a stable political and economic outlook are fueling enthusiasm for the country related saudi oil minister we won t ramp up oil production soon after 50 years of conflict the colombian government finally struck a peace treaty with guerrilla group revolutionary armed forces of colombia or farc and voted for a replacement for long serving president juan manuel santos 3 brazilian real ytd change 1 2 the real is a tricky bet because of the country s planned pension overhaul brazilian stocks recently hit 3 month lows on signs of political infighting as well as fears that president jair bolsonaro might not be fully committed to consensus building necessary to get lawmakers to pass the pension reform bill the biggest positive driver for the currency right now is the fact that it has become cheap 4 turking lira ytd change 9 7 source x rates advertisement turkey imports most of its crude oil from iran and is one of the countries facing waiver exemptions by the united states the nation has often lagged its em peers whenever oil prices climb which coupled with the unstable political backdrop make the lira a potential weak link 5 indian rupee ytd change 0 6 crude oil is india s biggest import item with nearly 15 percent of its gdp going to purchase the commodity indeed india is the world s third largest oil importer and has posted trade deficits every month over the past five years consequently the indian rupee has been the most negatively correlated currency to crude prices over the past five years essentially meaning that rising prices don t bode well for the indian economy over the short term the trajectory of the ongoing elections is likely to drive investor sentiment 6 philippine peso ytd change 1 6 the peso was one of the worst performing em currencies during the last oil rally this time around however it seems to be holding up much better thanks to a more supportive domestic backdrop by alex kimani for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com

compares to 0 92 a share gaap and 0 96 per share operating for the first quarter of 2018 positive drivers were fully realized outcomes from the multitude of rate cases from 2017 to 2019 increased transmission margins from invested capital and lower o m mostly timing in this case the company continues to excel and our employees continue to deliver on the execution of our strategy of being the premium regulated utility overall this was a great quarter for the company there are a few topics we d like to cover before moving on to coverage of our financial performance first regarding the oklahoma rate case outcome this was an important case while we didn t get everything we hoped to achieve we were successful in gaining our most important objectives an improved roe opportunity riders for transmission and some distribution investments and most of all a much improved regulatory environment the outcome of the case bodes well for our continued focus on renewables and hopefully natural gas at some point in the state i will discuss the regulated wind rfp initiative later we certainly appreciate the constructive focus of the oklahoma corporation commission the staff and parties on this case our acquisition of the sempra renewables portfolio is now finalized and we are moving forward with our renewables buildout according to plan we have extended employment offers which have been accepted by many of the members of the previous sempra team and we welcome them to the aep family we are excited about the acquisition of the existing operational projects the additional development projects and the safe harbor equipment that can provide additional value in addition to that effort we have significant opportunities for renewables in our regulated businesses pso and swepco issued an rfp for up to 2 200 megawatts of wind generation we have completed the bid process and received many quality responses we are in the process of negotiating terms with the preferred bidders and plan to file with the state commissions in july requesting approvals to proceed this should allow time for approvals in 2020 and for commercial operations of the projects by the end of 2021 as a reminder these projects are consistent with our integrated resource plans and they are currently not included in our capital and funding plans now to the ohio clean air fund legislation the company is supportive of the ohio house leadership s focus and efforts on addressing key energy policy issues that have plagued the state for years in order for the legislation to benefit all ohio customers there are certain issues that must be addressed first an elimination of the renewable portfolio standard should be replaced with the opportunity for utilities to voluntarily develop economic renewable resources in the state in addition contracts entered into under the existing renewable portfolio standard must be grandfathered so as to not punish utilities who are compliant with ohio law second in regards to energy efficiency aep is concerned about a rapid elimination of ee programs that have benefited our customers for many years in lieu of immediate elimination of ee programs previously approved plans should be phased out over the next several years we look forward to working with lawmakers during the process to achieve a balanced energy bill that provides benefits to all ohio customers turning to the equalizer chart on slide 5 aep s overall regulated operations roe is currently 10 1 versus 9 7 last quarter placing us at the upper end of our targeted range the improvement in the first quarter of 2019 versus the fourth quarter of 2018 is due to rate case outcomes in several of our jurisdictions as well as the timing effects of lower o m and taxes now let s take a look at the individual companies the seat adjusted roe for aep ohio at the end of the first quarter was 13 2 versus 13 1 in the fourth quarter of 2018 this year we will only be showing the seat adjusted roe since the legacy items are rolling off throughout the year we expect to end 2019 in the 13 range appalachian power s roe at the end of the first quarter was 9 5 comparable to last quarter apco received an order from west virginia at the end of february approving their settlement which includes a 44 million rate based increase with a 9 75 roe effective march 6th of this year the roe for kentucky power at the end of the first quarter was 8 6 compared to 9 at the end of 2018 the slight decline was primarily due to lower sales and usage driven by weather and an unfavorable tax adjustment i m s performance remained strong at 12 8 versus 11 4 at the end of 2018 i m s positive performance was driven by the favorable rate reviews that occurred mid 2018 as well as continued discipline managing o m expenses the roe for pso improved to 8 versus 6 9 at the end of 2018 this primarily reflects the implementation of the 2017 base rate case better weather and the absence of wind catcher expenses pso received an order on its base case settlement in march 2019 approving a 46 million increase and a 9 4 roe rates went into effect in april of this year importantly the order contained a provision for full transmission tracker and a partial distribution tracker pso is expected to approach its authorized roe by the end of this year the roe for swepco stands at 7 2 versus 6 5 at the end of 2018 this improvement is due to incremental reg relief and lower o m expenses also reflecting the absence of wind catcher expenses we filed an arkansas based rate case in february seeking a 46 million rate increase based on a requested 10 5 roe swepco s roe continues to be affected by the arkansas share of the turk plant that is not in rates this impacts roe by 135 basis points the roe for aep texas at the end of the first quarter was 7 6 versus 8 5 at the end of 2018 the expected decline in roe is due to lag associated with the timing of annual filings and our base rate review that we plan to file with the puct on may 1st of this year continued high level of investments and timing of our plan comprehensive rate review will continue to impact the roe in this year the roe for aep transmission holdco at the end of the first quarter was 9 9 comparable to last quarter the under recovery of expenses that occurred in 2018 will be trued up this june aep transmission holdco is projected to achieve an roe of approximately 10 by year end we are off to a great start in 2019 so let s go through the financial results for the quarter provide some insight on the economy and finish with a review of our balance sheet and liquidity looking at slide 6 which shows that operating earnings for the first quarter were 1 19 per share or 585 million compared to 0 96 per share or 473 million in 2018 looking at the earnings drivers by segment operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were 0 63 per share up 0 16 favorable drivers included higher rate changes due to recovery of incremental investment afudc and transmission revue as well as lower o m income taxes were also a driver for the quarter but will not be for the year due to timing partially offsetting these favorable items were lower normalized load unfavorable weather compared to last year and increased depreciation expense the transmission and distribution utilities segment earned 0 32 per share up 0 07 from last year primarily driven by the reversal of a regulatory provision in ohio other favorable drivers included higher transmission revenue and rate changes partially offsetting these favorable items were higher depreciation o m and unfavorable weather the aep transmission holdco segment continued to grow contributing 0 25 per share an improvement of 0 04 over last year this growth reflected the return on incremental rate base net plant increased by 1 4 billion or 19 since march of last year generation and marketing produced earnings of 0 09 per share up 0 01 from last year increases in retail and wholesale margins were offset by lower generation sales due to planned retirements and outages finally corporate and other was down 0 05 from last year primarily driven by unfavorable income tax adjustment and other consolidating tax items that will reverse by year end other variants related to higher interest expense and lower o m overall we experienced a solid quarter and are confident in reaffirming our annual operating earnings guidance now let s turn to slide 7 before we dig into the detail for the quarter let me highlight some minor changes to the slide you may have noticed that our growth estimates for the 2019 forecast of commercial and industrial sales have changed from what we presented in the last earnings release while total and residential sales remain unchanged this is due to a reclassification between the commercial and industrial classes there were no customer tariff or revenue impacts just geography and presentations between the two classes for ease of use we have adjusted the prior quarters to reflect the new classifications now let s look at the quarterly detail starting in the lower right chart normalized retail sales decreased by 0 3 for the quarter compared to 2018 it is worth mentioning that retail sales were down in all of the vertically integrated utilities while each of the t d utilities experienced modest growth in the quarter moving clockwise industrial sales decreased by 0 4 for the quarter sales in the industrial class have been slowing in recent quarters as the impact of a strong dollar and a more restrictive trade policy have challenged export manufacturers within aep s footprint during last year s first quarter earnings call we reported widespread growth across all operating companies in every one of the top 10 industrial sectors now a year later industrial sales grew only in our western operating companies and ohio and in only six of the top 10 industrial sectors the majority of this came from the oil and gas sectors i ll provide more color on our industrial sales on the next slide in the upper left chart normalized residential sales increased by 0 9 compared to the first quarter of 2018 the growth in residential sales was partially due to customer account growth which increased by 0 5 while the rest came from growth in normalized usage incomes grew faster than inflation for the quarter which provided our customers with more disposable income i ll provide more detail on the economy later in the presentation finally in the upper right chart commercial sales decreased by 1 7 commercial sales were down across all operating companies the tightening labor market and rising interest rates have limited this sector s growth in recent quarters turning to slide 8 i want to provide a little more color with respect to our industrial sales the chart shows the disparity in sales between the oil and gas sectors and all other industrial sectors the oil and gas sector load shown in blue mirrors the pattern in oil prices over time as expected for the quarter industrial sales in the oil and gas sectors increased by 5 1 while the rest of our industrial sales shown in red declined by 2 2 we expect the growth in oil and gas to continue through 2019 as prices recover in addition our economic development team has identified a number of new oil and gas projects that are expected to come online throughout the year now focusing on the red bars you see the non oil and gas industrials experienced robust growth in 2018 until the trade policy changes were announced at the end of the first quarter since then a noticeable deceleration has occurred most of this slowdown can be traced back to export industries such as chemical manufacturing which is down 9 for the quarter as discussed on previous calls aep has a higher exposure to trade policy given the higher concentration of export manufacturers located within the service territory now let s turn to slide 9 and review the status of our regional economies as shown in the upper left chart gdp growth in aep service territory was 2 9 for the quarter which is 0 1 above the u s outside of kentucky gdp growth for every operating company was within 0 2 of the u s for the quarter the upper right chart shows that the gap in employment growth between aep service territory and the u s did not change in the first quarter job growth in aep s territory was still 1 3 with higher growth coming from the west for most of the oil and gas activities located in fact job growth in the natural resources and mining sector posted the strongest growth in the quarter at 4 3 other sectors that experienced robust job growth for the quarter include construction professional and business services education and health services and leisure and hospitality the final chart at the bottom shows that income growth within aep s footprint improved in the first quarter while u s income growth moderated for the quarter personal incomes within aep s service territory increased by 3 7 which was 0 5 below the u s as described earlier income growth is a key driver for residential and commercial sales now let s move on to slide 10 and review the company s capitalization and liquidity our debt to total capital ratio increased 0 8 during the quarter to 57 8 our ffo to debt ratio finished the quarter at 18 1 we expect this ratio to decline over the year as we flow back adit to customers but expect the number to remain in the baa1 range our net liquidity stood at about 3 1 billion supported by our revolving credit facility our qualified pension funding decreased to 98 and our opeb funding moderately increased to 131 a drop in yields increased the liabilities for both plans but strong equity returns helped offset the liability increases in march aep issued 805 million of mandatory convertible equity units this issuance combines a three year junior subordinated debt instrument with a three year forward purchase contract for equity this issuance de risks our financing plan by providing required capital now and equity later when needed and not sooner it delays equity needs above our drip program until 2022 the issuance maintains our balance sheet strength enhances our credit metrics and allows us to invest growth capital for the benefit of our customers and for the recently closed renewables transaction let s try and wrap this up on slide 11 so we can get to your questions we will move forward with opportunities in the renewables space and continue to optimize our o m spend our performance in the first quarter and the stability of our regulated business model gives us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of 4 00 4 20 per share with that i will turn the call over to the operator for your questions questions and answers operator okay ladies and gentlemen if you do wish to ask a question please press 1 at this time you will hear a tone indicating you ve been placed in queue you can remove yourself at any time by pressing once again it s 1 our first question will come from the line of praful mehta with citigroup please go ahead praful mehta citigroup analyst thanks so much hi guys brian x tierney chief financial officer good morning praful praful mehta citigroup analyst morning so maybe just the details on the mandatory convert in 22 what are the terms in terms of what price at which you expect the forward to convert into equity brian x tierney chief financial officer it was priced at 82 98 and the company gets the benefit of the first 20 of upside so to almost 100 00 per share and we re locked in on the downside from that price praful mehta citigroup analyst got it thank you and then on the renewable side i wanted to understand a couple of things is there any exposure that the current renewable business has to california in terms of pg e or edison in terms of any bp exposure as counterparties and also i want to understand when you say move forward with renewable opportunities in the future are you looking at incremental investments even in 2019 beyond the sempra acquisition brian x tierney chief financial officer a couple things there praful we don t have any direct credit exposure to the california utilities on those most of those are direct third party consumers of that electricity so we don t have that exposure that others do in regards to the investment in the renewables portfolio we had talked about a five year spend of about 2 2 billion with certain projects including the renewables portfolio from sempra we ve spent about 1 5 billion of that commitment so we have roughly 700 million left and we re looking at opportunities as they become available we feel that the sempra transaction was at a very good value to the company considering both the existing projects and the developmental projects and we were able to by making that acquisition early in the five year period we were able to solidify and de risk that 2 2 billion forecast of spend so we re on our way to meeting the 2 2 billion commitment and we re evaluating these development projects with the portfolio and looking at other opportunities as well praful mehta citigroup analyst got it but you don t expect to go above the 2 2 billion it will stay within that budget brian x tierney chief financial officer that s our anticipation at this point praful mehta citigroup analyst very helpful thank you guys brian x tierney chief financial officer thanks praful operator the next question comes from the line of julien dumoulin with bank of america please go ahead julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning everyone brian x tierney chief financial officer good morning julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst so to pick up where praful left off in terms of the incremental and the 2 2 billion versus the 1 5 billion commitment already i understand that you have some inventoried assets that you acquired as part of that sempra transaction i d be curious how do you think about leveraging that for further investments on the repowering side when would you need to provide some updates obviously just given the limited window remaining here from a safe harbor perspective and then separately if you can clarify obviously the 2 2 billion is over a five year period it would appear that at least from a timing perspective you re ahead of what you d introduced from a ratable improvement in the eei slides last november i would think brian x tierney chief financial officer julien i m going to ask chuck zebula who runs that business and who you know to address those questions charles e zebula executive vice president energy supply good morning julien so yes there are opportunities that we re pursuing as you know we just closed on the transaction on monday we re actively working with our new team members on the status of the development projects even as we have taken over this week there s some positive news coming out of a township vote in michigan on one of our projects so there s still additional due diligence we realize that the time is ticking to reach 2020 we may reach the light of day on one or two of these by 2020 but i can t commit to that at this point in time they can turn into 21 projects with some structuring and items we would need to do with other parties but nonetheless there are opportunities here and they re relatively small bites as opposed to significant large projects and that s why we think a lot of these could get done within the 700 million that brian had talked about julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and then in terms of timing charles e zebula executive vice president energy supply in terms of timing i think absolutely we ll be updating quarterly where we are on some of this stuff it s full push forward but yeah as we ve pulled the transaction and the spend earlier you ll see the earnings from those contributions here in 19 and beyond julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and just to clarify this point obviously you ve got a number of rfps out there on the wind catcher 2 0 structure that s separate and distinct from any inventoried assets that you might have for repowering assets to beat the 2 2 billion bucket right brian x tierney chief financial officer that s correct julien completely different efforts julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst excellent all right i ll leave it there thank you operator next question comes from the line of ali agha with suntrust please go ahead ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey managing director thank you good morning brian x tierney chief financial officer good morning ali ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey managing director good morning brian in the past you folks have talked about confidence level of trending to the higher end of the upper half of the 5 7 range of earnings growth that you ve targeted are we still looking at it from that perspective and also to clarify that was based on the existing budget that was not assuming new incremental capex the existing budget could trend you in the upper half of the 5 7 is that still correct brian x tierney chief financial officer that s right ali and i think the way nick has phrased it before is this management team will be very disappointed if we re not in the upper end of that range ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey managing director upper end of the range got it okay and then separately these rfps and other opportunities particularly in renewables that you re working on can you give us some sense of size if these do come through and then you ve pointed out these would be incremental to the base plan what kind of cumulative size are we looking at in terms of that opportunity brian x tierney chief financial officer the regulated rfps that we ve issued in the market are for up to 2 200 megawatts and the reason that that s the number is that s consistent with what our irps in those jurisdictions would call for renewables so a significant amount not dissimilar to what we were talking about in terms of generation with wind catcher ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey managing director and that would be owned by aep all of that if that comes through brian x tierney chief financial officer yes ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey managing director okay and the timing around that again brian x tierney chief financial officer we re shooting for the end of 2021 ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey managing director got it and last brian x tierney chief financial officer ali to your point those plans are not in our capital and funding plans today but we ll adjust those plans as we go forward and we firm up how much it is we re talking about and confirm that the timing is at the end of 2021 ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey managing director got it final question brian on the transmission front you ve laid out a very strong growth outlook through 2021 very specifically as you look out beyond that at least through 23 since your capex budget goes out that many years are you looking at a similar kind of growth over the 22 23 period or does it taper off how are you looking at that transmission growth brian x tierney chief financial officer no we see our ability to continue to grow investment in that space for the foreseeable future one of the things when you have the largest transmission system in the country you have the largest aging transmission system in the country so there s significant opportunity for us to continue to invest in our own assets and then there s also significant development that we need to do on cyber security and other efforts where we re just beginning to see the front end of that significant increase in spend ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey managing director thank you brian x tierney chief financial officer thanks ali operator our next question comes from the line of christopher turner with jp morgan please go ahead christopher turner jp morgan executive director good morning brian i have another question on renewables here just broadly speaking i think you talked about the value of the development portfolio within the sempra purchase but if you step back and think about the decision to buy that versus build it and the decision to go in more of a wind versus a solar direction here what informed those decisions and how do you think about your strategic edge in owning these assets versus others brian x tierney chief financial officer christopher chuck and his team have been very selective in the assets that they ve looked at and they re looking for high quality contracted assets with credit worthy counterparties so they ve been looking at on a project by project basis until this opportunity came along what this opportunity brought with it was a lot of wind some battery contracted with high quality counterparties but it also brought a team with it and that team is something that we didn t organically have from a development standpoint so we got not just a team but also development projects in the pipeline that we wouldn t have had otherwise so whether they re repowering or the new project that chuck talked about with the municipal it takes our business to the next level and not to say we re going to be the next nextera because i don t think that s our aspiration but it firms up and de risks our ability to put that 2 2 billion to work like we talked about so i think with chuck s existing commercial team their conservative approach to making sure that we get high quality assets combined with the new development team that we get from sempra i think we have a pretty strong organization to go forward and execute against the strategic plans that we ve laid out christopher turner jp morgan executive director is it fair to think about the returns that you re going to get there long term as being pretty competitive with what you re earning at the t d businesses and the generation businesses today on the utilities side brian x tierney chief financial officer very much so christopher turner jp morgan executive director okay and then my second question is a follow up to an earlier one on the long term eps guidance i wanted to make sure i was properly understanding everything here you have a situation where you d be disappointed if you weren t at the high end of the 5 7 range and just year to date you ve pulled forward that capex with the sempra deal you ve had a constructive settlement in oklahoma that s going to allow you to earn a more fair return there and you still have the potential for the rfp on the utility side with the renewables is there any timing shift within that 5 7 range that s occurred here or is it kind of still back end weighted for the high end of that range brian x tierney chief financial officer as we talk about this year we believe we re on track to be inside that 4 00 4 20 range which puts us in the mid part of that range i think as we execute against some of these things it s going to take time for them to cumulatively push us to the higher end of that range so i d say no change on this year and as we look forward to future years as we execute both regulated and some of these competitive opportunities i think that s when we ll be expecting to be in the upper end of that range christopher turner jp morgan executive director that s fair thanks brian brian x tierney chief financial officer thanks christopher operator next question comes from the line of paul patterson with glenrock please go ahead paul patterson glenrock associates analyst good morning brian x tierney chief financial officer good morning paul paul patterson glenrock associates analyst on the significant excess the seat reversal i apologize what triggered that it looks like it s a 2016 item that reversed brian x tierney chief financial officer so paul it was a number of things 2016 was the year that we had the global settlement in ohio and there was some risk as to whether or not issues that were included in the global settlement would be included in the calculation of seat for that year we believe they should have been excluded and that s the basis on which we filed our 2016 seat we had a unanimous settlement saying that there was no significantly excess earnings in 2016 and did not get an order on that until this year so when we looked at that we had significant risk around that we re uncomfortable at that point given the risk that existed in taking that to income made the reserve at the time and now with the positive order on the settlement are able to reverse that paul patterson glenrock associates analyst wow they took that long for a settlement for an order excuse me that s nonrecurring right brian x tierney chief financial officer i want to be clear about that it s included in gaap earnings and we ve included it in ongoing earnings but it s an item that will not repeat next year paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and then with respect to the ohio legislation previously you guys had concerns about aep utility ratepayers paying for other companies nuclear plants how do you guys feel about hb 6 as it currently stands i know you raised a couple of the issues in your prepared remarks this morning can you give a little more color on that brian x tierney chief financial officer so we think if there s a full package where all of ohio customers can benefit then it s a worthy effort if it s just a bailout for one company or another it s not as beneficial to all ohio customers so there needs to be a full package of things that get addressed and energy efficiency the renewable portfolio standard ability of utilities to invest in renewables going forward are all important things that need to be in the bill and if they re not it s not as beneficial for ratepayers in the state paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and with respect to the energy efficiency if those changes did take place do you think it would have a meaningful impact on your retail sales growth brian x tierney chief financial officer we do not paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay thanks so much brian x tierney chief financial officer thanks paul operator next we go to the line of michael lapides with goldman sachs please go ahead michael lapides goldman sachs analyst hey guys brian thanks for taking the question just curious can you remind us what the sensitivity to changes in weather normalized demand are in terms of meeting not just current year guidance but your multiyear growth rate i ask and i know it s only one quarter but some of the demand metrics on the commercial side seem pretty weak and that s obviously you get a lot of demand from industrial but it tends to be lower margin but commercial and residential tends to be higher margin brian x tierney chief financial officer we re trying to look up what the sensitivities are right now we think that we re on track to get where we need to be for the year even though we re slightly off for the first quarter again we make more from places where we sell integrated utility product than just the t d side but for changes half a percent change in residential is half a penny for t d utilities for vertically integrated utilities it s 1 4 commercial again is about half that half a percent change for vertically integrated utilities is 7 10 of a penny for t d utilities it s 1 10 of a penny and for industrial sales 0 5 change is the same as it is for commercial 7 10 of a penny for vertically integrated and 1 10 of a penny for t d utilities michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you and one other question just trying to think about texas what s driving the under earning in texas texas is a state where you ve got both transmission and distribution cost recovery riders so just curious what s the biggest driver of the regulatory lag you re experiencing now brian x tierney chief financial officer there s a couple things going on there michael one is the fact that we are investing so much in the state that even with those very timely recoveries we just can t keep up with the amount of capital that we re putting to work in the state the second thing is as we go in for the base rate case this year we need to suspend those short term trackers for the near term until we get everything caught up in the base rate case and then we can put those trackers back in the space so that is going to cause a little bit of lag this year and next year as well michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you brian much appreciated brian x tierney chief financial officer thanks michael operator and next we go to the line of andrew weisel please go ahead andrew weisel scotia howard weil director hey good morning everybody congratulations on the pso outcome my question there is does this change your capex plan at all with the transmission tracker would you consider increasing capex at pso and would that drive an increase to the overall spending or would it be shifted away from other subsidiaries i see the pie chart is unchanged but just wondering how to think about that brian x tierney chief financial officer so what this means for us is that oklahoma is open for business again so we had previously when we were under that prolonged period of under earning at pso we had shifted capital to more welcoming jurisdictions that allowed us to have higher roes and that had trackers now that we have appropriate trackers in public service of oklahoma we re going to shift capital that had been shifted away from oklahoma back into the state and have that benefit the ratepayers and customers in that state so it s not so much a huge increase although it is but we re shifting dollars back in that have been shifted out and that s positive for pso andrew weisel scotia howard weil director makes a lot of sense then my other question is on ohio wind my understanding is you re able to own up to 450 megawatts out of the 500 planned my question is for the portion signed through ppa would you expect a debt equivalency cost mechanism i know you have that for solar but it s small how do you think about that for wind ppas brian x tierney chief financial officer yes we would expect a debt equivalency on those as well if our utilities balance sheets are being consumed to support ppas we need to be compensated for that and the rating agencies ding us for those and we need to make sure that we re filling in that gap that we re getting dinged for by entering into those ppas so we think debt equivalency is appropriate on all renewable ppas that we don t own andrew weisel scotia howard weil director okay and i know there s not a lot of precedent obviously michigan just settled upon that you used the word need twice in your answer there is that a nice to have or a must have brian x tierney chief financial officer how can i say this it s appropriate to have them and it s inappropriate not to have them andrew weisel scotia howard weil director fair enough thank you very much brian x tierney chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from angie storozynski with macquarie please go ahead angie storozynski macquarie capital partners analyst thank you so i wanted to go back to 2019 guidance so the sempra acquisition came earlier than expected and you mentioned that it would be earnings accretive this year the oklahoma rate case settlement was better than expected so what s the negative offset that you re still in the middle of the range brian x tierney chief financial officer so there s a couple things going on in addition to the sempra acquisition there are also some financing costs associated with that and so we do expect gen and marketing to be ahead a couple pennies we expect corporate and other to be a drag as we finance that and our aep transmission holdco while improving is not going to be as strong as what we thought it was going to be when we provided guidance due to some tracking items on o m and due to our inability to get everything into capital base that we thought we would by the end of last year so like any year there are things that are positive there are things that are negative as we work through the year and we still anticipate being in the midpoint of the guidance range angie storozynski macquarie capital partners analyst okay and for the swepco piece of renewables can we assume that all of these assets would be rate based brian x tierney chief financial officer yes that s what the rfp asked for build operate transfer to pso and swepco projects and that s largely how people responded and we would anticipate owning them and that s how we ll file with the commissions in july angie storozynski macquarie capital partners analyst okay thank you brian x tierney chief financial officer thank you angie operator and as a reminder if you do wish to ask a question please press 1 our next question comes from the line of mike lonegan with evercore please go ahead greg gordon evercore isi managing director hi it s greg gordon how are you doing brian x tierney chief financial officer hey greg greg gordon evercore isi managing director just to follow up on paul patterson s question on the reversal of the seat test issue when you initially booked that in the first instance was that also considered an operating item so this is sort of equal opportunity it was a drag in that year and now that you reversed it it s a help but in all cases you re consistently applying that methodology brian x tierney chief financial officer absolutely greg it was gaap and operating in both periods greg gordon evercore isi managing director okay thank you i just wanted to clarify that the second thing just as a follow up to angie s question i just want to make sure that i m not getting the implication wrong when you said that you re going to be ahead in the renewables business but then you have the financing costs associated with financing sempra is the implication that the sempra transaction is not really accretive on an earnings basis in 19 and if not what s the math there and how does that trend over time brian x tierney chief financial officer no greg it will be accretive in 19 it will be accretive going forward remember the financing was larger than what was needed just for that one project but it s an accretive project in the current period and in forward periods inclusive of financing costs greg gordon evercore isi managing director ah i understand but then part of that equity was allocated to just general corporate needs and we have to think about it that way brian x tierney chief financial officer that s correct greg gordon evercore isi managing director okay thank you brian x tierney chief financial officer thank you greg operator and we have no further questions in queue at this time bette jo rozsa managing director investor relations okay well thank you

executive officer daniel p amos stated i am pleased with the company s overall performance our strong first quarter results advanced our progress toward achieving the company s annual objectives aflac japan our largest earnings contributor generated strong financial results that were in line with our expectations for the quarter we continue to anticipate a slight decline in aflac japan s total earned premium in 2019 mainly due to limited pay policies reaching paid up status we also continue to anticipate full year sales of third sector and first sector protection products to decline in the low to mid single digits coming off the highest third sector sales year in recent history with the very successful launch of a new cancer product in the second quarter of 2018 turning to our u s operations we are pleased with the financial performance of aflac u s in the quarter which is particularly significant because these results also reflect ongoing investment in our platform distribution and customer experience our sales results were in line with our expectations for the quarter we continue to expect aflac u s to deliver solid results in 2019 with earned premium growth of 2 to 3 and stable sales growth we remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our policyholders and balancing our financial strength with reinvesting in our business increasing the dividend and repurchasing shares the dividend track record is supported by the strength of our capital and cash flows we continue to anticipate that we ll repurchase in the range of 1 3 to 1 7 billion of our shares in 2019 with the range allowing us to be more tactical in our deployment strategy as we demonstrated this quarter as is always the case this assumes stable capital conditions and the absence of compelling alternatives at the same time we recognize that prudent investment in our platform is critical to our growth strategy and driving efficiencies that will impact the bottom line for the long term i want to reiterate our 2019 earnings guidance our first quarter results reflect a strong start to the year benefiting from timing of expenses and a modestly favorable effective tax rate in the period which puts us on track to produce stable adjusted earnings per diluted share of 4 10 to 4 30 assuming the 2018 weighted average exchange rate of 110 39 yen to the dollar as

financial measures this earnings release includes references to aflac s non u s gaap financial measures adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per diluted share adjusted return on equity amortized hedge costs income and adjusted book value these measures are not calculated in accordance with u s gaap the measures exclude items that the company believes may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in insurance operations because they tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or related to infrequent activities not directly associated with insurance operations management uses adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted return on equity to evaluate the financial performance of aflac s insurance operations on a consolidated basis and believes that a presentation of these measures is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of aflac s insurance business the company believes that amortized hedge costs income which are a component of adjusted earnings measure the periodic currency risk management costs income related to hedging certain foreign currency exchange risks and are an important component of net investment income the company considers adjusted book value important as it excludes accumulated other comprehensive income aoci which fluctuates due to market movements that are outside management s control definitions of the company s non u s gaap financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable u s gaap measures are provided below and in the following schedules due to the size of aflac japan where the functional currency is the japanese yen fluctuations in the yen dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on reported results in periods when the yen weakens translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported when the yen strengthens translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported consequently yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current period results in relation to the comparable prior period while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current period results in relation to the comparable prior period a significant portion of the company s business is conducted in yen and never converted into dollars but translated into dollars for u s gaap reporting purposes which results in foreign currency impact to earnings cash flows and book value on a u s gaap basis because foreign exchange rates are outside of management s control aflac believes it is important to understand the impact of translating japanese yen into u s dollars adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted return on equity all excluding current period foreign currency impact are computed using the average yen dollar exchange rate for the comparable prior year period which eliminates fluctuations driven solely by yen to dollar currency rate changes the average yen dollar exchange rate is based on the published mufg bank ltd telegraphic transfer middle rate ttm aflac defines the non u s gaap financial measures included in this earnings release as follows adjusted earnings are adjusted revenues less benefits and adjusted expenses the adjustments to both revenues and expenses account for certain items that cannot be predicted or that are outside management s control adjusted revenues are u s gaap total revenues excluding realized investment gains and losses except for amortized hedge costs income related to foreign currency exposure management strategies and net interest cash

by jorge amar scott ferguson in a few weeks a general election will be held in spain the optimistic verdict of the spanish mass media concerning the economy is clear the spanish economy is purportedly a paradigm of recovery and macroeconomic management that should serve as a model for other member countries of the eurozone if this is genuinely the case however then why is the spanish miracle not providing any discernible hope for spaniards in surveys carried out by the reputable centro de investigaciones sociológicas 60 6 of spaniards identify unemployment as their greatest concern and for the most part perceive the economic situation as bad 35 7 or very bad 14 9 the answer is that most households have not shared in the recovery touting record growth analysts both domestic and international have joined in chorus celebrating the success of the so called german model in spain this counter intuitive and frankly suicidal approach to economic crisis recommends forcing further deflation via government cutbacks the idea is to induce an internal devaluation of spain s economy relative its eurozone partners thereby rendering spanish exports more competitive abroad in other words millions suffer and generations are lost while neoliberals insist the only way up is paradoxically down spain s apparent recovery is mostly an illusion built up from stylized facts in truth the acclaimed surplus in the current account balance has been the result of a deleterious free fall in imports and steady expansion of low value added exports such as food fuel and intermediate goods so while aggregate demand has risen and the current account balance looks to be in surplus relative to its previous position spain s productive capacity continues to atrophy as it replaces high with low skill jobs and ship materials outside the country the perverse effects of this process have been registered by the national statistics institute s employer confidence index showing that for the first time since 2017 more firms expect business to worsen than improve they have appeared in spain s industrial production index which began downgrading the development of country s industrial capabilities beginning at the end on 2018 and they are most evident in the balance sheets of spanish firms and households which are now deeply and unsustainable in the red meanwhile spain s alleged economic rebound has only normalized unemployment and poverty as workers continuously lose ground in their share of national income to the owners of capital if the distribution that existed before the outbreak of the crisis had been maintained writes javier g jorrín labour incomes would have to increase by 32 6 billion euros and gross operating surplus gos would have to be reduced by 8 1 billion in short a transfer of 40 000 million from capital to wages neither the number of employed nor total wages have recovered from the crisis as jorrín also notes spain currently has the same total wages at current prices as in 2008 with 780 000 fewer wage earners what is more spain remains the nation with the second highest unemployment rate in the eu surpassed only by greece it is unsurprising that high unemployment and uneven income distribution has been accompanied by a drastic increase in wealth inequality in spain this amounts to on the one hand an increase in the number of rich and ultra rich from 144 600 in 2012 to 224 200 in 2017 despite the economy s precipitous fall during the first years of the global financial crisis the spanish 1 would come to possess 25 of the country s wealth by 2017 on the other hand poverty and social exclusion are spreading as isabel garcía reports nearly one in three children under 16 years of age 31 with 10 8 living in severe poverty 13 1 of the spanish population retired between 2014 and 2018 and 14 1 of the employed now risk falling below the poverty line at the same time both centrist social democrats psoe and right wing pp in the spanish government have approved debilitating austerity measures euphemistically called reforms that have strengthened capital in its struggle for national income spain s social expenditure gap in comparison to other european economies has not been reduced at all totalling 16 8 of gdp social expenditure in spain is still significantly lower than the european union average of 19 1 with france spending 24 4 and portugal 18 of gdp the results of have been disastrous labor and capital battle over unpaid overtime which today constitutes around 46 of overtime worked and spaniards continue to lose confidence in the major labor unions which have all too readily conceded to the government s austerity measures far from improving the spanish economy the growth strategy pursued by the pp and psoe governments has exacerbated systemic problems making life ever more difficult for the poor principally the government s strategy has been to stoke property bubbles and expand rental markets rather than spending directly on communities and delivering jobs to the unemployed such inflationary spending has reduced individual savings to a record low mirroring the dangerous savings levels spain saw on the eve of the financial crisis the latest real estate bubble arose in two stages first the zapatero social democrat government legalized real estate investment trusts reits next the popular party created tax incentives and expedited the sale of public property housing and companies to vulture funds this includes properties held by the bad bank created by the spanish government in the aftermath of the financial crisis when it relieved the four nationalized spanish financial institutions of their toxic assets as a consequence spain has seen an explosion in speculative real estate investments and now ranks second in the world in real estate investment trusts spanish cities are pushing out the poor to make room for the wealthy in the words of manuel gabarre and sonia martínez city centers are being reduced to renting flats to tourists and housing expatriates people coming from other countries with highly paid jobs and who can pay a rent that the normal spanish citizen cannot afford and newly privatized public companies have also ended up in the hands of vulture funds from the airport manager aena to the railway service renfe adif the government is abandoning public infrastructures and responsibilities and instead delivering enormous sources of income to the private sector should election forecasts prove correct and the psoe maintains its grip on power the psoe government s disastrous neoliberal policies will likely be carried out in full support of both brussels and the major political parties on the right a psoe government will not lack allies in the spanish parliament to pass neoliberal economic policy dictated from brussels such parties include the pp and the liberal ciudadanos who on economic matters are typically allied with the social democrats in votes in the european parliament but could also include vox the party of the spanish ultra right that said resistance does persist and especially in the embattled region of catalonia it is striking for example that left wing parties in catalonia did not support the psoe s 2018 draft budget and have since received increased support in the polls at present the catalonian party known as esquerra republicana de catalunya erc is predicted to expand its 9 current deputies to around 14 or 15 the spanish central government has officially lifted its former suspension of the regional government s powers but the catalonian government nevertheless remains inactive if catalonian authorities manage to hold autonomous elections however erc representatives could go from 32 currently to between 40 and 43 still the only erc candidates who remain fully committed to the wishes of the catalan voters are oriol junqueras currently in prison and marta rovira exiled in switzerland they are also joined by carles riera i albert candidate for catalonia s anti capitalist and pro independence left wing party cup should they win in an autonomous election anti neoliberal representation would go from 4 to 8 deputies in the autonomous regions of catalonia although this would not include representation in the spanish parliament the cortes generales the fracture in spain s disappointing leftist party podemos is becoming most clear in madrid s local and regional elections which are set to take place after the general election most indicative of this breakdown is the fact that podemos s celebrity campaign manager iñigo errejón has decided not to represent the party in madrid s upcoming gubernatorial election breaking with podemos errejón is running as an independent on a business friendly más madrid platform errejón s campaign seems to hinge primarily on errejón personal celebrity moreover errejón is now joining forces with the openly left but tacitly neoliberal mayor of madrid manuela carmena who is presently seeking re election as a retired judge and former member of psoe associated think tank fundación alternativas mayor carmena has long spoken the language of the left in her 2015 ahora madrid now madrid campaign for instance she promised to build a meager 4 000 new public housing units and to make madrid an asylum city for mostly african immigrant street vendors who have been intimidated by the city s police and high end retailers during her first term however carmena has built fewer than 1 000 public housing units she has betrayed madrid s struggling street vendors by using city funds for a public relations campaign that instructs consumers to avoid buying their goods and she facilitated the sale of 1 27 million square meters of land owned the public railway company to property speculators and did so in brash defiance of social opposition movements including the municipal group of her now madrid project later commenting to le figaro on her failed promises carmena has characterized her platform as merely a set of suggestions while dismissing the leftist politics she has courted as inflexible with errejón at her side carmena now speaks in managerial and technocratic terms about forming a government of the best talents thus far however such team building has mostly translated into the firing of carlos sánchez mato a top leftist economist for the city government podemos party leaders are now expressly distancing themselves from errejón on account of his shift toward carmena s centrism however it is important to remember that carmena first rose to power with the express support of podemos and izquierda unida suggesting that podemos s current identity crisis is hardly new a major wildcard in the upcoming election is the scandal involving high stakes government corruption and watergate style criminality essentially the pp utilized a corrupt faction of the national police to spy on unidos podemos and fabricate documents which among other things implied that the podemos associated ceps foundation had received 7 1 million euros in support from hugo chavez s venezuelan government what is more the pp has leaked to alt right media sensitive personal information about pablo iglesias obtained illegally from a stolen cell phone belonging to a key aid of the podemos leader podemos has repeatedly attempted to subpoena the high ranking officer at the center of the plot as news of the scandal has come to light in turn the pp psoe and centrist ciudadanos parties have consistently blocked all such subpoenas yet recently the ruling psoe party was rocked by further scandal when presidential press secretary alberto pozas stepped down in response to espionage charges linking him directly to the leakage of the cell phone information the question now is whether last minute developments or revelations in this developing story will introduce any surprises in the forthcoming election barring such a surprise the anticipated results of the election are not likely to change the neoliberal policies that have shaped spain over the past 30 years tragically the 2019 general election will almost certainly deliver a significant blow to the spirit of 15m the anti austerity protest movement that began in march 2011 and defined a generation of spanish political resistance but all hope is not lost across spain there are pensioners tenants feminists students and numerous collectives of workers such as taxi drivers researchers and hotel cleaners who continue to resist the neoliberal order and demand social justice in the streets looking ahead the most crucial political contest for the spanish left concerns the uncertain fate of the euro currency zone and its fiscal straightjacket or golden rule in the short term spain caught the tailwind of european central bank s ecb bond purchase program while benefiting from the ecb s de facto suspension of its punishing golden rule for the pp government for these reasons the pp government s discretionary fiscal deficit slightly rose and real gdp growth minimally returned by the end of 2018 yet spain is now the last remaining country enjoy the ecb s soon to be defunct excessive deficit procedure when the new government forms after the election spain is set to begin a new era of fiscal consolidation which will not only curtail public deficits but also dissolve the mirage of the spanish miracle for the foreseeable future then any spanish left worthy of the name should do what every european leftist movement must do overturn the eurozone s spiral of austerity reclaim the public purse and revive the european community in a far more just and sustainable fashion jorge amar is a research scholar at the global institute for sustainable prosperity and the president and

buenos aires argentina tomás ruiz embraced his father one last time at the buenos aires airport before he boarded a plane in search of a new life in ireland his sister recently did the same when she moved to spain like many other young argentines the siblings hold european passports by descent and they are returning to the home countries of their grandparents far from argentina s sizzling inflation high unemployment and sharp currency depreciation my country s situation prompted me to take this decision ruiz said as he finished packing his bags for his trip to dublin surrounded by photos of his family and friends on the wall it was a constant frustration to live constantly on the edge barely making it to the end of the month ruiz studied gastronomy and was employed as a cafe manager in argentina s capital but even when he worked extra shifts he couldn t manage to save money and for months he had been living with his mother to save on rent outside his room family members left him and his sister farewell messages on a chalkboard i love you and i ll miss you his mother wrote others said the best is yet to come and carpe diem latin for seize the day it s not the first time argentines have sought shelter in europe in times of economic uncertainty hundreds of thousands emigrated to the old continent to escape hyperinflation in the early 1990s and an economic meltdown in 2001 and 2002 now argentines are losing purchasing power to a nearly 50 annual inflation rate one of the world s worst many have also protests president mauricio macri s decision to cut subsidies leading to a spike in the costs of utilities and public transportation last year the argentine peso lost more than half its value to the u s dollar following a run on the local currency causing the government to seek a record 56 billion bailout loan with the international monetary fund to try to come out of the recession as a result of the economic crisis and the devaluation more young professionals are thinking about a future in europe said alejandro servide director of professionals and recruitment process outsourcing at argentina s branch of randstad the world s second largest staffing company as part of the austerity measures aimed at balancing the budget macri s administration has laid off thousands of government workers and slashed funding for dance science and other programs hundreds recently protested outside the headquarters of the national scientific and technical research council argentina s main agency for science and technology the science sector is suffering because these budget cuts ordered by macri endanger the continuity of scientific activity said alberto kornblihtt a molecular biologist this is undoubtedly contributing to a brain drain that we ve suffered at other times of crisis in our country there are no official statistics available on how many argentines have moved to europe argentina s immigration directorate said it is nearly impossible to keep track of the number because argentines leaving the country don t have to provide information on their destination or how long they ll stay but academics research groups and consulting firms agree there has been a rise in the number of people leaving especially among young educated argentines just as there was during the nation s worst crisis 17 years ago back then millions were plunged into poverty more than 20 percent of the population became unemployed and many reportedly went hungry in a country that is one world s biggest producers of beef soy and wheat when argentina goes through these profound crises people search for options and just like it happened in 2001 2002 when nearly 800 000 argentines went abroad today we re living through perhaps the initial phase said ariel gonzalez executive secretary of the center for international studies at the catholic university of argentina that means that there s a sector of society the middle and high class professionals who are eyeing a plan b which is that if the crisis deepens one of the options would be to go abroad servide said randstad argentina carries out about 160 daily interviews for surveys one of the questions they ask is whether if given the chance they would be interested in living abroad about 80 percent tell you yes he said manuel miglioranza a 26 year old lawyer is moving next month to toulouse france although he doesn t have dual argentine french nationality he s going to take french lessons and find a job through a temporary work permit allowed through a treaty between the two nations the economic situation in argentina is not helping you can t progress unless you work for the state or you have dollars he said i know many people who are leaving millions of europeans flooded into argentina in the 19th century to escape war and poverty back home which has been a source of pride for the country argentina gave peace to those who were escaping war freedom to those escaping religious persecution and bread and work to those escaping hunger said horacio garcia director of argentina s national migration directorate of the last six presidents four of them were first generation sons of immigrants garcia noted their fathers came to argentina with a cardboard suitcase and they saw that their children in a short amount of time became presidents of the nation that hardly happens anywhere else in the world by the 20th century a strong workforce along with export earnings from agricultural products and beef had helped turn argentina into one of the wealthiest countries in the world argentines were also among the most europeanized and educated people in latin america gabriela nouzeilles and graciela montaldo write in their anthology the argentina reader history culture and politics their literacy rate about 90 percent was the highest by far until 1945 the country boasted the highest per capita income on the continent the most extensive urbanization the largest middle class as well as the best newspapers universities and publishing houses but political mismanagement and lower prices for agricultural products that form the country s economic backbone have for decades led to cyclical booms and busts the spanish government recently launched an initiative that allows a limited number of descendants of spaniards living in argentina without a spanish passport to seek a special three month work visa once they find a job they can request spanish nationality and bring their families there were 76 328 argentines officially registered by mid 2018 in spain there are many many argentines living here we re like pigeons everywhere quipped paz pucheu an argentine now living in spain the 25 year old radio and television announcer went to barcelona in 2017 when things got really complicated in argentina she began working at a restaurant and eventually landed a job at a local radio station like other latin american countries argentina was a spanish colony with friends now we joke around that we re colonizing our colonizers she said

expects cash flow before financing activities to increase significantly in 2019 compared to 2018 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 4 5 million in 2019 kitchen collection segment results kitchen collection generated revenue of 19 3 million for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 22 1 million for the first quarter of 2018 the decrease was due to the closure of underperforming stores and lower comparable store sales both of which reflect a continued downward trend in customer traffic at march 31 2019 kitchen collection operated 168 stores compared to 199 stores at march 31 2018 and 189 stores at december 31 2018 the operating loss of 3 7 million improved by 0 6 million compared to the operating loss of 4 3 million for the first quarter of 2018 as a result of store

leases kitchen collection believes it can right size its store portfolio aggressively over the next two years or so to a core group of 100 to 150 adequately profitable stores in favorable outlet mall locations store lease decisions will be based on store by store profitability the retail environment at store locations continues to be unfavorably affected by changing consumer shopping patterns as

capital drawn from fund investors plus net borrowings outstanding under a fund level credit facility if any where such borrowings were made in lieu of drawing capital from fund investors 2 represents capital drawn from fund investors net of distributions to such investors of uninvested capital divided by committed capital the aggregate change in drawn capital for the three months ended march 31 2019 was 0 7 billion 3 accrued incentives fund level exclude non gaap incentive income previously recognized 4 unreturned drawn capital plus accrued preferred return reflects the amount the fund needs to distribute to its investors as a return of capital and a preferred return as applicable before oaktree is entitled to receive incentive income other than tax distributions from the fund 5 the internal rate of return irr is the annualized implied discount rate calculated from a series of cash flows it is the return that equates the present value of all capital invested in an investment to the present value of all returns of capital or the discount rate that will provide a net present value of all cash flows equal to zero fund level irrs are calculated based upon the actual timing of cash contributions distributions to investors and the residual value of such investor s capital accounts at the end of the applicable period being measured gross irrs reflect returns before allocation of management fees expenses and any incentive allocation to the fund s general partner to the extent material gross returns include certain transaction advisory directors or other ancillary fees fee income paid directly to us in connection with our funds activities we credit all such fee income back to the respective fund s so that our funds investors share pro rata in the fee income s economic benefit net irrs reflect returns to non affiliated investors after allocation of management fees expenses and any incentive allocation to the fund s general partner 6 multiple of drawn capital is calculated as drawn capital plus gross income and if applicable fee income before fees and expenses divided by drawn capital 7 fund data include the performance of the main fund and any associated fund of one accounts except the gross and net irrs presented reflect only the performance of the main fund certain fund of one accounts pay management fees based on cost basis rather than committed capital 8 legacy funds represent certain predecessor funds within the relevant strategy or product that have substantially or completely liquidated their assets including funds managed by certain oaktree investment professionals while employed at the trust company of the west prior to oaktree s founding in 1995 when these employees joined oaktree upon or shortly after its founding they continued to manage the fund through the end of its term pursuant to a sub advisory relationship between the trust company of the west and oaktree 9 management fees during the investment period are calculated on drawn capital or cost basis rather than committed capital as a result as of march 31 2019 management fee generating aum included only that portion of committed capital that had been drawn 10 aggregate irrs or totals are based on the conversion of cash flows or amounts respectively from euros to usd using the march 31 2019 spot rate of 1 12 11 the fund s partnership interests are divided into class a and class b interests with the class a interests having priority with respect to the distribution of current income and disposition proceeds the net irr for class a interests was 10 4 and class b interests was 9 4 the combined net irr for class a and class b interests was 10 0 12 the fund s partnership interests are divided into class a and class b interests with the class a interests having priority with respect to the distribution of current income and disposition proceeds the net irr for class a interests was 10 8 and class b interests was 10 5 the combined net irr for the class a and class b interests was 10 6 13 the irr is not considered meaningful nm as the period from the initial capital contribution through march 31 2019 was less than 36 months 14 a portion of this fund pays management fees based on drawn rather than committed capital 15 due to differences in the allocation of income and expenses to this fund s two primary limited partners the u s treasury

and 18 6 respectively 16 the fund follows the american style distribution waterfall whereby the general partner may receive an incentive allocation as soon as it has returned the drawn capital and paid a preferred return on the fund s realized investments i e on a deal by deal basis however such cash distributions of incentives may be subject to repayment or clawback as of march 31 2019 oaktree had not recognized any incentive income from this fund the accrued incentives fund level for this fund represents oaktree s effective 8 of the potential incentives generated by this fund in accordance

chief financial officer thanks bette jo good morning everyone and thanks for joining aep s first quarter 2019 earnings call we all wish nick a speedy recovery and a quick return the company is off to an excellent start for 2019 we are pleased to report solid earnings of 1 16 per share on a gaap basis and 1 19 per share operating which compares to 0 92 a share gaap and 0 96 per share operating for the first quarter of 2018 positive drivers were fully realized outcomes from the multitude of rate cases from 2017 to 2019 increased transmission margins from invested capital and lower o m mostly timing in this case the company continues to excel and our employees continue to deliver on the execution of our strategy of being the premium regulated utility overall this was a great quarter for the company there are a few topics we d like to cover before moving on to coverage of our financial performance first regarding the oklahoma rate case outcome this was an important case while we didn t get everything we hoped to achieve we were successful in gaining our most important objectives an improved roe opportunity riders for transmission and some distribution investments and most of all a much improved regulatory environment the outcome of the case bodes well for our continued focus on renewables and hopefully natural gas at some point in the state i will discuss the regulated wind rfp initiative later we certainly appreciate the constructive focus of the oklahoma corporation commission the staff and parties on this case advertisement advertisement our acquisition of the sempra renewables portfolio is now finalized and we are moving forward with our renewables buildout according to plan we have extended employment offers which have been accepted by many of the members of the previous sempra team and we welcome them to the aep family we are excited about the acquisition of the existing operational projects the additional development projects and the safe harbor equipment that can provide additional value in addition to that effort we have significant opportunities for renewables in our regulated businesses pso and swepco issued an rfp for up to 2 200 megawatts of wind generation we have completed the bid process and received many quality responses we are in the process of negotiating terms with the preferred bidders and plan to file with the state commissions in july requesting approvals to proceed this should allow time for approvals in 2020 and for commercial operations of the projects by the end of 2021 as a reminder these projects are consistent with our integrated resource plans and they are currently not included in our capital and funding plans now to the ohio clean air fund legislation the company is supportive of the ohio house leadership s focus and efforts on addressing key energy policy issues that have plagued the state for years in order for the legislation to benefit all ohio customers there are certain issues that must be addressed first an elimination of the renewable portfolio standard should be replaced with the opportunity for utilities to voluntarily develop economic renewable resources in the state in addition contracts entered into under the existing renewable portfolio standard must be grandfathered so as to not punish utilities who are compliant with ohio law second in regards to energy efficiency aep is concerned about a rapid elimination of ee programs that have benefited our customers for many years in lieu of immediate elimination of ee programs previously approved plans should be phased out over the next several years we look forward to working with lawmakers during the process to achieve a balanced energy bill that provides benefits to all ohio customers advertisement advertisement turning to the equalizer chart on slide 5 aep s overall regulated operations roe is currently 10 1 versus 9 7 last quarter placing us at the upper end of our targeted range the improvement in the first quarter of 2019 versus the fourth quarter of 2018 is due to rate case outcomes in several of our jurisdictions as well as the timing effects of lower o m and taxes now let s take a look at the individual companies the seat adjusted roe for aep ohio at the end of the first quarter was 13 2 versus 13 1 in the fourth quarter of 2018 this year we will only be showing the seat adjusted roe since the legacy items are rolling off throughout the year we expect to end 2019 in the 13 range appalachian power s roe at the end of the first quarter was 9 5 comparable to last quarter apco received an order from west virginia at the end of february approving their settlement which includes a 44 million rate based increase with a 9 75 roe effective march 6th of this year the roe for kentucky power at the end of the first quarter was 8 6 compared to 9 at the end of 2018 the slight decline was primarily due to lower sales and usage driven by weather and an unfavorable tax adjustment i m s performance remained strong at 12 8 versus 11 4 at the end of 2018 i m s positive performance was driven by the favorable rate reviews that occurred mid 2018 as well as continued discipline managing o m expenses the roe for pso improved to 8 versus 6 9 at the end of 2018 this primarily reflects the implementation of the 2017 base rate case better weather and the absence of wind catcher expenses pso received an order on its base case settlement in march 2019 approving a 46 million increase and a 9 4 roe rates went into effect in april of this year importantly the order contained a provision for full transmission tracker and a partial distribution tracker pso is expected to approach its authorized roe by the end of this year advertisement advertisement the roe for swepco stands at 7 2 versus 6 5 at the end of 2018 this improvement is due to incremental reg relief and lower o m expenses also reflecting the absence of wind catcher expenses we filed an arkansas based rate case in february seeking a 46 million rate increase based on a requested 10 5 roe swepco s roe continues to be affected by the arkansas share of the turk plant that is not in rates this impacts roe by 135 basis points the roe for aep texas at the end of the first quarter was 7 6 versus 8 5 at the end of 2018 the expected decline in roe is due to lag associated with the timing of annual filings and our base rate review that we plan to file with the puct on may 1st of this year continued high level of investments and timing of our plan comprehensive rate review will continue to impact the roe in this year the roe for aep transmission holdco at the end of the first quarter was 9 9 comparable to last quarter the under recovery of expenses that occurred in 2018 will be trued up this june aep transmission holdco is projected to achieve an roe of approximately 10 by year end we are off to a great start in 2019 so let s go through the financial results for the quarter provide some insight on the economy and finish with a review of our balance sheet and liquidity looking at slide 6 which shows that operating earnings for the first quarter were 1 19 per share or 585 million compared to 0 96 per share or 473 million in 2018 looking at the earnings drivers by segment operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were 0 63 per share up 0 16 favorable drivers included higher rate changes due to recovery of incremental investment afudc and transmission revue as well as lower o m income taxes were also a driver for the quarter but will not be for the year due to timing partially offsetting these favorable items were lower normalized load unfavorable weather compared to last year and increased depreciation expense the transmission and distribution utilities segment earned 0 32 per share up 0 07 from last year primarily driven by the reversal of a regulatory provision in ohio other favorable drivers included higher transmission revenue and rate changes partially offsetting these favorable items were higher depreciation o m and unfavorable weather advertisement advertisement the aep transmission holdco segment continued to grow contributing 0 25 per share an improvement of 0 04 over last year this growth reflected the return on incremental rate base net plant increased by 1 4 billion or 19 since march of last year generation and marketing produced earnings of 0 09 per share up 0 01 from last year increases in retail and wholesale margins were offset by lower generation sales due to planned retirements and outages finally corporate and other was down 0 05 from last year primarily driven by unfavorable income tax adjustment and other consolidating tax items that will reverse by year end other variants related to higher interest expense and lower o m overall we experienced a solid quarter and are confident in reaffirming our annual operating earnings guidance now let s turn to slide 7 before we dig into the detail for the quarter let me highlight some minor changes to the slide you may have noticed that our growth estimates for the 2019 forecast of commercial and industrial sales have changed from what we presented in the last earnings release while total and residential sales remain unchanged this is due to a reclassification between the commercial and industrial classes there were no customer tariff or revenue impacts just geography and presentations between the two classes for ease of use we have adjusted the prior quarters to reflect the new classifications now let s look at the quarterly detail starting in the lower right chart normalized retail sales decreased by 0 3 for the quarter compared to 2018 it is worth mentioning that retail sales were down in all of the vertically integrated utilities while each of the t d utilities experienced modest growth in the quarter moving clockwise industrial sales decreased by 0 4 for the quarter sales in the industrial class have been slowing in recent quarters as the impact of a strong dollar and a more restrictive trade policy have challenged export manufacturers within aep s footprint advertisement advertisement during last year s first quarter earnings call we reported widespread growth across all operating companies in every one of the top 10 industrial sectors now a year later industrial sales grew only in our western operating companies and ohio and in only six of the top 10 industrial sectors the majority of this came from the oil and gas sectors i ll provide more color on our industrial sales on the next slide in the upper left chart normalized residential sales increased by 0 9 compared to the first quarter of 2018 the growth in residential sales was partially due to customer account growth which increased by 0 5 while the rest came from growth in normalized usage incomes grew faster than inflation for the quarter which provided our customers with more disposable income i ll provide more detail on the economy later in the presentation finally in the upper right chart commercial sales decreased by 1 7 commercial sales were down across all operating companies the tightening labor market and rising interest rates have limited this sector s growth in recent quarters turning to slide 8 i want to provide a little more color with respect to our industrial sales the chart shows the disparity in sales between the oil and gas sectors and all other industrial sectors the oil and gas sector load shown in blue mirrors the pattern in oil prices over time as expected for the quarter industrial sales in the oil and gas sectors increased by 5 1 while the rest of our industrial sales shown in red declined by 2 2 we expect the growth in oil and gas to continue through 2019 as prices recover in addition our economic development team has identified a number of new oil and gas projects that are expected to come online throughout the year now focusing on the red bars you see the non oil and gas industrials experienced robust growth in 2018 until the trade policy changes were announced at the end of the first quarter since then a noticeable deceleration has occurred most of this slowdown can be traced back to export industries such as chemical manufacturing which is down 9 for the quarter as discussed on previous calls aep has a higher exposure to trade policy given the higher concentration of export manufacturers located within the service territory advertisement advertisement now let s turn to slide 9 and review the status of our regional economies as shown in the upper left chart gdp growth in aep service territory was 2 9 for the quarter which is 0 1 above the u s outside of kentucky gdp growth for every operating company was within 0 2 of the u s for the quarter the upper right chart shows that the gap in employment growth between aep service territory and the u s did not change in the first quarter job growth in aep s territory was still 1 3 with higher growth coming from the west for most of the oil and gas activities located in fact job growth in the natural resources and mining sector posted the strongest growth in the quarter at 4 3 other sectors that experienced robust job growth for the quarter include construction professional and business services education and health services and leisure and hospitality the final chart at the bottom shows that income growth within aep s footprint improved in the first quarter while u s income growth moderated for the quarter personal incomes within aep s service territory increased by 3 7 which was 0 5 below the u s as described earlier income growth is a key driver for residential and commercial sales now let s move on to slide 10 and review the company s capitalization and liquidity our debt to total capital ratio increased 0 8 during the quarter to 57 8 our ffo to debt ratio finished the quarter at 18 1 we expect this ratio to decline over the year as we flow back adit to customers but expect the number to remain in the baa1 range our net liquidity stood at about 3 1 billion supported by our revolving credit facility our qualified pension funding decreased to 98 and our opeb funding moderately increased to 131 a drop in yields increased the liabilities for both plans but strong equity returns helped offset the liability increases in march aep issued 805 million of mandatory convertible equity units this issuance combines a three year junior subordinated debt instrument with a three year forward purchase contract for equity this issuance de risks our financing plan by providing required capital now and equity later when needed and not sooner it delays equity needs above our drip program until 2022 the issuance maintains our balance sheet strength enhances our credit metrics and allows us to invest growth capital for the benefit of our customers and for the recently closed renewables transaction advertisement advertisement let s try and wrap this up on slide 11 so we can get to your questions we will move forward with opportunities in the renewables space and continue to optimize our o m spend our performance in the first quarter and the stability of our regulated business model gives us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of 4 00 4 20 per share with that i will turn the call over to the operator for your questions questions and answers operator okay ladies and gentlemen if you do wish to ask a question please press 1 at this time you will hear a tone indicating you ve been placed in queue you can remove yourself at any time by pressing once again it s 1 our first question will come from the line of praful mehta with citigroup please go ahead praful mehta citigroup analyst thanks so much hi guys brian x tierney chief financial officer good morning praful praful mehta citigroup analyst morning so maybe just the details on the mandatory convert in 22 what are the terms in terms of what price at which you expect the forward to convert into equity brian x tierney chief financial officer it was priced at 82 98 and the company gets the benefit of the first 20 of upside so to almost 100 00 per share and we re locked in on the downside from that price praful mehta citigroup analyst got it thank you and then on the renewable side i wanted to understand a couple of things is there any exposure that the current renewable business has to california in terms of pg e or edison in terms of any bp exposure as counterparties and also i want to understand when you say move forward with renewable opportunities in the future are you looking at incremental investments even in 2019 beyond the sempra acquisition brian x tierney chief financial officer a couple things there praful we don t have any direct credit exposure to the california utilities on those most of those are direct third party consumers of that electricity so we don t have that exposure that others do in regards to the investment in the renewables portfolio we had talked about a five year spend of about 2 2 billion with certain projects including the renewables portfolio from sempra we ve spent about 1 5 billion of that commitment so we have roughly 700 million left and we re looking at opportunities as they become available we feel that the sempra transaction was at a very good value to the company considering both the existing projects and the developmental projects and we were able to by making that acquisition early in the five year period we were able to solidify and de risk that 2 2 billion forecast of spend so we re on our way to meeting the 2 2 billion commitment and we re evaluating these development projects with the portfolio and looking at other opportunities as well praful mehta citigroup analyst got it but you don t expect to go above the 2 2 billion it will stay within that budget brian x tierney chief financial officer that s our anticipation at this point praful mehta citigroup analyst very helpful thank you guys brian x tierney chief financial officer thanks praful operator the next question comes from the line of julien dumoulin with bank of america please go ahead julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning everyone brian x tierney chief financial officer good morning julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst so to pick up where praful left off in terms of the incremental and the 2 2 billion versus the 1 5 billion commitment already i understand that you have some inventoried assets that you acquired as part of that sempra transaction i d be curious how do you think about leveraging that for further investments on the repowering side when would you need to provide some updates obviously just given the limited window remaining here from a safe harbor perspective and then separately if you can clarify obviously the 2 2 billion is over a five year period it would appear that at least from a timing perspective you re ahead of what you d introduced from a ratable improvement in the eei slides last november i would think brian x tierney chief financial officer julien i m going to ask chuck zebula who runs that business and who you know to address those questions charles e zebula executive vice president energy supply good morning julien so yes there are opportunities that we re pursuing as you know we just closed on the transaction on monday we re actively working with our new team members on the status of the development projects even as we have taken over this week there s some positive news coming out of a township vote in michigan on one of our projects so there s still additional due diligence we realize that the time is ticking to reach 2020 we may reach the light of day on one or two of these by 2020 but i can t commit to that at this point in time they can turn into 21 projects with some structuring and items we would need to do with other parties but nonetheless there are opportunities here and they re relatively small bites as opposed to significant large projects and that s why we think a lot of these could get done within the 700 million that brian had talked about julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and then in terms of timing charles e zebula executive vice president energy supply in terms of timing i think absolutely we ll be updating quarterly where we are on some of this stuff it s full push forward but yeah as we ve pulled the transaction and the spend earlier you ll see the earnings from those contributions here in 19 and beyond julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and just to clarify this point obviously you ve got a number of rfps out there on the wind catcher 2 0 structure that s separate and distinct from any inventoried assets that you might have for repowering assets to beat the 2 2 billion bucket right brian x tierney chief financial officer that s correct julien completely different efforts julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst excellent all right i ll leave it there thank you operator next question comes from the line of ali agha with suntrust please go ahead ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey managing director thank you good morning brian x tierney chief financial officer good morning ali ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey managing director good morning brian in the past you folks have talked about confidence level of trending to the higher end of the upper half of the 5 7 range of earnings growth that you ve targeted are we still looking at it from that perspective and also to clarify that was based on the existing budget that was not assuming new incremental capex the existing budget could trend you in the upper half of the 5 7 is that still correct brian x tierney chief financial officer that s right ali and i think the way nick has phrased it before is this management team will be very disappointed if we re not in the upper end of that range ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey managing director upper end of the range got it okay and then separately these rfps and other opportunities particularly in renewables that you re working on can you give us some sense of size if these do come through and then you ve pointed out these would be incremental to the base plan what kind of cumulative size are we looking at in terms of that opportunity brian x tierney chief financial officer the regulated rfps that we ve issued in the market are for up to 2 200 megawatts and the reason that that s the number is that s consistent with what our irps in those jurisdictions would call for renewables so a significant amount not dissimilar to what we were talking about in terms of generation with wind catcher ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey managing director and that would be owned by aep all of that if that comes through brian x tierney chief financial officer yes ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey managing director okay and the timing around that again brian x tierney chief financial officer we re shooting for the end of 2021 ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey managing director got it and last brian x tierney chief financial officer ali to your point those plans are not in our capital and funding plans today but we ll adjust those plans as we go forward and we firm up how much it is we re talking about and confirm that the timing is at the end of 2021 ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey managing director got it final question brian on the transmission front you ve laid out a very strong growth outlook through 2021 very specifically as you look out beyond that at least through 23 since your capex budget goes out that many years are you looking at a similar kind of growth over the 22 23 period or does it taper off how are you looking at that transmission growth brian x tierney chief financial officer no we see our ability to continue to grow investment in that space for the foreseeable future one of the things when you have the largest transmission system in the country you have the largest aging transmission system in the country so there s significant opportunity for us to continue to invest in our own assets and then there s also significant development that we need to do on cyber security and other efforts where we re just beginning to see the front end of that significant increase in spend ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey managing director thank you brian x tierney chief financial officer thanks ali operator our next question comes from the line of christopher turner with jp morgan please go ahead christopher turner jp morgan executive director good morning brian i have another question on renewables here just broadly speaking i think you talked about the value of the development portfolio within the sempra purchase but if you step back and think about the decision to buy that versus build it and the decision to go in more of a wind versus a solar direction here what informed those decisions and how do you think about your strategic edge in owning these assets versus others brian x tierney chief financial officer christopher chuck and his team have been very selective in the assets that they ve looked at and they re looking for high quality contracted assets with credit worthy counterparties so they ve been looking at on a project by project basis until this opportunity came along what this opportunity brought with it was a lot of wind some battery contracted with high quality counterparties but it also brought a team with it and that team is something that we didn t organically have from a development standpoint so we got not just a team but also development projects in the pipeline that we wouldn t have had otherwise so whether they re repowering or the new project that chuck talked about with the municipal it takes our business to the next level and not to say we re going to be the next nextera because i don t think that s our aspiration but it firms up and de risks our ability to put that 2 2 billion to work like we talked about so i think with chuck s existing commercial team their conservative approach to making sure that we get high quality assets combined with the new development team that we get from sempra i think we have a pretty strong organization to go forward and execute against the strategic plans that we ve laid out christopher turner jp morgan executive director is it fair to think about the returns that you re going to get there long term as being pretty competitive with what you re earning at the t d businesses and the generation businesses today on the utilities side brian x tierney chief financial officer very much so christopher turner jp morgan executive director okay and then my second question is a follow up to an earlier one on the long term eps guidance i wanted to make sure i was properly understanding everything here you have a situation where you d be disappointed if you weren t at the high end of the 5 7 range and just year to date you ve pulled forward that capex with the sempra deal you ve had a constructive settlement in oklahoma that s going to allow you to earn a more fair return there and you still have the potential for the rfp on the utility side with the renewables is there any timing shift within that 5 7 range that s occurred here or is it kind of still back end weighted for the high end of that range brian x tierney chief financial officer as we talk about this year we believe we re on track to be inside that 4 00 4 20 range which puts us in the mid part of that range i think as we execute against some of these things it s going to take time for them to cumulatively push us to the higher end of that range so i d say no change on this year and as we look forward to future years as we execute both regulated and some of these competitive opportunities i think that s when we ll be expecting to be in the upper end of that range christopher turner jp morgan executive director that s fair thanks brian brian x tierney chief financial officer thanks christopher operator next question comes from the line of paul patterson with glenrock please go ahead paul patterson glenrock associates analyst good morning brian x tierney chief financial officer good morning paul paul patterson glenrock associates analyst on the significant excess the seat reversal i apologize what triggered that it looks like it s a 2016 item that reversed brian x tierney chief financial officer so paul it was a number of things 2016 was the year that we had the global settlement in ohio and there was some risk as to whether or not issues that were included in the global settlement would be included in the calculation of seat for that year we believe they should have been excluded and that s the basis on which we filed our 2016 seat we had a unanimous settlement saying that there was no significantly excess earnings in 2016 and did not get an order on that until this year so when we looked at that we had significant risk around that we re uncomfortable at that point given the risk that existed in taking that to income made the reserve at the time and now with the positive order on the settlement are able to reverse that paul patterson glenrock associates analyst wow they took that long for a settlement for an order excuse me that s nonrecurring right brian x tierney chief financial officer i want to be clear about that it s included in gaap earnings and we ve included it in ongoing earnings but it s an item that will not repeat next year paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and then with respect to the ohio legislation previously you guys had concerns about aep utility ratepayers paying for other companies nuclear plants how do you guys feel about hb 6 as it currently stands i know you raised a couple of the issues in your prepared remarks this morning can you give a little more color on that brian x tierney chief financial officer so we think if there s a full package where all of ohio customers can benefit then it s a worthy effort if it s just a bailout for one company or another it s not as beneficial to all ohio customers so there needs to be a full package of things that get addressed and energy efficiency the renewable portfolio standard ability of utilities to invest in renewables going forward are all important things that need to be in the bill and if they re not it s not as beneficial for ratepayers in the state paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and with respect to the energy efficiency if those changes did take place do you think it would have a meaningful impact on your retail sales growth brian x tierney chief financial officer we do not paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay thanks so much brian x tierney chief financial officer thanks paul operator next we go to the line of michael lapides with goldman sachs please go ahead michael lapides goldman sachs analyst hey guys brian thanks for taking the question just curious can you remind us what the sensitivity to changes in weather normalized demand are in terms of meeting not just current year guidance but your multiyear growth rate i ask and i know it s only one quarter but some of the demand metrics on the commercial side seem pretty weak and that s obviously you get a lot of demand from industrial but it tends to be lower margin but commercial and residential tends to be higher margin brian x tierney chief financial officer we re trying to look up what the sensitivities are right now we think that we re on track to get where we need to be for the year even though we re slightly off for the first quarter again we make more from places where we sell integrated utility product than just the t d side but for changes half a percent change in residential is half a penny for t d utilities for vertically integrated utilities it s 1 4 commercial again is about half that half a percent change for vertically integrated utilities is 7 10 of a penny for t d utilities it s 1 10 of a penny and for industrial sales 0 5 change is the same as it is for commercial 7 10 of a penny for vertically integrated and 1 10 of a penny for t d utilities michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you and one other question just trying to think about texas what s driving the under earning in texas texas is a state where you ve got both transmission and distribution cost recovery riders so just curious what s the biggest driver of the regulatory lag you re experiencing now brian x tierney chief financial officer there s a couple things going on there michael one is the fact that we are investing so much in the state that even with those very timely recoveries we just can t keep up with the amount of capital that we re putting to work in the state the second thing is as we go in for the base rate case this year we need to suspend those short term trackers for the near term until we get everything caught up in the base rate case and then we can put those trackers back in the space so that is going to cause a little bit of lag this year and next year as well michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you brian much appreciated brian x tierney chief financial officer thanks michael operator and next we go to the line of andrew weisel please go ahead andrew weisel scotia howard weil director hey good morning everybody congratulations on the pso outcome my question there is does this change your capex plan at all with the transmission tracker would you consider increasing capex at pso and would that drive an increase to the overall spending or would it be shifted away from other subsidiaries i see the pie chart is unchanged but just wondering how to think about that brian x tierney chief financial officer so what this means for us is that oklahoma is open for business again so we had previously when we were under that prolonged period of under earning at pso we had shifted capital to more welcoming jurisdictions that allowed us to have higher roes and that had trackers now that we have appropriate trackers in public service of oklahoma we re going to shift capital that had been shifted away from oklahoma back into the state and have that benefit the ratepayers and customers in that state so it s not so much a huge increase although it is but we re shifting dollars back in that have been shifted out and that s positive for pso andrew weisel scotia howard weil director makes a lot of sense then my other question is on ohio wind my understanding is you re able to own up to 450 megawatts out of the 500 planned my question is for the portion signed through ppa would you expect a debt equivalency cost mechanism i know you have that for solar but it s small how do you think about that for wind ppas brian x tierney chief financial officer yes we would expect a debt equivalency on those as well if our utilities balance sheets are being consumed to support ppas we need to be compensated for that and the rating agencies ding us for those and we need to make sure that we re filling in that gap that we re getting dinged for by entering into those ppas so we think debt equivalency is appropriate on all renewable ppas that we don t own andrew weisel scotia howard weil director okay and i know there s not a lot of precedent obviously michigan just settled upon that you used the word need twice in your answer there is that a nice to have or a must have brian x tierney chief financial officer how can i say this it s appropriate to have them and it s inappropriate not to have them andrew weisel scotia howard weil director fair enough thank you very much brian x tierney chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from angie storozynski with macquarie please go ahead angie storozynski macquarie capital partners analyst thank you so i wanted to go back to 2019 guidance so the sempra acquisition came earlier than expected and you mentioned that it would be earnings accretive this year the oklahoma rate case settlement was better than expected so what s the negative offset that you re still in the middle of the range brian x tierney chief financial officer so there s a couple things going on in addition to the sempra acquisition there are also some financing costs associated with that and so we do expect gen and marketing to be ahead a couple pennies we expect corporate and other to be a drag as we finance that and our aep transmission holdco while improving is not going to be as strong as what we thought it was going to be when we provided guidance due to some tracking items on o m and due to our inability to get everything into capital base that we thought we would by the end of last year so like any year there are things that are positive there are things that are negative as we work through the year and we still anticipate being in the midpoint of the guidance range angie storozynski macquarie capital partners analyst okay and for the swepco piece of renewables can we assume that all of these assets would be rate based brian x tierney chief financial officer yes that s what the rfp asked for build operate transfer to pso and swepco projects and that s largely how people responded and we would anticipate owning them and that s how we ll file with the commissions in july angie storozynski macquarie capital partners analyst okay thank you brian x tierney chief financial officer thank you angie operator and as a reminder if you do wish to ask a question please press 1 our next question comes from the line of mike lonegan with evercore please go ahead greg gordon evercore isi managing director hi it s greg gordon how are you doing brian x tierney chief financial officer hey greg greg gordon evercore isi managing director just to follow up on paul patterson s question on the reversal of the seat test issue when you initially booked that in the first instance was that also considered an operating item so this is sort of equal opportunity it was a drag in that year and now that you reversed it it s a help but in all cases you re consistently applying that methodology brian x tierney chief financial officer absolutely greg it was gaap and operating in both periods greg gordon evercore isi managing director okay thank you i just wanted to clarify that the second thing just as a follow up to angie s question i just want to make sure that i m not getting the implication wrong when you said that you re going to be ahead in the renewables business but then you have the financing costs associated with financing sempra is the implication that the sempra transaction is not really accretive on an earnings basis in 19 and if not what s the math there and how does that trend over time brian x tierney chief financial officer no greg it will be accretive in 19 it will be accretive going forward remember the financing was larger than what was needed just for that one project but it s an accretive project in the current period and in forward periods inclusive of financing costs greg gordon evercore isi managing director ah i understand but then part of that equity was allocated to just general corporate needs and we have to think about it that way brian x tierney chief financial officer that s correct greg gordon evercore isi managing director okay thank you brian x tierney chief financial officer thank you greg operator and we have no further questions in queue at this time bette jo rozsa managing director

with comments on our outlook for 2019 and after our prepared remarks we ll be happy to respond to your questions in the first quarter moody s analytics mid teens revenue growth offset issuance headwinds resulting in a 1 revenue increase for moody s corporation as expected moody s adjusted operating margin contracted to 45 4 as the expense reductions from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018 will not meaningfully affect the p l until the second half of 2019 adjusted diluted eps nonetheless grew by 2 year over year driven by a lower effective tax rate and a 1 reduction in share count from the accelerated share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2019 lower interest rates and tighter fixed income spreads led to improved issuance activity following the disruption in the fourth quarter of 2018 however issuance was lower than first quarter 2018 has 2018 levels as a result of uncertain business outlook the inversion of the us treasury yield curve and reduced global growth forecast caused concern about economic weakness and contributed to more accommodative monetary and fiscal policies geopolitical concerns around us china trade negotiations and brexit uncertainty continuing to weigh on the market these factors led to a mixed issuance environment in the first quarter as i mentioned while issuance improved significantly from the fourth quarter of 2018 year over year issuance was down 14 mis revenue was down only 7 demonstrating the continued strength of the business model mis s recurring revenue base supported by increased monitoring fees from recent new mandates as well as pricing provided a partial counterbalance to the decline in issuance similar to my comment on corporate expenses we expect to start realizing mis expense reductions from our restructuring program as we move further into 2019 for the first quarter the revenue contraction led to a decline in mis s adjusted operating margin to 54 9 however focusing longer term on the trailing 12 month basis mis margins were up 50 basis points to 57 5 i d like to spend another minute on investment grade and high yield bond issuance as well as bank loan issuance in the first quarter as these were significant drivers of year over year performance due to the flattening of the yield curve in the first quarter market preferences shifted from floating to fixed rate instruments where lower financing costs increased investment grade and high yield bond issuance by 19 and 1 respectively on the other hand higher financing costs reduced bank loan issuance by 33 year over year while loan issuance for m a activity remained relatively intact refinancing activity was largely muted versus the prior year period for ma each business delivered double digit revenue growth which contributed to 16 total ma revenue growth and a 350 basis point improvement in the adjusted operating margin organic ma revenue was up 13 from the prior year period rd a revenue grew 15 due to strong sales growth at bureau van dijk in the second half of 2018 contribution from the reis acquisition as well as strengthened core research and data products on an organic basis rd a also delivered double digit revenue growth of 12 in ers strong fourth quarter 2018 and first quarter 2019 subscription sales drove a 19 revenue increase and we continue to execute on the transition to as we continue to execute on the transition to a software as a service or saas operating model we re encouraged by this growth however we are not expecting increases of similar magnitude in every quarter professional services revenue growth of 13 was driven by the contribution from omega performance as well as strong new sales in the max business organic professional services revenue was up 6 i would like to highlight the strong performance of ers in the first quarter the increase in the ers revenue base which has grown by over 100 million since 2015 has been a large driver of ma revenue recurring revenue as a share of total ers business continued to tick up in the first quarter and reached 78 on a trailing 12 month basis indicating that this trend will continue trailing 12 month subscription sales have increased 12 while sales of the one time products we have been de emphasizing increased 2 the deliberate shift we have made on the on the expansion of our subscription business will support scalability and drive ma operating leverage and margin moreover we are meeting our customers demands by moving to a saas based model due to its ease of use and lower cost of ownership this next generation of products will enhance the customer experience improve adoption rates and shorten our sales cycles ers s resumed revenue growth is a key component of ongoing adjusted operating margin improvement in ma for 2019 i d like to take a moment to highlight the recent acquisitions that are contributing to our strategic priority of pursuing growth opportunities in adjacent product areas in october 2018 we successfully completed the acquisition of reis a leading provider of us commercial real estate or cre data since then ma introduced the reis network a platform of connected applications providing market participants access to cre solutions for property research investment and risk management we also launched commercial location score an advanced quantitative solution for evaluating cre using data from reis allowing cre investors lenders and developers to evaluate the suitability of over 7 million commercially zoned parcels in the united states also in october we announced an investment in team8 partners a leading think tank and company creation platform specializing in cyber security and data resilience building on prior investments and initiatives in cyber security and emerging technologies and last week we announced that moody s had acquired a majority stake in vigeo eiris to support our esg initiatives vigeo eiris is a leading global provider of esg research data and assessments and is a foundational asset for our broader efforts in this space adding to the growing body of esg analysis and research already produced within mis vigeo eiris brings moody s an extensive database a long established presence in the esg space and a wide product offering which will help moody s and its goal to become a global standard setter in esg vigeo eiris will be an affiliate of mis and continue to operate from its headquarters in paris this investment is consistent with moody s strategy of serving the evolving needs of financial market participants beyond the credit risk this transaction is not expected to materially impact moody s 2019 financial results or our capital allocation plans but it s meaningful to our strategic objectives building on moody s increasing efforts in the esg space on that note moody s will soon release its annual corporate social responsibility report which aligns with the global reporting initiative or gri standards core option you will be able to access this report at moodys com csr underpinning our strategic priorities we are continuing to enhance our technology infrastructure to enable automation innovation and efficiency moody s is enhancing its data and analytical capabilities by utilizing alternative and unstructured data sources to supplement financial and cre analysis natural language processing and ai are improving the decision making capabilities of our analysts and our customers through credit monitoring tools customized training and loan

as generate thousands of research reports on small municipal issuers finally we are utilizing the cloud across the business to cater to customer requirement in an efficient and low cost manner we will continue to enhance our processes and product offerings to meet our needs and those of our customers by embracing technological innovation i ll now turn the call over to mark to review our outlook for 2019 mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you ray moody s outlook for 2019 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors including but not limited to interest and foreign currency exchange rates corporate profitability and business investment spending mergers and acquisitions and the level of debt capital markets activity these assumptions are subject to uncertainty and the results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates specifically our forecast for the remainder of 2019 reflected reflects exchange rates for the british pound of 1 30 and for the euro 1 12 we are affirming the full year 2019 guidance metrics we laid out on the february earnings call we still expect revenue and operating expenses to each increase in the mid single digit percent range operating expense guidance includes depreciation and amortization acquisition related expense and restructuring charges of note we are not expecting a significant ramp in expenses from the first to the fourth quarter of 2019 as we start to realize savings from the restructuring program the 2019 operating margin and adjusted operating margin are still anticipated to be approximately 43 and 48 respectively we continue to expect net interest expense in the range of 200 million to 225 million and a full year effective tax rate in the range of 21 to 22 notwithstanding the low actual rate in the first quarter of the year diluted and adjusted diluted eps are still expected to be 7 30 to 7 55 and 7 85 to 8 10 respectively for a full list of our guidance please refer to table 12 in our earnings release for mis we continue to anticipate total full year revenue increase in the low single digit percent range with growth weighted more toward the second half of the year as the year over year comparable becomes easier we are now expecting higher contribution from us corporate bond but lower contribution from loans and to a lesser extent from clos and us public finance issuance we continue to believe that issuance will be flat to down 5 in comparison to 2018 we also expect approximately 900 first time mandates in 2019 the mis adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 58 in 2019 for ma we still anticipate total revenue to increase in the low double digit percent range as we recognized the strong sales growth at bureau van dijk and benefit from the stability of recurring revenue from the core rd a business and ers transition to a saas based model the ma adjusted operating margin is still expected to expand 250 basis points to 350 basis points the 29 to 30 range in 2019 i d like to spend a moment discussing our approach to capital management we remain committed to long term leverage anchored around bbb plus rating which we believe appropriately balances our cost of capital with financing flexibility our debt maturities are well distributed with no significant debt coming due until september 2020 as i ve noted previously we have a robust and disciplined approach to capital allocation as the first priority we invest or reinvest in activities that support our strategic priorities following that we look to return excess capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases before turning to q a i would like to note a few key takeaways we remain confident in moody s ability to deliver revenue growth and margin stability in 2019 we will continue to defend and enhance our core ratings and research businesses at the same time we will keep pursuing strategic growth opportunities both down the corporate credit permit and across into new geographies and adjacent product areas remaining grounded in technology enabled products services and capabilities finally we will maintain our disciplined and thoughtful approach to capital management and the return of free cash flow raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer thank you mark this concludes our prepared remarks and joining mark and me for the question and answer session are mark almeida president of moody s analytics and rob fauber president of moody s investors service we ll be pleased to take any questions you may have questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions we will take our first question from manav patnaik with barclays manav patnaik barclays analyst thank you good morning guys my first question is just around that credit permit and business adjacency slide that you had commercial real estate and esg those make sense can you just help me understand the cyber risk aspect of it and then maybe just briefly what are the areas would you consider as business adjacencies raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer sure manav we re really looking at areas of financial markets where we think that they are under served in the form of standards that help to understand measure and manage risk so certainly the interest in certain areas of esg and cyber security are things that have drawn increasing attention from investors from regulatory authorities and as a result our important increasingly important for the issuer community and the mis side and for a variety of institutions that moody s analytics serves and we believe that as adjacencies to credit risk areas of esg and cyber security are going to be folded into the overall financial analysis and investing that is done on a going forward basis so really what we re looking at is trying to align our products and services with what investors and customers are increasingly focusing themselves on and where we believe standards can can be implemented that is going to create more efficiency in markets and among customer transactions that s that s really the thesis here manav patnaik barclays analyst okay got it and then if i could just follow up on the capital allocation so with leverage already at i guess 2 times and i think you said in the slide that you expect leverage to keep declining so does that mean the focus is still on deleveraging versus buybacks or maybe there are some m a in the thoughts there as well mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer sure manav and thanks for the question leverage ticked up a little bit in the first quarter really due to the lower first quarter adjusted operating income and some of our commercial paper borrowing and we do expect leverage to decline over the remainder of the year of course this is subject to market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decision our approach to capital allocation remains consistent with that we followed historically primarily looking firstly for investing in growth opportunities either through reinvestment in the business or through acquisitions and then to the extent those opportunities are not available and certainly to return capital either through dividends or through share repurchases manav patnaik barclays analyst all right thank you guys operator we ll now hear from toni kaplan with morgan stanley toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst hi good afternoon when you look at the first quarter outside of the lower tax rate i guess were results in line with your expectations and where i m coming from is i think top line you had sort of the weak structured results but that was offset by strong ers but margins were a little bit lighter ph than what i was thinking and i know mis was pressured by the revenue decline and it s just ma didn t really offset that so i guess it s given that you re not expecting the tax benefit to sustain through the year did you contemplate lowering guidance or did your expectations for the rest of the year get better raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer i think i think the fairest answer toni is that our expectations have remained largely the same so within the the fact that we affirmed guidance really across the board for both mis and ma and then and then moody s corp as a whole indicates that the first quarter was not a surprise to us and it is is pretty much in line with with where we expected to be overall obviously the strength in moody s analytics was very welcome but we had expected some challenge with mis given the very strong first quarter that we saw in 2018 we did expect it to be off from that level toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst okay and based on that i guess it sounds like you re sort of expecting that mis was going to be roughly around where it came in i guess are you more or less confident maybe in the mis revenue guide of up of for the year and was structured worse than you expected in the quarter how do you think structured sort of plays out from here i know you mentioned the different mix of versus what you were maybe originally expecting but maybe rob you could give us a little bit of commentary on sort of the environment now thank you robert fauber president moody s investors service yeah this is rob so we can we can expand on that but i would say supporting the guidance we re still holding to our overall outlook for issuance of kind of flat to down 5 and again we can talk a little bit about that touching specifically on structured the first thing i would highlight is we had the reclassification of reits ph were structured into into corporate finance the big story in structured this quarter was really around clos clo formation new clo formation held up pretty well generally in line with the prior year quarter but it was really around the refis and resets that we saw significant decline in activity and that s as we saw wider aaa liability spreads and that really weakened the deal economics for clos that said looking forward for structured finance we the pipeline i would say is generally improving and adding that this includes clos we ve seen improvement in deal activity in clos each month of the quarter from a very slow start in january we ve seen clo issuance really pickup in march it s continuing to be active into april we have an active pipeline of clos but as i said that the refi and reset activity continues to be significantly below prior year levels and then the other kind of big piece of structured finance is around cmbs and market activity was was pretty good there in the first quarter the mix was skewed heavily toward these single asset single borrower deals versus conduits that resulted in some smaller deal sizes and we re continuing to see that so we re seeing good inquires and engagement but but smaller deal sizes in cmbs toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst thank you operator alex kramm with ubs has the next question alex kramm ubs analyst yeah hey good morning everyone maybe and maybe this is for rob as well but can you just broaden your comment a little bit on your on your expectations for maybe the corporate issuance environment i think a quarter ago we asked about increasingly hearing a cfo saying they want to de lever i mean you yourself are saying you re keeping leverage pretty low so i guess what are the what are still the items that you re watching and what are you hearing from issuers how they are how they are thinking about leverage levels appetite to for capex m a etc mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer alex thank you for the question this is mark rob and i actually both going to comment on this particular question i ll first provide the perspective we re hearing externally from some of the banks and then i ll turn it over to rob who will follow up with our internal view point on the banking side in the us banks primarily noticed the dovish ph commentary to low yields and tightening spreads which they believe have supported a strong start to the year for investment grade bonds and to a lesser extent high yield bonds while the tone from banks was quite positive on the start of the year a concern does remain around potentially slowing economic growth and recession risk which is i d say briefly accentuated by the temporary inversion of the yield curve as a result the expectations are now for us benchmark rates to remain lower for longer this view on benchmarks rates is one of the factors that we believe or at least the banks believe contributed to a lowest us leverage loan issuance and a shift toward high yield bond issuance if i turn to europe and what we heard from the banks is that the investment grade market is seeing similar rate dynamics to us investment grade and you can see this in the tenure bonds where the yield recently went negative now for the first time since mid 2016 and it is obviously currently hovering around zero correspondingly the banks are seeing a sharp decline in the number of investment grade floating rate issuances year to date compared to the same period in 2018 and there is favorable relative value dynamics that continue to encourage reverse and the ph issuance and the banks estimated around 30 of supply year to date has come from us companies issuing in europe and then lastly in the high yield bond market issuance did start the year slow but saw considerable pickup in march and of course brexit remains a focus and a potential downside robert fauber president moody s investors service yeah maybe maybe to add to that mark and i don t think we ve seen a structural shift since we put together certainly our views for the year in terms of how companies are thinking about financing as i said we are continuing to hold to that 0 to down 5 the biggest risk really to the current issuance outlook is probably around bank loans mark noted in regards to the street view less opportunistic refi the flattening of the yield curve and this issuer and investor rotation out of bank loans and that s all contributing to softness that we re seeing there and i think we re going to need to see some further spread tightening to improve bank loan issuance volumes for the rest of the year so we remain cautious on the bank loan space along with the decline in bank loans softer outlook for clos again record refi activity in 2018 and that s really begun to decelerate again amid those wider spreads that i talked about i think some modest upside to our original outlook in investment grade and that s supported by opportunistic refinancing and again with rates coming in spreads coming in and m a activity as well we see continue to see very healthy m a activity underpinning the market we also see some upside to high yield and this is the flip side of the rotation from bank loans into high yield and we re keeping an eye out on us public finance again we all know that was impacted from the tax law changes around the advance refundings as a result first quarter of 2018 was a pretty modest comparable because we had pulled forward into 4q 17 so that s an area where we have been expecting higher growth relative to the other higher issuance growth relative to the other sectors and all in all i think as i think forward to the just now the next several months i think the risk from bank loans and clos is probably modestly outweighing the upsides from us investment grade and high yield alex kramm ubs analyst okay thank you for that just very quickly on ers i think you gave a lot of good detail on this we ll move to more recurring but maybe i missed this but can you just talk about the first quarter and the near term outlook here a little bit was there a bunch of one time ish stuff that happened in the first quarter was it was it a little bit more transactional and maybe flesh out why and i think about this business now as maybe growing consistently sequentially versus very seasonally as a more saas based ph but i guess my question is is the second quarter little bit of a sequential down tick maybe there because there was something big in the first quarter thank you mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer alex it s mark the answer is the short answer to your question is no the first quarter strength was really driven by very good results on the subscription side of the business so that really is what drove the 19 growth and we just said very good strength across the business all of the regions were up double digits all of the product lines were up double digits so we we did quite well across ers in the first quarter as ray said we don t expect that the first quarter result is something that we ll be able to sustain through the full year but we are expecting a strong year in ers particularly coming off of a down year last year because as we said at the end of last year we feel like we ve made the transition and we ve turned the corner from being a predominantly saas oriented or subscription based business and the runoff in the one time business is now being offset by a very good strength and continued growth on the subscription side so we we feel good about what we are i think it really validates our whole product strategy in ers i just remind everybody that the strategy behind ers is that we use the ers product to deliver moody s analytics specialized data and analytical capabilities to and we engineer platforms that address very specific customer problems for example we re working with many customers in the united states who need to adopt the cecl accounting standard that s analytically rather complex and it draws very directly on specific capabilities that we ve got in moody s analytics and so ers has engineered a platform aimed directly at that customer problem we ve got a similar situation with insurers who are having to adopt the forthcoming ifrs 17 accounting standard similar story there more broadly and we work with a lot of banks who are working hard to digitize and bring efficiency to their loan origination and credit assessment processes particularly around lending to small and medium sized enterprises our new creditlens platform is designed to enable that kind of digitization and efficiency so i think the results you re seeing are really a validation of the strategy that we re pursuing in ers alex kramm ubs analyst all right helpful thank you very much operator peter appert with piper jaffray has the next question peter appert piper jaffray analyst thank you good morning just sticking with mr almeida mark can you talk about the longer term margin targets please for the analytics business any new thoughts in terms of where you think you can go given the strength you re seeing currently and then i ll give you my follow up in advance also for mark on reis and bvd just an update in terms of what you re seeing in those business the size of the reis opportunity and whether you re continuing to see the same new sales momentum at bvd you enjoyed last year thank you mark e almeida president moody s analytics peter on the margin we feel good about the margin we feel like we continue to make very good progress there the first quarter was particularly strong but we have not set a specific target or sort of a ceiling on where we think we can go with the margin we continue to pursue expense management efforts as well as continue to drive growth in what is increasingly a subscription oriented business so that implies lots of scalability so if we can if we can drive good growth on the top line we ought to be able to continue to add to our expanding margins so i think the first quarter we had a bit of a benefit from the elimination of that deferred revenue haircut in bureau van dijk last year frankly that only accounted for about a third of the margin expansion that we re reporting so most of the margin expansion was coming from the rest of the moody s analytics business and a very significant chunk of that was from ers so we re going to continue doing what we ve been doing which i think will allow us to continue on the path of consistent but gradual improvement in the margin from quarter to quarter again the best way to look at that will be to look at it on a trailing 12 month basis because in any discrete quarter we re probably going to get some we can get some weird behavior either on the top line or on the expense line but the on a on a trailing 12 month basis i think you ll see you ll continue to see good margin expansion in ma to your questions about reis and bureau van dijk i ll take bureau van dijk first the business continues to perform very well we re very happy with what s happening in that business from a stand alone on a stand alone basis if you will as well as with respect to cross selling and product synergies that we are pursuing in a very disciplined way so bvd continues to perform well i mean frankly the if you look at the bureau van dijk business we took a pretty big hit on fx in the first quarter but on an underlying basis on a constant currency basis we still had very strong growth in bureau van dijk so the underlying business is performing quite well and as i said our cross selling and product synergies are starting to kick in very much in line with our expectations within reis i d say that business is is also going very much according to expectations i think what we are hearing very clearly from our customers is that they very much welcome moody s involvement in the reis business there is clear interest in the opportunities to combine the reis data which is is quite extensive and very unique with some of the specialized content and analytics that moody s offers people the customers have indicated to us that they they fully subscribed to and validate the hypothesis that we ve had about the impact that we can have in bringing more insight and more analytic capabilities to the commercial real estate business so we re we re very encouraged by the response we re getting from customers having said that there is there is still a lot of work for us to do there but we we feel very good about the path we re on and the opportunities to to grow that business peter appert piper jaffray analyst okay thank you mark operator now moving to a question from joseph foresi with cantor fitzgerald joseph foresi cantor fitzgerald analyst hi i was wondering sticking with analytics how much of this is the change in the business model versus i guess strength in demand i m just trying to get a sense of whether there was an uptick for the products in general or as you said bvd is being integrated and you re starting to see some of the saas to services change take place raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer i would say it s it s definitely both i think the some of the shift that we ve made in business model particularly in ers and also to some degree in our training business is definitely enabling us to deliver much more scalable and therefore profitable solutions but having said that the underlying demand for the kinds of things that we re doing that are driven by new accounting standards that are driven by banks desires to improve the efficiency of their sme lending practices those that underlying demand is also very important element of this as well joseph foresi cantor fitzgerald analyst got it and then my second question is just on the margin opportunity you talked about the second half potentially being better than the first half maybe you could give us a cadence there and i m just wondering should we think of this as guidance on the margin side is set for what the expectations are on the top line from issuance and anything above would be beneficial to the margins that we would see further expansion how should we how should we think about that in the second half of the year raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer yeah i mean it s ray generally speaking yes if we see an uptick in issuance particularly if it s issuance from institutions that we already have a rating relationship with that s going to be a margin friendly scenario we ve talked about on previous calls a little bit about the desirability of the new mandates because they create new relationships which benefit us in the going forward years but it s in terms of the highest margin uptick it would come from from existing issuers rated issuers who choose to go back into the market joseph foresi cantor fitzgerald analyst thank you operator our next question will come from bill warmington with wells fargo william warmington wells fargo analyst good afternoon everyone so first question on sorry first question on mis issuance excluding for the overall market issuance excluding sovereign debt was down about 14 mis revenue was down about 7 there were seem to be some notable outperformance there and i wanted to see if you thought that was a fair assessment are there other specific factors you feel enabled you to outperform the market this quarter or is it really a function of mix or other extraneous factors robert fauber president moody s investors service hey bill it s rob i ll take that and i think you got to keep in mind that about 40 of the revenue is recurring william warmington wells fargo analyst yeah robert fauber president moody s investors service and that revenue this quarter was growing at about 1 that provides a nice kind of balance the transaction revenue was down 11 compared to that issuance down 14 and if you allow for call it low single digit price the mix factors this quarter were i would say a minor contributor to the delta william warmington wells fargo analyst got it and then a question for you on esg i mean we noted the vigeo eiris acquisition i just wanted to ask if you could frame what you considered to be the esg opportunity for moody s when does it actually start to move the needle has it started to move the needle raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer that i ll lead off and then rob may may want to add in terms of the commercial opportunity it s early days we will have to see how much the increasing investor and customer interest in esg translates into a robust commercial opportunity and we ll obviously keep you informed as we move forward with that the level of interest though in esg cyber security cyber scoring is very high it s particularly high in europe and it s growing everywhere so that says to us that if we can develop standards if we can develop the vocabulary on a rigorous consistent analytically robust basis for communicating to the the marketplace about developments with entities in esg that the likelihood of us having a promising commercial opportunity is quite high so rob i don t know if you robert fauber president moody s investors service i i mean that s right ray i mean it s a it s still a relatively small fragmented evolving industry as ray said looking for standards i would say for us there s a stand alone commercial opportunity as ray described but it is also increasingly relevant to the work that we re doing in the rating agency and also more broadly across the ma customer base you think about banks insurance companies corporates professional services firms all increasingly interested in some form of esg or cyber kind of content that s what s driving it raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer and i would just add there is also increasing regulatory interest and policy maker interest in disclosure around esg in measuring esg factors of various kinds and when you get that kind of regulatory push historically in other areas that has translated into into product and service opportunities for us so i would be hopeful we would see the same phenomena here william warmington wells fargo analyst okay thank you very much operator jeff silber with bmo capital markets will have the next question jeffrey silber bmo capital markets analyst thank you so much i was hoping you can give an update on some of the progress that you ve made if any on ratings in china raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer sure i think as we ve talked about on previous calls we we do have a joint venture in china entity called ccxi it is the largest rating agency in china it has been the most successful rating agency i think both in terms of its coverage and financially so we are very interested in continuing with that joint venture relationship what that translates into in terms of having a separate license for moody s to operate in the domestic market i think is uncertain at this point it may be that the chinese would prefer us to operate either through ccxi or on our own as moody s and we will just have to see as as their thinking evolves we make our views as clear as we can but we are very interested in staying with the joint venture and that that would influence how we we think about the domestic market opportunity now that being said we still have very good coverage in the cross border markets for chinese institutions that are active internationally we expect that to continue and we ve had good growth in that in that stock of rating relationships so that s that s all continuing as it has been and i guess just the last thing i would add is one of the attractions of the joint venture is it is actually licensed to operate in both the interbank market and the exchange traded market and so the interbank market being larger the exchange traded market being the faster growing market and that makes that platform again particularly attractive to us jeffrey silber bmo capital markets analyst okay great if i could shift gears to your outlook for this year forgive me i don t have last quarters press release in front of me but if i compare the details on your table this quarter to just the last quarter is there anything to call out besides just the changes in fx rates mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer there are no changes in our outlook or our guidance that we re providing today vis a vis what we provided in mid february multiple speakers jeffrey silber bmo capital markets analyst yeah thank you so much mark operator craig huber with huber research partners will ask have the next question craig huber huber research partners analyst yeah hi thank you i ll start with china as well ray is your ph preference to be allowed to operate as a moody s stand alone in china and also have the jv separately how do you what s your ideal situation how this could be structured inaudible when things are complicated with this jv arrangement you have and along the same lines can you just talk a little bit further about in china how you kind of view the corporate market for example of any potential pent up demand for so called third party or us rating agencies have come in there but there s a lot of pent up demand for ratings being called out by the companies out there and so they re looking for that raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer yeah craig i think the i think rather than what our preference is it s probably best to look at this through the lens of what the priorities are for the chinese policy makers in terms of their thinking about how they would like to see participation in their market and what the nature of that participation would be certainly they don t want to see disruptive activities with respect to their market and so they re conscious of participants in the market operating in ways that are going to be conducive to smooth ph the market growth and the steady development of credit risk analysis and related solutions that might come from institutions like moody s analytics they are also interested in attracting foreign capital and in attracting foreign capital they are certainly aware of the fact that international investors interested in deploying capital into china would be interested in hearing from international institutions such as moody s about risk and related research so the the agenda that includes attracting foreign capital includes market stability includes a desire for reform without disruption all of that has to be placed into a mix and i think honestly i think it s still relatively early days in terms of how exactly that will play out there s probably an element to the trade negotiations that factors into this as well but we ll just have to see as that moves forward craig huber huber research partners analyst then also if i could ask on the on the cost side you sort of mark you sort of think about the cadence for cost growth over the remaining three quarters of the year relative to what you had here in the first quarter and then i ll get some ph one more you said back half they will be helped by the restructuring you guys have done here the last couple of quarters and stuff but normally things go up if cost goes up ph or the year goes on particularly in the fourth quarter sequentially and stuff how do you see that cadence playing out this year in the scheme of being up single digits for the full year and then my housekeeping question is what was incentive comp in the first quarter versus a year ago please thanks mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer hey craig thanks for the thanks for the question the most prominent factors in the expense growth that we saw this quarter were related to hiring and merits and this is primarily due to the impact from hiring in prior periods obviously we ve spoken about our ability and our desire to continue to invest selectively in lower cost locations and i d also note that the expense growth was due to the inorganic activity from reis and omega and then certainly our restructuring charge thinking forward we are not expecting a significant ramping in expenses from the first quarter to the fourth quarter and specifically as we start to realize savings from the restructuring program if i have to quantify that i say expenses would ramp somewhere between somewhere around 10 million in the first quarter to the fourth quarter and i don t think this will necessarily be linearly and then just by way of comparison last year s expense ramp was 50 million so there is a meaningful reduction this year and on the housekeeping item related to incentive comp the amount that we booked this quarter was approximately 47 million for the quarter that is very much in line with the guidance we gave in february around which is around 50 million for the quarter craig huber huber research partners analyst great thank you operator our next question will come from tim mchugh with william blair company timothy mchugh william blair company analyst yes just following up a little bit on the expense side i guess to talk about why the expense is taking i guess the savings from the restructuring are taking time to flow through is it people then leave the business immediately after the restructuring i guess just help me understand i guess the timing aspect of the savings mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer sure and again thank you for the question we did communicate the time that we announced our restructuring program that we would begin to see those savings emerge really in the second half of the year and that s because the restructuring savings encompass really three areas both real estate management second relates to people and then third really relates to ongoing oversight of various projects and initiatives we are on track i would say to achieve the total restructuring plan target that we have updated earlier in the year and that would lead to an anticipated annualized pre tax saving amount of 40 million to 50 million and i would say that we do expect a larger q2 restructuring charge to be booked vis a vis what we see now in q1 and that may push us to be slightly above the high end of the previously communicated 70 million to 80 million range so in brief i would say that we are certainly on track and this is playing out exactly as we expected and we are executing the actions that we have committed to timothy mchugh william blair company analyst okay and then can i follow up maybe as we think about then the expenses not ramping as much as normal is it simply that i guess the saving from that restructuring charge or is there any change as we think about the ongoing hiring and pace of investment across the year i guess are you also constraining how quickly your ph kind of incremental investments from here are going to happen as we go on or is it simply the savings will flow through later in the year trying to understand the ongoing kind of investment and spending levels for the rest of the year now in this environment mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer sure i think there s certainly an expectation that both variables will impact the ramp which obviously includes the timing of hiring and there is also the element of incentive compensation which will flex based on how the external environment emerges and we are certainly in both businesses actively utilizing the opportunities available to us in lower cost locations and i think the combination of those factors is really what s influencing the fact that expense ramped this year is relatively flat especially vis a vis postures timothy mchugh william blair company analyst okay great thank you operator we ll now take a question from george tong with goldman sachs ryan leary goldman sachs analyst hi you have ryan ph on for george thanks for taking my question in regards to your issuance guidance for 2019 that you reiterated could you discuss any changes within the guidance as it relates to the composition of mis revenue raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer there are some some adjustments we ve made internally for example expectations around the volume of floating rate versus fixed rate debt in the corporate finance area but but overall it s it s netting out so that our expectations remain consistent the adjustments are incremental and offsetting ryan leary goldman sachs analyst okay great thanks operator ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the question and answer session i will turn the call back over to mr ray mcdaniel for any additional or closing remarks raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer okay thank you very much everybody and before we go i just

if you were hoping that president trump would seek to balance the budget and cut unconstitutional spending eliminating socialism as he goes you ll be disappointed charles scaliger with the accustomed fanfare the trump administration released on march 11 its budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 such budget proposals are little more than window dressing since it is congress and not the white house that has authority under the constitution to appropriate public funds such budgets are usually ignored by the denizens of capitol hill especially when as is now the case the house of representatives is controlled by the opposing party moreover it has become the practice over the last dec ade or so to operate without any sort of budgetary restraint whatsoever congress preferring to lurch from one debt ceiling crisis to another without the limits of an agreed upon budget nevertheless such budgets however statutorily irrelevant are useful bellwethers for getting a sense of fiscal priorities it s a safe assumption that a congressional or presidential budgetary proposal will represent the absolute minimum that government is prepared to spend and that actual expenditures as well as the deficits they will generate will far exceed those contemplated this is because for several generations and across party lines government expenditures have been largely allocated to programs not authorized by the legal document that once set limits on federal government power and cost the u s constitution such irresponsible spending is the reason for the heavy burden of taxes americans now bear taxes that are routinely wasted on pie in the sky government programs that benefit few besides the overpaid bureaucrats who administer them or that are shoveled into the unappeasable maw of the national debt for which interest payments alone now consume hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars every year president trump in the introduction to his 2020 budget proposal expresses a desire for significant cost cutting this year writes the president i have asked most executive departments and agencies to cut their budgets by at least 5 percent laudable sentiments allegedly reflected throughout the budget but that same introduction outlines a series of ambitious budget proposals to research childhood cancers defeat hiv aids and confront the opioid epidemic noble objectives all but like so much of modern big government of very dubious constitutionality moreover the budget introduction seeks to invest in america s students and workers by creating a loan risk sharing program for educational institutions and by expanding eligibility for the federal government subsidized pell grant program pledging also to support working families the trump budget also includes a one time mandatory investment of 1 billion for a competitive fund aimed at supporting underserved populations and stimulating employer investments in child care for working families and will also provide paid parental leave to help working parents these be it noted are merely broad brush statements in the brief introduction to the budget as with washington budgets since time immemorial the devil is always to be found in the details

outlook for 2019 and after our prepared remarks we ll be happy to respond to your questions in the first quarter moody s analytics mid teens revenue growth offset issuance headwinds resulting in a 1 revenue increase for moody s corporation as expected moody s adjusted operating margin contracted to 45 4 as the expense reductions from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018 will not meaningfully affect the p l until the second half of 2019 adjusted diluted eps nonetheless grew by 2 year over year driven by a lower effective tax rate and a 1 reduction in share count from the accelerated share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2019 lower interest rates and tighter fixed income spreads led to improved issuance activity following the disruption in the fourth quarter of 2018 however issuance was lower than first quarter 2018 has 2018 levels as a result of uncertain business outlook the inversion of the us treasury yield curve and reduced global growth forecast caused concern about economic weakness and contributed to more accommodative monetary and fiscal policies geopolitical concerns around us china trade negotiations and brexit uncertainty continuing to weigh on the market these factors led to a mixed issuance environment in the first quarter as i mentioned while issuance improved significantly from the fourth quarter of 2018 year over year issuance was down 14 mis revenue was down only 7 demonstrating the continued strength of the business model mis s recurring revenue base supported by increased monitoring fees from recent new mandates as well as pricing provided a partial counterbalance to the decline in issuance similar to my comment on corporate expenses we expect to start realizing mis expense reductions from our restructuring program as we move further into 2019 for the first quarter the revenue contraction led to a decline in mis s adjusted operating margin to 54 9 however focusing longer term on the trailing 12 month basis mis margins were up 50 basis points to 57 5 i d like to spend another minute on investment grade and high yield bond issuance as well as bank loan issuance in the first quarter as these were significant drivers of year over year performance due to the flattening of the yield curve in the first quarter market preferences shifted from floating to fixed rate instruments where lower financing costs increased investment grade and high yield bond issuance by 19 and 1 respectively on the other hand higher financing costs reduced bank loan issuance by 33 year over year while loan issuance for m a activity remained relatively intact refinancing activity was largely muted versus the prior year period for ma each business delivered double digit revenue growth which contributed to 16 total ma revenue growth and a 350 basis point improvement in the adjusted operating margin organic ma revenue was up 13 from the prior year period rd a revenue grew 15 due to strong sales growth at bureau van dijk in the second half of 2018 contribution from the reis acquisition as well as strengthened core research and data products on an organic basis rd a also delivered double digit revenue growth of 12 in ers strong fourth quarter 2018 and first quarter 2019 subscription sales drove a 19 revenue increase and we continue to execute on the transition to as we continue to execute on the transition to a software as a service or saas operating model we re encouraged by this growth however we are not expecting increases of similar magnitude in every quarter professional services revenue growth of 13 was driven by the contribution from omega performance as well as strong new sales in the max business organic professional services revenue was up 6 i would like to highlight the strong performance of ers in the first quarter the increase in the ers revenue base which has grown by over 100 million since 2015 has been a large driver of ma revenue recurring revenue as a share of total ers business continued to tick up in the first quarter and reached 78 on a trailing 12 month basis indicating that this trend will continue trailing 12 month subscription sales have increased 12 while sales of the one time products we have been de emphasizing increased 2 the deliberate shift we have made on the on the expansion of our subscription business will support scalability and drive ma operating leverage and margin moreover we are meeting our customers demands by moving to a saas based model due to its ease of use and lower cost of ownership this next generation of products will enhance the customer experience improve adoption rates and shorten our sales cycles ers s resumed revenue growth is a key component of ongoing adjusted operating margin improvement in ma for 2019 i d like to take a moment to highlight the recent acquisitions that are contributing to our strategic priority of pursuing growth opportunities in adjacent product areas in october 2018 we successfully completed the acquisition of reis a leading provider of us commercial real estate or cre data since then ma introduced the reis network a platform of connected applications providing market participants access to cre solutions for property research investment and risk management we also launched commercial location score an advanced quantitative solution for evaluating cre using data from reis allowing cre investors lenders and developers to evaluate the suitability of over 7 million commercially zoned parcels in the united states also in october we announced an investment in team8 partners a leading think tank and company creation platform specializing in cyber security and data resilience building on prior investments and initiatives in cyber security and emerging technologies and last week we announced that moody s had acquired a majority stake in vigeo eiris to support our esg initiatives vigeo eiris is a leading global provider of esg research data and assessments and is a foundational asset for our broader efforts in this space adding to the growing body of esg analysis and research already produced within mis vigeo eiris brings moody s an extensive database a long established presence in the esg space and a wide product offering which will help moody s and its goal to become a global standard setter in esg vigeo eiris will be an affiliate of mis and continue to operate from its headquarters in paris this investment is consistent with moody s strategy of serving the evolving needs of financial market participants beyond the credit risk this transaction is not expected to materially impact moody s 2019 financial results or our capital allocation plans but it s meaningful to our strategic objectives building on moody s increasing efforts in the esg space on that note moody s will soon release its annual corporate social responsibility report which aligns with the global reporting initiative or gri standards core option you will be able to access this report at moodys com csr underpinning our strategic priorities we are continuing to enhance our technology infrastructure to enable automation innovation and efficiency moody s is enhancing its data and analytical capabilities by utilizing alternative and unstructured data sources to supplement financial and cre analysis natural language processing and ai are improving the decision making capabilities of our analysts and our customers through credit monitoring tools customized training and loan application approval machine learning ai and natural language processing are also delivering efficiencies by allowing us to automate manual repeatable tasks and the spreading of financial data as well as generate thousands of research reports on small municipal issuers finally we are utilizing the cloud across the business to cater to customer requirement in an efficient and low cost manner we will continue to enhance our processes and product offerings to meet our needs and those of our customers by embracing technological innovation i ll now turn the call over to mark to review our outlook for 2019 mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you ray moody s outlook for 2019 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors including but not limited to interest and foreign currency exchange rates corporate profitability and business investment spending mergers and acquisitions and the level of debt capital markets activity these assumptions are subject to uncertainty and the results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates specifically our forecast for the remainder of 2019 reflected reflects exchange rates for the british pound of 1 30 and for the euro 1 12 we are affirming the full year 2019 guidance metrics we laid out on the february earnings call we still expect revenue and operating expenses to each increase in the mid single digit percent range operating expense guidance includes depreciation and amortization acquisition related expense and restructuring charges of note we are not expecting a significant ramp in expenses from the first to the fourth quarter of 2019 as we start to realize savings from the restructuring program the 2019 operating margin and adjusted operating margin are still anticipated to be approximately 43 and 48 respectively we continue to expect net interest expense in the range of 200 million to 225 million and a full year effective tax rate in the range of 21 to 22 notwithstanding the low actual rate in the first quarter of the year diluted and adjusted diluted eps are still expected to be 7 30 to 7 55 and 7 85 to 8 10 respectively for a full list of our guidance please refer to table 12 in our earnings release for mis we continue to anticipate total full year revenue increase in the low single digit percent range with growth weighted more toward the second half of the year as the year over year comparable becomes easier we are now expecting higher contribution from us corporate bond but lower contribution from loans and to a lesser extent from clos and us public finance issuance we continue to believe that issuance will be flat to down 5 in comparison to 2018 we also expect approximately 900 first time mandates in 2019 the mis adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 58 in 2019 for ma we still anticipate total revenue to increase in the low double digit percent range as we recognized the strong sales growth at bureau van dijk and benefit from the stability of recurring revenue from the core rd a business and ers transition to a saas based model the ma adjusted operating margin is still expected to expand 250 basis points to 350 basis points the 29 to 30 range in 2019 i d like to spend a moment discussing our approach to capital management we remain committed to long term leverage anchored around bbb plus rating which we believe appropriately balances our cost of capital with financing flexibility our debt maturities are well distributed with no significant debt coming due until september 2020 as i ve noted previously we have a robust and disciplined approach to capital allocation as the first priority we invest or reinvest in activities that support our strategic priorities following that we look to return excess capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases before turning to q a i would like to note a few key takeaways we remain confident in moody s ability to deliver revenue growth and margin stability in 2019 we will continue to defend and enhance our core ratings and research businesses at the same time we will keep pursuing strategic growth opportunities both down the corporate credit permit and across into new geographies and adjacent product areas remaining grounded in technology enabled products services and capabilities finally we will maintain our disciplined and thoughtful approach to capital management and the return of free cash flow raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer thank you mark this concludes our prepared remarks and joining mark and me for the question and answer session are mark almeida president of moody s analytics and rob fauber president of moody s investors service we ll be pleased to take any questions you may have questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions we will take our first question from manav patnaik with barclays manav patnaik barclays analyst thank you good morning guys my first question is just around that credit permit and business adjacency slide that you had commercial real estate and esg those make sense can you just help me understand the cyber risk aspect of it and then maybe just briefly what are the areas would you consider as business adjacencies raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer sure manav we re really looking at areas of financial markets where we think that they are under served in the form of standards that help to understand measure and manage risk so certainly the interest in certain areas of esg and cyber security are things that have drawn increasing attention from investors from regulatory authorities and as a result our important increasingly important for the issuer community and the mis side and for a variety of institutions that moody s analytics serves and we believe that as adjacencies to credit risk areas of esg and cyber security are going to be folded into the overall financial analysis and investing that is done on a going forward basis so really what we re looking at is trying to align our products and services with what investors and customers are increasingly focusing themselves on and where we believe standards can can be implemented that is going to create more efficiency in markets and among customer transactions that s that s really the thesis here manav patnaik barclays analyst okay got it and then if i could just follow up on the capital allocation so with leverage already at i guess 2 times and i think you said in the slide that you expect leverage to keep declining so does that mean the focus is still on deleveraging versus buybacks or maybe there are some m a in the thoughts there as well mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer sure manav and thanks for the question leverage ticked up a little bit in the first quarter really due to the lower first quarter adjusted operating income and some of our commercial paper borrowing and we do expect leverage to decline over the remainder of the year of course this is subject to market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decision our approach to capital allocation remains consistent with that we followed historically primarily looking firstly for investing in growth opportunities either through reinvestment in the business or through acquisitions and then to the extent those opportunities are not available and certainly to return capital either through dividends or through share repurchases manav patnaik barclays analyst all right thank you guys operator we ll now hear from toni kaplan with morgan stanley toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst hi good afternoon when you look at the first quarter outside of the lower tax rate i guess were results in line with your expectations and where i m coming from is i think top line you had sort of the weak structured results but that was offset by strong ers but margins were a little bit lighter ph than what i was thinking and i know mis was pressured by the revenue decline and it s just ma didn t really offset that so i guess it s given that you re not expecting the tax benefit to sustain through the year did you contemplate lowering guidance or did your expectations for the rest of the year get better raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer i think i think the fairest answer toni is that our expectations have remained largely the same so within the the fact that we affirmed guidance really across the board for both mis and ma and then and then moody s corp as a whole indicates that the first quarter was not a surprise to us and it is is pretty much in line with with where we expected to be overall obviously the strength in moody s analytics was very welcome but we had expected some challenge with mis given the very strong first quarter that we saw in 2018 we did expect it to be off from that level toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst okay and based on that i guess it sounds like you re sort of expecting that mis was going to be roughly around where it came in i guess are you more or less confident maybe in the mis revenue guide of up of for the year and was structured worse than you expected in the quarter how do you think structured sort of plays out from here i know you mentioned the different mix of versus what you were maybe originally expecting but maybe rob you could give us a little bit of commentary on sort of the environment now thank you robert fauber president moody s investors service yeah this is rob so we can we can expand on that but i would say supporting the guidance we re still holding to our overall outlook for issuance of kind of flat to down 5 and again we can talk a little bit about that touching specifically on structured the first thing i would highlight is we had the reclassification of reits ph were structured into into corporate finance the big story in structured this quarter was really around clos clo formation new clo formation held up pretty well generally in line with the prior year quarter but it was really around the refis and resets that we saw significant decline in activity and that s as we saw wider aaa liability spreads and that really weakened the deal economics for clos that said looking forward for structured finance we the pipeline i would say is generally improving and adding that this includes clos we ve seen improvement in deal activity in clos each month of the quarter from a very slow start in january we ve seen clo issuance really pickup in march it s continuing to be active into april we have an active pipeline of clos but as i said that the refi and reset activity continues to be significantly below prior year levels and then the other kind of big piece of structured finance is around cmbs and market activity was was pretty good there in the first quarter the mix was skewed heavily toward these single asset single borrower deals versus conduits that resulted in some smaller deal sizes and we re continuing to see that so we re seeing good inquires and engagement but but smaller deal sizes in cmbs toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst thank you operator alex kramm with ubs has the next question alex kramm ubs analyst yeah hey good morning everyone maybe and maybe this is for rob as well but can you just broaden your comment a little bit on your on your expectations for maybe the corporate issuance environment i think a quarter ago we asked about increasingly hearing a cfo saying they want to de lever i mean you yourself are saying you re keeping leverage pretty low so i guess what are the what are still the items that you re watching and what are you hearing from issuers how they are how they are thinking about leverage levels appetite to for capex m a etc mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer alex thank you for the question this is mark rob and i actually both going to comment on this particular question i ll first provide the perspective we re hearing externally from some of the banks and then i ll turn it over to rob who will follow up with our internal view point on the banking side in the us banks primarily noticed the dovish ph commentary to low yields and tightening spreads which they believe have supported a strong start to the year for investment grade bonds and to a lesser extent high yield bonds while the tone from banks was quite positive on the start of the year a concern does remain around potentially slowing economic growth and recession risk which is i d say briefly accentuated by the temporary inversion of the yield curve as a result the expectations are now for us benchmark rates to remain lower for longer this view on benchmarks rates is one of the factors that we believe or at least the banks believe contributed to a lowest us leverage loan issuance and a shift toward high yield bond issuance if i turn to europe and what we heard from the banks is that the investment grade market is seeing similar rate dynamics to us investment grade and you can see this in the tenure bonds where the yield recently went negative now for the first time since mid 2016 and it is obviously currently hovering around zero correspondingly the banks are seeing a sharp decline in the number of investment grade floating rate issuances year to date compared to the same period in 2018 and there is favorable relative value dynamics that continue to encourage reverse and the ph issuance and the banks estimated around 30 of supply year to date has come from us companies issuing in europe and then lastly in the high yield bond market issuance did start the year slow but saw considerable pickup in march and of course brexit remains a focus and a potential downside robert fauber president moody s investors service yeah maybe maybe to add to that mark and i don t think we ve seen a structural shift since we put together certainly our views for the year in terms of how companies are thinking about financing as i said we are continuing to hold to that 0 to down 5 the biggest risk really to the current issuance outlook is probably around bank loans mark noted in regards to the street view less opportunistic refi the flattening of the yield curve and this issuer and investor rotation out of bank loans and that s all contributing to softness that we re seeing there and i think we re going to need to see some further spread tightening to improve bank loan issuance volumes for the rest of the year so we remain cautious on the bank loan space along with the decline in bank loans softer outlook for clos again record refi activity in 2018 and that s really begun to decelerate again amid those wider spreads that i talked about i think some modest upside to our original outlook in investment grade and that s supported by opportunistic refinancing and again with rates coming in spreads coming in and m a activity as well we see continue to see very healthy m a activity underpinning the market we also see some upside to high yield and this is the flip side of the rotation from bank loans into high yield and we re keeping an eye out on us public finance again we all know that was impacted from the tax law changes around the advance refundings as a result first quarter of 2018 was a pretty modest comparable because we had pulled forward into 4q 17 so that s an area where we have been expecting higher growth relative to the other higher issuance growth relative to the other sectors and all in all i think as i think forward to the just now the next several months i think the risk from bank loans and clos is probably modestly outweighing the upsides from us investment grade and high yield alex kramm ubs analyst okay thank you for that just very quickly on ers i think you gave a lot of good detail on this we ll move to more recurring but maybe i missed this but can you just talk about the first quarter and the near term outlook here a little bit was there a bunch of one time ish stuff that happened in the first quarter was it was it a little bit more transactional and maybe flesh out why and i think about this business now as maybe growing consistently sequentially versus very seasonally as a more saas based ph but i guess my question is is the second quarter little bit of a sequential down tick maybe there because there was something big in the first quarter thank you mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer alex it s mark the answer is the short answer to your question is no the first quarter strength was really driven by very good results on the subscription side of the business so that really is what drove the 19 growth and we just said very good strength across the business all of the regions were up double digits all of the product lines were up double digits so we we did quite well across ers in the first quarter as ray said we don t expect that the first quarter result is something that we ll be able to sustain through the full year but we are expecting a strong year in ers particularly coming off of a down year last year because as we said at the end of last year we feel like we ve made the transition and we ve turned the corner from being a predominantly saas oriented or subscription based business and the runoff in the one time business is now being offset by a very good strength and continued growth on the subscription side so we we feel good about what we are i think it really validates our whole product strategy in ers i just remind everybody that the strategy behind ers is that we use the ers product to deliver moody s analytics specialized data and analytical capabilities to and we engineer platforms that address very specific customer problems for example we re working with many customers in the united states who need to adopt the cecl accounting standard that s analytically rather complex and it draws very directly on specific capabilities that we ve got in moody s analytics and so ers has engineered a platform aimed directly at that customer problem we ve got a similar situation with insurers who are having to adopt the forthcoming ifrs 17 accounting standard similar story there more broadly and we work with a lot of banks who are working hard to digitize and bring efficiency to their loan origination and credit assessment processes particularly around lending to small and medium sized enterprises our new creditlens platform is designed to enable that kind of digitization and efficiency so i think the results you re seeing are really a validation of the strategy that we re pursuing in ers alex kramm ubs analyst all right helpful thank you very much operator peter appert with piper jaffray has the next question peter appert piper jaffray analyst thank you good morning just sticking with mr almeida mark can you talk about the longer term margin targets please for the analytics business any new thoughts in terms of where you think you can go given the strength you re seeing currently and then i ll give you my follow up in advance also for mark on reis and bvd just an update in terms of what you re seeing in those business the size of the reis opportunity and whether you re continuing to see the same new sales momentum at bvd you enjoyed last year thank you mark e almeida president moody s analytics peter on the margin we feel good about the margin we feel like we continue to make very good progress there the first quarter was particularly strong but we have not set a specific target or sort of a ceiling on where we think we can go with the margin we continue to pursue expense management efforts as well as continue to drive growth in what is increasingly a subscription oriented business so that implies lots of scalability so if we can if we can drive good growth on the top line we ought to be able to continue to add to our expanding margins so i think the first quarter we had a bit of a benefit from the elimination of that deferred revenue haircut in bureau van dijk last year frankly that only accounted for about a third of the margin expansion that we re reporting so most of the margin expansion was coming from the rest of the moody s analytics business and a very significant chunk of that was from ers so we re going to continue doing what we ve been doing which i think will allow us to continue on the path of consistent but gradual improvement in the margin from quarter to quarter again the best way to look at that will be to look at it on a trailing 12 month basis because in any discrete quarter we re probably going to get some we can get some weird behavior either on the top line or on the expense line but the on a on a trailing 12 month basis i think you ll see you ll continue to see good margin expansion in ma to your questions about reis and bureau van dijk i ll take bureau van dijk first the business continues to perform very well we re very happy with what s happening in that business from a stand alone on a stand alone basis if you will as well as with respect to cross selling and product synergies that we are pursuing in a very disciplined way so bvd continues to perform well i mean frankly the if you look at the bureau van dijk business we took a pretty big hit on fx in the first quarter but on an underlying basis on a constant currency basis we still had very strong growth in bureau van dijk so the underlying business is performing quite well and as i said our cross selling and product synergies are starting to kick in very much in line with our expectations within reis i d say that business is is also going very much according to expectations i think what we are hearing very clearly from our customers is that they very much welcome moody s involvement in the reis business there is clear interest in the opportunities to combine the reis data which is is quite extensive and very unique with some of the specialized content and analytics that moody s offers people the customers have indicated to us that they they fully subscribed to and validate the hypothesis that we ve had about the impact that we can have in bringing more insight and more analytic capabilities to the commercial real estate business so we re we re very encouraged by the response we re getting from customers having said that there is there is still a lot of work for us to do there but we we feel very good about the path we re on and the opportunities to to grow that business peter appert piper jaffray analyst okay thank you mark operator now moving to a question from joseph foresi with cantor fitzgerald joseph foresi cantor fitzgerald analyst hi i was wondering sticking with analytics how much of this is the change in the business model versus i guess strength in demand i m just trying to get a sense of whether there was an uptick for the products in general or as you said bvd is being integrated and you re starting to see some of the saas to services change take place raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer i would say it s it s definitely both i think the some of the shift that we ve made in business model particularly in ers and also to some degree in our training business is definitely enabling us to deliver much more scalable and therefore profitable solutions but having said that the underlying demand for the kinds of things that we re doing that are driven by new accounting standards that are driven by banks desires to improve the efficiency of their sme lending practices those that underlying demand is also very important element of this as well joseph foresi cantor fitzgerald analyst got it and then my second question is just on the margin opportunity you talked about the second half potentially being better than the first half maybe you could give us a cadence there and i m just wondering should we think of this as guidance on the margin side is set for what the expectations are on the top line from issuance and anything above would be beneficial to the margins that we would see further expansion how should we how should we think about that in the second half of the year raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer yeah i mean it s ray generally speaking yes if we see an uptick in issuance particularly if it s issuance from institutions that we already have a rating relationship with that s going to be a margin friendly scenario we ve talked about on previous calls a little bit about the desirability of the new mandates because they create new relationships which benefit us in the going forward years but it s in terms of the highest margin uptick it would come from from existing issuers rated issuers who choose to go back into the market joseph foresi cantor fitzgerald analyst thank you operator our next question will come from bill warmington with wells fargo william warmington wells fargo analyst good afternoon everyone so first question on sorry first question on mis issuance excluding for the overall market issuance excluding sovereign debt was down about 14 mis revenue was down about 7 there were seem to be some notable outperformance there and i wanted to see if you thought that was a fair assessment are there other specific factors you feel enabled you to outperform the market this quarter or is it really a function of mix or other extraneous factors robert fauber president moody s investors service hey bill it s rob i ll take that and i think you got to keep in mind that about 40 of the revenue is recurring william warmington wells fargo analyst yeah robert fauber president moody s investors service and that revenue this quarter was growing at about 1 that provides a nice kind of balance the transaction revenue was down 11 compared to that issuance down 14 and if you allow for call it low single digit price the mix factors this quarter were i would say a minor contributor to the delta william warmington wells fargo analyst got it and then a question for you on esg i mean we noted the vigeo eiris acquisition i just wanted to ask if you could frame what you considered to be the esg opportunity for moody s when does it actually start to move the needle has it started to move the needle raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer that i ll lead off and then rob may may want to add in terms of the commercial opportunity it s early days we will have to see how much the increasing investor and customer interest in esg translates into a robust commercial opportunity and we ll obviously keep you informed as we move forward with that the level of interest though in esg cyber security cyber scoring is very high it s particularly high in europe and it s growing everywhere so that says to us that if we can develop standards if we can develop the vocabulary on a rigorous consistent analytically robust basis for communicating to the the marketplace about developments with entities in esg that the likelihood of us having a promising commercial opportunity is quite high so rob i don t know if you robert fauber president moody s investors service i i mean that s right ray i mean it s a it s still a relatively small fragmented evolving industry as ray said looking for standards i would say for us there s a stand alone commercial opportunity as ray described but it is also increasingly relevant to the work that we re doing in the rating agency and also more broadly across the ma customer base you think about banks insurance companies corporates professional services firms all increasingly interested in some form of esg or cyber kind of content that s what s driving it raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer and i would just add there is also increasing regulatory interest and policy maker interest in disclosure around esg in measuring esg factors of various kinds and when you get that kind of regulatory push historically in other areas that has translated into into product and service opportunities for us so i would be hopeful we would see the same phenomena here william warmington wells fargo analyst okay thank you very much operator jeff silber with bmo capital markets will have the next question jeffrey silber bmo capital markets analyst thank you so much i was hoping you can give an update on some of the progress that you ve made if any on ratings in china raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer sure i think as we ve talked about on previous calls we we do have a joint venture in china entity called ccxi it is the largest rating agency in china it has been the most successful rating agency i think both in terms of its coverage and financially so we are very interested in continuing with that joint venture relationship what that translates into in terms of having a separate license for moody s to operate in the domestic market i think is uncertain at this point it may be that the chinese would prefer us to operate either through ccxi or on our own as moody s and we will just have to see as as their thinking evolves we make our views as clear as we can but we are very interested in staying with the joint venture and that that would influence how we we think about the domestic market opportunity now that being said we still have very good coverage in the cross border markets for chinese institutions that are active internationally we expect that to continue and we ve had good growth in that in that stock of rating relationships so that s that s all continuing as it has been and i guess just the last thing i would add is one of the attractions of the joint venture is it is actually licensed to operate in both the interbank market and the exchange traded market and so the interbank market being larger the exchange traded market being the faster growing market and that makes that platform again particularly attractive to us jeffrey silber bmo capital markets analyst okay great if i could shift gears to your outlook for this year forgive me i don t have last quarters press release in front of me but if i compare the details on your table this quarter to just the last quarter is there anything to call out besides just the changes in fx rates mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer there are no changes in our outlook or our guidance that we re providing today vis a vis what we provided in mid february multiple speakers jeffrey silber bmo capital markets analyst yeah thank you so much mark operator craig huber with huber research partners will ask have the next question craig huber huber research partners analyst yeah hi thank you i ll start with china as well ray is your ph preference to be allowed to operate as a moody s stand alone in china and also have the jv separately how do you what s your ideal situation how this could be structured inaudible when things are complicated with this jv arrangement you have and along the same lines can you just talk a little bit further about in china how you kind of view the corporate market for example of any potential pent up demand for so called third party or us rating agencies have come in there but there s a lot of pent up demand for ratings being called out by the companies out there and so they re looking for that raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer yeah craig i think the i think rather than what our preference is it s probably best to look at this through the lens of what the priorities are for the chinese policy makers in terms of their thinking about how they would like to see participation in their market and what the nature of that participation would be certainly they don t want to see disruptive activities with respect to their market and so they re conscious of participants in the market operating in ways that are going to be conducive to smooth ph the market growth and the steady development of credit risk analysis and related solutions that might come from institutions like moody s analytics they are also interested in attracting foreign capital and in attracting foreign capital they are certainly aware of the fact that international investors interested in deploying capital into china would be interested in hearing from international institutions such as moody s about risk and related research so the the agenda that includes attracting foreign capital includes market stability includes a desire for reform without disruption all of that has to be placed into a mix and i think honestly i think it s still relatively early days in terms of how exactly that will play out there s probably an element to the trade negotiations that factors into this as well but we ll just have to see as that moves forward craig huber huber research partners analyst then also if i could ask on the on the cost side you sort of mark you sort of think about the cadence for cost growth over the remaining three quarters of the year relative to what you had here in the first quarter and then i ll get some ph one more you said back half they will be helped by the restructuring you guys have done here the last couple of quarters and stuff but normally things go up if cost goes up ph or the year goes on particularly in the fourth quarter sequentially and stuff how do you see that cadence playing out this year in the scheme of being up single digits for the full year and then my housekeeping question is what was incentive comp in the first quarter versus a year ago please thanks mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer hey craig thanks for the thanks for the question the most prominent factors in the expense growth that we saw this quarter were related to hiring and merits and this is primarily due to the impact from hiring in prior periods obviously we ve spoken about our ability and our desire to continue to invest selectively in lower cost locations and i d also note that the expense growth was due to the inorganic activity from reis and omega and then certainly our restructuring charge thinking forward we are not expecting a significant ramping in expenses from the first quarter to the fourth quarter and specifically as we start to realize savings from the restructuring program if i have to quantify that i say expenses would ramp somewhere between somewhere around 10 million in the first quarter to the fourth quarter and i don t think this will necessarily be linearly and then just by way of comparison last year s expense ramp was 50 million so there is a meaningful reduction this year and on the housekeeping item related to incentive comp the amount that we booked this quarter was approximately 47 million for the quarter that is very much in line with the guidance we gave in february around which is around 50 million for the quarter craig huber huber research partners analyst great thank you operator our next question will come from tim mchugh with william blair company timothy mchugh william blair company analyst yes just following up a little bit on the expense side i guess to talk about why the expense is taking i guess the savings from the restructuring are taking time to flow through is it people then leave the business immediately after the restructuring i guess just help me understand i guess the timing aspect of the savings mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer sure and again thank you for the question we did communicate the time that we announced our restructuring program that we would begin to see those savings emerge really in the second half of the year and that s because the restructuring savings encompass really three areas both real estate management second relates to people and then third really relates to ongoing oversight of various projects and initiatives we are on track i would say to achieve the total restructuring plan target that we have updated earlier in the year and that would lead to an anticipated annualized pre tax saving amount of 40 million to 50 million and i would say that we do expect a larger q2 restructuring charge to be booked vis a vis what we see now in q1 and that may push us to be slightly above the high end of the previously communicated 70 million to 80 million range so in brief i would say that we are certainly on track and this is playing out exactly as we expected and we are executing the actions that we have committed to timothy mchugh william blair company analyst okay and then can i follow up maybe as we think about then the expenses not ramping as much as normal is it simply that i guess the saving from that restructuring charge or is there any change as we think about the ongoing hiring and pace of investment across the year i guess are you also constraining how quickly your ph kind of incremental investments from here are going to happen as we go on or is it simply the savings will flow through later in the year trying to understand the ongoing kind of investment and spending levels for the rest of the year now in this environment mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer sure i think there s certainly an expectation that both variables will impact the ramp which obviously includes the timing of hiring and there is also the element of incentive compensation which will flex based on how the external environment emerges and we are certainly in both businesses actively utilizing the opportunities available to us in lower cost locations and i think the combination of those factors is really what s influencing the fact that expense ramped this year is relatively flat especially vis a vis postures timothy mchugh william blair company analyst okay great thank you operator we ll now take a question from george tong with goldman sachs ryan leary goldman sachs analyst hi you have ryan ph on for george thanks for taking my question in regards to your issuance guidance for 2019 that you reiterated could you discuss any changes within the guidance as it relates to the composition of mis revenue raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer there are some some adjustments we ve made internally for example expectations around the volume of floating rate versus fixed rate debt in the corporate finance area but but overall it s it s netting out so that our expectations remain consistent the adjustments are incremental and offsetting ryan leary goldman sachs analyst okay great thanks operator ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the question and answer session i will turn the call back over to mr ray mcdaniel for any additional or closing remarks raymond w mcdaniel jr president and chief executive officer okay thank you very much everybody and before we go i just would like to note two additional items first we are amending our quarterly quiet period to now run from the 16th of last month of each calendar quarter to after that quarter s earnings call so i ve been asked to tell you to please consider this

for centuries gold has played a major role in human history and has become interwoven into the financial fabric of society beyond its investment following gold has become synonymous with wealth historically gold s early use cases revolved around money a form of medium of exchange after the second world war however several countries and their respective currencies started to shift away from the gold standard and migrated towards a fiat currency system today gold remains largely a store of value and due to its unique properties and large number of use cases it has managed to distance itself from other asset classes in terms of correlation demand supply drivers and investment purpose gold s idiosyncrasies function as a double edged sword as it is challenging to predict the price action and catalysts around this asset class even experts have trouble playing in this space with bernanke even stating nobody really understands gold prices and i don t pretend to understand them either we continue to see value in gold despite the recent volatility which was caused by market technical factors the fundamental underpinnings of the long gold trade remain intact since physical gold is rarely consumed but rather held for years as a store of value it has more in common with fiat currencies than industrial metals this is why the direction of gold prices is influenced by factors that drive other currencies including growth outlook and interest rates rather than physical premium inventory levels and other important technical drivers of certain commodities as such correlation with other metals such as the current sharp correction in palladium prices caused by supply demand distortions is likely to be fleeting when gold returns to its fundamental drivers as a store of value golds biggest attraction is that it maintains or even appreciates in value consistently and acts as safe haven during market risk off periods because of gold s perception it is not evaluated in terms of dividend yields and cash flow distributions but instead by analyzing quantifiable macro factors related to world growth prospects liquidity interest rates usd with an overlay analysis of the market environment implementing gold in portfolio construction requires combining bottom up quantitative signals with a forward looking analysis of event risks and political uncertainty broadly speaking the gold investment framework is constructed based on the following three pillars synchronized global slowdown appears widely entrenched china trend growth is declining as it moves up in value chain moving closer to developed markets rate of growth the lack of european and us economic momentum and policy paralysis invites comparison to japan this comparison will persist and reduce attractiveness of growth sensitive assets like equities and increases the allure of gold as a store of value source marto capital research bloomberg gold tends to perform well at the time of prolonged equity corrections driven by changes in the growth environment the inverse of the european equities and gold chart is a good illustration of how fundamental changes in growth outlook drive gold prices i e supporting gold prices at the time of the eurozone debt crisis and hurting gold when the european growth started to recover in 2013 no factor in isolation can fully explain the performance and other factors are also important to consider one of them being long term interest rates in fact researc bloomberg is a good example of gold prices diverging from growth outlook when gold prices declined even as the credit crisis got worse driven by a spike in real yields source marto capital research bloomberg over the very long term gold can benefit from wealth creation especially in emerging markets where allocation to gold as a percent of gdp remains low the rise of disposable income has risen in emerging markets over the past several decades and has led to an increase in financial assets and gold being held by households 2 liquidity drivers and investment alternatives real yields reflect longer term growth expectations but also reflect changes in liquidity conditions in the developed world financial markets the negative correlation between us real yields and gold prices is well known declining developed markets real yields reduce the attractiveness of traditional investment vehicles and lead investors to seek investments in alternative assets higher yielding emerging markets and gold rising real yields on the other hand increase the opportunity cost of investing in non interest bearing assets such as gold compared to other safe haven investments such as treasuries the graph below shows that real yields have been declining in the long term and the recent global central bank pivot to a dovish stance further solidifies the view that the monetary landscape has become more gold friendly source marto capital research bloomberg the inverse of the relationship between gold price and real rates has become stronger since the introduction of gold etfs in 2004 as this lowered the overhead costs of investing in gold we expect that the future pricing patterns and trends of gold will more likely resemble those in the post 2004 period as opposed to the 1980s when gold prices were more influenced by supply and demand dynamics of physical gold investing rather than macro drivers the u s dollar and gold have always been linked while under the gold standard the value of a unit of currency was tied to a specific amount of gold until 1971 when the u s dollar untethered from gold and became a reserve currency on a standalone basis now gold like most currencies is traded against the usd is influenced by the same macro drivers as currencies and by virtue of being denominated in dollars exhibits high correlation source marto capital research bloomberg there is an inverse relationship between the strength of the u s dollar and the price of gold this is due to two overarching reasons a falling u s dollar increases the value of other countries currencies gold is widely accepted to be priced and benchmarked in usd terms this in turn leads to an increase in demand for commodities including gold when the u s dollar starts to lose value investors look for alternative sources to store value other fiat currencies and gold one must acknowledge here that the reasons for the moves in the us dollar are often related to interest rate differentials when us interest rates decline versus other currencies carry in the alternative currencies becomes more attractive or if there are no better safe carry alternatives investors flee to gold 3 political uncertainty in modern portfolio construction gold is believed to be a hedge against geopolitics and is often called the crises commodity it typically appreciates in value when confidence in governments are low and during steep equity market drawdowns despite being a great dynamic risk hedge over time it is not a panacea for all market events the table below shows and breaks down the performance of high yield bonds treasuries reits and gold during periods of equity drawdowns it illustrates that gold rallies during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions and rising investor concerns with respect to fiscal and monetary policy errors in g4 source marto capital research bloomberg rising political uncertainty and a deteriorating fiscal position in the us meaningfully revives the debate of the us dollar as a reserve currency this in turn could drive further allocations to gold and alternative reserve currencies in central bank portfolios since the early 1970 s the volume of gold produced each year has roughly tripled and the amount of gold bought annually has since quadrupled as the gold market has become global despite gold s unique properties it is still ultimately a commodity and moves to the forces of demand and supply the supply and demand factors driving gold however are different from technical factors driving other commodities this is due to the fact that physical gold has almost no industrial applications and thus is never consumed but rather held as a store of value source marto capital research world gold council one notable development is an uptick in gold demand from 2017 to 2018 where the biggest driver is central bank purchases up 74 yoy reemergence of political risk that raise possibilities of fiscal accidents and sovereign downgrades revive more meaningfully the perennial question of usd dominance in the reserve managers portfolios this bears positive consequences for alternative reserve currencies like the chinese renminbi and the euro as well as gold as the table above indicates the three primary demand drivers for gold include jewelry investments and central banks while the growth in jewelry demand has been stagnant it still represents more than 50 of global demand for gold the narrative in 2019 is very much different than in 2018 the united states has lost its growth leadership china s road to stabilization is uncertain and we continue to watch a coordination effort unfold amongst central banks with dovish policies the price of gold is underpinned by three pillars growth expectations liquidity and event risk political uncertainty as we enter a late cycle where levered assets will be greatly challenged gold remains relatively attractive it is a real asset with limited supply from a macro perspective we are entering uncharted waters with global debt levels over 250 trillion nearing the end of one of the longest economic expansion cycles in history and the extremely poor labor force demographic trends of slowing growth and ageing these macro economic headwinds will incentivize policy makers to run larger deficits and central banks to print money which should increase the attractiveness of gold the move by the major central banks back to financial repression is just getting started the coming years also appear to have a high level of political and event uncertainty brexit european parliament elections the us presidential election cycle amongst other events could well cause a flight to quality stability mentality benefiting assets like gold and while not a tradeable investable theme the unfortunate reality of terrorism and the prospects of future instability it causes is real in summary the prospects for gold given the macro economic backdrop fiscal and monetary policy outlook flow dynamics reserve managers investments and political event risk dynamics are likeable holding an overweight position of an unlevered asset with limited supply such as gold will offer one of the few safe havens for capital preservation

morning to everybody on the call we certainly appreciate your time and attention at this early hour this morning i will provide some high level comments related to our operations in the first quarter and then for room we ll dig into the segments and related financial details before i come back with a few closing remarks taken as a whole q1 represented a solid quarter and played out pretty much as we anticipated we made good progress with the various operational and productivity initiatives we began implementing in 2018 and the business performed in line with our expectations knowing that we faced exceptionally tough growth comparisons for north america a challenging macroeconomic environment in europe and significant negative headwinds from the year over year impact of scrap and net backs now onto the quarter as noted on slide 4 revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was 3 1 billion a 14 increase over the 2 7 billion recorded in the comparable period of 2018 parts and services organic growth for the first quarter of 2019 was essentially flat year over year on a reported basis but when adjusting for one month selling day in the quarter organic revenue growth for parts and services was 1 3 diluted earnings per share attributable to lkq stockholders for the first quarter of 2019 was 0 31 as compared to 0 49 for the same period of 2018 however the first quarter of 2019 results include 52 million of non cash impairment charges net of tax composed of 40 million related to the company s equity investment in mekonomen and a 12 million charge for net assets held for sale these impairment charges reduced diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2019 by 0 17 a share so on an adjusted basis net income attributable to lkq stockholders was 176 million an increase of 4 as compared to the 170 million for the same period of 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to lkq stockholders for the first quarter of 2019 was 0 56 as compared to 0 55 for the same period last year let me briefly touch on the impairment of net assets held for sale which varun will cover in more detail during his remarks as you are all aware we have on several occasions discussed our four key strategic colors which include growing our customer offering expanding our geographic footprint adapting to changing technologies and rationalizing the asset base with respect to the latter i view the efforts to rationalize the business as an ongoing evaluation of our assets to ensure that we have the right combination of operations for our long term success as you might expect undertaking this evaluation will from time to time identified businesses that no longer represent a strong fit with either our long term strategy or financial return objectives after careful consideration we ve reached a conclusion to sell a few of our operations in the upcoming year while each of the subject businesses has its strength we don t view them as being critical to our core operations these businesses neither individually nor collectively reflects a significant amount of revenue or ebitda the sale of these non core assets will however help improve our overall margins and simplify our operating model with respect to capital allocation during the first quarter of 2019 the company repurchased approximately 2 6 million shares of common stock at an average price per share of 26 66 since initiating our buyback plan in late october of last year we have repurchased 4 9 million shares reflecting a 130 million return of capital to our shareholders let s turn to the quarterly segment highlights as you ll note from slide 7 organic revenue growth for parts and services for our north american segment declined 1 4 in the first quarter of 2019 but was up slightly when adjusting for the one less selling day as anticipated the pgw glass business and the airplane recycling operation exhibited negative same day organic growth while the largest part of our north american segment the automotive salvage and aftermarket parts operations exhibited same day revenue growth of approximately 1 8 importantly organic growth in north america ended on a strong note with the march organic revenue growth showing significant improvement from the levels posted in january and february we continued to perform well in north america especially when you consider that according to ccc collision on liability related auto claims were down 2 6 year over year in the first quarter we continue to believe this outperformance in our growth relative to the ccc data is due to the increase in the number of vehicles in our collision sweet spot that being model years 3 years to 10 years old and auto insurance carriers ongoing efforts to reduce the cost pressures associated with increased cycle time and labor due to the shortage of technicians despite some challenges on the top line including facing a tough comparison from q1 of 2018 our focus on profitable growth helped drive year over year margin improvements in north america with segment gross margins and ebitda margins improving 90 basis points and 20 basis points respectively when compared to the first quarter of 2018 removing the self service business which was impacted the most by the decline in scrap prices gross margins and ebitda margins for the rest of our north american segment were up 170 basis points and 120 basis points respectively varun will address this in more detail but i wanted to highlight that our margin enhancement efforts are indeed working we also continue to grow our parts offerings with aftermarket collision sku offerings and the total number of certified parts available growing 5 8 and a 11 6 respectively year over year in the first quarter moving to the other side of the atlantic our european segment achieved total parts and services revenue growth of 39 primarily driven by the acquisition of stahlgruber organic revenue growth for parts and services in the first quarter of 2019 in europe was 1 3 on a reported basis and 2 1 on a same day basis which was above our expectations given the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds facing europe importantly each of our european platforms witness positive organic revenue growth for parts and services on both a reported and same day basis in the first quarter europe has seen many of its economies slowing as evidenced by lower new vehicle sales and lower or negative gdp growth discussions with our suppliers and other industry participants had confirmed the negative impact the poor economic growth is having on the european marketplace our sense is that the economic conditions have led to an initial deferral of repairs and maintenance while a near term headwind we believe that core automotive maintenance can only be deferred so long and the demand will eventually rebound our u k operation continues to make good progress despite the fact that the market continues to struggle with the uncertainty around brexit which continues to undergo negotiations with a new deadline of october 31st it has been widely reported in the media brexit it s having a negative impact on overall consumer demand in the united kingdom with respect to the automotive parts space most market participants are again reporting low single digit to negative organic revenue growth rate despite the softness in the market ecp performed well by delivering meaningful improvements in both organic revenue growth for parts and services and ebitda margins on a year over year basis the team at ecp continues to make progress with the ongoing optimization of our t2 distribution facility yet there is still more room for an improvement and i am confident we are now have the right team in place to position and optimize the long term performance of our uk business additionally ecp s collision business performed above expectations and above the european segment as a whole we continue to believe ecp s aftermarket collision parts and paints offerings offer an attractive value proposition to u k auto insurance carriers as they confront profitability challenges according to the association of british insurers u k carriers have witnessed pressures similar to the domestic carriers with increased parts cost vehicle complexity and increased cycle times in 2017 and 2018 claims cost reached record highs in the u k unfortunately the positive improvements experienced at ecp were largely offset by the mix impact related to the inclusion of stahlgruber in the q1 2019 results and soft margins relative to the prior year elsewhere in europe particularly in italy and belgium at stahlgruber we are on track with our projected synergies we ve also begun some testing with respect to utilizing sulzbach rosenberg our state of the art national distribution center in southern germany to support the rhiag operations in central and eastern europe we have also begun to expand the utilization of private label products in the stahlgruber s product offering finally during q1 we opened two branches in western europe and in eastern europe we opened five new branches while closing three under performing locations now let s move on to our specialty segment during the first quarter specialty reported total revenue growth of 0 05 ph to 1 with organic revenue growth for parts and services of 1 being offset by a negative impact from currencies adjusting for one less selling day in the quarter specialty had organic revenue growth of 2 6 during the first quarter our specialty team hosted their industry leading trade shows including the rv expo in nashville and the automotive focused big show in dallas with both events witnessing solid year over year increases in supplier and customer attendance as well as show orders the expo s training and education programs continue to be a strong draw as witnessed by the largest attendance ever at the expose rv university moving on to corporate development on april 1st after the close of the first quarter we announced the acquisition of elite electronics this transaction is directly aligned with our strategic pillars of growing our customer offering and adapting to new technologies we have been signaling for some time now that select service offerings could be an excellent complement to our north american parts business elite s mobile and on site technical solutions are provided to automotive collision and mechanical repair facilities that are facing the rapidly expanding requirements related to vehicle diagnostics and calibration elite services include reflashing programming pre and post collision repair diagnostics adas related calibrations airbag replacements theft and vandalism repair and frame replacements the robust service offering assist lkq and elite s customers in completing time consuming and challenging repairs allowing elite to handle any number of these operations improves cycle times and reduces associated repair expenses thereby resulting in better customer experiences we are delighted to have the elite team join lkq and we look forward to adding additional service focused businesses to our suite of customer offerings we will continue to complete tuck in acquisitions and during the first quarter we closed on two small transactions in europe and with that i will now turn the discussion over to varun who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our 2019 guidance varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks nick and good morning to everyone joining us on the call i will take you through our consolidated and segment results for the quarter cover our current liquidity position and discuss our 2019 guidance before turning it back to nick for closing remarks as we have discussed on a past few calls we are focused on delivering profitable growth expanding our margins generating free cash flow and optimizing our capital allocation strategy the first quarter provided evidence of continued progress on these initiatives as we grew our consolidated gross margin by 30 basis points over the prior year produced 124 million in free cash flow paid down 60 million of debt and as nick mentioned repurchase 70 million in lkq stock while maintaining our net leverage ratio while we are pleased with the progress on our initiatives we still have work to do on our segment margins and i ll comment on these drivers behind the quarter over quarter variances in a few minutes diluted eps attributable to lkq stockholders for the first quarter was 0 31 down 0 18 relative to the comparable quarter last year primarily related to a few impairment charges on which i will provide further details adjusted eps which excludes restructuring charges intangible asset amortization acquisition and divestiture related gains and losses impairment charges and the tax benefit associated with stock based compensation was 0 56 reflecting a 2 improvement over the comparable quarter last year i want to highlight a few items that affected quarter over quarter comparability first scrap prices trended down in the first quarter of 2019 with a sequential decrease of 9 whereas the opposite was true in the first quarter of 2018 when scrap prices rose 21 sequentially we benefited by roughly 0 03 in the first quarter a year ago due to the price rise of scrap compared to a negative impact of about 0 01 in q1 2019 resulting in a 0 04 negative swing year over year second the us dollar was stronger in q1 2019 relative to the prior year which created a negative impact from translation and transaction gains and losses of almost a 0 015 taken together scrap prices and currency impacts represented about a 0 05 headwind relative to q1 of 2018 as we disclosed during the fourth quarter call the mekonomen stock price declined significantly between the 1st 31st of december and february 28 we indicated that without a recovery in the stock price by quarter end that we would need to record a further impairment unfortunately there was no rebound and we have booked a 40 million impairment charge for the quarter in the equity earnings line of our income statement the mekonomen share price appears to have stabilized in recent weeks so we are hopeful that the significant impairment charges are behind us as we continue to refine our capital allocation strategy and to simplify the operating model we have undertaken a review of our businesses to identify underperforming assets we identified several businesses that we intend to sell over the course of the next year these units which represent approximately 170 million in annualized revenue and a nominal amount of ebitda are outside of our core business and or geographies under the accounting rules we are required to classify these assets as held for sale on our balance sheet because of our intention to sell the businesses in the near term additionally we had to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets as of quarter end we concluded that the expected recovery would be less than the carrying value and as a result we recorded a 15 million impairment charge which is excluded from our calculation of adjusted diluted eps other than the impairment charge there is no impact on the income statement presentation for these businesses that is the revenue and expenses flow through the same lines as the fall they held for sale of classification and will continue to be presented as such until the sale is completed given the ongoing negotiations related to the potential transactions we know you ll appreciate the need for confidentiality and why we are unable to provide further details currently we will of course provide updates on subsequent calls on a combined basis the mekonomen and the assets held for sale impairment charges reduced our gaap diluted eps by 0 17 now i ll turn to slide 11 and 12 of the presentation for a few points on the consolidated results the consolidated gross margin percentage increased 30 basis points quarter over quarter to 39 with meaningful gains in both our north america and european segments as we ve discussed previously there is a negative mix impact as the lower gross margin european segment makes up a larger percentage of the consolidated results and hence has a dilutive effect on the consolidated margin our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased by 70 basis points quarter over quarter primarily attributable to the north america and european segments which i will discuss a bit later interest expense was up 8 million or 27 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to higher average debt balances primarily related to the stahlgruber financing in april 2018 moving to the income taxes our effective tax rate was 27 1 for the quarter which is roughly in line with our full year estimate i ve already mentioned the mekonomen impairment in the equity earnings line but i also want to point out that the reported fourth quarter 2018 mekonomen earnings decline relative to the prior year therefore our share of their earnings which we pickup in our first quarter reporting was down relative to the prior year by about 2 million after tax moving to the segments while north america on slide 14 gross margin during the first quarter was 44 2 or 90 basis points higher than last year our aftermarket team continues to do really strong work on pricing initiatives to offset the general wage inflation and higher logistics costs prevalent in the u s market while aftermarket is the primary driver of this segment improvement we are also encouraged by progress on margin in our glass product line as a result of pricing initiative and renegotiating underperforming contracts there was a partial offset of our self service operations gross margin which decreased relative to the first quarter of 2018 due to the scrap price impact that i referenced and nick called out the impact in his comments earlier shifting to operating expenses we saw an increase of 100 basis points compared to a year ago the negative leverage effect resulting from quarter over quarter decline in revenue of 28 million drove a significant portion of the decrease having one fewer selling day in q1 of 2019 increased the expense as a percentage of revenue of fixed costs such as facility rental expenses and administrative personnel salaries additionally the decline in other revenue primarily related to lower scrap prices created a negative leverage effect as highest scrap revenue doesn t require additional overhead costs such as commissions and delivery costs that said this segment did incur higher expenses in rent related to expansions and renewals employee benefit cost due to enhancements implemented across the u s business last april and vehicle insurance costs in total segment ebitda for north america during the first quarter of 2019 was 177 million down 1 million compared to a year ago and as a percentage of revenue was up 20 basis points from the prior year quarter sequential changes in scrap prices had an unfavorable impact of 4 million for the quarter compared to a positive impact of 13 million in q1 2018 creating a 17 million year over year negative swing on the surface a 20 basis point improvement in segment ebitda may not sound very impressive but when you factor in the gross margin increase and the scrap price and leverage headwinds the north america team took a solid step toward achieving its margin goals moving to our european segment on slide 16 gross margin in europe was 36 8 in q1 a 90 basis point increase over the comparable period of 2018 our centralized procurement yielded a 50 basis point improvement from supplier rebate programs as we continue to benefit from the synergies created with the stahlgruber acquisition our u k operations contributed a 30 basis point increase with lower distribution costs you recall that we had some challenges in our t2 facility in early 2018 which produce an incremental operating cost that didn t repeat this year with respect to operating expenses we experienced a 60 basis point increase on a consolidated european basis versus the comparable quarter from a year ago relative low sales growth partially attributable to fewer selling days in the quarter had a negative impact on operating leverage given the segment s relatively high fixed cost base especially with regards to personnel partially offsetting we had a 40 basis point decrease primarily due to freight and also facility rental expenses the european segment ebitda totaled 105 million a 39 increase over last year as shown on slide 17 relative to the first quarter of a year ago both the sterling and the euro weakened by 6 and 8 respectively against the dollar causing almost 0 015 negative effect from translation and transaction gains and losses on adjusted eps in the quarter segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue was 7 3 for q1 2019 flat compared to the same period last year compared to a year ago we ve made progress toward integrating stahlgruber and putting t2 back on track however with challenging economic conditions and fewer selling days negatively affecting revenue in q1 we are working actively to manage operating leverage turning to our specialty segment on slide 18 the gross margin percentage declined 160 basis points in q1 relative to the comparable period a year ago of this amount 120 basis points related to higher net product cost as a supplier discounts were lower than realized in the prior year we benefited from higher discounts in the fourth quarter of 2017 that carried over into our first quarter 2018 gross margin the balance related primarily to increase customer incentives due to higher volumes with certain customers operating expenses improved 50 basis points relative to the prior year with reductions in personnel and advertising more than offsetting higher facility expenses related to warehouse expansion projects that went live after the first quarter of 2018 while these projects generated an increase in year over year expenses we believe that the investments were necessary to support the segment s growth and profitability objectives and that the short term margin effect will be mitigated as the warehouses are optimized segment ebitda for specialty was 38 million down about 10 from q1 of 2018 and as a percentage of revenue ebitda margin was down 120 basis points to 10 7 our specialty business has produced solid results in recent years and we believe that the specialty team will be able to make up the shortfall and produce growth in both ebitda dollars and margin percentage for the full year let s move on to capital allocation and the balance sheet as presented on slide 19 you will note that our operating cash flow for the first quarter was 177 million 22 higher than q1 a year ago with the change to our compensation plans our teams are focused on driving working capital improvements though i do need to call out that there will be some ups and downs as we move throughout the year based on the seasonality and timing of certain transactions for example in our stahlgruber operation customer rebates get paid in the month of march which triggered a large outflow in receivables for the quarter that wasn t present a year ago on the other hand we were able to reduce inventory by 72 million and that resulted as the cash inflow for the quarter capex for the quarter was 53 million resulting in free cash flow for the quarter of 124 million and almost 50 improvement relative to a year ago in addition to share repurchases of 70 million in the first quarter we paid down 60 million of debt our strong cash flow generation allows us to delever while at the same time returning capital to our shareholders on january 1 2019 the long awaited lease accounting standard asc 842 went into effect and you can see a large impact on the balance sheet we added about 1 3 billion in assets and a similar amount in liabilities related to operating leases that were off balance sheet under the prior accounting rules there was no material impact on our income statement due to the new accounting standard and on the net leverage ratio covenant under the credit facility was unaffected moving to slide 21 as of the 31st of march we had 316 million of cash resulting in net debt of about 3 9 billion or about 2 9 times last 12 month ebitda now i would like to provide an update on our annual guidance please note that the guidance assumes that scrap prices and foreign exchange rates hold at current levels additionally the guidance continues to assume no material disruptions associated with the united kingdom s potential exit from the european union as nick noted earlier the first quarter came in line with our expectations north america excluding self service performed well and we expect the specialty margin decline to be short lived while we see challenges with european economic conditions holding for the remainder of the year we believe that the business is resilient and that the management team will adapt appropriately to meet the targets therefore we are leaving our 2019 full year guidance unchanged with the exception of our full year forecasted u s gaap income owing to the first quarter activity let me run you through the guidance figures quickly organic parts and services revenue growth remains at 2 to the 4 corridor diluted eps on a gaap basis is updated to a range of 1 87 to 2 accounting for the q1 activity primarily related to the non cash impairment charges i referenced earlier adjusted diluted eps remains unchanged for the year the range remains at 2 34 to 2 46 cash flows from operations continues to reflect a range of 775 million to 850 million and capital spending is unchanged at a range of 250 million to 300 million in summary the first quarter was a solid start to the year and we remain optimistic about our prospects for the balance of the year now i ll turn the call back to nick for closing remarks dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer thank you varun for that financial overview and with that let me reiterate the key initiatives discussed in february that we will continue to focus on during the balance of 2019 first we will integrate and simplify the operating model our management teams will concentrate on leveraging the strength of their respective business units for profitable revenue growth margin improvement and cash conversion and as discussed work on divesting the businesses that don t represent the right long term fit for our organization second we will closely monitor cost and react quicker to changing market conditions we believe that we can adapt to market trends and economic conditions to deliver our full year targets third we will invest in our future through projects like the european erp implementation which continues to move forward and finally we will create even tighter alignment with the key priorities of the company and the expectations of our stockholders through revised compensation programs i am happy to report these programs and targets have been communicated throughout the organization and the teams are actively working toward achieving their respective goals in closing i am very proud of the momentum we have created with our q1 performance and how our team of over 51 000 employees performed amid various operating challenges in both north america and europe importantly i want to recognize how our leaders across each of our segments have embraced our productivity initiatives and the metrics we have implemented as we progressed through 2019 and beyond these factors should continue to create long term value for our stockholders and with that operator we are now ready to open the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of michael hoffman from stifel your line is open michael hoffman your line is open our next question comes from the line of stephanie benjamin from suntrust your line is open stephanie benjamin suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hi good morning i just wanted to get a little bit more color on expectations for european ebitda margin for the remainder of the year flat for the first quarter but what kind of are the drivers to see improvement as we move through the year thanks varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer stephanie good morning it s varun laroyia how are you stephanie benjamin suntrust robinson humphrey analyst doing well thank you varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer excellent listen so in terms of our european margins while we were really pleased with the way our ecp and our u k operations bounce back as nick noted in his opening comments there was some macroeconomic softness which obviously pull down the overall organic growth numbers but in terms of the overall full year number for our european business well clearly q1 was a little disappointing from an operating leverage standpoint we do know that in the remaining nine months the team is actively working toward delivering on their targets there is again a fair bit of the year yet to run and the team is actually proactively working through a series of different initiatives to ensure that they hit their margin targets i think if you re referring back to the broader three year program that we had called out following january 2018 so that full year 2021 we would hit the 10 points of segment ebitda margins that remains unchanged so no change to that program that we had called out for the 36 month period operator our next question comes from the line of bret jordan from jefferies your line is open bret jordan jefferies analyst hey good morning guys dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer good morning bret bret jordan jefferies analyst could you talk about the accounts payable balance maybe as it specifically around the european side of the business how you ve done as far as leveraging payables and then sort of along with that as stahlgruber has entered the mix could you give us some feeling for stahlgruber s accretion maybe in q1 what has added you ve talked about some incremental margin in the purchasing mix but maybe you could talk about it sort of stand alone profitability varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah hey bret good morning it s varun let me the answer the first part for your question and then i think nick will pick up on the second part of your two part question so in terms of payables on an enterprisewide basis they were flat on a year over year basis but you are indeed correct in terms of being able to get a vendor financing program up and running we ve had great discussions and we continue to work toward getting it across the final finishing line so we are excited about that but we do believe that really is where there is a significant amount of upside so no other reason then it is a common set of suppliers that also supplied to the big box folks here in the u s so again discussions are under way we have great financing partners lined up also and we actually anticipate seeing some of that come through in 2019 dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer and bret this is nick good morning as related to the stahlgruber accretion indeed that acquisition added to our earnings per share on a inaudible direct basis it s a few cents pretty much technical difficulty as we ve noted in other conversations not all of the synergies related to stahlgruber will manifest themselves at stahlgruber because some of the procurement really some of those markets get spread overall the different operating units in europe so we re happy with the acquisition and how it s performing operator our next question comes from the line of craig kennison from baird your line is open craig kennison robert w baird analyst good morning thank you for taking my question dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer good morning craig craig kennison robert w baird analyst varun first good morning varun if you could give us the per day organic growth for each segment i m sorry i missed it and then with respect to specialty maybe just add a little color to what happened in the first quarter and what makes you confident that business will recover as the year unfolds thanks varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah hey craig good morning it s varun out here yes and so in terms of on a per day basis for each of our reportable segments as nick mentioned north america was marginally up about 10 basis points on a per day basis europe was up 2 1 on a per day basis and specialty achieved organic revenue growth of 2 6 on a per day basis the key out here really is if you think about some of our businesses that nick also called out and i also refer to in terms of whether it would be our glass business where we focused on margins that certainly pulled us back in terms of overall per day in north america for example and again as nick mentioned if we were to pull out the glass and the airplane recycling business as they both exhibited a negative same day growth the largest part of our north american segment the salvage and the aftermarket piece essentially grew about 1 8 on a per day basis so just wanted to kind of reiterate that s a solid performance across each of our large business segment technical difficulty and with regards to the second part of your question on specialty see yes specialty gross margins were down 160 basis points but about 120 basis points of that s almost three quarters of that related to and this is i m going to ask folks to dive into their memory banks but in the fourth quarter of 2017 where we had a significant investment in overall inventories you will recall apart from the hurricane buying opportunities we had we also invested into our specialty business and some of those opportunistic buying conditions related to getting some pretty attractive discounts from our suppliers those discounts essentially get capitalized and get rolled into 2018 results for the specialty unit which obviously boosted certain margins but at this point of time that obviously has flown through the balance sheet and the income statement and the team is actually technical difficulty continue to hit its numbers so again we are quietly confident about the specialty segment being able to hit its full year targets operator our next question comes from the line of daniel imbro from stephens your line is open daniel imbro stephens analyst hey good morning guys dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer good morning daniel varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning daniel imbro stephens analyst i have a question on north america obviously growth slowed it sounds like to about flat on a same day basis but we still saw margin up year over year as you guys execute on your pricing and discounting program can you talk a little bit about how your customers are responding to those changes i mean are you seeing any push back from them and then related to that have we seen any update on oem pricing here domestically thanks dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer yeah so again we got a little bit of a dichotomy in the north american growth with core business actually as varun just said up about 1 8 on a same day basis so feeling pretty good about that and as i mentioned in my comments march was a lot better than january as well so the near term runs are good we re adjusting our pricing based on the inflationary condition that we re taking with respect to wages and rate and the like we re being very thoughtful as to how we re doing that with our customers it is a very competitive environment out there as you well know we are taking it day by day and really customer by customer all we re trying to do is recover the internal operating costs we re facing and we re running the business on a day in and day out basis like given the beyond full employment condition we have in this country and the impact that has on wages and the like and the second half of your question i know you had two part question i believe okay we ll on to the next next question please operator our next question comes from the line of chris bottiglieri from wolfe research your line is open chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst hi thanks you for taking the question so the question is on the ebit margin improvement ex self service was exceptionally like very strong which is great to see as you assess your non core operations can you talk about your self service business and if you could consider this to be a good business and core to your offering that holding scrap price is steady can you talk about the margin profile and capital intensity relative to the rest of north america thank you dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer yeah so our self service business in north america is clearly the most cyclical because that s where the largest impact that scrap pricing it manifest in times where scrap is rising and we get the benefit of that that obviously include the benefit for the software business in times like what we re seeing right now where scrap has come down materially since the first of the year it s working against us when you take it over kind of a multi year view the self service business is a good performer with good double digit margins and it adds to the overall the overall value of the organization more broadly we are very proud of the north american margin improvement that we have as we indicated a 170 basis points on the top line and 120 basis points improvement at ebitda line when you take out the impact of self service which is really the impact of the scrap on the overall segment we think that is very good it s the really the first time in about five quarters that we ve been able to post up positive year over year growth in ebitda margins in north america and we re looking for the team to continue that momentum as we complete the rest of the year varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer and nick just to add to the comments you mentioned so chris effectively if you look at our north america segment which had an uptick with regards to gross margins by about 90 basis points without the self service business that would have been up a 170 basis points on incremental 80 bps and if you think of it in terms of how that flows all the way through to ebitda margins while we incredibly proud of the fact that the overall segment reported a 20 basis points up as nick mentioned without the self service business it would have been a 120 basis points up so there is 100 point delta 100 basis point delta right there at the ebitda level and i think the final part of your question was about the capital intensity of self service business listen in terms of self service capital intensity it s actually pretty good it actually lowers the overall capital intensity of the business but if you think of the business model for our self service where we have our stores or yards take a pick in terms of what you d like to call them the inventory that we have on offer on the salvage side has to be fresh right once people come and pick their parts out of those vehicles if it s there for more than call it three max four weeks it becomes stale and so that s really when it becomes it gets kind of crushed and kind of again sent to the shredders but effectively from a capital intensity perspective that product moves pretty darn quick so on a capital intensity adjusted basis the returns of that business are pretty good the only issue as you nick also kind of pointed out is the volatility associated with the broader macroeconomic scenario with regards to scrap steel prices that really is what kind of comes through and then from an eps perspective on a year over year basis just to kind of reiterate the reversal on scrap and as we talked about it in our guidance also that hit us for 0 04 on a year over year basis q1 2018 versus q1 2019 so a 0 04 hit effectively on a year over year basis came through operator our next question comes from the line of ryan merkel from william blair your line is open ryan merkel william blair analyst hey guys two questions for me dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer good morning ryan ryan merkel william blair analyst good morning so first in north america can you provide a little bit more color on the aviation and glass headwind is it one off or should it continue and then secondly can you comment on the competitive environment in europe if things are the same or getting a little bit worse dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer sure as it relates to the glass business we taken a very purposeful approach make sure that we can drive good margins there it really had a little bit of an impact on our revenue in the first quarter that s probably going to linger with us as we proceed through 2019 though again that s the business again where the comps get a little bit easier as we get into the back half of the year the aviation business again that it s different from the growth of our business in the it s much fewer transaction of much bigger dollar size per transaction if you will you re not selling a used engine for 800 you re selling used engines probably for hundreds of thousands of dollars and so there is going to be more volatility where our expectation is in the aviation business and again the outlook for the year is the team is looking to hit their inaudible varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer and i think ryan your second part of your of your two part question was competition in europe so let me address that also this in terms of what we ve talked about previously we know there is a general down draft with regards to economic sentiment across europe in any case the fact that they ve been other folks that have public companies that have reported which may have experienced negative growth each of our organic numbers that we have kind of have posted for our european business each of our platforms actually delivered positive year over year organic while it may have been anemic they all came out with positive year over year organic so from that perspective we feel good about it we knew going into q1 versus a year ago our european business a year ago had been impacted by some operational challenges that have been well discussed and articulated so really happy with the way ecp has come through that business as a market leader has continued to deliver and without the operational stumbles is actually delivering on the promise we have we know that business can deliver so on a broader basis listen the competition has always been there do we see any more intensity not really it s always been pretty down intense in any case so from that perspective no major shifts that we see specifically operator our next question comes from the line of scott stember from cl king your line is open scott l stember cl king associates analyst good morning varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning scott scott l stember cl king associates analyst can you maybe frame out a little bit more the europe organic sales situation you did say that you saw that ecp was up nicely i guess compared to the rest of the regions but maybe just give us an idea of how much it was up and maybe just frame that against some of the other regions just give us an idea of the performance in eastern europe thanks dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer yeah scott we don t provide guidance on a country by country basis but what i can tell you is i on a same day basis europe was well north of 2 and that was pretty much in line with ecp and most all of the businesses that we have so no significant kind of deviations obviously stahlgruber was not in the organic numbers since we did it complete that acquisition until may 31st of last year and so they won t really come in to the whole but for a month in q2 then really will fully commence with the organic calculation when we get into q3 of this year but again across the board all of our platforms if you will think about ecp as far rhiag we re all in kind of that kind of low single digit 2 plus range that on a total basis was for the european segment and that compares to ecp last first quarter of last year at a negative organic so that s where the big inaudible came on a year over year basis operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of jason rodgers from great lakes review your line is open jason rodgers great lakes review analyst yes you mentioned you saw a significant improvement in march from january and february i wonder if you could put any numbers around that and perhaps talk a little bit about what you re seeing in april dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer yeah so we don t provide monthly guidance jason but let s just say that march was more consistent with where we had been historically and the january numbers were pretty soft varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and again nick just to add to jason just to kind of confirm what we did mentioned in the opening remarks was specifically the sales intensity in our north americas segment in the first quarter where january and february was slow march has come through very strongly now again a whole host of different anecdotal information of what we do know as a fact is that there was the federal government shutdown in the month of january where 800 000 federal employees were essentially not being paid or essentially not at work and that obviously has an amplification impact also but again as we talked about we didn t talk about margins we specifically talked about north america sales intensity that continue to improve as we ended toward the back end of the quarter dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer yeah and as we talked about last call too right the first two quarters of last year in north america had pretty much modest organic so there is going to be tough comps right we are at i think 6 8 like 7 2 in q1 and q2 organic of 2018 and so again we are going to have another quarter as we head into q2 what we have some pretty high comps and then in the back half of the year obviously get much easier comps on a year over year basis operator and we have no further questions in queue i will turn the call back to nick zarcone for closing remarks dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer well thank you everyone for listening to our first quarter call here we do appreciate your time and attention again we feel very proud of the quarter we delivered we think it puts us in very good standing as we head into the balance of the year again there is nine months to run if you will so there is a lot of runway ahead of us but all in all we re feeling confident about 2019 and we certainly look forward to chatting with everybody in another 90 days when we report our second quarter results thank you very much operator this concludes today s conference call you

ebitda increased year over year by 8 and 11 respectively and we ended the quarter with an undrawn revolver and over 100 million of cash we continue to deliver significant free cash flow across all geographies and reporting segments we recently divested several non core assets and business lines as we continue to narrow strategic focus towards our high performance high value land drilling segment announced asset sales proceeds totaled 77 million and will be used to fund our capex plan allowing us to utilize cash on hand and funds from operations to accelerate our debt repayment initiatives with negligible ebitda impact by the end of may precision will have reduced debt levels by approximately 84 million including us 50 million of announced 2021 notes redemptions and

our outperformance continuing into the second quarter our current active rig count of 80 rigs has remained steady from the end of 2018 despite slightly declining industry activity levels and reflects the success of our super series fleet investments and high performance high value competitive strategy demand for our super series rigs continues to be strong as we are operating at record market share levels and have signed 16 term contracts during the first quarter with 18 signed year to date we will be completing a full scr to ac st 1500 upgrade to be delivered early in the third quarter representing our sixth ac st 1500 walking rig added to our u s fleet over the last twelve months following three new builds and two relocations from canada in the canadian market takeaway capacity constraints and wide differentials experienced by our customers in the fourth quarter resulted in precision s activity declining 33 year over year a trend that will likely carry through into the second quarter in the first quarter of 2019 despite persistent market headwinds our canadian contract drilling well service equipment rentals and camps and catering businesses all generated strong free cash flow contract drilling generated higher year over year normalized margins and our completion and production services segment reported a 126 increase in ebitda although crude prices have improved customers remain vague regarding drilling plans in the second half of 2019 precision will remain focused on factors we can control by leveraging our scale unmatched rig fleet quality and performance and relentless focus on costs to generate continued strong free cash flow in canada in the middle east we are pleased with our expanding presence and strengthened contract book we recently announced three year contract renewals for two of our rigs in the kingdom of saudi arabia with our third active rig contracted into 2022 in kuwait precision signed one year extensions on two rigs that were set to expire mid year and remains on track to deliver our sixth new build rig in july which provides incremental cash flow and leverages our scale in country once delivered we will have nine rigs operating on long term contracts in the middle east and are starting to see reactivation opportunities for idle rigs in the region precision s technology strategy displayed significant progress throughout the first quarter led by increased utilization of our 31 process automated control pac systems currently active in the field in the first quarter we drilled approximately 200 wells utilizing pac an increase of 46 from the prior year we continue to demonstrate to our customers our system s ability to deliver consistent and repeatable high quality results while improving safety performance and operational efficiency additionally we are in the final stages to commercialize several apps which include stick slip mitigation bit preservation and drilling harmonics as an industry

million which is 8 higher than the first quarter of 2018 the increase in revenue is primarily the result of higher activity and average day rates in our u s contract drilling business offset by lower canadian drilling activity compared with the first quarter of 2018 our activity for the quarter as measured by drilling rig utilization days increased by 23 in the u s while canada decreased by 33 and international activity remained consistent revenue from our contract drilling services and completion and production services segments increased 8 and 12 respectively adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures for the quarter was 108 million an increase of 10 million from the previous year our adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue was 25 this quarter compared with 24 in the comparative quarter of 2018 adjusted ebitda this quarter was positively impacted by higher activity and day rates in the u s changes to the recognition of lease related expenses under ifrs 16 and lower share based incentive compensation expense offset by lower canadian drilling activity and restructuring costs of 6 million relating to severance costs as we continued to align our cost structure to reflect reduced canadian activity levels with the adoption of ifrs 16 lease related charges of 3 million in the first quarter of 2019 were recognized through finance charges and depreciation and amortization expense historically these charges were reflected in operating and general and administrative expense total share based incentive compensation expense for the quarter was 9 million compared with 10 million in the first quarter of 2018 see discussion on share based incentive compensation under other items later in this release for additional details operating earnings see non gaap measures this quarter were 62 million compared with 10 million in the first quarter of 2018 operating earnings this quarter were positively impacted by the gain on asset disposals and impairment reversal from the disposition of our mexico drilling equipment and changes to the recognition of lease related expenses under ifrs 16 partially offset by restructuring costs see discussion on asset disposals under other items later in this release for additional details general and administrative expenses this quarter were 31 million 2 million higher than in 2018 the higher general and administrative costs in 2019 were due to the weakening of the canadian dollar on our u s dollar denominated costs net finance charges were 31 million a decrease of 1 million compared with the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to a reduction in interest expense related to the debt retired in 2018 and 2019 offset by the impact of the weakening of the canadian dollar on our u s dollar denominated interest and 1 million of lease accretion charges resulting from the adoption of ifrs 16 on january 1 2019 revenue per utilization day in the u s increased in the first quarter of 2019 to us 23 202 from us 20 603 in the prior year quarter the increase in the u s revenue rate was the result of higher day rates and third party cost recoveries partially offset by lower turnkey revenue during the quarter we had turnkey revenue of us 0 2 million compared with us 7 million in the 2018 comparative period and revenue from idle but contracted rigs of us 0 6 million compared with nil in the prior year comparative period on a sequential basis revenue per utilization day excluding revenue from turnkey and idle but contracted rigs increased by us 1 266 due to higher fleet average day rates and higher third party cost recoveries in canada average revenue per utilization day for contract drilling rigs was 22 977 in the first quarter compared with 22 209 in the first quarter of 2018 average revenue per utilization day increased in 2019 primarily because of higher day rates and rig mix as we had proportionately more super triples working partially offset by fewer shortfall payments received during the quarter we recognized 3 million of shortfall payments in revenue compared with 10 million in the prior year comparative period excluding the impact of shortfall payment revenue average day rates in canada were up 1 589 in the u s operating costs on a per day basis increased to us 14 368 in the first quarter of 2019 compared with us 14 026 in 2018 the increase was primarily due to higher third party charges and repair and maintenance costs offset by lower costs from turnkey activity on a sequential basis operating costs per day decreased by 756 compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 due to lower turnkey activity in the current period average operating costs per utilization day for drilling rigs in canada increased to 14 455 compared with the prior year quarter of 13 331 the increase in average costs was due to higher labour expenses due to larger crew formations rig mix as we had proportionately more super triples working and overhead costs spread over a lower number of drilling rig utilization days partially offset by lower maintenance cost due to timing of certifications on a sequential basis operating costs per day decreased by 660 due to lower use of large crew configurations compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 we realized revenue from international contract drilling of us 36 million in the first quarter of 2019 in line with the prior year period average revenue per utilization day in our international contract drilling business was us 49 940 consistent with the comparable prior year quarter during the quarter we signed three year contract renewals for two rigs in saudi arabia one year extensions for two kuwait rigs and sold our mexico based drilling assets for proceeds of us 48 million resulting in a gain on sale of us 24 million and a us 4 million impairment reversal directional drilling services realized revenue of 10 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared with 9 million in the prior year period funds provided by operations see non gaap measures in the first quarter of 2019 were 96 million a decrease of 8 million from the prior year comparative quarter of 104 million the decrease was primarily the result of the timing of 20 million of cash interest payments as we did not have a first quarter interest payment on our senior notes due 2026 in 2018 partially offset by improved operating results capital expenditures were 71 million in the first quarter an increase of 41 million over the same period in 2018 capital spending for the quarter included 66 million for upgrade and expansion capital primarily related to our sixth new build rig for kuwait and a u s new build rig under long term contract and 5 million for the maintenance of existing assets infrastructure spending and intangibles strategy precision s strategic priorities for 2019 are as follows generate strong free cash flow and utilize 100 million to 150 million to reduce debt in 2019 in the first quarter of 2019 we generated 96 million of funds provided by operations see non gaap measures and 58 million of cash proceeds from the divestiture of non core assets with a further 19 million of cash proceeds expected to be received in the second quarter utilizing our cash on hand and free cash flow generated in 2019 we reduced our debt balance by us 13 million through open market repurchases of a portion of our 2024 and 2026 unsecured senior notes and on april 16 2019 redeemed us 30 million principal amount of our 2021 senior notes as of april 24 our total 2019 debt reduction totaled us 43 million subsequent to the first quarter we initiated the redemption of us 20 million principal amount of our 6 50 senior notes due 2021 the redemption payment will be made on may 20 2019 maximize financial results by leveraging our high performance high value super series rig fleet and scale with disciplined cost management in 2019 precision continued to generate strong financial results largely lead by our u s contract drilling business we are currently operating at record market share levels in this region as first quarter utilization days were up 23 and operating margins revenue less operating costs were up 2 257 per day compared with the prior year in canada our unmatched fleet quality and flexible business model led to an increase in operating margins excluding shortfall payments of 465 per day compared with the prior year our continued business improvement initiatives contributed to 6 million in adjusted ebitda growth for our completion and production segment from the prior year in the first quarter of 2019 we continued to invest in our high performance high value super series rig fleet with the building of our sixth kuwait rig which is expected to commence drilling in the third quarter of 2019 and generate operational economies of scale and strengthen our operating margins in the region additionally we will begin converting one of our u s scr triple rigs to a full ac st 1500 in 2019 full scale commercialization and implementation of our process automation control platform pd apps and pd analytics we currently have 31 rigs equipped with our process automation control platform pac using pac technology we drilled

industry s active rigs and 59 of the canadian industry s active rigs were drilling for oil targets compared with 81 for the u s and 64 for canada at the same time last year industry conditions we expect tier 1 rigs to remain the preferred rigs of customers globally the economic value created by the significant drilling and mobility efficiencies delivered by the most advanced xy pad walking rigs has been highlighted and widely accepted by our customers the trend to longer reach horizontal completions and importance of the rig delivering these complex wells consistently and efficiently has been well established by the industry we expect demand for leading edge high efficiency tier 1 rigs will continue to strengthen as drilling rig capability has been a key economic facilitator of horizontal unconventional resource exploitation development and field application of drilling equipment process automation coupled with closed loop drilling controls and de manning of rigs will continue this technical evolution while creating further cost efficiencies and performance value for customers capital spending capital spending in 2019 is expected to be 169 million and includes 54

revenue per operating hour in the quarter was 758 or 58 higher than the first quarter of 2018 the increase was primarily the result of increased costs passed through to the customer during the first

once activity levels improve these rigs are expected to return to work with minimal start up costs adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures was higher than the first quarter of 2019 primarily because of higher camp activity higher average rates and improved cost structure slightly offset by lower well servicing and rental activity operating costs as a percentage of revenue was 77 compared with the

work and continued cost control depreciation expense in the quarter was 17 lower than the prior year comparative period the decrease in depreciation expense was primarily due to a lower capital asset

period that the participant becomes entitled to payment the recorded liability is re established at the end of each reporting period until settlement with the resultant change to fair value of the liability recognized in net earnings loss for the period we also have two equity settled share based incentive plans under the executive performance share executive psu plan the fair value of psus granted is calculated at the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation and black scholes option pricing model and that value is recorded as compensation expense over the grant s vesting period with an offset to contributed surplus upon redemption of the executive psus into common shares the associated amount is reclassified from contributed surplus to shareholders capital the share option plan is treated similarly whereby the fair value of the share purchased options granted are valued using the black scholes option pricing model and consideration paid by employees upon exercise of the

executive psu share based incentive compensation expense for the quarter was 2 million compared with 1 million in the same quarter in 2018 the increased compensation expense was the result of additional executive psus granted in 2019 offset partially by lower fair values for the 2019 grants finance charges net finance charges were 31 million a decrease of 1 million compared with the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to a reduction in interest expense related to the debt retired in 2018 and 2019 partially offset by the impact of the weakening of the canadian dollar on our u s dollar

comparative information was not restated as a result the comparability of our 2019 adjusted ebitda to periods prior to january 1 2019 is impacted under ifrs 16 leases classified as operating leases were recognized on our statement of financial position with a right of use asset and corresponding lease obligation representing the present value of precision s future lease payments once recognized right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter of their useful life and the term of the lease the lease obligation is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method under this approach an interest charge is applied to accrete the lease obligation to the present value of future lease payments as lease payments are made the lease obligation is reduced historically operating leases were accounted for as off balance sheet and lease expenses were only recognized at the time of payment in either operating or general and administrative expense however under ifrs 16 lease

associated press investors are dumping argentina bonds now that it looks even more certain that the man who brought the international monetary fund back to buenos aires is six months away from losing the presidency mauricio macri is in the biggest crisis of his tenure the market has spoken and they do not like what they are seeing macri is close to becoming a zombie president unless inflation now over 51 on a rolling 12 month basis drops dramatically a decline of 10 basis points won t cut it a recent poll by synopsis in buenos aires showed respondents listing inflation as the biggest problem facing the economy some 44 6 said inflation was their biggest economic concern followed by 19 2 who said unemployment some investors have called it argentina s macrisis on thursday it looked like that crisis has spurred a panic attack with investors fearing defaults and selling out of argentinian debt credit default swap rates are showing investors are forecasting a higher risk of default in argentina it is now not that far off from levels reached in the run up to cristina s 2014 default bloomberg argentina s peso fell 2 3 and is now at 44 95 to the dollar today if this keeps up it s going to 50 by august the global x argentina argt exchange traded fund was down 2 25 starting to chip away at the fund s gains on the year over the last four weeks since some polls have shown macri losing to cristina kirchner the fund is down 8 98 the peso shed another 6 55 over the same period kirchner is largely considered the one who got argentina into this mess macri inherited a quasi communist economy held up by sticks and duct tape funded by government subsidies price controls and other social programs her economy survived on a black market currency rate that differed from the central bank rate and dollar based businesses like tourism export commodities and real estate with his election outlook deteriorating by the minute macri announced peronist style price controls on some 60 items last week one week later after digesting what s been happening in buenos aires investors decided to take some money off the table in hopes that macri and his economic team can get their act together if they do speculators who are buying on the declines will be greatly rewarded odds are not in their favor at this point see argentina s president macri is a peronista now forbes berlin bourse looked at from the top down argentina looks scary says sara moreno managing director and co fund manager at jennison associates in boston it s unfortunate there is a lot of potential in argentina and the consumer class is so big they should be in a much better place she says mimicking what nearly every argentine has said since the turn of the century when nestor kirchner cristina s husband took over and defaulted on around 82 billion argentina owes the imf 56 billion it is the fund s biggest ever aid package it s hard to know if cristina wins if she would pay that debt or not says roberto simon senior director for policy at as coa in new york the market reaction today may be overdone but if cristina maintains her lead come august september markets will look worse than they do today elections are in october other opinion polls like the well respected pollster elypsis still show macri neck and neck with cristina but like inflation falling just 10 basis points not being enough to turn things around for him neither are 50 50 odds that s a nail biter with the lead top contender having defaulted just four and a half years ago i think they will default again says luis maizel senior managing director of lm capital group a 4 5 billion wealth management firm in san diego associated press there is a real and growing risk that the president proves unable to break the ongoing vicious cycle of currency depreciation high inflation and increased political risk his package of emergency anti inflation measures announced last week might help temporarily but producers of those items will hold back production if they know they are not getting paid as much as they were just a few weeks ago macri needs better than good economic data he needs stellar economic data the only way he gets it is from the agribusiness sector that could help him in the best case scenario that he is in a tie with cristina later in the campaign cycle consumer sentiment in the farm belt states which sell goods in dollars might be in good enough shape to squeak out a win for macri if he cannot rein in inflation macri s reelection bid is at risk says fiona mackie latin america regional director for the economist intelligence unit associated press moreover there is a chance that u s financial support and the imminent inflow of dollars from this year s bumper harvest will keep the peso from tanking people have been saying this since january however and the peso has only gotten weaker much like macri s presidency nieves zuberbuhler a freelance journalist who has done work for 60 minutes in argentina left the country this year she considers herself one of the lucky ones her sense of frustration and disappointment in argentina is obvious i was super hopeful after cristina kirchner left but it was a very tough year to live there it s a country where nothing works she says i love my country and it makes me sad that so many people there feel helpless governments keep promising that things will get better but in the meantime the people suffer a lot if moderate peronists can rally around former economy minister roberto lavagna whom markets view favorably enough instead of cristina then there is a chance that the bloodletting in argentine assets will stop every day cristina gains on macri weakness means another basis point off everything tradable in argentina

was mr hewson said they appear to have ignored the pickup in retail sales that we saw last month while the jobs market still looks fairly robust and wages are rising he added if the data continue to pick up in terms of how the consumer behaves we could well see this dovish bias get tempered we also shouldn t forget the u s dollar is on a tear at the moment and this is amplifying the effect a slowdown in u s data could temper canadian dollar downside some in the markets believe the next move by the central bank will be a cut which is why the loonie is suffering and capital economics for one thinks the market is still underestimating over all we think that the economy could fare a bit better in the near term than the bank expects said stephen brown the group s senior canada economist but that doesn t change our view that persistently below potential gdp growth this year will cause the bank to cut interest rates three times starting in the third quarter he added with investors expecting just one rate cut that suggests the loonie could face further downward pressure david watt chief economist at hsbc canada also expects a rate cut but not until the second half of 2020 meanwhile the bank views the current slowdown as a detour and expects above potential gdp growth to return mr watt said this informs governor poloz s statement that rates are more likely to rise than to fall if the bank s forecast is right our forecast incorporates a lengthy period of below potential gdp growth that eventually prompts a rate cut with headwinds proving more persistent read more

as a percent of risk weighted assets was 14 38 at march 31 2019 compared to 13 41 at march 31 2018 and 14 20 at december 31 2018 the company s tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio1 was 11 04 at march 31 2019 compared to 9 94 at march 31 2018 and 10 63 at december 31 2018 1 non gaap financial measure see reconciliation of non gaap financial measures findlay added the strength of our balance sheet is demonstrated by our strong capital position we are pleased to continue our history of double digit dividend increases for our shareholders the dividend increase is the outcome of consistent long term growth in earnings and its positive impact to our capital base over the last five years we have increased our dividend by 21 annually on a compound annual growth basis average total loans for the first quarter of 2019 were 3 92 billion an increase of 126 1 million or 3 versus 3 79 billion for the first quarter 2018 on a linked quarter basis total average loans grew 12 5 million from 3 91 billion at december 31 2018 total loans outstanding grew 93 3 million or 2 from 3 85 billion as of march 31 2018 to 3 94 billion as of march 31 2019 average total deposits were 4 09 billion for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 total deposits grew 47 9 million or 1 from 4 10 billion as of march 31 2018 to 4 15 billion as of march 31 2019 in addition total core deposits which exclude brokered deposits increased 128 8 million or 3 from 3 88 billion at march 31 2018 to 4 01 billion at march 31 2019 due to growth in commercial deposits of 238 1 million or 25 offset by decreases in public fund deposits of 80 0 million or 6 and decreases in retail deposits of 29 3 million or 2 findlay noted we are pleased with the growth momentum reflected in the increase in commercial deposits we are particularly pleased that the total number of commercial noninterest bearing checking accounts have increased by 11 over a two year period this increase in accounts has been accompanied by a 23 increase in balances over the same timeframe the company s net interest margin increased nine basis points to 3 45 for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 3 36 for the first quarter of 2018 the higher margin in the first quarter of 2019 was due to higher yields on loans partially offset by a higher cost of funds driven by the federal reserve bank increasing the target federal funds rate in march june september and december of 2018 linked quarter net interest margin declined by seven basis points due to an increase of five basis points in earning asset yields and an offsetting increase in cost of funds of twelve basis points the net interest margin was 3 52 for the linked fourth quarter of 2018 and was positively impacted by four basis points due to the payoff of a nonaccrual loan and other nonaccrual loan adjustments thus the net interest margin run rate for the fourth quarter excluding those adjustments was 3 48 as a result net interest margin in the first quarter declined by three basis points when compared to the fourth quarter core run rate net interest margin earning asset yields were negatively impacted by a decline in investment security yields during the first quarter 2019 due to the combined effect of the flattening yield curve and the corresponding increase in the fair value of the investment securities portfolio as well as the impact of the adoption of the fasb accounting standard update which amended the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium the decline in investment security portfolio yields reduced net interest margin by two basis points during the quarter in addition loan yields were elevated by four basis points in the fourth quarter of 2018 as previously noted on a linked fourth quarter basis cost of funds increased by twelve basis points versus a thirteen basis point increase in the prior third linked quarter of 2018 with the widening expectation that the federal reserve may be in a holding pattern with respect to future rates changes we have taken steps to maintain our net interest margin deposit rates have remained generally unchanged during the quarter in our markets and we believe that our net interest margin will be stable moving into the second quarter commented findlay the company recorded a provision for loan losses of 1 2 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 3 3 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 300 000 in the linked fourth quarter of 2018 the lower provision in the first quarter of 2019 was primarily due to lower net charge offs compared to the first quarter of 2018 net charge offs in the first quarter of 2019 were 91 000 versus net charge offs of 4 8 million in the first quarter of 2018 and net charge offs of 189

decrease in nonaccrual loans on a linked quarter basis nonperforming assets were 604 000 or 8 lower than the 7 6 million reported as of december 31 2018 the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets at march 31 2019 decreased to 0 14 from 0 24 at march 31 2018 and 0 16 at december 31 2018 loan loss reserve to total loans increased to 1 26 as of march 31 2019 as compared with 1 19 as of

quarter of 2018 noninterest income was positively impacted by an 18 increase over the prior year first quarter in recurring fee income for service charges on deposit accounts primarily due to growth in treasury management fees from business accounts in addition loan and service fees increased 10 and wealth advisory fees increased by 8 compared to the first quarter 2018 due to continued growth of client relationships noninterest income increased by 1 4 million or 14 on a linked quarter basis to 11 5 million due to increases in bank owned life insurance income swap fees generated from commercial lending transactions and improvement in mortgage banking income the company s noninterest expense increased 1 3 million or 6 to 22 5 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 21 2 million in the first quarter of 2018 and decreased by 79 000 on a linked quarter basis salaries and employee benefits increased on a year over year basis primarily due to higher employee health

talking points boj monetary policy us japan trade talks trade wars taro aso steven mnuchin meeting in washington on thursday both representatives will be discussing future trade relations will the boj s monetary policy be a point of conflict in the talks see our free guide to learn how to use economic news in your trading strategy the bank of japan boj will be paying unusually close attention to trade talks between japanese finance minister taro aso and us treasury secretary steven mnuchin aso will be arriving in washington on thursday to discuss trade relations to avoid entering into an economic spat with the us currency manipulation is widely anticipated to be discussed and may be point of concern that puts both powers at odds with each other for thirty years japanese policymakers have struggled to maintain inflation consistently above the central bank s two percent target the boj has launched several policy measures aimed at boosting inflationary pressure the titles of which grew to grammatically monstrous lengths the current program is called quantitative and qualitative easing with negative interest rates and yield curve control consequently the stimulative measures have resulted in a weaker japanese yen and this is where the cross roads between us trade policy and japanese monetary policy may come into conflict mnuchin has stated that in any trade deal reached with japan that there be a provision put in place to inhibit currency manipulation the idea being to avoid a situation where one country keeps a currency weak in an effort to boost exports the white house is looking to close the gap on the us trade deficit with japan and has leveraged threats of auto tariffs a similar tactic used against germany this is part of the white house s broader campaign of redesigning 21st century global trade relations with an aim at reducing the us s trade deficit on all trading fronts including china and europe following the talks between aso and mnuchin on friday there will be a summit held at the white house between japanese prime minister shinzo abe and president donald trump the trade negotiations between the two representatives may then set the stage for higher level negotiations between the two leaders for trump these trade talks have multi dimensional consequences a factor that may complicate the negotiations is the uss unilateral decision to end all iranian oil importing waivers to countries that were previously clients japan has dramatically reduced its consumption of oil coming out of iran the cooperation may be used as leverage in trade talks showing that tokyo has already made concessions to the white house s oil policy toward iran on the one hand with the 2020 election coming up proclaiming victory in trade deals would surely be a feather in his cap and would reinforce his image as a master dealmaker if he reaches an agreement with china this might then reinforce his method of employing tariff techniques in achieving trade deals this could then put the japanese economy and global financial markets at risk of another trade related headwind in the event of a us japan trade war the japanese yen and us dollar may rise as a result of increased demand for haven assets at the expense of sentiment linked assets these would include the australian and new zealand dollars nordic and emerging market assets as well as other currencies that are tied to export driven economies that rely on global demand aud usd nzd usd emerging markets etf sek usd daily chart height of the us china trade war in 2018 note swedish krona us dollar crosses are conventionally quoted as usd sek conversely with the global economy showing greater weakness and financial vulnerability another trade war may weigh on growth and hurt his constituents that are reliant on healthy global demand for us goods trump will have to tip toe this line carefully and global markets will be waiting with baited breath to see how or if tariff man will strike again fx trading resources written by dimitri zabelin jr currency analyst for dailyfx com to contact dimitri use the comments section below or zabelindimitri on twitter

emerging market currencies the role of global risk the us dollar and domestic forces prepared by massimo ferrari published as part of the ecb economic bulletin issue 3 2019 exchange rate movements against the us dollar are an important factor shaping the outlook in emerging market economies as a large share of their credit trade and debt is priced in dollars abrupt swings in emerging market exchange rates are typically linked to capital outflows tighter financing conditions and heightened financial instability the drivers of those movements are however difficult to disentangle as global and domestic forces jointly determine the relative strengths of these currencies this box presents a methodology for separating out the four main drivers of emerging market exchange rate swings spillovers from us shocks global risk appetite interest rate effects and idiosyncratic domestic shocks it uses the methodology to analyse the factors behind the sharp depreciation and subsequent recovery of emerging market currencies over the course of 2018 chart a evolution of emerging market economies net capital inflows and exchange rates left hand scale usd billions right hand scale index 1 january 2018 100 sources ecb institute of international finance jp morgan and ecb calculations notes the emerging market exchange rate index is the jp morgan nominal effective exchange rate for emerging markets which is a weighted average of emerging markets exchange rates the latest observation is for 31 december 2018 between january and august 2018 emerging market currencies depreciated markedly emerging market currencies experienced a sharp sell off over the first eight months of 2018 coupled with capital outflows and rising financial market volatility see chart a the composite index of the nominal effective exchange rates of emerging market currencies fell by 3 6 between january and august of that year while bilateral exchange rates against the us dollar reacted much more strongly weakening in some cases by more than 20 the abrupt financial market swings in some countries have posed a threat to financial stability with potential spillovers to advanced economies large currency depreciations also increase funding costs for emerging market economies whose financial systems typically raise liquidity in us dollars lowering economic growth prospects interest rate differentials alone do not explain exchange rate movements the theoretical concept of uncovered interest rate parity postulates that interest rate differentials determine exchange rate movements it states that developments in the difference in interest rates between two countries should determine the change in the bilateral exchange rate with the high yielding currency depreciating vis à vis the low yielding currency in practice however a large part of exchange rate movements is not explained by interest rate differentials and is often attributed to changes in the risk premium the risk premium correlates with various economic forces which are not well captured by short term interest rate differentials including for example measures of investors risk appetite or market volatility interest rate differentials indeed explain very little of the changes in emerging market exchange rates against the us dollar in 2018 see chart b chart b contribution of interest rate differentials and other factors to exchange rate movements against the us dollar percentage points sources haver analytics board of governors of the federal reserve system global financial data and ecb calculations notes the blue bars show contributions of interest rate differentials to the change in the bilateral exchange rates against the us dollar expressed as us dollars per unit of local currency from january to august 2018 contributions are computed from a regression of daily changes in the bilateral exchange rate on interest rate differentials between the country in question and the united states the interest rate used is the short term money market rate the component other factors is the residual of this regression the latest observation is for 31 august 2018 a better understanding of the drivers of currency movements is provided by a model which augments the standard interest rate regression with measures of global risk appetite and us factors beyond interest rates there are two main forces behind emerging market currency movements changes in global risk appetite and the spillovers from developments in the united states global risk appetite affects currencies because a higher risk appetite among market participants tends to lead to inflows of capital into emerging markets which results in an appreciation of their exchange rates the unique position of the us dollar in the international monetary system also plays an important role when the us dollar is strong which happens in periods of positive economic growth momentum and high interest rates in the us economy capital tends to flow from emerging markets to the united states and emerging market currencies depreciate this is a channel through which us shocks spread to emerging market economies verdelhan 2018 provides a simple framework to assess the relative significance of each of the two forces for movements in emerging market currencies the standard model in which exchange rate changes are related to interest rate differentials is augmented by two components one which can be called a dollar factor aims to identify the effect of developments in the united states on emerging market currencies it is added by inserting a component into the regression which measures the average change in emerging market exchange rates against the us dollar since a purely us based shock might be expected to have a similar effect on all us dollar bilateral exchange rates looking at changes that are common to a number of such exchange rates should reveal shocks that are specific to the us dollar the second component accounts for risk driven movements in emerging market currencies which do not stem directly from us shocks and is generally labelled in the literature as the carry factor it is defined as the difference between exchange rate changes of high yielding currencies and those of low yielding currencies when investors engage in carry trades i e sell assets in low yielding currencies to buy assets in high yielding currencies they become exposed to global risks through the exchange rate this is because high interest rate currencies tend to depreciate during periods of economic downturn or adverse risk sentiment therefore when global risk rises the difference in exchange rate returns between the two portfolios widens mechanically making this component highly correlated with global risk adding these two variables to the baseline model significantly increases the share of variation in emerging market currencies that can be explained the residual element that is not explained by these global or us factors reflects country specific developments it may include developments not entirely captured by short term money market rates such as domestic political instability changes in expectations of the future path of the domestic economy or market sentiment towards the currency this model suggests that the sell off during the first eight months of 2018 was mainly driven by spillovers from the united states and rising global risk aversion see chart c in the period to august 2018 the decomposition highlights two main forces behind the depreciation of emerging market currencies against the us dollar spillovers from us shocks and global risk this is in line with the tightening of financial conditions in emerging markets and rising us yields observed over the same period notable outliers are turkey and argentina where domestic political tensions are likely to have been the main drivers of exchange rate developments the model also shows that domestic monetary policies aimed at increasing interest rate differentials vis à vis the united states were largely unable to cushion the effects of the global and us factors driving currencies downwards chart c contributions to the depreciation and recovery of emerging market currencies against the us dollar percentage points sources haver analytics board of governors of the federal reserve system global financial data and ecb calculations notes the bars show contributions to variance based on a regression of changes in the exchange rates against the us dollar expressed as us dollars per unit of local currency on interest rate differentials the dollar factor and the carry factor at daily frequency the interest rate used is the short term money market rate the latest observation is for 1 march 2019 the subsequent recovery on the other hand appears to have been driven mainly by domestic policy reactions in emerging market countries and positive idiosyncratic developments see chart c the decomposition shows that global risk has continued to put downward pressure on emerging market currencies however the role of the us dollar factor has been more limited since august 2018 suggesting that developments in the united states have not generated additional spillovers to emerging market currencies since then on the other hand country specific factors have tended to bolster emerging market currencies suggesting that domestic conditions have become somewhat more positive and growth prospects have improved in emerging economies since the financial market turmoil during the summer of 2018

president trump and president xi originally set a deadline of 90 days to finish their trade deal that would have been march 31 in spite of missing that deadline negotiators have made serious progress and they now have a new de facto deadline treasury secretary steven mnuchin said just days ago that the parties are getting close to the final round of concluding issues in the china talks u s trade representative robert lighthizer and mnuchin are scheduled to travel to beijing the last days of april chinese vice premier liu he is set to be in washington the first full week in may if a deal could be reached in early may that would allow a couple of weeks of text wrap up and legal finalizing before a signing summit the end of may or early june mnuchin added that both sides have agreed on real enforcement on both sides that includes detailed enforcement offices with serious budgets he also confirmed that agreement had been reached on preventing currency manipulation similar to the one in the usmca in early april china agreed to another purchase of soybeans some 800 000 metric tons and agreed to more closely monitor and limit exporting of fentanyl the former move likely being a negotiating sweetener and the latter in response to a u s request related trade at different stages with china and japan part 2 one of the most difficult issues left to settle involves china s subsidies for certain companies and industries a practice quite ingrained in the country s economy how and when the u s tariffs on chinese imports will be removed is another sticky area china wants them removed right away and the u s wants to use at least some of them to ensure china implements what it has promised they seem to be flexible on the latest round of tariffs 10 tariffs on 200 billion worth of goods but the administration wants to retain the initial 25 tariffs on 50 billion worth of goods as leverage the u s tarriffs on 250 billion worth of goods is roughly half of all chinese imports into the u s china has imposed tariffs on 110 billion worth of goods exported from the u s to china about 90 of the total negotiators have reported that the currency provisions agreed upon utilize the transparency of activities that move currencies china has traditionally not reported currency market activity or foreign exchange reserves information penalties for violations are supposedly part of the deal including tariffs the currency provisions are meant to prevent a country from manipulating its currency to favor exports over imports which can end up negating the impact of a trade deal pact hems beijing currency moves wall street journal 04 13 14 19 the wsj story for the first time we ve seen quoted fred bergsten as indicating the u s china pact could be structured as an executive agreement rather than a free trade agreement that would mean the deal wouldn t have to be submitted to congress for ratification bergsten is co founder of the respected peterson institute for international economics and a former senior treasury official in mid march chinese hastily added provisions to a foreign investment bill regulating technology transfers or theft of intellectual property the bill was later passed barring officials from leaking corporate secrets and provide for criminal prosecution for violations foreign companies often have to appear before conformity assessment committees where most of the mining of useful information was gathered and then passed on to competing chinese companies however several experts said the new law is really re stating current policy the china law blog warns that this law does not address the real problem china s layers of government regulation requiring businesses to buy only products manufactured in china china s new foreign investment law and forced technology transfer same as it ever was china law blog 03 21 19 factors affecting china s negotiating headroom include things like its giant debt its coal fired power grid the chinese appetite for pork and its need to salve the feelings of countries feeling the burden of debt for loans from china under the one belt one road project chinese officials have scaled back their estimates on the country s growth this year to around 6 from the nearer 6 5 pace indicated earlier to keep growth from slowing too quickly the government is using more deficit spending tax cuts and easier credit policies china s total debt including companies central and local governments and households neared 250 of gdp by year end 2018 beijing s stimulus push faces limits wall street journal 03 18 19 most of china s debt growth comes from state owned companies and finance firms controlled by various levels of government the governments often use the money for projects that are politically appealing but not always commercially viable the story explained that means when the u s demands that china phase out state owned firms the government has the necessary power to do so but faces possible political fallout if they do china must decide how to manage a coal industry that supplies some 60 of electricity but is testing citizens patience with pollution the power sector is 1 3 trillion in debt and not generating much more profit than interest payments then there s asf how much of a negotiation incentive the african swine fever asf situation will put on the chinese is hard to forecast china s national bureau of statistics was reporting the pig count down nearly 40 million roughly 9 6 the end of march at 375 million a two decade low the u s reported the chinese had made the largest pork purchase in two years in march interestingly china s ministry of agriculture said pig stocks were down 19 over a year earlier more than the bureau of statistics

earlier today and as normal we are planning to file our 10 q in the next few days and with that i am happy to turn the call over to our ceo nick zarcone dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer thank you joe and good morning to everybody on the call we certainly appreciate your time and attention at this early hour this morning i will provide some high level comments related to our operations in the first quarter and then for room we ll dig into the segments and related financial details before i come back with a few closing remarks taken as a whole q1 represented a solid quarter and played out pretty much as we anticipated we made good progress with the various operational and productivity initiatives we began implementing in 2018 and the business performed in line with our expectations knowing that we faced exceptionally tough growth comparisons for north america a challenging macroeconomic environment in europe and significant negative headwinds from the year over year impact of scrap and net backs now onto the quarter as noted on slide 4 revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was 3 1 billion a 14 increase over the 2 7 billion recorded in the comparable period of 2018 parts and services organic growth for the first quarter of 2019 was essentially flat year over year on a reported basis but when adjusting for one month selling day in the quarter organic revenue growth for parts and services was 1 3 diluted earnings per share attributable to lkq stockholders for the first quarter of 2019 was 0 31 as compared to 0 49 for the same period of 2018 however the first quarter of 2019 results include 52 million of non cash impairment charges net of tax composed of 40 million related to the company s equity investment in mekonomen and a 12 million charge for net assets held for sale these impairment charges reduced diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2019 by 0 17 a share so on an adjusted basis net income attributable to lkq stockholders was 176 million an increase of 4 as compared to the 170 million for the same period of 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to lkq stockholders for the first quarter of 2019 was 0 56 as compared to 0 55 for the same period last year let me briefly touch on the impairment of net assets held for sale which varun will cover in more detail during his remarks as you are all aware we have on several occasions discussed our four key strategic colors which include growing our customer offering expanding our geographic footprint adapting to changing technologies and rationalizing the asset base with respect to the latter i view the efforts to rationalize the business as an ongoing evaluation of our assets to ensure that we have the right combination of operations for our long term success as you might expect undertaking this evaluation will from time to time identified businesses that no longer represent a strong fit with either our long term strategy or financial return objectives after careful consideration we ve reached a conclusion to sell a few of our operations in the upcoming year while each of the subject businesses has its strength we don t view them as being critical to our core operations these businesses neither individually nor collectively reflects a significant amount of revenue or ebitda the sale of these non core assets will however help improve our overall margins and simplify our operating model with respect to capital allocation during the first quarter of 2019 the company repurchased approximately 2 6 million shares of common stock at an average price per share of 26 66 since initiating our buyback plan in late october of last year we have repurchased 4 9 million shares reflecting a 130 million return of capital to our shareholders let s turn to the quarterly segment highlights as you ll note from slide 7 organic revenue growth for parts and services for our north american segment declined 1 4 in the first quarter of 2019 but was up slightly when adjusting for the one less selling day as anticipated the pgw glass business and the airplane recycling operation exhibited negative same day organic growth while the largest part of our north american segment the automotive salvage and aftermarket parts operations exhibited same day revenue growth of approximately 1 8 importantly organic growth in north america ended on a strong note with the march organic revenue growth showing significant improvement from the levels posted in january and february we continued to perform well in north america especially when you consider that according to ccc collision on liability related auto claims were down 2 6 year over year in the first quarter we continue to believe this outperformance in our growth relative to the ccc data is due to the increase in the number of vehicles in our collision sweet spot that being model years 3 years to 10 years old and auto insurance carriers ongoing efforts to reduce the cost pressures associated with increased cycle time and labor due to the shortage of technicians despite some challenges on the top line including facing a tough comparison from q1 of 2018 our focus on profitable growth helped drive year over year margin improvements in north america with segment gross margins and ebitda margins improving 90 basis points and 20 basis points respectively when compared to the first quarter of 2018 removing the self service business which was impacted the most by the decline in scrap prices gross margins and ebitda margins for the rest of our north american segment were up 170 basis points and 120 basis points respectively varun will address this in more detail but i wanted to highlight that our margin enhancement efforts are indeed working we also continue to grow our parts offerings with aftermarket collision sku offerings and the total number of certified parts available growing 5 8 and a 11 6 respectively year over year in the first quarter moving to the other side of the atlantic our european segment achieved total parts and services revenue growth of 39 primarily driven by the acquisition of stahlgruber organic revenue growth for parts and services in the first quarter of 2019 in europe was 1 3 on a reported basis and 2 1 on a same day basis which was above our expectations given the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds facing europe importantly each of our european platforms witness positive organic revenue growth for parts and services on both a reported and same day basis in the first quarter europe has seen many of its economies slowing as evidenced by lower new vehicle sales and lower or negative gdp growth discussions with our suppliers and other industry participants had confirmed the negative impact the poor economic growth is having on the european marketplace our sense is that the economic conditions have led to an initial deferral of repairs and maintenance while a near term headwind we believe that core automotive maintenance can only be deferred so long and the demand will eventually rebound our u k operation continues to make good progress despite the fact that the market continues to struggle with the uncertainty around brexit which continues to undergo negotiations with a new deadline of october 31st it has been widely reported in the media brexit it s having a negative impact on overall consumer demand in the united kingdom with respect to the automotive parts space most market participants are again reporting low single digit to negative organic revenue growth rate despite the softness in the market ecp performed well by delivering meaningful improvements in both organic revenue growth for parts and services and ebitda margins on a year over year basis the team at ecp continues to make progress with the ongoing optimization of our t2 distribution facility yet there is still more room for an improvement and i am confident we are now have the right team in place to position and optimize the long term performance of our uk business additionally ecp s collision business performed above expectations and above the european segment as a whole we continue to believe ecp s aftermarket collision parts and paints offerings offer an attractive value proposition to u k auto insurance carriers as they confront profitability challenges according to the association of british insurers u k carriers have witnessed pressures similar to the domestic carriers with increased parts cost vehicle complexity and increased cycle times in 2017 and 2018 claims cost reached record highs in the u k unfortunately the positive improvements experienced at ecp were largely offset by the mix impact related to the inclusion of stahlgruber in the q1 2019 results and soft margins relative to the prior year elsewhere in europe particularly in italy and belgium at stahlgruber we are on track with our projected synergies we ve also begun some testing with respect to utilizing sulzbach rosenberg our state of the art national distribution center in southern germany to support the rhiag operations in central and eastern europe we have also begun to expand the utilization of private label products in the stahlgruber s product offering finally during q1 we opened two branches in western europe and in eastern europe we opened five new branches while closing three under performing locations now let s move on to our specialty segment during the first quarter specialty reported total revenue growth of 0 05 ph to 1 with organic revenue growth for parts and services of 1 being offset by a negative impact from currencies adjusting for one less selling day in the quarter specialty had organic revenue growth of 2 6 during the first quarter our specialty team hosted their industry leading trade shows including the rv expo in nashville and the automotive focused big show in dallas with both events witnessing solid year over year increases in supplier and customer attendance as well as show orders the expo s training and education programs continue to be a strong draw as witnessed by the largest attendance ever at the expose rv university moving on to corporate development on april 1st after the close of the first quarter we announced the acquisition of elite electronics this transaction is directly aligned with our strategic pillars of growing our customer offering and adapting to new technologies we have been signaling for some time now that select service offerings could be an excellent complement to our north american parts business elite s mobile and on site technical solutions are provided to automotive collision and mechanical repair facilities that are facing the rapidly expanding requirements related to vehicle diagnostics and calibration elite services include reflashing programming pre and post collision repair diagnostics adas related calibrations airbag replacements theft and vandalism repair and frame replacements the robust service offering assist lkq and elite s customers in completing time consuming and challenging repairs allowing elite to handle any number of these operations improves cycle times and reduces associated repair expenses thereby resulting in better customer experiences we are delighted to have the elite team join lkq and we look forward to adding additional service focused businesses to our suite of customer offerings we will continue to complete tuck in acquisitions and during the first quarter we closed on two small transactions in europe and with that i will now turn the discussion over to varun who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our 2019 guidance varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks nick and good morning to everyone joining us on the call i will take you through our consolidated and segment results for the quarter cover our current liquidity position and discuss our 2019 guidance before turning it back to nick for closing remarks as we have discussed on a past few calls we are focused on delivering profitable growth expanding our margins generating free cash flow and optimizing our capital allocation strategy the first quarter provided evidence of continued progress on these initiatives as we grew our consolidated gross margin by 30 basis points over the prior year produced 124 million in free cash flow paid down 60 million of debt and as nick mentioned repurchase 70 million in lkq stock while maintaining our net leverage ratio while we are pleased with the progress on our initiatives we still have work to do on our segment margins and i ll comment on these drivers behind the quarter over quarter variances in a few minutes diluted eps attributable to lkq stockholders for the first quarter was 0 31 down 0 18 relative to the comparable quarter last year primarily related to a few impairment charges on which i will provide further details adjusted eps which excludes restructuring charges intangible asset amortization acquisition and divestiture related gains and losses impairment charges and the tax benefit associated with stock based compensation was 0 56 reflecting a 2 improvement over the comparable quarter last year i want to highlight a few items that affected quarter over quarter comparability first scrap prices trended down in the first quarter of 2019 with a sequential decrease of 9 whereas the opposite was true in the first quarter of 2018 when scrap prices rose 21 sequentially we benefited by roughly 0 03 in the first quarter a year ago due to the price rise of scrap compared to a negative impact of about 0 01 in q1 2019 resulting in a 0 04 negative swing year over year second the us dollar was stronger in q1 2019 relative to the prior year which created a negative impact from translation and transaction gains and losses of almost a 0 015 taken together scrap prices and currency impacts represented about a 0 05 headwind relative to q1 of 2018 as we disclosed during the fourth quarter call the mekonomen stock price declined significantly between the 1st 31st of december and february 28 we indicated that without a recovery in the stock price by quarter end that we would need to record a further impairment unfortunately there was no rebound and we have booked a 40 million impairment charge for the quarter in the equity earnings line of our income statement the mekonomen share price appears to have stabilized in recent weeks so we are hopeful that the significant impairment charges are behind us as we continue to refine our capital allocation strategy and to simplify the operating model we have undertaken a review of our businesses to identify underperforming assets we identified several businesses that we intend to sell over the course of the next year these units which represent approximately 170 million in annualized revenue and a nominal amount of ebitda are outside of our core business and or geographies under the accounting rules we are required to classify these assets as held for sale on our balance sheet because of our intention to sell the businesses in the near term additionally we had to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets as of quarter end we concluded that the expected recovery would be less than the carrying value and as a result we recorded a 15 million impairment charge which is excluded from our calculation of adjusted diluted eps other than the impairment charge there is no impact on the income statement presentation for these businesses that is the revenue and expenses flow through the same lines as the fall they held for sale of classification and will continue to be presented as such until the sale is completed given the ongoing negotiations related to the potential transactions we know you ll appreciate the need for confidentiality and why we are unable to provide further details currently we will of course provide updates on subsequent calls on a combined basis the mekonomen and the assets held for sale impairment charges reduced our gaap diluted eps by 0 17 now i ll turn to slide 11 and 12 of the presentation for a few points on the consolidated results the consolidated gross margin percentage increased 30 basis points quarter over quarter to 39 with meaningful gains in both our north america and european segments as we ve discussed previously there is a negative mix impact as the lower gross margin european segment makes up a larger percentage of the consolidated results and hence has a dilutive effect on the consolidated margin our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased by 70 basis points quarter over quarter primarily attributable to the north america and european segments which i will discuss a bit later interest expense was up 8 million or 27 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to higher average debt balances primarily related to the stahlgruber financing in april 2018 moving to the income taxes our effective tax rate was 27 1 for the quarter which is roughly in line with our full year estimate i ve already mentioned the mekonomen impairment in the equity earnings line but i also want to point out that the reported fourth quarter 2018 mekonomen earnings decline relative to the prior year therefore our share of their earnings which we pickup in our first quarter reporting was down relative to the prior year by about 2 million after tax moving to the segments while north america on slide 14 gross margin during the first quarter was 44 2 or 90 basis points higher than last year our aftermarket team continues to do really strong work on pricing initiatives to offset the general wage inflation and higher logistics costs prevalent in the u s market while aftermarket is the primary driver of this segment improvement we are also encouraged by progress on margin in our glass product line as a result of pricing initiative and renegotiating underperforming contracts there was a partial offset of our self service operations gross margin which decreased relative to the first quarter of 2018 due to the scrap price impact that i referenced and nick called out the impact in his comments earlier shifting to operating expenses we saw an increase of 100 basis points compared to a year ago the negative leverage effect resulting from quarter over quarter decline in revenue of 28 million drove a significant portion of the decrease having one fewer selling day in q1 of 2019 increased the expense as a percentage of revenue of fixed costs such as facility rental expenses and administrative personnel salaries additionally the decline in other revenue primarily related to lower scrap prices created a negative leverage effect as highest scrap revenue doesn t require additional overhead costs such as commissions and delivery costs that said this segment did incur higher expenses in rent related to expansions and renewals employee benefit cost due to enhancements implemented across the u s business last april and vehicle insurance costs in total segment ebitda for north america during the first quarter of 2019 was 177 million down 1 million compared to a year ago and as a percentage of revenue was up 20 basis points from the prior year quarter sequential changes in scrap prices had an unfavorable impact of 4 million for the quarter compared to a positive impact of 13 million in q1 2018 creating a 17 million year over year negative swing on the surface a 20 basis point improvement in segment ebitda may not sound very impressive but when you factor in the gross margin increase and the scrap price and leverage headwinds the north america team took a solid step toward achieving its margin goals moving to our european segment on slide 16 gross margin in europe was 36 8 in q1 a 90 basis point increase over the comparable period of 2018 our centralized procurement yielded a 50 basis point improvement from supplier rebate programs as we continue to benefit from the synergies created with the stahlgruber acquisition our u k operations contributed a 30 basis point increase with lower distribution costs you recall that we had some challenges in our t2 facility in early 2018 which produce an incremental operating cost that didn t repeat this year with respect to operating expenses we experienced a 60 basis point increase on a consolidated european basis versus the comparable quarter from a year ago relative low sales growth partially attributable to fewer selling days in the quarter had a negative impact on operating leverage given the segment s relatively high fixed cost base especially with regards to personnel partially offsetting we had a 40 basis point decrease primarily due to freight and also facility rental expenses the european segment ebitda totaled 105 million a 39 increase over last year as shown on slide 17 relative to the first quarter of a year ago both the sterling and the euro weakened by 6 and 8 respectively against the dollar causing almost 0 015 negative effect from translation and transaction gains and losses on adjusted eps in the quarter segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue was 7 3 for q1 2019 flat compared to the same period last year compared to a year ago we ve made progress toward integrating stahlgruber and putting t2 back on track however with challenging economic conditions and fewer selling days negatively affecting revenue in q1 we are working actively to manage operating leverage turning to our specialty segment on slide 18 the gross margin percentage declined 160 basis points in q1 relative to the comparable period a year ago of this amount 120 basis points related to higher net product cost as a supplier discounts were lower than realized in the prior year we benefited from higher discounts in the fourth quarter of 2017 that carried over into our first quarter 2018 gross margin the balance related primarily to increase customer incentives due to higher volumes with certain customers operating expenses improved 50 basis points relative to the prior year with reductions in personnel and advertising more than offsetting higher facility expenses related to warehouse expansion projects that went live after the first quarter of 2018 while these projects generated an increase in year over year expenses we believe that the investments were necessary to support the segment s growth and profitability objectives and that the short term margin effect will be mitigated as the warehouses are optimized segment ebitda for specialty was 38 million down about 10 from q1 of 2018 and as a percentage of revenue ebitda margin was down 120 basis points to 10 7 our specialty business has produced solid results in recent years and we believe that the specialty team will be able to make up the shortfall and produce growth in both ebitda dollars and margin percentage for the full year let s move on to capital allocation and the balance sheet as presented on slide 19 you will note that our operating cash flow for the first quarter was 177 million 22 higher than q1 a year ago with the change to our compensation plans our teams are focused on driving working capital improvements though i do need to call out that there will be some ups and downs as we move throughout the year based on the seasonality and timing of certain transactions for example in our stahlgruber operation customer rebates get paid in the month of march which triggered a large outflow in receivables for the quarter that wasn t present a year ago on the other hand we were able to reduce inventory by 72 million and that resulted as the cash inflow for the quarter capex for the quarter was 53 million resulting in free cash flow for the quarter of 124 million and almost 50 improvement relative to a year ago in addition to share repurchases of 70 million in the first quarter we paid down 60 million of debt our strong cash flow generation allows us to delever while at the same time returning capital to our shareholders on january 1 2019 the long awaited lease accounting standard asc 842 went into effect and you can see a large impact on the balance sheet we added about 1 3 billion in assets and a similar amount in liabilities related to operating leases that were off balance sheet under the prior accounting rules there was no material impact on our income statement due to the new accounting standard and on the net leverage ratio covenant under the credit facility was unaffected moving to slide 21 as of the 31st of march we had 316 million of cash resulting in net debt of about 3 9 billion or about 2 9 times last 12 month ebitda now i would like to provide an update on our annual guidance please note that the guidance assumes that scrap prices and foreign exchange rates hold at current levels additionally the guidance continues to assume no material disruptions associated with the united kingdom s potential exit from the european union as nick noted earlier the first quarter came in line with our expectations north america excluding self service performed well and we expect the specialty margin decline to be short lived while we see challenges with european economic conditions holding for the remainder of the year we believe that the business is resilient and that the management team will adapt appropriately to meet the targets therefore we are leaving our 2019 full year guidance unchanged with the exception of our full year forecasted u s gaap income owing to the first quarter activity let me run you through the guidance figures quickly organic parts and services revenue growth remains at 2 to the 4 corridor diluted eps on a gaap basis is updated to a range of 1 87 to 2 accounting for the q1 activity primarily related to the non cash impairment charges i referenced earlier adjusted diluted eps remains unchanged for the year the range remains at 2 34 to 2 46 cash flows from operations continues to reflect a range of 775 million to 850 million and capital spending is unchanged at a range of 250 million to 300 million in summary the first quarter was a solid start to the year and we remain optimistic about our prospects for the balance of the year now i ll turn the call back to nick for closing remarks dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer thank you varun for that financial overview and with that let me reiterate the key initiatives discussed in february that we will continue to focus on during the balance of 2019 first we will integrate and simplify the operating model our management teams will concentrate on leveraging the strength of their respective business units for profitable revenue growth margin improvement and cash conversion and as discussed work on divesting the businesses that don t represent the right long term fit for our organization second we will closely monitor cost and react quicker to changing market conditions we believe that we can adapt to market trends and economic conditions to deliver our full year targets third we will invest in our future through projects like the european erp implementation which continues to move forward and finally we will create even tighter alignment with the key priorities of the company and the expectations of our stockholders through revised compensation programs i am happy to report these programs and targets have been communicated throughout the organization and the teams are actively working toward achieving their respective goals in closing i am very proud of the momentum we have created with our q1 performance and how our team of over 51 000 employees performed amid various operating challenges in both north america and europe importantly i want to recognize how our leaders across each of our segments have embraced our productivity initiatives and the metrics we have implemented as we progressed through 2019 and beyond these factors should continue to create long term value for our stockholders and with that operator we are now ready to open the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of michael hoffman from stifel your line is open michael hoffman your line is open our next question comes from the line of stephanie benjamin from suntrust your line is open stephanie benjamin suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hi good morning i just wanted to get a little bit more color on expectations for european ebitda margin for the remainder of the year flat for the first quarter but what kind of are the drivers to see improvement as we move through the year thanks varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer stephanie good morning it s varun laroyia how are you stephanie benjamin suntrust robinson humphrey analyst doing well thank you varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer excellent listen so in terms of our european margins while we were really pleased with the way our ecp and our u k operations bounce back as nick noted in his opening comments there was some macroeconomic softness which obviously pull down the overall organic growth numbers but in terms of the overall full year number for our european business well clearly q1 was a little disappointing from an operating leverage standpoint we do know that in the remaining nine months the team is actively working toward delivering on their targets there is again a fair bit of the year yet to run and the team is actually proactively working through a series of different initiatives to ensure that they hit their margin targets i think if you re referring back to the broader three year program that we had called out following january 2018 so that full year 2021 we would hit the 10 points of segment ebitda margins that remains unchanged so no change to that program that we had called out for the 36 month period operator our next question comes from the line of bret jordan from jefferies your line is open bret jordan jefferies analyst hey good morning guys dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer good morning bret bret jordan jefferies analyst could you talk about the accounts payable balance maybe as it specifically around the european side of the business how you ve done as far as leveraging payables and then sort of along with that as stahlgruber has entered the mix could you give us some feeling for stahlgruber s accretion maybe in q1 what has added you ve talked about some incremental margin in the purchasing mix but maybe you could talk about it sort of stand alone profitability varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah hey bret good morning it s varun let me the answer the first part for your question and then i think nick will pick up on the second part of your two part question so in terms of payables on an enterprisewide basis they were flat on a year over year basis but you are indeed correct in terms of being able to get a vendor financing program up and running we ve had great discussions and we continue to work toward getting it across the final finishing line so we are excited about that but we do believe that really is where there is a significant amount of upside so no other reason then it is a common set of suppliers that also supplied to the big box folks here in the u s so again discussions are under way we have great financing partners lined up also and we actually anticipate seeing some of that come through in 2019 dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer and bret this is nick good morning as related to the stahlgruber accretion indeed that acquisition added to our earnings per share on a inaudible direct basis it s a few cents pretty much technical difficulty as we ve noted in other conversations not all of the synergies related to stahlgruber will manifest themselves at stahlgruber because some of the procurement really some of those markets get spread overall the different operating units in europe so we re happy with the acquisition and how it s performing operator our next question comes from the line of craig kennison from baird your line is open craig kennison robert w baird analyst good morning thank you for taking my question dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer good morning craig craig kennison robert w baird analyst varun first good morning varun if you could give us the per day organic growth for each segment i m sorry i missed it and then with respect to specialty maybe just add a little color to what happened in the first quarter and what makes you confident that business will recover as the year unfolds thanks varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah hey craig good morning it s varun out here yes and so in terms of on a per day basis for each of our reportable segments as nick mentioned north america was marginally up about 10 basis points on a per day basis europe was up 2 1 on a per day basis and specialty achieved organic revenue growth of 2 6 on a per day basis the key out here really is if you think about some of our businesses that nick also called out and i also refer to in terms of whether it would be our glass business where we focused on margins that certainly pulled us back in terms of overall per day in north america for example and again as nick mentioned if we were to pull out the glass and the airplane recycling business as they both exhibited a negative same day growth the largest part of our north american segment the salvage and the aftermarket piece essentially grew about 1 8 on a per day basis so just wanted to kind of reiterate that s a solid performance across each of our large business segment technical difficulty and with regards to the second part of your question on specialty see yes specialty gross margins were down 160 basis points but about 120 basis points of that s almost three quarters of that related to and this is i m going to ask folks to dive into their memory banks but in the fourth quarter of 2017 where we had a significant investment in overall inventories you will recall apart from the hurricane buying opportunities we had we also invested into our specialty business and some of those opportunistic buying conditions related to getting some pretty attractive discounts from our suppliers those discounts essentially get capitalized and get rolled into 2018 results for the specialty unit which obviously boosted certain margins but at this point of time that obviously has flown through the balance sheet and the income statement and the team is actually technical difficulty continue to hit its numbers so again we are quietly confident about the specialty segment being able to hit its full year targets operator our next question comes from the line of daniel imbro from stephens your line is open daniel imbro stephens analyst hey good morning guys dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer good morning daniel varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning daniel imbro stephens analyst i have a question on north america obviously growth slowed it sounds like to about flat on a same day basis but we still saw margin up year over year as you guys execute on your pricing and discounting program can you talk a little bit about how your customers are responding to those changes i mean are you seeing any push back from them and then related to that have we seen any update on oem pricing here domestically thanks dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer yeah so again we got a little bit of a dichotomy in the north american growth with core business actually as varun just said up about 1 8 on a same day basis so feeling pretty good about that and as i mentioned in my comments march was a lot better than january as well so the near term runs are good we re adjusting our pricing based on the inflationary condition that we re taking with respect to wages and rate and the like we re being very thoughtful as to how we re doing that with our customers it is a very competitive environment out there as you well know we are taking it day by day and really customer by customer all we re trying to do is recover the internal operating costs we re facing and we re running the business on a day in and day out basis like given the beyond full employment condition we have in this country and the impact that has on wages and the like and the second half of your question i know you had two part question i believe okay we ll on to the next next question please operator our next question comes from the line of chris bottiglieri from wolfe research your line is open chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst hi thanks you for taking the question so the question is on the ebit margin improvement ex self service was exceptionally like very strong which is great to see as you assess your non core operations can you talk about your self service business and if you could consider this to be a good business and core to your offering that holding scrap price is steady can you talk about the margin profile and capital intensity relative to the rest of north america thank you dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer yeah so our self service business in north america is clearly the most cyclical because that s where the largest impact that scrap pricing it manifest in times where scrap is rising and we get the benefit of that that obviously include the benefit for the software business in times like what we re seeing right now where scrap has come down materially since the first of the year it s working against us when you take it over kind of a multi year view the self service business is a good performer with good double digit margins and it adds to the overall the overall value of the organization more broadly we are very proud of the north american margin improvement that we have as we indicated a 170 basis points on the top line and 120 basis points improvement at ebitda line when you take out the impact of self service which is really the impact of the scrap on the overall segment we think that is very good it s the really the first time in about five quarters that we ve been able to post up positive year over year growth in ebitda margins in north america and we re looking for the team to continue that momentum as we complete the rest of the year varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer and nick just to add to the comments you mentioned so chris effectively if you look at our north america segment which had an uptick with regards to gross margins by about 90 basis points without the self service business that would have been up a 170 basis points on incremental 80 bps and if you think of it in terms of how that flows all the way through to ebitda margins while we incredibly proud of the fact that the overall segment reported a 20 basis points up as nick mentioned without the self service business it would have been a 120 basis points up so there is 100 point delta 100 basis point delta right there at the ebitda level and i think the final part of your question was about the capital intensity of self service business listen in terms of self service capital intensity it s actually pretty good it actually lowers the overall capital intensity of the business but if you think of the business model for our self service where we have our stores or yards take a pick in terms of what you d like to call them the inventory that we have on offer on the salvage side has to be fresh right once people come and pick their parts out of those vehicles if it s there for more than call it three max four weeks it becomes stale and so that s really when it becomes it gets kind of crushed and kind of again sent to the shredders but effectively from a capital intensity perspective that product moves pretty darn quick so on a capital intensity adjusted basis the returns of that business are pretty good the only issue as you nick also kind of pointed out is the volatility associated with the broader macroeconomic scenario with regards to scrap steel prices that really is what kind of comes through and then from an eps perspective on a year over year basis just to kind of reiterate the reversal on scrap and as we talked about it in our guidance also that hit us for 0 04 on a year over year basis q1 2018 versus q1 2019 so a 0 04 hit effectively on a year over year basis came through operator our next question comes from the line of ryan merkel from william blair your line is open ryan merkel william blair analyst hey guys two questions for me dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer good morning ryan ryan merkel william blair analyst good morning so first in north america can you provide a little bit more color on the aviation and glass headwind is it one off or should it continue and then secondly can you comment on the competitive environment in europe if things are the same or getting a little bit worse dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer sure as it relates to the glass business we taken a very purposeful approach make sure that we can drive good margins there it really had a little bit of an impact on our revenue in the first quarter that s probably going to linger with us as we proceed through 2019 though again that s the business again where the comps get a little bit easier as we get into the back half of the year the aviation business again that it s different from the growth of our business in the it s much fewer transaction of much bigger dollar size per transaction if you will you re not selling a used engine for 800 you re selling used engines probably for hundreds of thousands of dollars and so there is going to be more volatility where our expectation is in the aviation business and again the outlook for the year is the team is looking to hit their inaudible varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer and i think ryan your second part of your of your two part question was competition in europe so let me address that also this in terms of what we ve talked about previously we know there is a general down draft with regards to economic sentiment across europe in any case the fact that they ve been other folks that have public companies that have reported which may have experienced negative growth each of our organic numbers that we have kind of have posted for our european business each of our platforms actually delivered positive year over year organic while it may have been anemic they all came out with positive year over year organic so from that perspective we feel good about it we knew going into q1 versus a year ago our european business a year ago had been impacted by some operational challenges that have been well discussed and articulated so really happy with the way ecp has come through that business as a market leader has continued to deliver and without the operational stumbles is actually delivering on the promise we have we know that business can deliver so on a broader basis listen the competition has always been there do we see any more intensity not really it s always been pretty down intense in any case so from that perspective no major shifts that we see specifically operator our next question comes from the line of scott stember from cl king your line is open scott l stember cl king associates analyst good morning varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning scott scott l stember cl king associates analyst can you maybe frame out a little bit more the europe organic sales situation you did say that you saw that ecp was up nicely i guess compared to the rest of the regions but maybe just give us an idea of how much it was up and maybe just frame that against some of the other regions just give us an idea of the performance in eastern europe thanks dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer yeah scott we don t provide guidance on a country by country basis but what i can tell you is i on a same day basis europe was well north of 2 and that was pretty much in line with ecp and most all of the businesses that we have so no significant kind of deviations obviously stahlgruber was not in the organic numbers since we did it complete that acquisition until may 31st of last year and so they won t really come in to the whole but for a month in q2 then really will fully commence with the organic calculation when we get into q3 of this year but again across the board all of our platforms if you will think about ecp as far rhiag we re all in kind of that kind of low single digit 2 plus range that on a total basis was for the european segment and that compares to ecp last first quarter of last year at a negative organic so that s where the big inaudible came on a year over year basis operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of jason rodgers from great lakes review your line is open jason rodgers great lakes review analyst yes you mentioned you saw a significant improvement in march from january and february i wonder if you could put any numbers around that and perhaps talk a little bit about what you re seeing in april dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer yeah so we don t provide monthly guidance jason but let s just say that march was more consistent with where we had been historically and the january numbers were pretty soft varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and again nick just to add to jason just to kind of confirm what we did mentioned in the opening remarks was specifically the sales intensity in our north americas segment in the first quarter where january and february was slow march has come through very strongly now again a whole host of different anecdotal information of what we do know as a fact is that there was the federal government shutdown in the month of january where 800 000 federal employees were essentially not being paid or essentially not at work and that obviously has an amplification impact also but again as we talked about we didn t talk about margins we specifically talked about north america sales intensity that continue to improve as we ended toward the back end of the quarter dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer yeah and as we talked about last call too right the first two quarters of last year in north america had pretty much modest organic so there is going to be tough comps right we are at i think 6 8 like 7 2 in q1 and q2 organic of 2018 and so again we are going to have another quarter as we head into q2 what we have some pretty high comps and then in the back half of the year obviously get much easier comps on a year over year basis operator and we have no further questions in queue i will turn the call back to nick zarcone for closing remarks dominick zarcone president and chief executive officer well thank you everyone for listening to our first quarter call here we do appreciate your time and attention again we feel very proud of the quarter we delivered we think it puts us in very good standing as we head into the balance of the year again there is nine months to run if you will so there is a lot of runway ahead of us but all in all we re feeling confident about 2019 and we certainly look forward to chatting with everybody in another 90 days when we report our second quarter results thank you very much operator this concludes today s conference call you

ebitda increased year over year by 8 and 11 respectively and we ended the quarter with an undrawn revolver and over 100 million of cash we continue to deliver significant free cash flow across all geographies and reporting segments we recently divested several non core assets and business lines as we continue to narrow strategic focus towards our high performance high value land drilling segment announced asset sales proceeds totaled 77 million and will be used to fund our capex plan allowing us to utilize cash on hand and funds from operations to accelerate our debt repayment initiatives with negligible ebitda impact by the end of may precision will have reduced debt levels by approximately 84 million including us 50 million of announced 2021 notes redemptions and completed open market repurchases of us 13 million of later maturity debt we are confident in our ability to meet or exceed the high end of our targeted annual debt reduction range of 100 million to 150 million and our longer term range of 400 million to 600 million by the end of 2021 in the u s our activity for the quarter increased 23 from the prior year compared with 8 for the industry with our outperformance continuing into the second quarter our current active rig count of 80 rigs has remained steady from the end of 2018 despite slightly declining industry activity levels and reflects the success of our super series fleet investments and high performance high value competitive strategy demand for our super series rigs continues to be strong as we are operating at record market share levels and have signed 16 term contracts during the first quarter with 18 signed year to date we will be completing a full scr to ac st 1500 upgrade to be delivered early in the third quarter representing our sixth ac st 1500 walking rig added to our u s fleet over the last twelve months following three new builds and two relocations from canada in the canadian market takeaway capacity constraints and wide differentials experienced by our customers in the fourth quarter resulted in precision s activity declining 33 year over year a trend that will likely carry through into the second quarter in the first quarter of 2019 despite persistent market headwinds our canadian contract drilling well service equipment rentals and camps and catering businesses all generated strong free cash flow contract drilling generated higher year over year normalized margins and our completion and production services segment reported a 126 increase in ebitda although crude prices have improved customers remain vague regarding drilling plans in the second half of 2019 precision will remain focused on factors we can control by leveraging our scale unmatched rig fleet quality and performance and relentless focus on costs to generate continued strong free cash flow in canada in the middle east we are pleased with our expanding presence and strengthened contract book we recently announced three year contract renewals for two of our rigs in the kingdom of saudi arabia with our third active rig contracted into 2022 in kuwait precision signed one year extensions on two rigs that were set to expire mid year and remains on track to deliver our sixth new build rig in july which provides incremental cash flow and leverages our scale in country once delivered we will have nine rigs operating on long term contracts in the middle east and are starting to see reactivation opportunities for idle rigs in the region precision s technology strategy displayed significant progress throughout the first quarter led by increased utilization of our 31 process automated control pac systems currently active in the field in the first quarter we drilled approximately 200 wells utilizing pac an increase of 46 from the prior year we continue to demonstrate to our customers our system s ability to deliver consistent and repeatable high quality results while improving safety performance and operational efficiency additionally we are in the final stages to commercialize several apps which include stick slip mitigation bit preservation and drilling harmonics as an industry leader integrating automation technologies with drilling equipment we continue to promote our digital culture and pd analytics with our people processes and systems to deliver value to our customers

million which is 8 higher than the first quarter of 2018 the increase in revenue is primarily the result of higher activity and average day rates in our u s contract drilling business offset by lower canadian drilling activity compared with the first quarter of 2018 our activity for the quarter as measured by drilling rig utilization days increased by 23 in the u s while canada decreased by 33 and international activity remained consistent revenue from our contract drilling services and completion and production services segments increased 8 and 12 respectively adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures for the quarter was 108 million an increase of 10 million from the previous year our adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue was 25 this quarter compared with 24 in the comparative quarter of 2018 adjusted ebitda this quarter was positively impacted by higher activity and day rates in the u s changes to the recognition of lease related expenses under ifrs 16 and lower share based incentive compensation expense offset by lower canadian drilling activity and restructuring costs of 6 million relating to severance costs as we continued to align our cost structure to reflect reduced canadian activity levels with the adoption of ifrs 16 lease related charges of 3 million in the first quarter of 2019 were recognized through finance charges and depreciation and amortization expense historically these charges were reflected in operating and general and administrative expense total share based incentive compensation expense for the quarter was 9 million compared with 10 million in the first quarter of 2018 see discussion on share based incentive compensation under other items later in this release for additional details operating earnings see non gaap measures this quarter were 62 million compared with 10 million in the first quarter of 2018 operating earnings this quarter were positively impacted by the gain on asset disposals and impairment reversal from the disposition of our mexico drilling equipment and changes to the recognition of lease related expenses under ifrs 16 partially offset by restructuring costs see discussion on asset disposals under other items later in this release for additional details general and administrative expenses this quarter were 31 million 2 million higher than in 2018 the higher general and administrative costs in 2019 were due to the weakening of the canadian dollar on our u s dollar denominated costs net finance charges were 31 million a decrease of 1 million compared with the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to a reduction in interest expense related to the debt retired in 2018 and 2019 offset by the impact of the weakening of the canadian dollar on our u s dollar denominated interest and 1 million of lease accretion charges resulting from the adoption of ifrs 16 on january 1 2019 revenue per utilization day in the u s increased in the first quarter of 2019 to us 23 202 from us 20 603 in the prior year quarter the increase in the u s revenue rate was the result of higher day rates and third party cost recoveries partially offset by lower turnkey revenue during the quarter we had turnkey revenue of us 0 2 million compared with us 7 million in the 2018 comparative period and revenue from idle but contracted rigs of us 0 6 million compared with nil in the prior year comparative period on a sequential basis revenue per utilization day excluding revenue from turnkey and idle but contracted rigs increased by us 1 266 due to higher fleet average day rates and higher third party cost recoveries in canada average revenue per utilization day for contract drilling rigs was 22 977 in the first quarter compared with 22 209 in the first quarter of 2018 average revenue per utilization day increased in 2019 primarily because of higher day rates and rig mix as we had proportionately more super triples working partially offset by fewer shortfall payments received during the quarter we recognized 3 million of shortfall payments in revenue compared with 10 million in the prior year comparative period excluding the impact of shortfall payment revenue average day rates in canada were up 1 589 in the u s operating costs on a per day basis increased to us 14 368 in the first quarter of 2019 compared with us 14 026 in 2018 the increase was primarily due to higher third party charges and repair and maintenance costs offset by lower costs from turnkey activity on a sequential basis operating costs per day decreased by 756 compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 due to lower turnkey activity in the current period average operating costs per utilization day for drilling rigs in canada increased to 14 455 compared with the prior year quarter of 13 331 the increase in average costs was due to higher labour expenses due to larger crew formations rig mix as we had proportionately more super triples working and overhead costs spread over a lower number of drilling rig utilization days partially offset by lower maintenance cost due to timing of certifications on a sequential basis operating costs per day decreased by 660 due to lower use of large crew configurations compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 we realized revenue from international contract drilling of us 36 million in the first quarter of 2019 in line with the prior year period average revenue per utilization day in our international contract drilling business was us 49 940 consistent with the comparable prior year quarter during the quarter we signed three year contract renewals for two rigs in saudi arabia one year extensions for two kuwait rigs and sold our mexico based drilling assets for proceeds of us 48 million resulting in a gain on sale of us 24 million and a us 4 million impairment reversal directional drilling services realized revenue of 10 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared with 9 million in the prior year period funds provided by operations see non gaap measures in the first quarter of 2019 were 96 million a decrease of 8 million from the prior year comparative quarter of 104 million the decrease was primarily the result of the timing of 20 million of cash interest payments as we did not have a first quarter interest payment on our senior notes due 2026 in 2018 partially offset by improved operating results capital expenditures were 71 million in the first quarter an increase of 41 million over the same period in 2018 capital spending for the quarter included 66 million for upgrade and expansion capital primarily related to our sixth new build rig for kuwait and a u s new build rig under long term contract and 5 million for the maintenance of existing assets infrastructure spending and intangibles strategy precision s strategic priorities for 2019 are as follows generate strong free cash flow and utilize 100 million to 150 million to reduce debt in 2019 in the first quarter of 2019 we generated 96 million of funds provided by operations see non gaap measures and 58 million of cash proceeds from the divestiture of non core assets with a further 19 million of cash proceeds expected to be received in the second quarter utilizing our cash on hand and free cash flow generated in 2019 we reduced our debt balance by us 13 million through open market repurchases of a portion of our 2024 and 2026 unsecured senior notes and on april 16 2019 redeemed us 30 million principal amount of our 2021 senior notes as of april 24 our total 2019 debt reduction totaled us 43 million subsequent to the first quarter we initiated the redemption of us 20 million principal amount of our 6 50 senior notes due 2021 the redemption payment will be made on may 20 2019 maximize financial results by leveraging our high performance high value super series rig fleet and scale with disciplined cost management in 2019 precision continued to generate strong financial results largely lead by our u s contract drilling business we are currently operating at record market share levels in this region as first quarter utilization days were up 23 and operating margins revenue less operating costs were up 2 257 per day compared with the prior year in canada our unmatched fleet quality and flexible business model led to an increase in operating margins excluding shortfall payments of 465 per day compared with the prior year our continued business improvement initiatives contributed to 6 million in adjusted ebitda growth for our completion and production segment from the prior year in the first quarter of 2019 we continued to invest in our high performance high value super series rig fleet with the building of our sixth kuwait rig which is expected to commence drilling in the third quarter of 2019 and generate operational economies of scale and strengthen our operating margins in the region additionally we will begin converting one of our u s scr triple rigs to a full ac st 1500 in 2019 full scale commercialization and implementation of our process automation control platform pd apps and pd analytics we currently have 31 rigs equipped with our process automation control platform pac using pac technology we drilled approximately 200 wells in the first quarter of 2019 an increase of 46 over the first quarter of 2018 we currently have over 15 pd apps in various stages of development as precision s portfolio of technological offerings continues to expand supporting our full scale commercialization goals by the end of 2019 outlook for the first quarter of 2019 the average west texas intermediate price of oil

industry s active rigs and 59 of the canadian industry s active rigs were drilling for oil targets compared with 81 for the u s and 64 for canada at the same time last year industry conditions we expect tier 1 rigs to remain the preferred rigs of customers globally the economic value created by the significant drilling and mobility efficiencies delivered by the most advanced xy pad walking rigs has been highlighted and widely accepted by our customers the trend to longer reach horizontal completions and importance of the rig delivering these complex wells consistently and efficiently has been well established by the industry we expect demand for leading edge high efficiency tier 1 rigs will continue to strengthen as drilling rig capability has been a key economic facilitator of horizontal unconventional resource exploitation development and field application of drilling equipment process automation coupled with closed loop drilling controls and de manning of rigs will continue this technical evolution while creating further cost efficiencies and performance value for customers capital spending capital spending in 2019 is expected to be 169 million and includes 54 million for sustaining infrastructure and intangibles and 115 million for upgrade and expansion we expect that the 169 million will be split 161 million in the contract drilling services segment 6

non reporting caodc members revenue from contract drilling services was 379 million this quarter or 8 higher than the first quarter of 2018 while adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures increased by 7 to 118 million the increase in revenue was primarily due to higher utilization days as well as higher u s day rates partially offset by lower canadian activity in the u s during the first quarter of

utilization day for the quarter in the u s was up 13 compared with the prior year as we realized higher day rates and third party cost recoveries partially offset by lower turnkey revenue compared with the same quarter in 2018 drilling rig revenue per utilization day in canada increased 3 primarily due to higher spot market day rates partially offset by fewer shortfall payments received international revenue per utilization day was in line with the prior year comparative period in the u s 69 of utilization days were generated from rigs under term contract as compared with 58 in the first quarter of 2018 in canada 13 of our utilization days in the quarter were generated from rigs under term contract compared with 8 in the first quarter of 2018 operating costs were 65 of revenue for the quarter one percentage point lower than the prior year period in the u s operating costs for the quarter on a per day basis were higher than the prior year period primarily due to higher third party charges and repair and maintenance costs offset by lower costs from turnkey activity on a per utilization day basis operating costs for the drilling rig division in canada were greater than the 2018 period as we had higher labour expenses due to larger crew formations rig mix and overhead costs spread over a lower number of drilling rig utilization days partially offset by lower maintenance cost due to timing of certifications depreciation expense in the quarter was 2 lower than the first quarter of 2018 because of asset sales and assets becoming fully depreciated in the first quarter of

adjusted for this sale n m calculation not meaningful revenue from completion and production services increased 6 million or 12 compared with the first quarter of 2018 due to higher camp activity and higher pricing in our well servicing business offset by lower activity in our canadian well servicing and rental businesses our service rig operating hours in the quarter were down 19 from the first quarter of 2018 while rates increased an average of 8 approximately 70 of our first quarter canadian service rig activity was oil related during the quarter completion and production services

revenue per operating hour in the quarter was 758 or 58 higher than the first quarter of 2018 the increase was primarily the result of increased costs passed through to the customer during the first quarter of 2019 as a cost control measure precision did not renew the registration of 75 canada based well service rigs with industry associations due to low anticipated activity levels for the year once activity levels improve these rigs are expected to return to work with minimal start up costs adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures was higher than the first quarter of 2019 primarily because of higher camp activity higher average rates and improved cost structure slightly offset by lower well servicing and rental activity operating costs as a percentage of revenue was 77 compared with the prior year comparative quarter of 86 the reduction of operating costs as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of increased service rig rates a higher proportion of 24 hour well service work and continued cost control depreciation expense in the quarter was 17 lower than the prior year comparative period the decrease in depreciation expense was primarily due to a lower capital asset base as assets become fully depreciated in the first quarter of 2019 we exited the wastewater treatment business with the disposal of our terra water assets segment review of corporate and other our corporate and other segment provides support functions to our operating segments the corporate and other segment had negative adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures of 21 million a 3 million increase

us 24 million in april 2019 precision expects to receive the remaining us 8 million which will be due upon delivery of the final rig as a result precision reversed us 4 million of impairment pertaining to the final rig the impairment reversal brought the carrying value of the final rig equal to its fair value of us 8 million and was reclassified as held for sale in addition we exited the

related equipment for proceeds of 8 million this transaction closed on april 15 2019 share based incentive compensation plans we have several cash settled share based incentive plans for non management directors officers and other eligible employees the fair values of the amounts payable under these plans are recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities over the period that the participant becomes entitled to payment the recorded liability is re established at the end of each reporting period until settlement with the resultant change to fair value of the liability recognized in net earnings loss for the period we also have two equity settled share based incentive plans under the executive performance share executive psu plan the fair value of psus granted is calculated at the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation and black scholes option pricing model and that value is recorded as compensation expense over the grant s vesting period with an offset to contributed surplus upon redemption of the executive psus into common shares the associated amount is reclassified from contributed surplus to shareholders capital the share option plan is treated similarly whereby the fair value of the share purchased options granted are valued using the black scholes option pricing model and consideration paid by employees upon exercise of the equity purchase options are recognized in share capital a summary of the amounts expensed under these plans during the reporting periods are as follows three months ended march 31 stated in thousands

the current quarter to 6 million compared with 8 million in the same quarter in 2018 the decrease is primarily due to a change in the psu total shareholder return multiplier applied on the 2018 payout executive psu share based incentive compensation expense for the quarter was 2 million compared with 1 million in the same quarter in 2018 the increased compensation expense was the result of additional executive psus granted in 2019 offset partially by lower fair values for the 2019 grants finance charges net finance charges were 31 million a decrease of 1 million compared with the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to a reduction in interest expense related to the debt retired in 2018 and 2019 partially offset by the impact of the weakening of the canadian dollar on our u s dollar denominated interest and 1 million of lease accretion charges resulting from the adoption of ifrs 16 on january 1 2019 interest charges on our u s denominated long term debt in the first quarter of 2019 were us 22 million 29 million as compared with us 24 million 30 million in 2018 income tax income tax expense for the quarter was 8 million compared with a recovery of 5 million in the same

right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter of their useful life and the term of the lease the lease obligation is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method under this

leases were accounted for as off balance sheet and lease expenses were only recognized at the time of payment in either operating or general and administrative expense however under ifrs 16 lease costs are reflected on the statement of income loss through depreciation and interest expense resulting in an increase to adjusted ebitda upon transition we recognized right of use assets and

after a lacklustre couple of weeks for foreign exchange markets trading volumes are expected to return to somewhat more normal levels over the next seven days with plenty of risk events on the horizon but with many european markets shut on wednesday for labour day and japan closed for the entire week liquidity might still be in short supply the us currency and economy will remain at the fore as the federal reserve holds a policy meeting and the all important jobs report is released the euro and the pound will also be in focus as the initial gdp reading for the first quarter will be available for the eurozone while in the uk the bank of england will also be meeting to set policy aussie to seek support from chinese pmis after bruising week the australian dollar looks set to end the week as the worst performing major currency following much weaker than expected inflation figures out of australia improving economic indicators from china and the united states have not eased rate cut bets for the reserve bank of australia as stubbornly low inflation could still prompt the central bank to reduce borrowing costs there could be some support though for the aussie next week if the latest manufacturing pmis from china confirm that the sector is emerging from a rut in march both the official and caixin markit manufacturing pmis unexpectedly returned to growth raising hopes that a recovery is underway however investors should wait before counting their chickens as the official manufacturing gauge tuesday is predicted to stay unchanged at 50 5 in april while the caixin pmi thursday is forecast to edge only marginally higher to 50 9 there will also be some domestic data for aussie traders to watch private sector lending numbers for march are due on tuesday and building approvals for the same month will follow on friday kiwi feeling the heat too another underperformer this week has been the new zealand dollar which has also been engulfed by rate cut speculation but unlike for its aussie cousin the kiwi s declines may be better justified as the reserve bank of new zealand is more likely to cut interest rates than the rba which so far has been more cautious labour market figures due on wednesday could be key for the rbnz s next move as the central bank now has a dual mandate to achieve low inflation as well as maximum sustainable employment first quarter numbers on jobs growth the unemployment rate and labour costs will be watched closely the jobless rate had unexpectedly jumped to 4 3 in q4 2018 so another increase would only fuel rate cut bets also significant in new zealand next week will be the anz business outlook survey for april on tuesday weak business sentiment has been a major concern of the rbnz as it contradicts the actual data which hasn t been quite as dismal the bank is worried that persistently low business confidence would eventually drag on economic growth because it tends to hold back corporate investment little upside expected for loonie from monthly growth stats after this week s bank of canada meeting which saw the bank dropping its tightening bias attention will turn to tuesday s monthly gdp estimates the canadian dollar tumbled on the boc s statement and not even a bullish oil market could prevent the loonie from hitting near 4 month lows there could be more downside for the loonie if gdp growth slows in february from january s surprisingly strong 0 3 month on month rate slower growth would support the boc s shift to a neutral stance euro bears eye eurozone gdp for bigger sell off the eurozone will report its preliminary estimate of gdp growth on tuesday but the data is unlikely to follow the same trend as in the us and china where economic pointers have been improving the euro area economy is projected to have expanded by 0 1 quarter on quarter in the first three months of 2019 compared to 0 2 in the prior quarter a worse figure such as no growth during the period would deepen the pessimism for the eurozone economy ahead of the gdp numbers a more forward looking barometer the economic sentiment indicator will be monitored on monday for signs that the downturn began to ease in april in other data the flash inflation reading for april will be released on friday along with march producer prices a combination of disappointing gdp and inflation prints would be the worst outcome for the euro which crumbled below its key support around 1 1180 this week bank of england to hold rates amid brexit impasse the ongoing brexit deadlock has tied the bank of england s hands and policymakers are almost certain to keep rates unchanged at 0 75 on thursday when they conclude a two day policy meeting however the may meeting should nonetheless capture some attention as the bank will publish its quarterly inflation report which includes the latest economic projections there will also be a press conference by governor mark carney who is expected to repeat his warnings about the damage to the british economy from the lingering brexit uncertainty the pound is unlikely to see a big reaction to the boe decision but any dovish tilt either in the bank s outlook or in carney s remarks could weigh on sterling which slipped to 10 week lows versus the us dollar this week the uk economy has been relatively resilient despite the brexit chaos with the hard data not quite as bad as the more recent gloomy pmi readings the uk services pmi plunged below 50 in march pointing to shrinking activity in the economy s largest segment the construction pmi is also below 50 with only the manufacturing sector expanding in march though this was on the back of stockpiling by companies on fears of a hard brexit the april pmis for manufacturing construction and services will be released on wednesday thursday and friday respectively more weak pmi prints would not do the beleaguered pound any favours but of course brexit is still very much the main driver for the british currency talks between the government and the opposition labour party to find a consensus on a way forward with brexit are reportedly not making much progress and at the same time pressure is building on the prime minister theresa may to resign hence the pound will continue to be sensitive to political headlines dollar to remain buoyed by goldilocks economy patient fed the us dollar has more than recovered from its january lows when the fed hit the pause button to climb to the highest in 23 months against a basket of currencies this week the latest indicators from the us suggest the goldilocks economy is back with growth picking up some pace and inflation staying low the core pce price index the fed s preferred inflation measure that s due on monday will likely underscore the muted inflation picture as it s expected to have moderated slightly from 1 8 year on year in february to 1 7 in march also out on monday are personal income and spending figures both are forecast to have accelerated in march on tuesday there will be more important releases including wage growth numbers for the first quarter the chicago pmi and the consumer confidence index for april as well as pending home sales for march the ism manufacturing pmi for april will be closely watched on wednesday following the unexpected rebound in march but the main highlight will be the fomc meeting the fed is widely anticipated to keep its benchmark rate on hold and will probably stick to recent language in its statement fed chief jerome powell will no doubt attempt to reiterate the central bank s patient stance in his press conference even as the us economy regains some momentum the greenback could come under some selling pressure if powell appears unfazed by the recent bounce in growth but would likely recoup any losses if next week s data are on the whole solid particularly friday s jobs report nonfarm payrolls are forecast to have risen by 180k in april easing slightly from the prior month the unemployment rate is expected to have stayed unchanged at 3 8 while average hourly earnings are forecast to head back up to 3 4 y y from 3 2 in march factory orders for march and the ism non manufacturing pmi for april will round up a data packed week in the us

combined nickel inventories on the london metals exchange lme and the shanghai futures exchange at the end of q1 2019 totaled 191 292 tonnes down 13 from the combined total of 219 804 tonnes at the end of q4 2018 since the end of q1 2018 combined class 1 nickel inventories have declined by approximately 50 as demand continues to exceed available supply the nickel market is anticipated to be in a structural deficit in the coming years despite the recovery of prices since the start of 2019 the average reference price for nickel in q1 2019 was down 7 from last year declining from us 6 03 lb to us 5 62 lb nickel prices in april 2019 have averaged at us 5 85 lb and are currently trading on the lme at us 5 56 lb demand for nickel will continue to be driven by the stainless steel sector according to market research by cru stainless steel demand is expected to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 4 through 2022 with production emanating largely from china and indonesia demand for nickel particularly class 1 nickel from non stainless steel sectors is also expected to accelerate given the growth of the electric vehicle battery market class i nickel along with cobalt are key metals needed to manufacture electric vehicle batteries beyond 2019 a shortage of class 1 nickel is anticipated over the coming years since current market prices are below incentive levels needed to develop new nickel projects as a result no new class 1 nickel supply is expected to come on stream in the near term cobalt cobalt prices and demand experienced considerable softness and volatility in q1 2019 the reference price for q1 2019 was us 18 53 lb down 52 from us 39 01 lb for the same period of 2018 consistent with trends over the past several months the price decline was driven by increased supply of intermediate product from the democratic republic of congo as well as by the destocking of inventory by chinese consumers abundant available supply has recently resulted in cobalt producers selling product at significant discount to prevailing reference prices during the run up in prices from late 2017 through 2018 cobalt producers often sold cobalt at a premium to reference prices as consumers looked to lock supply since the start of april however cobalt prices have risen by approximately 15 as consumers renew purchasing activities the recent increase in cobalt prices is expected to be sustained through the balance of 2019 albeit with some volatility due to increased speculative interest growing demand from the electric vehicle battery market and persistent supply risk concerns linked to the democratic republic of congo which is currently the world s largest source of cobalt supply advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded

the moa jv produced 4 397 tonnes of finished nickel in q1 2019 up 54 from 2 854 tonnes produced in q1 2018 growth was largely driven by the deployment of new mining equipment acquired throughout 2018 that resulted in improved ore access and reduced equipment downtime compared to the same period of last year in q1 2018 the moa jv s results were impacted by the highest level of rainfall at moa in more than 20 years and by transportation delays to the refinery in fort saskatchewan by the railway service provider efforts at improving ore access and mining equipment reliability at moa have been instrumental in increasing inventory stockpiles and reducing the impact that adverse weather conditions may have on future production finished cobalt production for q1 2019 was 426 tonnes up 27 from q1 2018 due to higher mixed sulphides availability the ratio of finished nickel production to cobalt production was higher in q1 2019 compared to last year as a result of a higher nickel to cobalt ratio in mixed sulphides produced at moa despite the change which is due to ore grade variability the nickel to cobalt ratio is consistent with historical norms advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content combined nickel and cobalt production totals for q1 2019 represent the moa jv s highest ever first quarter production results second quarter production will be impacted however by the annual maintenance shutdown of the refinery in fort saskatchewan this year s shutdown is expected to be similar in duration to the prior years revenue for q1 2019 totaled 102 3 million up 6 from last year the increase was largely due to higher sales volume of nickel and cobalt offset however by a 70 decline in the cobalt realized price over q1 2018 the realized price decline in q1 2019 was driven by lower consumer demand and the settlement of provisional q4 2018 pricing the average realized price for nickel in q1 2019 was 7 51 lb down 4 from last year mining processing and refining mpr costs for q1 2019 were us 5 59 lb up 6 from us 5 26 lb for q1 2018 due to the impacts of higher energy prices and higher utilization of moa mixed sulphides relative to third party feeds although partly offset by the impact of higher sales volume ndcc in q1 2019 was us 4 53 lb up from us 2 06 lb for the same period last year the increase was largely due to lower by product revenue stemming from lower cobalt prices and the settlement of approximately 200 tonnes of provisionally priced cobalt sales 100 basis from q4 2018 the variance between q1 2019 cobalt reference and realized prices that resulted from provisional pricing adjustments negatively impacted ndcc by approximately 0 40 per pound the decrease in cobalt by product revenue was partly offset by lower third party feed costs and a higher contribution from fertilizer sales sustaining capital spending in q1 2019 was 14 0 million up from 4 5 million in q1 2018 as the moa jv continued its new mining equipment initiative aimed at improving equipment reliability reducing maintenance costs and improving ore accessibility consistent with its efforts

production in 2019 was primarily due to natural reservoir declines and the absence of new development drilling revenue in q1 2019 was 9 0 million down 50 when compared to last year the decline was attributable to lower total net working interest production due to the impact of the decrease in profit oil percentage to 6 from 45 with the renewal of the puerto escondido yumuri psc starting in q2 2018 the decline was partially offset by a higher usgc hsfo reference oil price and by a weaker canadian dollar relative to the u s currency unit operating costs in cuba in q1 2019 were 21 19 per

which can be found at lithiainvestorrelations com with that i d like to turn the call over to bryan deboer president and ceo bryan deboer president and chief executive officer good morning and thank you for joining us today we reported the highest adjusted first quarter earnings in company history at 2 44 per share an 18 increase over last year our earnings were driven by strong top line growth of 7 and an even greater increase in pre tax income which was up over 12 as a growth company powered by people and innovation our strategy centers around purchasing strong assets that have yet to realize their earnings potential we then refocus our teams on creating memorable consumer experiences and install clear performance measurements to deliver operational excellence these customer experiences are generated from several distinct business lines new vehicle sales used vehicle sales finance and insurance service parts and body shops this diversification creates resiliency in our revenue streams sits atop of these each of these business value chains and provides multiple options for growth as a result in the quarter we made meaningful strides toward realizing our earnings potential we increased our total same store sales 3 which was achieved despite a somewhat soft national new vehicle market and resulted in our new vehicle sales decreasing 3 this was more than offset by strong same store improvements in used vehicle retail sales up 11 f i sales up 9 and service body and parts sales up an aggregated 6 this is the key differentiator of our business model compared to other companies that have risk concentration in just one of these business lines our trends over the previous few quarters make our pathway to achieving 15 in eps much clearer we have added over 7 billion in annualized revenues and grew eps over 250 from 4 in 2013 to 10 last year all while maintaining low leverage as a result of our value based acquisition strategy earnings potential is continually being realized and then replenished this combined with innovation and diversification are the catalysts to take us beyond our 15 milestone earnings potential from new stores is realized through improving the performance in the following key areas new vehicle sales when purchased operate at around 75 of average manufacturer market share and when seasoned achieve 125 market share for used vehicle sales when purchased the store average is 35 used units per month and over 85 units when seasoned in finance and insurance average per unit retailed is 700 and when seasoned is over 1 500 service body and parts for acquired dealerships at purchased are typically retaining customers below oem average and in seasoned stores operate at 25 above oem average by improving performance in each of these areas we continue to build velocity in our units in operation to create leverage in the model as a result sg a to gross when a store is purchased is over 90 and drops to below 65 when they re seasoned this value based growth strategy creates the opportunity to continue to grow profits and generate significant cash flows our capital has been reinvested into our omni channel network to expand and modernize our personal transportation solutions wherever whenever and however our consumers desire car buying and servicing is a local and regional experience for our consumers having a strategically diversified physical network centered around strong brands and locations provides consumers convenience and choice we actively monitor only 2 600 acquisition targets of the 18 000 new vehicle dealers that we believe have the earnings potential we seek while also complementing our national network strategy our current available liquidity is over 0 5 billion and our capital engine generates another 250 million in free cash flows annually we have historically purchased assets at below 15 of revenues therefore if our funds were deployed exclusively to acquiring dealership it could fund additional growth in excess of 30 of our current size another 15 growth could be added annually from free cash flows without adding any incremental leverage typically consolidation comes with risk however we have achieved an 80 success rate of recovering our entire investment within five years these strengths combined with an active market that remains ripe for consolidation motivates us to continue to grow we are now one of the three largest auto groups in the u s retailing over 335 000 units annually and operating the second largest own inventory marketplace online despite this and to keep things in perspective our industry is highly fragmented with the top 10 dealership groups controlling just 8 of the total u s new vehicle market in used vehicles no single company controls more than 2 of the u s market combined the total addressable new and used vehicle market is over 1 trillion annually as such we see significant growth available to us through modernization of the vehicle ownership experience and expanding our network to deliver upon this we also invest in innovation and diversification to further activate our physical network and expand market reach these investments are prioritized as follows first we create internal solutions to improve our existing operations secondly we gain vertical and horizontal adjacencies to our core business and lastly we expand market share through strategic partnerships some examples include internal digital transformations being piloted at baierl com soon to launch at lithia com and external partnerships such as shift technologies a san francisco based digital retailer shift provides an entirely new channel of direct to home vehicle purchasing and selling experiences in addition to this new channel this partnership brings synergies by sharing our existing retail network personnel and data we ve also introduced vendor and lender relationships to provide shift with financing capacity to more quickly drive them toward 1 billion in annual revenues in closing we look forward to continuing to drive operational excellence and deploy our capital for acquisition growth to build and capture more earnings potential these efforts combined with innovation will expand the reach of our network pave the pathway to and beyond our 15 eps milestone and springboard us toward a much more meaningful share of the u s market with that i d like to turn the call over to chris chris holzshu executive vice president thank you bryan lithia s mission of growth powered by people is the foundation and driving force of our culture that promotes high performance our team members embrace our customer focus core values and promote an environment of continuous improvement in addition lithia s proprietary strategy for acquiring and integrating stores utilizes our store performance scorecard or sps to align these core values with the key metrics that drive our short and long term success the sps provides immediate visibility when diagnosing trends and identifying areas of opportunity that our empowered store leaders can use to take immediate action that improves results last quarter we discussed how our store and department leaders developed individual annual operating plan or aops for 2019 a key component of the sps in the first quarter our teams made good strides toward executing on their aops and where gaps remain they will continue to reassess plans to drive higher results turning to same store results and as bryan mentioned total sales increased 3 in the quarter reflecting strong performance in used f i and service body and parts our operating model is built upon several independent business lines that drive our overall performance for example over 80 of our gross profit is derived from used vehicle sales f i service parts and our body shops which all coexist with the new vehicle nameplates we represent we continue to grow our total gross profit per unit which was 3 614 or an increase of 140 per unit over 2018 this metric continues to demonstrate the resiliency and flexibility our stores have and balancing volume and gross in the current environment gross margin was 16 an increase of 60 basis points from the same period last year new vehicle revenue decreased 3 our average selling price increased 4 and unit sales decreased 7 in line with retail saar gross profit per unit was 2 136 compared to 2 104 last year an increase of 32 even with a decline in incentives which were down 10 in the quarter these trends demonstrate our stores ability to remain nimble in their volume and growth strategies and adapt to local market conditions through this approach our stores will continue to capture market share and expand their reach regardless of the selling environment retail used vehicles increased 11 our average selling price increased 1 and unit sales increased 10 used retail gross profit per unit was 2 106 compared to 2 059 last year an increase of 47 our used vehicle sales mix in the quarter was 28 certified 58 core and 14 value auto our stores sold 49 off brand vehicles on average per location an improvement of 5 over the prior year we continue to encourage store leaders to leverage the digital marketplace to grow their used car penetration and expand their reach in addition sourcing retail used vehicle inventory is key in generating increased sales and we remain focused on securing a wide variety of options for sourcing used cars in the quarter 63 of our used vehicles came from trade ins which were primarily available to a new car dealer 12 came from auctions 12 from other new car dealers and 7 from independent wholesalers and finally 6 came directly from off the street purchases from customers looking for an easy way to sell their vehicle in a safe and a professional environment we anticipate this last channel will continue to grow as we leverage technology our used vehicle to new vehicle sales ratio reached a new milestone over one to one and our stores continue to target selling 85 used units per location per month in the first quarter of 2019 we reached 70 used units per store per month an increase of three units over the prior year f i per vehicle reached a new record of 1 485 compared to 1 378 an increase of 107 over the prior year this improvement was the result of higher penetration rates and per unit profitability in virtually all our product offerings over the of the vehicles we sold in the quarter we arranged financing on 75 sold a service contract on 48 and sold a lifetime oil product on 22 opportunity remains particularly on our current group of unseasoned stores where f i pvr is still 400 to 500 below our seasoned stores our service body and parts revenue increased 6 over the prior year customer pay work which represents over half of our fixed operations revenue stream increased 7 warranty spiked 12 wholesale parts was flat and our body shops decreased 2 we anticipate continued growth in service body and parts as the car parks continue to grow with an average age of 12 years meaning more vehicles are staying on the road longer creating more recurring repair and maintenance opportunities in addition vehicles are more technologically advanced and continue to require brand specified digital diagnostic equipment owned by the oem new car dealer same store adjusted sg a to gross profit was 70 6 an improvement of over 190 basis points from the first quarter of last year cost savings initiatives are gaining traction as the results in the quarter indicated 85 of our sg a is made up of personnel advertising and facility costs and we saw improvements across all of these areas as bryan mentioned we have acquired over 7 billion in annualized revenues over the past five years and our newer stores have an adverse impact on our sg a results however as these assets continue to season we will continue to achieve leverage in our model and we will get our current stores back to industry leading results on a consolidated basis interest expense increased by 11 million or 30 in the quarter our floor plan facility is variable and is impacted by changes in libor which is up almost 50 basis points over the prior year increasing rates conceal some of the true improvements that have been made in capturing store potential and our teams will continue to work to offset this headwind by managing down their days supply in the remainder of 2019 in closing we continue to look to the leadership at our 182 locations to drive innovation efficiency and profitability while providing solutions wherever whenever and however customers desire unleashing lithia s unique operating model that leverages proven local market leaders to make ground level decisions allows us to the react quickly to market dynamics and leverage our scale our 15 000 employees are taking the steps necessary to exceed their aops capture store potential and carry the trends of q1 into the rest of 2019 and beyond and with that a few comments from tina tina miller vice president and chief accounting officer thank you chris at march 31st we had approximately 280 million in cash and available credit unfinanced real estate could quickly provide us with an additional 247 million for an estimated total liquidity of approximately 527 million our leveraged ebitda defined as adjusted ebitda less capital expenditures was 83 million for the first quarter of 2019 our net debt to adjusted ebitda is 2 1 times a reduction of 0 2 from december 31st and at the low end of our targeted range of two to three times as a reminder to those new to the industry we finance vehicle inventory with floor plan debt a common instrument within the industry as of march 31st we had 2 5 billion outstanding as floor plan in used vehicle financing unadjusted and not reflecting how we think of our business our net debt to ebitda is overstated at 6 4 times vehicle financing is integral to our operations and collateralized by these assets because of this nature we treat the associated interest expense as an operating expense in our ebitda and exclude this debt from our balance sheet leverage calculation resulting in a ratio of 2 1 times our adjusted tax rate was 27 5 up 210 bps compared to 2018 this was primarily driven by the tax impact of our annual vesting of stock awards and changes in certain state tax laws enacted late last year we adopted the new accounting lease guidance this quarter which requires us to record a right of use assets with corresponding operating lease liability for leases with a duration over one year this new guidance had an immaterial impact on our income statement as of march 31st we had a right of use assets of 250 million as we own over 80 of our rooftops this is a small amount compared to our own property of 1 5 billion we continue to balance our capital uses of reinvesting in our business through acquisitions and innovation investments and returning cash to our investors earlier this morning we announced a 3 increase in our dividend to 0 30 per share additionally we have approximately 234 million in remaining availability under our existing share repurchase authorization this concludes our prepared remarks we would now like to open the call to questions operator questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of rick nelson with stephens please proceed with your question rick nelson stephens inc analyst thanks good morning congratulations bryan deboer president and chief executive officer thanks rick chris holzshu executive vice president morning rick rick nelson stephens inc analyst bryan i d like to ask you for an update on the acquisition environment how the pipeline might look for you guys especially with dealers that fit the type that you might be speaking bryan deboer president and chief executive officer great rick i think most everyone has seen that we took a little bit of a breather we really haven t bought anything over the last year the attempt was really to catch up with our operational teams to be able to start to capture potential i think we did more of that this quarter which is great so we got three good quarters under our belt trending back to where we want to be we sit at the bottom of our two to three times leverage ratio range which is good the market is active and we are ready to grow again and i think the pipeline is fairly full and we should have a good three quarters of the remaining year rick nelson stephens inc analyst all right you ve made a lot of progress on sg a down 150 basis points if you could discuss some of the drivers there maybe some of the acquisitions that you made the last few years where you are making the most progress maybe where the opportunities those that might be lagging where the opportunities might be chris holzshu executive vice president rick this is chris you nailed it the 7 billion in acquisition revenue that we ve acquired over the last five years is all coming in at different paces and so it s hard to just look at individual groups but rather look at individual stores to decide kind of where our opportunities continue to stay focused on and so when you think about what we do our first intent obviously in acquisitions is to drive gross while a lot of stores do great in new car volumes the used car volume f i opportunity and focusing on service body and parts is a key focus which generates the gross and then after that we continue to work to manage down the cost the big cost primarily in personnel marketing and leveraging facilities so as far as directly answering your question i mean if you looked at where the baierl acquisition group has come in they are definitely in the lower 70s downtown la actually that group is in the lower 70s we have got some opportunities in upstate new york that we are working through right now and starting to finally get some momentum on and then continuing to leverage the acquisition from dch to maximize the next and probably the final push for them to get toward what we look toward a store potential bryan deboer president and chief executive officer rick one other thing and for those that are joining us for the first time on the call slide 7 shows our historical returns on acquisitions and how we recapture our entire investment within a five year period where you can actually see eight full years since we turned the faucet back on in 2010 rick nelson stephens inc analyst all right great finally if i could ask you for an update on shift maybe what your plan is for using some of their technology in your own dealerships perhaps procurement or other opportunities bryan deboer president and chief executive officer rick bryan again we are very pleased to how the progress has progressed over the first six months it s neat to be able to learn how a digital company thinks and how they re so in tune with consumer behaviors and how to monetize those consumer behaviors through their technology it s been fun to collaborate around people the technology currently is only being utilized in a few of the stores this is their independent channel for business and growth it s not necessarily ours today someday it could become that but for now it s really a second distribution channel directly to consumers home to be able to purchase and buy cars from them so i think for the time being it is really their model we are there to help guide them operationally and in execution more than anything rick nelson stephens inc analyst thanks a lot and good luck thanks for reading through it operator our next question comes from the line of steve dyer with craig hallum please proceed with your question steven dyer craig hallum capital group analyst thanks good morning guys f i was really strong in the quarter it has been for a bit now just wondering if you could get a little more granular on what s driving the strength there is it just increased take rates are there different product offerings are the asps on those going up what are you seeing there and how sort of sustainable is it going forward chris holzshu executive vice president it s chris it s just kind of same response related to what i mentioned to rick about sg a i mean we ve acquired 7 billion in revenue one of the biggest opportunities that we have with new acquisitions that are coming in is the f i opportunity and that really comes down to three core areas it s the people products and the process that we instill to make sure that we stay focused on driving the f i pvrs to the numbers that you see in a lot of our seasoned stores that are anywhere between 1 500 and 2 000 per unit so we re going to continue to work kind of on the lower performers that continue to be part of the acquisition groups that we have done in recent years and we feel like there is still quite a bit of upside for us there as we continue to season those stores steven dyer craig hallum capital group analyst great and i was going to ask about your parts and service similar question and i m guessing potentially a similar answer bryan deboer president and chief executive officer yes steve that s correct steven dyer craig hallum capital group analyst ok and then i guess lastly from me as you look at maybe restarting the acquisition engine a little bit this year any change in terms of geographies or what you re looking for in terms of sort of the legacy lithia strategy of brand exclusivity in smaller mid tier markets versus large markets any sort of change to the thought process as you go forward bryan deboer president and chief executive officer steve this is bryan again definitely no changes in our current strategy no changes in our roe hurdle rates i think if we think about our national network we would like to put some more meat on the bones in the areas where we are a little bit thin which is the midwest and the southeast we are starting to be able to make a digital push into those areas to hopefully be a preamble to something in the future which is good but i would say that it s always about that value based investing and finding those 2 600 stores in the country that are really underperforming in those four or five key areas where we have been able to prove time and time again with an 80 certainty that we re able to get that hurdle rate of getting our money back within a five year period of time steven dyer craig hallum capital group analyst got it thank you very much bryan deboer president and chief executive officer thanks steve operator our next question comes from the line of bret jordan with jefferies please proceed with your question bret jordan jefferies analyst hey good morning guys could you talk about maybe regional performance on the new side any dispersion in sales in the quarter and then maybe how you think you saw your volumes relative to the market in those regions sort of of a share gain standpoint chris holzshu executive vice president bret this is chris as far as regions were concerned we saw a single to double digit improvements in gross profit across the board i mean the only market that we actually saw a bit of a headwind on was our hawaiian market was probably more personnel driven and some transitions with some people there but overall we are continuing to really push on overall gross so even when we see a little bit of pressure on new car units are focused on used cars f i service body and parts has really generated a nice story for us and we continue to anticipate seeing continued growth in gross profit across the board if i had to pick like the big highlights that we saw our markets in nevada new jersey pennsylvania and north dakota and alaska all saw more than double digit growth so those are probably the positive for us on the regions bret jordan jefferies analyst ok i mean a year ago we were talking about the risk of maybe with a loss of state and local tax deductions we would see some impact in demand did you see any i guess cadence shift through the quarter as people were doing their taxes and realizing they weren t getting a deduction as far as some of these state and local tax markets chris holzshu executive vice president bret chris again i mean obviously the impact of some lower refunds for certain consumers may have had an impact on volume but overall our local market leaders are making great decisions as far as how to address what s happening in each of their stores and i would say we didn t see a big impact there bret jordan jefferies analyst ok great and one follow up question i guess you talked about shift with a 1 billion target for revenues do you have a timeframe around that 1 billion bryan deboer president and chief executive officer we ll let them answer that question i know that they are on a clear path to be able to get there and we re there to hopefully be some of the gas that goes into the engine to be able to get there bret jordan jefferies analyst great thank you bryan deboer president and chief executive officer thanks bret operator our next question comes from the line of john murphy with bank of america please proceed with your question john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning guys i just wanted to follow up on used and the strength there i mean how much of the 11 growth in same store sales could be attributable to some incremental sales going through the shift network i m just curious how many of your stores are currently connected to the shift system and how we should think about that over time bryan deboer president and chief executive officer john this is bryan there is only three stores that have any interaction with shift at the current time so it s not a big impact the 10 increase in same store sales in used cars is driven primarily off of our ability to procure inventory that is the no 1 thing and i think as you think about the used car business those that can procure inventory and own the inventory are the ones that will end up in the greatest dominance of market share in the future chris you got some other color to add on that chris holzshu executive vice president yes john just kind of as a follow up to our prepared remarks is really around our street purchases which is a big focus area for shift on the one sided marketplace i think we have woken up a lot of our leaders to kind of look at maybe off the street purchases as a real opportunity to improve their procurement cycle and right now only 6 of the vehicles that we retail are coming from direct street purchases and as we mentioned we anticipate that will continue to grow john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok how are you going out with the street purchase i mean it s cars for cash i mean is there a natural system or is there signs i mean how is that actually working i mean that s not part of a regular transaction right that s just going out and not a trade it s just buying the car bryan deboer president and chief executive officer that s correct john it s bryan again that is directly buying them that is not a trade in our trade ins are almost 50 of our inventory so being at the top of the food chain on that sure helps a lot as well i think when we look about going look at going forward a lot of our street purchases today from consumers are done with heavy lifting it s calling out at craigslist it s them walking in it s them maybe not buying a car from us but still wanting to sell their car and i think as we think about going to market in the future and many of our stores are starting to touch on the digital presence and being able to go right into people s living rooms and say we ll come pick up your car directly at your home and i think if you go to baierl com you can start to see what we re talking about which is the pilot for the future of lithia com as well john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it ok so that s going to become much more sophisticated over time that s encouraging second question just on inventory on the new side i mean you kind of alluded to it being a little bit high it looks like the industry is a little bit heavy what are you kind of hearing from auto makers as far as them pushing the inventory on you and you re able to kind of push back a little bit or do you expect the spring selling season to help work out of this just kind of understand how that might get cleared in the next few months bryan deboer president and chief executive officer john i think that s our one big area of opportunity and without increases in interest costs or inventories we would have really had a killer quarter i think that s part of the drag i think when we think about our manufacturer partnerships we think about seasonality a lot so we are going into a seasonally better time of the year so you should automatically see drops in that we are in the process of implementing an interest rate incentive for our stores to be able to drop inventory from our current about 1 8 billion in new car inventories but we think that we can drop that somewhere in the 15 range through incentivizing our people to be able to what i would say discern a little bit better with utilizing technology and past sales to be able to determine what things they should be stocking but i would still say that we may still be a season or two away from having that really active and rolling the other thing that we are seeing is with our manufacturers it s primarily being driven off of incentives i mean you see incentives rise when there is too much inventory and you see incentives shrink like they did over the year over year basis they re down about 10 or so that s usually an indication that inventories are going to start to thin out john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok and then just on the front end gross you had some growth in the quarter i think there was a lot of there had been a lot of concern with rates backing up that the f i pvr part of that front end gross may come under pressure but now with the reversal and potentially reversal in rates here we ll all see where this goes it doesn t seem like there is a lot of risk to that f i pvr number could you foresee growth in your front end gross what do you think is kind of a do you have an actual target there and is there kind of an esoteric limit we should be thinking about i mean it just seems like there might be more opportunity if rates are heading flat to maybe back down chris holzshu executive vice president yes john this is chris i definitely think we have opportunity in this the balance that we put on our general managers to figure out each and every day based on the brand that they represent so across the board we were up in gpu dollars on every business line and that s a function of the reaction to maybe declining volumes on the new car side that a lot of our stores experience so i think we anticipate that based on whatever the market is putting in front of us our stores will react appropriately knowing that the ultimate goal is to generate gross profit dollars not generally drop off to bottom line exactly and bring it to the bottom line john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst is there sort of a rough rule of thumb we should think about that potentially going to 4 000 i don t know i mean is that something that s too pie in the sky for an average i mean over time can this continue to grind higher chris holzshu executive vice president john this is chris i mean a lot of our stores have focus on velocity i wouldn t say that 4 000 is what they re focusing on but in smaller markets there are stores that have hit kind of that 120 150 sales efficiency number where they have kind of captured the market or they re doing great on the used car side i think then they ll start to sweeten the pot by pushing on more gpu dollars so it s a store by store call and definitely opportunity there but it s hard to predict what the final number is going to look like john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst gotcha and then just lastly tina i mean you gave us an explanation of floor plan and why it shouldn t be included in the cap structure or the debt numbers which i totally agree with i mean i m just curious why you felt it necessary to give that kind of an explanation on the call do you think there are some investors that are confused about this or has something kind of changed i mean i totally agree with the way you re looking at it it s the right way to look at it just curious what the motivation was bryan deboer president and chief executive officer great question john it s surprising we ve been out on the road megan and i for the last couple of months with investors and it s surprising how much overhang there is about people outside the industry that have not really invested that are very nervous when they see that there is a six times plus leverage ratio and they don t understand the flooring implications of that that really bring it down to two times so we thought for those people that are new to the call or new to the industry it was very important to point that out because we think it s part of the drag on why our sector trades at such a discount to specialty retail or to exclusive parts used vehicle or service providers john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok thank you very much i appreciate it operator our next question comes from the line of armintas sinkevicius with morgan stanley please proceed with your question armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst good morning thank you for taking the question just a few small ones here your same store used was down roughly 7 and the comment was that it s in line with retail saar although we have a retail saar number of down 5 i m sure your data is better than ours but just it doesn t seem to quite match up with retail saar so is it a push for gross is it something else going on just curious there on the same store sales for the new side chris holzshu executive vice president armintas this is chris just to clarify your question i think you led with used car sales down 7 i think you meant new cars armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst apologies yes chris holzshu executive vice president no worries that s the rest of your question so just to clarify that and i think it really comes down to just a general mix issue so just based on where we sit we saw the biggest pressure on our domestic brands and some of the import brands as well so based on what the national numbers are we don t kind of line up exactly to what national looks like and i think we felt a little bit more pressure in those areas and we are working through that and one of the focuses on working through that is continue to push gpu dollars which we did in the quarter armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst ok and then on the used side then the strength there is it the push with shift is it a new focus is it getting the acquired stores more seasoned just trying to understand the strength there a little bit better bryan deboer president and chief executive officer armintas this is bryan again there is very little impact from shift remember it s only in three stores and i think the procurement level was about 50 to 75 cars in the quarter so it s a small impact there this is coming 100 from our stores finding the right cars and then pricing them at the right numbers and providing options for consumers to be able to finance them or to pick them up in different areas whether it s our dealerships or at their home and really create a different type of experience wherever whenever and however they choose armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst ok and then with regards to shift i know it s you mentioned it s only in a few stores it s their independent channel for business and growth and for the time being it s their model but any thoughts on when you would start putting your inventory on their site or is baierl baierl com the sort of the push of where you re putting the inventory online bryan deboer president and chief executive officer yes this is bryan again i d almost explain it this way i don t believe it s about getting more eyes on the inventory i believe it s about getting more inventory so the idea of giving more visibility to shift inventory on lithia stores or lithia inventory on shift stores is less relevant than getting more vehicles so i think we focus at lithia and i think shift has done a very nice job at focusing on procurement knowing that that s not where the battle is going to be won or lost it s about being there to be able to buy the right cars i hope that clarifies it and i hate to simplify it that much but that is what the endgame is in the space is being able to procure the right inventory armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst got it that s very helpful much appreciated thank you operator our next question comes from the line of rajat gupta with jp morgan please proceed with your question rajat gupta j p morgan analyst good morning thanks for taking my question just wanted to follow up a little bit on parts and services could you elaborate a little bit more on the sources of strength there both in sales and margins which are up nicely and again across different parts of the businesses is it coming from different kind of band of vehicles or could you really just help parse that out a little bit chris holzshu executive vice president this is chris i think that s kind of two answered question there the first part is really about uio and if you look back over the last 10 years we are starting to see dropping off some of the smaller year saars in the 10 million to 13 million range that were back in 2009 to 2011 so our uio is continuing to grow which is also evident in the overall car park which is at 276 million units right now in the u s which i think is an all time high so that s continuing to help just as far as natural traffic the other big piece goes back to acquisitions again where that 7 billion in revenue that we brought in typically we see stores with service retention well below kind of the dealer s expected average rate of retention and what we are continuing to do is push those stores to get to where a lot of our seasoned stores are at which is at plus 20 so i think there is a lot happening related to the general market but then our acquisitions coming online and focusing on service body and parts the way our seasoned stores do is helping out a lot bryan deboer president and chief executive officer one other thing to add is it s key to remember that in those businesses we are the top of the food chain and we have been letting that business really move to independence and over the last 7 to 10 years we have really started to look at how do we become a commodity type of experience that s all about convenience and value for the consumers and that s starting to take hold and i think it s part of the reason why we have had now what i would imagine it s close to seven to eight years of continual same store sales increases in parts and service but it s really a function of that that we just weren t very good at that in the future and now we re a one stop shopping experience for our consumers rajat gupta j p morgan analyst got it that makes sense just wanted to follow up on your m a comments earlier this year i mean it sounded like we could see an uptake in acquisition activity later this year could you talk a little bit about the size of deals we might expect i mean could there be something as like a dch or is it more combination of smaller ones i mean just being able to aggregate that a little bit bryan deboer president and chief executive officer sure i don t mind giving you a little more color this is bryan again i mean we typically call our one to three store groups staple diet ok so you will see those trickling in periodically like we typically have done i think when we think about the areas that i mentioned midwest and southeast we would want to mid size our larger group to be able to spend time logistically getting back and forth into those areas and we need a management team with similar values that are customer based to join our team so i think unless we find that cultural fit much like a dch we probably will move into those markets more as a slow move in the adjacent states outside of that i mean we always have our oars in the water and track those 2 600 stores and i think it s fairly clear that a lot of the vc and private equity money seems to be leaving this space and having a fair amount of troubles which is breaking some stores loose and obviously makes the buying environment much less competitive so prices seem to be coming back into the realms of reality rajat gupta j p morgan analyst that makes sense just lastly on sg a to gross profit obviously good improvement here in the first quarter i mean excluding any acquisitions you might do is that kind of the trajectory we should be anticipating for the rest of the year if all else equal or is 1q a little bit more of an anomaly and we could see a little bit of i mean the question is basically i mean should we expect similar kind of decline the rest of the year chris holzshu executive vice president yes this is chris i mean we anticipate a continued focus on sg a to gross and we don t anticipate going backwards in that line item rajat gupta j p morgan analyst ok thanks that s all i had thank you operator our next question comes from the line of chris bottiglieri with wolfe research please proceed with your question chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst thanks for taking the question i guess i wanted to first talk on warranty growth that really exploded this quarter your peer one of your peers coincided to a similar outcome curious if you expect this to continue for the rest of the year or is there anything like large lumpy recall campaigns that are that you would expect to roll off chris holzshu executive vice president chris this is chris i mean we saw a number of oems that had significant positive recall activity but really focused on four primary brands which was volkswagen subaru ford and chrysler and the big impact or the big recalls that helped drive the warranty related to airbags some valve issues and some brake lights which obviously we anticipate continuing for the rest of the year so some good trends there and outside of that again as we continue to push on uio and selling more retail new vehicles the warranty numbers will continue to go up chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst that s really helpful and then to understand kind of the impacts on is there a way to dimensionalize parts and service growth between traffic and ticket trying to understand the impact from wage growth and probably parts inflation via the cpi growth like what that s contributing to the parts and service growth right now chris holzshu executive vice president chris i think we have a lot of data that we can probably compile into an answer for that question but we ll take that one off line with you if that s all right later this afternoon chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst that s great ok and then just one final one trying to think through such explosive growth in parts and service same store sales and gross margin rate and it sounds sustainable from what i m hearing on the call right now so i m trying to think through the incremental margins or sg a impact from that just going to see what this is doing to sg a to gross metric so is there a way to contextualize kind of the incremental sg a that you have with parts and service growth or kind of maybe even more specifically how much the parts and services sg a rate improved this quarter chris holzshu executive vice president yes chris chris again our focus on all of our core business lines is to continue to push for that 50 incremental throughput so the incremental gross that we are generating in parts and service we would expect to see at least 50 of that flow through to our operating profit and that will continue to be our focus for the rest of the year i think one of the big opportunities and one of the big advantages that you have as a larger dealer really comes down to technicians we have 75 000 technicians retiring out of this space in 2019 and from what i understand there s 35 000 new techs coming in so again being kind of a larger dealer where we leverage better benefits better pay better training able to attract more technicians and make sure that we can retain and do the work that s coming in is a big focal area for us and we anticipate that with uio increasing and our focus on tech recruiting i think we are going to see continued positive trends for the rest of the year and beyond chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst that s really helpful thank you chris holzshu executive vice president thanks chris operator our next question comes from the line of michael ward with seaport global securities please proceed with your question michael ward seaport global securities analyst thank you good morning just a point of clarification i think chris you mentioned in your remarks and then bryan you commented about incentives being down 10 year over year are those the incentives from the vehicle manufacturers bryan deboer president and chief executive officer yes the incentives from vehicles manufacturers is at 3 850 last year and they re just under 3 600 this year approximately this is triangulated number ok so kind of keep that in mind michael ward seaport global securities analyst right have you seen that continue in april bryan deboer president and chief executive officer we have it s a similar trend line michael ward seaport global securities analyst okay and just a follow up on the parts and service one of the things that i think the industry you ve always had this big drop off after year 1 and year 2 with the retention levels how was your experience been with the 3 4 and 5 years into the ownership experience with retention levels bryan b deboerthat s a great question michael it s bryan again i think when we think about old automotive new car retailers we were warranty businesses today that s not who we are we think about the life cycle of a consumer of what they do with their vehicle for the entire ownership period and possibly even into their second gen so we actually when warranty begins to get close to expiring which is typically three to five years we start to introduce the idea of lower priced parts and service experiences that comes through some aftermarket although we do prefer oem parts on our cars we teach our people to be sensitive to that with the consumers because not all consumers will stay with us if we only sell them oem parts when an aftermarket could be half the price that s allowed us to really retain customers at a higher rate i noted in my comments that when we buy stores retention of consumers which means a consumer that s in our 10 year uio comes into our dealerships at least one or two times a year depending on what manufacturers we re talking with but what basically happens is we have increased that retention rate to over 25 of average which is a fairly substantial increase and beyond the other adjacencies of us being able to sell and expand our product offerings into batteries or windshield wipers and tires and brakes and shocks and all the other things that we are top of food chain on are now adding to that existing business so the idea of a two to three year life and service with our consumers is not quite the same as it used to be keep in mind this one thing as well our facility utilization in our service departments still remains at less than 50 which means that if we open longer hours and filled our stalls and were able to turn that business into production that we still have double the potential with our existing base without spending any additional capital ok so it sounds like the growth in the parts and service there s no reason not to expect that we shouldn t see those types of levels maybe incentive in the past were we thought 3 to 5 maybe the 5 to 7 type levels of growth are more normal bryan deboer president and chief executive officer i think michael i think that s probably accurate and i think the better our stores are at understanding consumer needs the better that we ll be and the longer that we ll be able to retain those customers michael ward seaport global securities analyst and just one last question on shift if the website says they have roughly 700 units in inventory to me that suggests that they re selling 3 000 to 4 000 units a year if that s the right bucket that would explain why we wouldn t see anything any equity income line or anything like that on your results as it grows toward or it starts to expand out and grow the inventory that you enable there could come a point that we start to see those numbers on the equity income line is that how it would be presented bryan deboer president and chief executive officer this is bryan again michael yes if we get into an equity position you re accurate we currently don t sit at an equity position yet i think if you think about their inventory as well their inventory may not show their entire inventory on that specific site i believe it s about double that but we can have you circle back with george or toby at shift and they can give you the particulars and what their run rates and stuff are michael ward seaport global securities analyst so what is your relationship it s just a partnership you have no equity stake bryan deboer president and chief executive officer correct you want to elaborate on that tina tina miller vice president and chief accounting officer this is tina so just to clarify we do have some ownership in shift right we made the investment back at the second half of last year it s not a material component of our financial statements which is why you don t see it called out michael ward seaport global securities analyst ok and what level does that become significant is there a point is there a certain barrier that has to reach as far as in effect 1 or something like that tina miller vice president and chief accounting officer yes typically under guidance right it s less than 20 ownership allows you to kind of michael ward seaport global securities analyst ok that s fine so it s more the ownership level perfect tina miller vice president and chief accounting officer yes michael ward seaport global securities analyst thank you very much bryan deboer president and chief executive officer thanks for your question operator our next question comes from the line of derek glynn with consumer edge research please proceed with your question derek glynn consumer edge research analyst good morning and thanks for taking the question given continued growth in new prices and loan rates where they are do you think we re broadly approaching affordability problem in new vehicles bryan deboer president and chief executive officer derek this is bryan no i believe that manufacturers and retailers are pretty adaptable to those increases and figure out solutions for consumers to be able to afford new cars in any type of environment derek glynn consumer edge research analyst ok got it and then just secondly just want to get your pulse on the auto credit environment is credit still widely available have you seen any signs of a pull back bryan deboer president and chief executive officer derek this is bryan again no it s widely available i would say that it s definitely a driver leasing is in full swing which is an important part of the model valuations are stable in terms of lad s which is great we don t foresee any blips on the radar which is good and we look forward to a solid next few quarters and years operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i ll turn the floor back to mr deboer

our current age of automation anxiety is nothing new writing in 1930 john maynard keynes was concerned with the onset of technological unemployment and the temporary phase of maladjustment which would ensue in 1964 us president lyndon baines johnson commissioned a study on technology automation and economic progress which outlined recourse for the government to act as employer of last resort eolr more than half a century later economists executives and policy makers are consumed with brilliant technologies and the impact on employment in the second machine age it is the pace of change happening now the onset of artificial intelligence ai machine learning and robotics unfolding contemporaneously with large social undercurrents of inequality populist movements and an increase of protectionism that has induced an almost pervasive sense of distress in advanced economies today automation and advancing technology have contributed to a u shaped curve of employment in the united states and other organization for economic cooperation and development oecd economies with a hollowing out of the middle wage industrial and manufacturing jobs and growth in new economy jobs such as personal services on the one end of the spectrum and business and professional services at the other end the corresponding wage polarization alongside these labor market developments has almost certainly contributed to the rise of populism and the return of geopolitics but the important thing is not to give way to despair solutions can be enacted by both governments and the private sector which may even spur opportunities for long term investing these solutions are not only applicable in advanced economies but also in still developing societies such as such as brazil and china as they transition from old to new economic growth what are the facts the latest waves in rapidly advancing technology and robotics have unfolded beneath a wider umbrella of long term shifts in patterns of demand in advanced societies we have evolved from agrarian to heavy industrial manufacturing to services based employment and in an age in which investors speculate about the death of retail personal expenditures are often directed toward leisure health and personal services rather than the acquisition of goods beneath this umbrella of secular change significant advancements in technology in the manufacturing and industrial sectors have led to skill biased technical change sbtc in countries such as the united states as improvements in technology have replaced task intensive routine jobs in the middle of the employment spectrum a u shaped employment curve has emerged with a polarization of jobs to non routine manual services jobs at one end of the curve and non routine cognitive jobs white collar at the other although there are other contributing factors to the hollowing out of middle skill and middle wage jobs in the united states trade shocks from greater import competition from china the globalization of labor markets and the decline in private sector unions for example our focus is on what keynes called technological unemployment over the last three decades the united states has witnessed robust job growth in business services personal services education and healthcare real estate and hospitality and leisure with losses in old economy sectors such as mining alongside these shifts in employment wages have polarized with the highest wages in the white collar business and professional sector and lower wages for personal leisure and healthcare services it is likely that real wages in services have been further compressed by an influx of workers phased out of the old economy as middle skill workers particularly those without a college degree are more likely to migrate to non routine manual jobs than they are to non routine cognitive jobs which may require postgraduate degrees figure 1 source david autor and anna salomons in a worrisome development for global financial markets and long term economic growth wage inequality in the united states corresponds with a lack of intergenerational mobility indeed contrary to popular belief about the ease of achieving the american dream the us has both the lowest mobility and the highest inequality among all wealthy democratic countries among a comparable set of oecd countries as we can see in figure 2 italy and the united kingdom are not far behind in ranking for the lowest mobility and highest inequality figure 2 source david autor these three countries the united states the united kingdom and italy also happen to be the epicenter of populist politics today which one could argue set into motion a negative feedback loop an increase in protectionism volatility in financial markets and uncertainty in immigration policy can have a paralyzing effect on business and companies capital spending plans and in countries such as italy and the uk populist movements may even increase the debt servicing costs as worried investors dump sovereign bonds potentially stymying public spending plans what are the solutions as we consider both sides of the u shaped employment spectrum there are certain jobs which are unlikely to be threatened by automation in the personal services side jobs which require visual recognition and interpersonal interaction such as home healthcare nurse care practitioners security building maintenance food preparation and hairdressing are unlikely to be replaced by a robot at the high skill end of the spectrum business services that prioritize human relationships flexibility creativity problem solving capabilities and intuition are unlikely to be replaced by machines one can take this a step further with the automation of some functions of the business world such as passive index investing banking and machine informed hedge funds a higher skill premium may be placed on these interpersonal and creative capabilities which may require different continuing educational and training requirements than traditional technically focused degrees if we recognize that these long term employment shifts and corresponding wage inequality and lack of mobility are long term problems there are three solutions which can be enacted by policy makers companies and perhaps by investors these are education vocational training is paramount it can be argued that the united states needs a rapid revolution in tertiary education and learning for working for workers to be able learn skills as the new artisans in growing sectors germany is the exemplar here perhaps governments could incentivize companies to grow apprenticeship and training programs with favorable tax deductions additionally by contributing to sustainable employment and reducing wage inequality companies could clearly meet the social criteria of social impact investing that is the s part of esg environmental social governance benchmarking becoming increasingly important for global companies and investors job creation with these long term changes in mind governments could generate jobs in thriving sectors such as infrastructure smart cities transport construction and maintenance of affordable housing green and clean tech integrative healthcare and preventive medicine in such a way the government s acting as an eolr would yield benefits for the taxpayers paying for these projects whether it was more green space in an urban center better roads improvements in healthcare or better air quality and research and development can be directed toward dynamic sectors with goods and services geared to export to growing markets wage subsidies reinstating the dignity of work with the hollowing out of manufacturing jobs wages in the personal services side of the u shaped curve may be compressed with an influx of new workers particularly in a scenario in which vocational education helped them to secure these new jobs governments could supplement wages in the private sector in some of these growing service industries unlike a cash handout or universal basic income ubi wage subsidies would help to reinstate the dignity of work it would be a move from entitlement to empowerment in supplementing income derived from work the supplements may not need to be long term with the growth in wages at the high skill end of the employment spectrum workers tend to spend more of their disposable income on personal services leisure and hospitality perhaps spurring greater demand in the sub sector over time conclusion looking forward we are unlikely to roll back the tide of technological advancement automation and robotics as china advances with its made in china 2025 vision and countries from israel to singapore solidify their positions as ai hubs it is unlikely that a postmodern luddite movement will emerge but the long term changes which have unfolded over the last few decades job and wage polarization and lack of intergenerational mobility have led to waves of angst dissatisfaction insecurity and distrust by voting publics in many advanced economies protectionist cries have spilled over into financial markets contributing to an uncertain environment in which to make business decisions and to invest the potential solutions a proliferation of vocational training job creation in growing sectors and wage supplements require long term thinking direction and patience in implementation the move from entitlement to empowerment necessitates a different kind of communication from governments to their people and potentially from companies to their shareholders but by contributing to sustainable employment and reinstating the dignity of work stakeholders can do their part in transforming the future of work creating upside potential rather than remaining paralyzed in fear dr alexis crow is a nonresident senior fellow with the atlantic council s global business and economics program related experts alexis crow image a

discussion of ebitda and adjusted ebitda see the definitions section definitions funds from operations ffo we calculate funds from operations or ffo in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit in the nareit funds from operations white paper 2018 restatement ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from real estate transactions impairment of investment in real estate real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs unconsolidated jv real estate related depreciation amortization non controlling interests in operating partnership and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures management uses ffo as a supplemental performance measure because in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures it provides a performance measure that when compared year over year captures trends in occupancy rates rental rates and operating costs we also believe that as a widely recognized measure of the performance of reits ffo will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other reits however because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our data centers that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our data centers all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition and results from operations the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited other reits may not calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and accordingly our ffo may not be comparable to other reits ffo ffo should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance core funds from operations core ffo we present core funds from operations or core ffo as a supplemental operating measure because in excluding certain items that do not reflect core revenue or expense streams it provides a performance measure that when compared year over year captures trends in our core business operating performance we calculate core ffo by adding to or subtracting from ffo i termination fees and other non core revenues ii transaction and integration expenses iii loss from early extinguishment of debt iv severance equity acceleration and legal expenses v loss on fx revaluation vi gain on contribution to unconsolidated joint venture net of related tax and vii other non core expense adjustments because certain of these adjustments have a real economic impact on our financial condition and results from operations the utility of core

considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance adjusted funds from operations affo we present adjusted funds from operations or affo as a supplemental operating measure because when compared year over year it assesses our ability to fund dividend and distribution requirements from our operating activities we also believe that as a widely recognized measure of the operations of reits affo will be used by investors as a basis to assess our ability to fund dividend payments in comparison to other reits including on a per share and unit basis we calculate affo by adding to or subtracting from core ffo i non real estate depreciation ii amortization of deferred financing costs iii amortization of debt discount premium iv non cash stock based compensation expense v straight line rental revenue vi straight line rental expense vii above and below market rent amortization viii deferred tax expense ix leasing compensation and

considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance ebitda and adjusted ebitda we believe that earnings before interest loss from early extinguishment of debt income taxes and depreciation and amortization or ebitda and adjusted ebitda as defined below are useful supplemental performance measures because they allow investors to view our performance without the impact of non cash depreciation and amortization or the cost of debt and with respect to adjusted ebitda severance equity acceleration and legal expenses transaction and integration expenses gain loss on real estate transactions equity in earnings adjustment for non core items other non core adjustments net noncontrolling interests preferred stock dividends including

severance equity acceleration and legal expenses transaction and integration expenses gain on sale deconsolidation impairment of investments in real estate other non core adjustments net non controlling interests and preferred stock dividends including undeclared dividends in addition we believe ebitda and adjusted ebitda are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits because ebitda and adjusted ebitda are calculated before recurring cash charges including interest expense and income taxes exclude capitalized costs such as leasing commissions and are not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of our business their utility as a measure of our performance is limited other reits may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently than we do and accordingly our ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other reits ebitda and adjusted ebitda accordingly ebitda and

2018 bloomberg finance lp when will jpmorgan discover china s bond market and include it in their massive global emerging market government bond index aka the gbi em gd bloomberg barclays global aggregate bond index added some chinese bank and government bonds priced in local currency recently jpm is behind the eight ball don t be a hater guys here it is in a nutshell china s frankenstein economy one part capitalist one part communist is opening to capital markets its bond market is the third largest in the world with 13 trillion in outstanding bonds its currency is the most stable of any emerging market currency it pays a bit more in yield than the u s and more than anything in japan euro bonds pay maybe 1 and if you re worried about bankruptcies and hard landings keep in mind that the people s bank of china is a short seller s worse nightmare the two most influential providers of fixed income benchmark indices for developed economies bloomberg and ftse already consider chinese bonds sufficiently accessible for inclusion in their indices jpmorgan is the outlier 2019 bloomberg finance lp one is left wondering how this is even possible says jan dehn head of research at the ashmore group a 75 billion emerging market bond fund manager based in london does jpmorgan hold china to higher standards than ftse and bloomberg one reason why bonds from countries like china are not included in indexes is because the market isn t deep enough china is not as liquid as brazil so that can be one reason why certain chinese bonds are not in some bond indexes only 19 emerging market countries are included in the gbi em gd index and only 9 of emerging market local currency government bonds are represented in that index the rest is dollar or euro denominated bonds blackrock likes the decision to include china s local currency government debt in the index and is buying more most funds tracking the index will have to make a play on china bonds anyway especially if they want to meet or beat the index passive investors like blackrock s ishares exchange traded funds will be equal weight active money managers might go underweight but they will be buyers regardless how heavy they go in it s not that they are being forced to global investors have been waiting patiently for china to open its capital markets for years now we are getting somewhere the bloomberg barclays index brings in local currency government and includes the bonds of top state banks like the industrial and commercial bank of china their weighting is set to increase over a 20 month period associated press local currency chinese bonds are set to make up roughly 6 of the global fixed income benchmark when the phase in is complete at that stage china s currency will be the fourth largest component in the index behind the u s dollar euro and japanese yen i m a china bull the changes they ve made to the economy for an economy their size is pretty impressive says chris gaffney the president of world markets for tiaa bank the renminbi rmb is becoming more widely accepted as a currency in trade throughout asia i don t think it surpasses the dollar but i think it surpasses the japanese yen i m not a yen bull for diversification in fixed income i would not go to japan i wouldn t want to hold the yen at all give me rmb local currency chinese bond yields this decade have been higher than the average yields of the developed market bonds that make up the majority of the global bond index japanese yens are basically money in a pillowcase richard turnill global chief investment strategist for blackrock says that liquidity is definitely a concern 2018 bloomberg finance lp particularly for investors with shorter term horizons he wrote in an april 22 commentary published on blackrock s website titled emerging opportunities in china bonds the domestic chinese investor traditionally has had a buy and hold approach to investing as more foreign investors come in and trading picks up between the new bond connect system between hong kong brokerages and the mainland then liquidity should improve jpmorgan is likely waiting to see how the new bond connect system works much like msci took a wait and see approach in the mainland china equity market when shanghai and shenzhen broker dealers were connected to the more sophisticated hong kong based firms that have long standing ties with western investors the a shares are now an even larger part of the msci china and msci emerging markets index courtesy of ashmore china is still an opportunity cost many wealth fund managers are willing to take it doesn t matter that it s the world s no 2 economy after the u s private wealth offices that build their own portfolios for clients are usually not wedded to benchmarks there s not enough yield in china to make that kind of investment in unknown securities anyway says luis maizel cofounder and senior managing director at lm capital group a 4 5 billion wealth management firm in san diego why should i take the risk in a chinese bank s corporate bond i know nothing about chinese banks i don t want to make stupid mistakes so i ll stay away from china

noy sonemany works at the china laos railway construction site in northern laos sonemany a builder before the job has grown into a skilled welder and was conferred railway craftsman with a monthly income of about 460 u s dollars the 26 year old said he is happy with the job sonemany is among millions around the world benefiting from cooperation projects within the framework of the belt and road initiative bri ever since the initiative was first proposed by chinese president xi jinping in 2013 126 countries and 29 international organizations have signed bri agreements with china under the bri china has not only helped others develop their economy and improved the livelihood of their people but also offered a platform where all countries can work together for common prosperity burgeoning cooperation projects the china laos railway project is just one of the many cooperation projects that the bri has created once completed in 2021 the 414 km railway will run from mohan boten border gate in northern laos to the capital vientiane with an operating speed of 160 km per hour turning the landlocked country into a land linked hub the colombo international container terminals in western sri lanka co managed by china s cm port and the sri lanka ports authority since 2014 has turned the colombo port into one of the fastest growing ports in the global market according to the international rating agency alphaliner the port had the highest container growth in the first half of 2018 in the initial five years of its implementation the china pakistan economic corridor had completed several energy projects which have solved pakistan s headache of blackouts while facilitating the country s economic development by providing sufficient electricity to its industries the china railway express an artery of international trade now links 59 cities in china with 50 cities in 15 european countries with the cumulative number of trips reaching 14 000 by the end of february france has agreed to jointly promote bri related third party market cooperation with china while italy and china have signed a memorandum of understanding on jointly advancing the initiative it turns out that the bri with great potential to benefit both developing and developed economies has become more and more appealing to the world the latest studies by the world bank and other international institutions suggested that cooperation under the bri will cut the costs of global trade by 1 1 to 2 2 percent and contribute at least 0 1 percent of global growth in 2019 debt trap fallacy as the bri is gaining growing global support some western politicians and media accuse china of setting up a debt trap these accusations have been refuted by officials and experts worldwide research published in january by trade credit insurer euler hermes said the bri will add 0 3 percent to global trade and 0 1 percent to global growth and countries involved will see higher trade volumes the accusations against china are complete nonsense as benefits generated from infrastructure construction will far exceed the investments said aboubaker omar hadi chairman of djibouti ports and the free zone authority a total of 41 billion u s dollars have been recorded in exports and imports through djibouti ports which cannot be achieved without developing proper infrastructure hadi said the bri offers tremendous opportunities for cambodia and the royal government has clearly indicated its commitment to the project said united nations development program resident representative nick beresford it is not going to create a debt trap for cambodia said hem vanndy undersecretary of state for the cambodian economy and finance ministry keshmeer makun a lecturer at fiji s university of the south pacific said it is important to know that china often takes into consideration the ability to meet foreign debt obligation and solvency constraint of receiving countries hence preventing heavy debt burden the chinese funded projects not only get the right costing and quality but also bring the preferred social and economic assistance to the people makun said speaking of sri lanka s debt problem local scholar dr dushni weerakoon and economics professor at australia s monash university sisira jayasuriya wrote in an article that it had very little to do with chinese loans which comprise merely about 10 percent of sri lanka s total foreign debt as to the montenegro highway project the international monetary fund said such construction has already given the country a shot in the arm as after expanding 2 9 percent in 2016 the economy grew 4 4 percent in 2017 and predicted montenegro will generate a primary fiscal surplus of 4 5 percent of gdp gross domestic product by 2020 the allegations regarding the bri are misguided and incorrect said khairy tourk from the stuart school of business of the illinois institute of technology in chicago connectivity for common prosperity the belt and road is about sharing tourk said indeed the bri by advancing globalization in a more open inclusive and balanced manner aims to build a trade and infrastructure network connecting the world based on mutual respect equality and mutual benefit in 2018 when addressing a symposium marking the fifth anniversary of the bri xi noted it is an open and inclusive initiative rather than an exclusive bloc or china club while the initiative has proved a real boon to countries along the belt and road through bilateral cooperation projects the international community has also started to recognize its significance in enhancing connectivity to jointly incubate new growth businesses and address unbalanced development speaking of the bri djibouti official hadi said he is expecting stronger interconnection between africa and the rest of the world central asia is basically landlocked in terms of its trade with the rest of the world by increasing connectivity a trendy idea reflected in the bri this region will definitely benefit economically said fabienne bossuyt assistant professor at belgium s ghent university for fijian lecturer makun the bri has helped the pacific island countries attract more foreign investment from neighboring economies indeed china s presence and assistance have also motivated our regional neighbors such as australia new zealand and the u s to step up it is a good thing that such countries have made their commitments to boost the pacific region s development he said in comparison to unilateral protectionist policies china offers a chance for peaceful and common prosperity among countries said francesco maringio an italian china expert the bri s emphasis on infrastructure and connectivity lays the best possible foundations for promoting all round comprehensive economic development and improvement of people s livelihood in the future said keith bennett vice chairman of britain s 48 group club it is an operating platform for how nations would work together and resolve their differences amicably through negotiation through give and take through win win solution said william jones washington bureau chief of the u s publication executive

good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the q1 2019 w r grace earnings conference call at this time all participants are in a listen only mode later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time operator instructions i would now like to turn the conference over to your host jeremy rohen vice president of corporate development and investor relations jeremy rohen vice president corporate development and investor relations thank you bella hello everyone and thank you for joining us today for grace s first quarter 2019 earnings call with me this morning are hudson la force grace s president and chief executive officer and bill dockman vice president and interim chief financial officer our earnings release and presentation are posted on our website under the investors section at grace com please note that some of our comments today will contain forward looking statements based on our current view of our business and actual future results may differ materially please see our recent sec filings which identify the principal risks and uncertainties that could affect future performance we will discuss certain non gaap financial measures which are described in more detail in this morning s earnings materials reconciliations of non gaap financial measures and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings materials and posted on our website this morning hudson will address our first quarter business performance and key developments with our strategic priorities i will then cover our financial results and provide an update on the second quarter and full year outlooks so with that please turn to slide four in our earnings presentation and i ll turn the call over to hudson hudson la force president and chief executive officer thank you jeremy good morning everyone our team delivered another strong quarter of solid sales and earnings growth we made significant progress with our strategic growth investments in our commercial and operating excellence initiatives for the quarter sales were up 9 with both specialty catalysts and materials technologies delivering high single digit organic sales growth on a constant currency basis overall we continue to see solid demand in our end markets and experienced good volume growth in north america emea and asia during the quarter our focus on value selling continues to benefit our results in the first quarter we achieved over 200 basis points of improved pricing with gains in every business adjusted ebit was up 9 and adjusted eps increased 13 driven by the polyolefin catalyst acquisition and our organic growth which more than offset the headwinds from inflation and currency for the quarter our adjusted eps was slightly above our outlook range largely due to order timing within the first half of the year i am confident in our growth earnings and cash flow expectations for the year and we are reaffirming our full year outlook we are focused on capturing and monetizing the growth opportunities we have in managing inventory and spending to ensure we remain well balanced please turn to slide five grace s future is anchored in the strong fundamentals of our businesses and the long term enduring growth drivers underlying the markets and customers we serve our growth has long been driven by increased demand for high performance plastics cleaner transportation fuels and stricter environmental regulations as the importance of sustainability continues to increase our opportunities to create value will continue to grow many of our fastest growing products help our customers improve the efficiency of their processes reduce energy or water use or cut harmful emissions other products help our customers address rising consumer and regulatory expectations for safe food clean water and human health and safety simply put our technologies help our customers achieve their sustainability goals last quarter i highlighted how one of our silica products help the customer reduce water usage and waste in their operations this is a product that we expect will grow double digits given the value it creates for customers on a much larger scale our entire hydroprocessing catalysts business is growing high single digits on the demand for cleaner fuels our catalyst significantly reduce the amount of sulfur and other contaminants in transportation fuels helping minimize their environmental impact we recently highlighted our initiatives to reactivate and recycle spend hpc catalysts expanding on existing catalysts recycling efforts to improve the sustainability of our products sustainability is important to us as a company and we remain committed to doing our part shifting to investments in operations in february we announced we were building a new manufacturing plant in europe to support the growing global demand for our ludox colloidal silica technology ludox is in high demand for use in emissions control catalysts to address tighter regulatory requirements and in specialty coatings for applications like corrosion resistance in any abrasion this capacity investment is timed and sized to meet identified customer demand as we commented last quarter over 90 of our current growth capital investments are tied to specific customers contracts or licenses operating excellence and the grace manufacturing system continue to improve operations through increased production rates improved reliability and lower costs in 2018 gms produced a 50 basis point benefit to gross margin some of which dropped to the bottom line and some of which we reinvested to support future growth for the next several years we expect similar annual benefits i ll give you an example of a typical gms implementation last year we began a gms implementation at one of our sold out units during the project the manufacturing team upgraded a challenging manufacturing process step and strengthen their maintenance strategy the project took about six months and was completed in q4 in the first quarter the changes resulted in an 8 5 increase in production rates versus the prior year like most of our gms investments this investment will pay back in less than one year now let s turn to slide six and look at our first quarter business performance catalyst technology sales were up 11 driven by solid demand for our leading technologies and improved pricing partially offset by currency headwinds in specialty catalysts organic sales were up 8 and total sales were up 27 including the polyolefin catalyst acquisition we continue to see strong demand for our catalyst products as customers add capacity to support long term demand for polyolefins and seek to maximize the value of the resins they produce we are encouraged by the robust pipeline for our unipol process technology driven by the growing global demand for polypropylene resins we ve passed the first anniversary of the polyolefin catalyst acquisition and i m very pleased with the results of this investment in the first 12 months the acquisition generated over 110 million in sales at margins in line with our catalyst segment today the business is fully integrated into specialty catalysts and is delivering the capital and cost synergies we expected the synergies will be fully realized by the end of 2019 and will result in a post synergy purchase price multiple more than three times below the announced multiple long term the combined commercial and r d platforms will further strengthen our customer relationships and innovation capabilities and enable specialty catalysts to continue to grow at high single digits in refining technologies sales were down 1 6 million due to weaker mto catalyst sales and unfavorable currency fcc catalyst sales volumes were up low single digits and fcc catalysts pricing improved more than 200 basis points on a trailing 12 month basis our pricing expectations remain 1 to 2 per year over the long term art continues to see strong demand for hpc catalysts and we expect this to continue as the demand for cleaner fuels increases and imo 2020 is implemented last i m pleased to report that the middle east fcc customer restarted operations in the first quarter we have now resumed normal supply to them let s turn to materials technologies on slide seven we continue to experience solid demand for our products led by the consumer pharma and chemical process and markets higher volumes and improved pricing contributed over 8 to sales growth this more than offset a 5 impact from currency in the expected weakness in the china coatings market we discussed last quarter the china coatings market has started to stabilize for us importantly this market is less than 4 of mt sales we expect the strong demand we ve experienced in materials to continue driven by consumer pharma and chemical process segments in north america and emea the materials technology team continues to execute on its strategy to optimize its portfolio by focusing on faster growing more strategic markets we expect these attractive end markets to contribute nearly two thirds of the business s sales growth in 2019 we have strong businesses with enduring growth drivers a clear growth strategy and customers that value our technologies our value creation model and strong culture make grace a great place to work in a competitive labor market we ve been successful retaining the great talent we have in attracting a significant amount of new talent to grace while the cfo search has taken longer than i wanted i m comfortable with where we are in our search we have a strong existing team that serves me our business leaders and investors well i ll now turn the call over to jeremy who will discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail jeremy rohen vice president corporate development and investor relations thanks hudson turning to slide nine grace had another solid quarter with sales of 479 million up 9 and up 11 on constant currency organic growth was driven by higher sales volumes and improved pricing in both catalysts technologies and materials technologies this more than offset the 2 5 impact from unfavorable currency which was largely driven by the strength of the us dollar versus the euro as we ve said before approximately 95 of our sales are linked to the us dollar or the euro adjusted gross margin for the quarter expanded 80 basis points through our focus on value selling and broader commercial and operating excellence initiatives which more than offset 120 basis points of inflation sequentially adjusted gross margin was up 260 basis points returning to normal levels following our decision in the fourth quarter to proactively reduce production rates and accelerate certain product trials as we discussed at that time the actions did not impact the first quarter adjusted ebit was up 9 and adjusted ebit margin of 22 2 was flat year over year adjusted eps for the quarter was 0 93 per share up 13 and slightly above our outlook primarily due to order timing in the first half of the year now let s turn to slide 10 we continue to deploy our capital to fund our strategic growth investments pursue bolt on acquisitions and return capital to shareholders we are confident our focus on disciplined capital allocation won t deliver profitable growth and create shareholder value for the quarter we invested 50 million of capital in our plants and are on track to invest 200 million to 210 million of capital in our operations this year we returned 23 million of cash to shareholders through our dividend and share buyback and we reduced our net leverage to 3 1 times with the expectation to be back below 3 by the end of 2019 moving to slide 11 let s take a quick look at our second quarter and full year outlooks and we ll then open the call for questions for q2 we expect adjusted eps to be up 6 5 to 7 5 year over year our adjusted eps outlook for the first half of 2019 remains tightly aligned to our internal expectations from february adjusted gross margin should be in line with the first quarter of 2019 but down year over year as the second quarter of 2018 was our strongest margin quarter of the year for the full year we remain encouraged about our business outlook and our position to deliver another solid year of growth and margin expansion we are reaffirming our 2019 outlook including 6 to 7 top line growth at the segment level we continue to expect sales growth in line with our prior views including high single digit growth in specialty catalyst mid single digit growth in materials technologies and low single digit growth in refining technologies we expect adjusted ebit in the range of 490 million to 500 million up 7 to 9 and adjusted eps in the range of 4 53 to 4 62 per share an increase of 10 to 12 year over year the key assumptions behind our outlook remain unchanged and are included on slide 11 in terms of global macroeconomic risks we continue to expect full year inflation in the range of 100 basis points to 150 basis points and moderate fx headwinds continuing in the second quarter as a reminder we have very limited exposure to tariffs emerging market currencies and interest rates we closely monitor global market conditions and we ll take any actions necessary to adjust if conditions change with that let s open the line for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of john roberts from ubs your line is open john roberts ubs analyst thank you nice quarter hudson la force president and chief executive officer thank you john john roberts ubs analyst i know consultants have forecast about how refiners may operate differently as we approach imo 2020 but do you have any visibility into your order book on how they might react as the year progresses hudson la force president and chief executive officer john this is a conversation that we re having with our customers every day right now and at this stage of the year it s still little early for them to make final decisions about what they how they want to run as they approach the end of the year we re working on giving them options and i expect they ll start making decisions in q3 and we would start to see changes in the catalyst preferences in that timeframe overall my expectation is that refiners will choose to run hard through the end of this year and into next year to create enough blendstock to achieve the lower sulfur content the 0 5 content they will try to shift their yield away from gas toward diesel but they re not going to be able to do enough mix shift to create enough blendstock without running hard that s what it looks like to us right now john roberts ubs analyst and then secondly in the materials technology segment can you give us a little more color around the 20 plus growth in the consumer and pharma applications hudson la force president and chief executive officer sure this is one of our focused growth segments i think we ve commented over the last year or so about our efforts to shift mix away from some lower value segments into the higher value segments and in consumer pharma broadly and in some of the individual segments within that business are attractive to us both from a growth rate perspective and a margin perspective and we ve been shifting r d dollars in that direction we ve been shifting commercial resources into that direction john roberts ubs analyst will the anniversary some step up and obviously i don t think you re going to maintain this kind of high growth rate for a long period or maybe you re early stage ramp hudson la force president and chief executive officer no this is if you think about thank you that s a good clarifying question john if you think about the sales growth guidance we ve given for mt we ve said mid single digits some segments will grow faster some will grow slower overtime i would expect the consumer pharma business to grow high single digits overtime in any one quarter that might be higher or lower jeremy made the comment in his remarks about order timing between q1 and q2 one of the reasons why the q1 growth was so high in that segment was one of these order timing points an order that we thought would come in q2 came in q1 instead and it was in that segment john roberts ubs analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of kevin mccarthy with vertical research your line is open kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst yes good morning hudson la force president and chief executive officer hi kevin kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst i was wondering if you could comment on your fcc business it looks like the price realizations continue to flow through nicely what are you seeing with regard to mix there and i m asking because we ve observed propylene prices come down i don t know 40 or so over the last six months are you seeing any change in behavior among your customers in terms of grades or mix of premium products there hudson la force president and chief executive officer we haven t kevin and if anything we ve seen the demand for propylene max products continue to grow the one thing i ll add thinking about the point you raised about propylene pricing the customers that really most of our customers that really want to maximize propylene are doing it for strategic reasons not just opportunistic reasons they re looking to maximize propylene for a downstream petrochemical operations and so they re not going to be sensitive to changes in propylene values kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst okay that s great color and then second one to ask about the art joint venture the equity earnings here it dipped a little bit i know that business can be lumpy from time to time what is your outlook for the second quarter and beyond in terms of hpc volume and order books hudson la force president and chief executive officer yeah great question kevin i always think about the art business on an annual basis because it is very very lumpy and the timing of the lumps seems to be different every year when we look at the whole year we re looking at strong high single digit volume growth and high single digits earnings growth as well kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst okay thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of christopher parkinson with credit suisse your line is open christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you i understand your 1 to 2 long term guidance range for catalyst pricing but can you just dig a little bit more into your price or value strategy how that s going competitive environment by region and just whether or not you believe there are any large intermediate term opportunities to attain above average price mix uplift particularly as a result of new products thank you hudson la force president and chief executive officer thanks chris when we look at the long term and when we say that we are thinking the five year term of our financial framework that 2016 2021 financial framework that we have we do expect 1 to 2 pricing throughout that time period it s going to be higher some years maybe lower other years for the last three i m looking at jeremy three maybe four quarters now we ve reported better than 200 basis points pricing in fcc catalysts and i expect that to continue certainly as we look into the rest of this year that reflects some product mix to the second part of your question the propylene max catalysts are high value catalyst for our customers and that s part of what we re benefiting from as we shift our product mix in that direction and we see a stronger demand growth for those types of products the relative demand growth for propylene max catalysts versus regular catalysts is probably 3x within our business christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst yes and just a quick follow up just given the reduction in leverage toward at least the high end of your target can you just comment on your appetite for m a large and small and whether or not there are any licensing of assets still out there thank you hudson la force president and chief executive officer okay yes chris no i we still remain very active thinking about m a opportunities the appetite that we have for strategic bolt ons like the ones we ve seen we ve been able to do over the last few years remains good we re doing work in catalysts and in materials technologies and while we have said we want to get our leverage back below 3 times this year that objective would not stand in the way of us doing a smart strategic bolt on christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of robert koort with goldman sachs your line is open chris evans goldman sachs analyst yes good morning everyone this is chris evans on for bob just regarding your second quarter guidance you re pointing toward the lowest eps growth rate in sometime now and realizing that you re lapping the albemarle acquisition and flagged timing but surprised the expectation is a little bit better given the trend in fcc pricing and potential mix benefits from to korea coming up is there anything else we re missing in there hudson la force president and chief executive officer q2 is the toughest inflation and currency quarter for us and when we look at the full year we feel good about our 10 to 12 guidance eps growth guidance but as you look across the four quarters and q2 will be the weaker year over year growth quarter for us the biggest issue is it is the peak quarter for us on year over year inflation and on currency chris evans goldman sachs analyst great and then our hpc plant i believe is coming up in the fourth quarter and i think previously you ve said it should be pretty well sold out to start how should we think about the potential financial impact of grace and if you can t give specific financial guidance around that could you contextualize it maybe in broader terms like you know how much tonnage of catalyst from that versus your current inaudible hudson la force president and chief executive officer yes the first point i think is we expect this to start up late in the year with really no financial benefit to 2019 all of the benefit will come in 2020 we ll be more specific when we give our 2020 expectations later this year but this is it s a significant increase in capacity i think i ve said once before it s big but not huge or something like that it s designed to supply a couple years of growth and provide enough tonnage for us to supply a couple of years of growth chris evans goldman sachs analyst is there a way you can give percentage increase in your tonnage for art hudson la force president and chief executive officer we ll give that to you when we get to 2020 when we get to give in our 2020 numbers i don t want to get ahead of myself chris evans goldman sachs analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mike harrison with seaport global securities your line is open mike harrison seaport global securities analyst hi good morning hudson la force president and chief executive officer hi mike mike harrison seaport global securities analyst hudson was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the mto weakness that you mentioned just wondering if china is still committed to this realm for olefin supply or are they seeing alternatives that are getting more attractive versus the mto realm hudson la force president and chief executive officer well i from a broad market perspective there s a lot of capacity in place in china for the most part those units are running and they are trying to use this technology as a way to better meet their olefins requirements internally the country has an objective of being more self sufficient in olefins and polyolefins for us our goal in all of our businesses is to make sure we re achieving the right balance between growth and profitability and that s true in china as it is any place else we haven t gotten the historically we haven t gotten the margins that we wanted to get in this business we don t want to get growth just for the sake of growth and so we re working to find the right balance between growth and profitability in this market mike harrison seaport global securities analyst interesting alright and then was also wondering just in terms of the outlook for fcc with the large middle eastern customer coming back on stream how should we think about that affecting volume and mix and can you also comment on whether there are some additional costs any kind of unusual costs associated with restarting the deliveries there hudson la force president and chief executive officer mike our strategic intent is to monetize the restart of this operation through mix you ll see it in mix rather than in volume and that benefit will start to materialize in q2 mike harrison seaport global securities analyst all right thanks very much hudson la force president and chief executive officer you bet operator your next question comes from the line of laurence alexander with jefferies your line is open daniel rizzo jefferies analyst hi everyone this is dan rizzo on for laurence you mentioned inflation kind of peaking in q2 i was wondering if you could provide color on exactly what what where the inflation is coming from and the outlook as the year progresses hudson la force president and chief executive officer we re seeing it in metals we re seeing it in caustic remember this is a year over year comparison on a sequential basis we do expect that cost to start to improve in the second half daniel rizzo jefferies analyst okay and then i think you said before that in materials technologies that you re seen strengthen in europe i was just wondering like because i mean macro conditions as reported by others is showing some blackluster to this weak in that region i was just wondering why you guys are or how you guys are outperforming if it s just not something you re seeing and it s just given the product mix or what what s happening there hudson la force president and chief executive officer yes it s we ve had others ask us the same question and i don t there is not any one end market or segment that i would point to i think it is a relative concept we had pretty modest expectations for europe and they did outperform we ve invested a lot in commercial excellence we re much more effective at managing our sales pipelines we re much more focused on driving commercial performance and i think some of it is just that but it s not a big difference it s enough to note but some of it is against weak expectations for europe daniel rizzo jefferies analyst okay thank you very much operator operator instructions your next question comes to the line of mike sison with keybanc your line is open michael sison keybanc analyst hey guys nice start to the year hudson la force president and chief executive officer thanks mike michael sison keybanc analyst hudson thinking about fcc in terms of your operating rates are you pretty full loud and what s the opportunity to start maybe shaving some of the lower margin business and looking at bigger projects or higher margin projects going forward hudson la force president and chief executive officer mike just to clarify you said fcc fluid catalytic cracking michael sison keybanc analyst yes hudson la force president and chief executive officer yeah okay good i just want to make sure i understood no i we re running hard our intent in this business our strategic intent in this business is to grow with the market and the market grows low single digit we have the capacity we need to grow in line with that market growth rate we are actively working to shift mix within that portfolio and we work customer mix we work product mix one of the earlier questions was on the advantage of maximizing propylene catalysts versus other catalysts and as we move through the course of this year we ll continue to do that the big customer that restarted in q1 as i commented on a moment ago we ll monetize that through mix rather than through big volume growth michael sison keybanc analyst great and then could you maybe spend a little bit time on specialty catalyst it s the organic growth rate high single digits not a lot of businesses are doing that could you maybe break down each of the pieces of that business and where you see the growth this year and potentially longer term hudson la force president and chief executive officer sure i appreciate the question mike so we do see high single digit growth in this business it s coming from the polyethylene side it s coming from the polypropylene side it s coming from licensing and it reflects a couple of different things i think there s a strong underlying growth rate in this business plastics are still growing 4 to 5 at least polyolefin plastics are still growing at that rate we get a growth benefit on top of that because of licensing not just the licensing revenue itself but i think the licensing capability gives us an advantage even when we re selling catalyst it just it changes the relationship with our customers in a positive way and i think it gives us an advantage in catalysts the other important part of the higher growth rate is the breadth of our portfolio with the acquisitions that we ve made over well i guess it s closer to 6 years now 5 5 years three big acquisitions we ve built out a very complete very comprehensive catalyst portfolio on both polyethylene and polypropylene it makes us a more valued a more valuable innovation partner to our customers and we ve learned a lot about catalyst technology and innovation by adopting the best practices of the businesses we ve acquired with the early ones the unipol acquisition and the basf acquisition we re far along in terms of those acquisitions benefiting our r d pipeline and so forth with the acquisition we made last year we re really just getting started on capitalizing on the r d synergies and the commercial synergies michael sison keybanc analyst got it thank you hudson la force president and chief executive officer i m very high on this business and it s a good strategic business it s in a good strategic spot with good growth opportunities michael sison keybanc analyst great thanks hudson operator operator instructions we have a follow up question from mike harrison from seaport global securities your line is now open mike harrison seaport global securities analyst hi just one quick additional question you announced the collaboration with technipfmc on fcc technology in that max propylene segment i was just wondering if you could help us understand how this dcc technology fits in with your existing max propylene catalyst and how that helps to enhance your position within fcc hudson la force president and chief executive officer it really is what you just said mike it s a way to enhance our technical capability in the max propylene segment the dcc process technology is a max propylene technology the idea is for us with catalyst expertise and techninp with process expertise to collaborate instead of us innovating on process and catalyst separately to innovate together and understand the interrelationship between the process and the mechanics on the one hand and the catalyst on the other it s something that were obviously just getting started with but we find it very very interesting mike harrison seaport global securities analyst all right thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of chris kapsch from loop capital your line is now open christopher kapsch loop capital markets analyst yeah good morning i had a follow up question on hudson your comments about your discussions with customers refining customers around how they their configurations going into and ahead of imo 2020 i think we all understand that there is going to be more hpc processing i think you said though they expect to maybe ship the yield slate a little bit from gas toward diesel to build some blend stock can you just talk about if that s the way plays out what do you think the implications are for the fcc unit at the refiners and therefore implications for either fcc demand or fcc mix over the balance of 2019 and then into 2020 thank you hudson la force president and chief executive officer yeah chris thanks for the question the we think they re going to run their fcc units hard this year to create enough basically to create enough blend stock and that s obviously good for us there will be some catalyst reformulation there is not a big profitability difference between gasoline oriented catalyst or diesel oriented catalyst so we don t expect in the fact that way but we do expect refiners to run hard in general and we expect them to run their fcc units hard christopher kapsch loop capital markets analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john mcnulty from bmo capitals your line is open john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst yeah thanks for taking my question with regard to the materials tech business you showed some solid volumes and some pricing in it it really didn t flow through in the margins and i guess you ve articulated there was certainly some investment there i guess can you speak to the level of investment that you re putting in there and when we might be able to see an inflection point in terms of how the margins progress higher going forward hudson la force president and chief executive officer yeah john thanks for the question we re investing in the manufacturing plants to make sure that we create the capacity we need to sustain this growth rates that not just new capacity but debottlenecking and gms type projects and so forth and so on so some of that investment is in the gross margin line and some of it is at the opex level as we ve added a sales and marketing resources i think we called it commercial excellence in the script to make sure that we ve got the commercial organization we need to continue to drive that growth we are still in a net investment mode at this point i think by the second half of this year that ll start to turn around john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst got it thanks very much and then i guess i was a little i was a little curious and you indicated the raw material headwinds we re going to be at least year over year the fiercest this quarter is that just because of the timing of when some of the hedges you have in place kind of roll through and maybe you know we re kind of seeing some of the heavier costs from last year still kind of in there because it does seem a little bit odd given a lot of the raws that you re tied to seem like they re actually lower at this point so i guess how should we think about that hudson la force president and chief executive officer well it s what has happened is on a cash basis to be fully transparent on a cash basis the cash costs probably peaked in q1 but a lot of that cost gives inventory then it ll come through in q2 john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst got it okay that makes perfect sense thanks very much for the color hudson la force president and chief executive officer thanks john operator and we have a follow up question from robert koort with goldman sachs your line is open chris evans goldman sachs analyst yeah thanks just wanted to follow up in mt could you give a little color on i guess the little bit of a step down you saw in sales of the coatings customers i think you flagged that china in a release and you read on the second quarter or beyond hudson la force president and chief executive officer we so on a year over year basis the china coatings market was weak for us in q4 and in q1 we see it as stabilizing right now and so when we look sequentially from q1 to q2 we see if least post chinese new year we see a more stabilized market but on a year over year basis we did definitely see a headwind in q4 and q1 chris evans goldman sachs analyst and then in your refining tech business flagged in the mto declines offsetting favorable price and volumes for fcc which my understanding is a much larger business than mto so in that context i guess could you contextualize how big of decline you actually saw in mto to partially offset the favorable business you saw in fcc hudson la force president and chief executive officer yes i jeremy have we quantified mto before jeremy rohen vice president corporate development and investor relations no hudson la force president and chief executive officer chris your intuition is right it is a smaller business significantly smaller business in fcc catalyst and your intuition is right it s a fairly large percentage change on a smaller business to show up at the total level chris evans goldman sachs analyst great thank you operator i m showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference back to jeremy rohen jeremy rohen vice president corporate development and investor relations thank you bella thank you everyone for your time today and your interesting in grace we look

toronto business wire sherritt international corporation sherritt or the corporation tsx s a world leader in the mining and hydrometallurgical refining of nickel and cobalt from lateritic ores today reported its financial results for the three months ended march 31 2019 all amounts are in canadian currency unless otherwise noted ceo commentary initiatives launched in 2018 to improve operational effectiveness increase mining equipment availability and improve ore access paved the way for the moa jv s highest ever first quarter nickel and cobalt production total said david pathe president and ceo of sherritt international our record production results in q1 2019 were negatively impacted however by the dramatic 70 decline in realized cobalt prices contributing to considerably lower by product revenue and higher ndcc than we have experienced in recent quarters our q1 progress was also impeded by the disappointing collections on our cuban overdue receivables mr pathe added since the start of q2 2019 we have seen a number of positive developments including the resumption of drilling on block 10 the recovery of cobalt prices by more than 15 and the continued draw down of class 1 nickel inventories combined these trends signal a more favorable outlook for our prospects for the balance of 2019 and beyond q1 highlights sherritt s share of finished nickel production at the moa joint venture moa jv in q1 2019 was 4 397 tonnes up 54 from last year while finished cobalt was 426 tonnes up 27 the combined nickel and cobalt total for q1 2019 marks the moa jv s highest ever first quarter production results q1 2019 adjusted ebitda 1 was negative 1 2 million down from positive adjusted ebitda of 35 5 million in q1 2018 the decrease was due to a number of factors including a 70 year over year decline in realized cobalt prices and lower contributions from the oil and gas business as a result of decreased net working interest production stemming from maturing oil fields and a lower profit share was negative 1 2 million down from positive adjusted ebitda of 35 5 million in q1 2018 the decrease was due to a number of factors including a 70 year over year decline in realized cobalt prices and lower contributions from the oil and gas business as a result of decreased net working interest production stemming from maturing oil fields and a lower profit share net direct cash cost ndcc 1 at the moa jv for q1 2019 was us 4 53 per pound of finished nickel sold up from us 2 06 per pound for q1 2018 the increase reflects the negative impact that sharply declining cobalt prices had on by product credits including the settlement of approximately 200 tonnes of provisionally priced cobalt sales 100 basis from q4 2018 the variance between q1 2019 cobalt reference and realized prices that resulted from provisional pricing adjustments negatively impacted ndcc by approximately us 0 40 per pound at the moa jv for q1 2019 was us 4 53 per pound of finished nickel sold up from us 2 06 per pound for q1 2018 the increase reflects the negative impact that sharply declining cobalt prices had on by product credits including the settlement of approximately 200 tonnes of provisionally priced cobalt sales 100 basis from q4 2018 the variance between q1 2019 cobalt reference and realized prices that resulted from provisional pricing adjustments negatively impacted ndcc by approximately us 0 40 per pound sherritt ended q1 2019 with cash cash equivalents and short term investments of 177 3 million down from 207 0 million at the end of 2018 the decrease was due to the timing of capital expenditures interest paid on outstanding debentures and changes to working capital including lower than expected cuban energy receipts reached an agreement in principle subject to final approvals with its cuban partners on a payment plan to reduce overdue energy receivables final approval of the agreement and payment schedule is expected shortly consistent with its previously announced strategy to no longer fund the ambatovy joint venture ambatovy jv sherritt elected to not fund its share of a us 45 million cash call and became a defaulting shareholder with reduced local influence and authority as a result the ambatovy jv is no longer considered an operating segment and its financial performance is not included in sherritt s combined or adjusted financial results developments subsequent to the quarter end resumed drilling on block 10 on april 1 using updated drilling parameters developed with the assistance of third party experts and the results of detailed lab analysis of rock cuttings collected previously the adoption of new drilling parameters will not result in any increases to planned capital spending previously disclosed for the oil and gas business any incremental capital spend at the oil and gas business in 2019 will be predicated on successful drill results on block 10 and collections on overdue receivables sherritt intends to explore partnerships for further investment in block 10 following completion of the current drilling which is expected in the second quarter of 2019 on april 17 the u s state department announced that effective may 2 2019 it will implement title iii of the helms burton act allowing u s citizens to bring lawsuits against foreign companies for using property that was nationalized by the cuban government beginning in 1959 sherritt has been working with its partners in cuba since 1994 producing nickel cobalt oil and gas and electricity and plans to continue to operate business as usual more

25 from the start of the year the recovery was driven by a number of factors including optimism that an international trade agreement between the u s and china would soon be reached underlying market fundamentals also contributed to the price recovery combined nickel inventories on the london metals exchange lme and the shanghai futures exchange at the end of q1 2019 totaled 191 292 tonnes down 13 from the combined total of 219 804 tonnes at the end of q4 2018 since the end of q1 2018 combined class 1 nickel inventories have declined by approximately 50 as demand continues to exceed available supply the nickel market is anticipated to be in a structural deficit in the coming years despite the recovery of prices since the start of 2019 the average reference price for nickel in q1 2019 was down 7 from last year declining from us 6 03 lb to us 5 62 lb nickel prices in april 2019 have averaged at us 5 85 lb and are currently trading on the lme at us 5 56 lb demand for nickel will continue to be driven by the stainless steel sector according to market research by cru stainless steel demand is expected to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 4 through 2022 with production emanating largely from china and indonesia demand for nickel particularly class 1 nickel from non stainless steel sectors is also expected to accelerate given the growth of the electric vehicle battery market class i nickel along with cobalt are key metals needed to manufacture electric vehicle batteries beyond 2019 a shortage of class 1 nickel is anticipated over the coming years since current market prices are below incentive levels needed to develop new nickel projects as a result no new class 1 nickel supply is expected to come on stream in the near term cobalt cobalt prices and demand experienced considerable softness and volatility in q1 2019 the reference price for q1 2019 was us 18 53 lb down 52 from us 39 01 lb for the same period of 2018 consistent with trends over the past several months the price decline was driven by increased supply of intermediate product from the democratic republic of congo as well as by the destocking of inventory by chinese consumers abundant available supply has recently resulted in cobalt producers selling product at significant discount to prevailing reference prices during the run up in prices from late 2017 through 2018 cobalt producers often sold cobalt at a premium to reference prices as consumers looked to lock supply since the start of april however cobalt prices have risen by approximately 15 as consumers renew purchasing activities the recent increase in cobalt prices is expected to be sustained through the balance of 2019 albeit with some volatility due to increased speculative interest growing demand from the electric vehicle battery market and persistent supply risk concerns linked to the democratic republic of congo which is currently the world s largest source of cobalt supply review of operations

adoption of ifrs 16 refer to note 4 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information the moa jv produced 4 397 tonnes of finished nickel in q1 2019 up 54 from 2 854 tonnes produced in q1 2018 growth was largely driven by the deployment of new mining equipment acquired throughout 2018 that resulted in improved ore access and reduced equipment downtime compared to the same period of last year in q1 2018 the moa jv s results were impacted by the highest level of rainfall at moa in more than 20 years and by transportation delays to the refinery in fort saskatchewan by the railway service provider efforts at improving ore access and mining equipment reliability at moa have been instrumental in increasing inventory stockpiles and reducing the impact that adverse weather conditions may have on future production finished cobalt production for q1 2019 was 426 tonnes up 27 from q1 2018 due to higher mixed sulphides availability the ratio of finished nickel production to cobalt production was higher in q1 2019 compared to last year as a result of a higher nickel to cobalt ratio in mixed sulphides produced at moa despite the change which is due to ore grade variability the nickel to cobalt ratio is consistent with historical norms combined nickel and cobalt production totals for q1 2019 represent the moa jv s highest ever first quarter production results second quarter production will be impacted however by the annual maintenance shutdown of the refinery in fort saskatchewan this year s shutdown is expected to be similar in duration to the prior years revenue for q1 2019 totaled 102 3 million up 6 from last year the increase was largely due to higher sales volume of nickel and cobalt offset however by a 70 decline in the cobalt realized price over q1 2018 the realized price decline in q1 2019 was driven by lower consumer demand and the settlement of provisional q4 2018 pricing the average realized price for nickel in q1 2019 was 7 51 lb down 4 from last year mining processing and refining mpr costs for q1 2019 were us 5 59 lb up 6 from us 5 26 lb for q1 2018 due to the impacts of higher energy prices and higher utilization of moa mixed sulphides relative to third party feeds although partly offset by the impact of higher sales volume ndcc in q1 2019 was us 4 53 lb up from us 2 06 lb for the same period last year the increase was largely due to lower by product revenue stemming from lower cobalt prices and the settlement of approximately 200 tonnes of provisionally priced cobalt sales 100 basis from q4 2018 the variance between q1 2019 cobalt reference and realized prices that resulted from provisional pricing adjustments negatively impacted ndcc by approximately 0 40 per pound the decrease in cobalt by product revenue was partly offset by lower third party feed costs and a higher contribution from fertilizer sales sustaining capital spending in q1 2019 was 14 0 million up from 4 5 million in q1 2018 as the moa jv continued its new mining equipment initiative aimed at improving equipment reliability reducing maintenance costs and improving ore accessibility consistent with its efforts to improve operational effectiveness the moa jv also commissioned a new slurry preparation plant dump pocket at moa in q1 2019 that is designed to improve ore screening and processing the moa jv contributed a

barrels of oil per day bopd down 20 from 5 572 bopd for q1 2018 lower production in 2019 was primarily due to natural reservoir declines and the absence of new development drilling revenue in q1 2019 was 9 0 million down 50 when compared to last year the decline was attributable to lower total net working interest production due to the impact of the decrease in profit oil percentage to 6 from 45 with the renewal of the puerto escondido yumuri psc starting in q2 2018 the decline was partially offset by a higher usgc hsfo reference oil price and by a weaker canadian dollar relative to the u s currency unit operating costs in cuba in q1 2019 were 21 19 per barrel up 2 from q1 2018 driven largely by reduced production costs were also negatively impacted by a stronger u s dollar relative to the canadian currency expenses in cuba are generally denominated in u s currency capital spending in q1 2019 was 5 7 million up 148 from q1 2018 exploration capital spending was higher in q1 2019 as a

cash call requested by the ambatovy jv as a result of this decision sherritt became a defaulting shareholder losing its voting rights at the ambatovy jv board level and incurring a reduction in influence and authority at the local level given these developments sherritt no longer considers the ambatovy jv as an operating segment for accounting purposes and will no longer present ambatovy s financial results as part of sherritt s combined financial results including combined revenue adjusted ebitda and combined cash flow the accounting treatment for the ambatovy jv for financial statement purposes has not changed finished nickel production in q1 2019 was 920 tonnes and finished cobalt production was 81 tonnes up 38 and 65 respectively from q1 2018 production in q1 2019 was impacted by an accident and fatality in the hydrogen plant that resulted in a full shutdown of the ambatovy plant for a period of 10 days to undertake safety reviews and complete repairs production in q1 2019 was also impacted by unplanned maintenance activities in the acid plants as well as by equipment reliability issues in q1 2018 production was impacted by cyclone ava that necessitated a plant shutdown of approximately one month due to damage to equipment and facilities ndcc in q1 2019 was us 5 70 lb up 7 from q1 2018 the increase was attributable to lower cobalt by product credits resulting from lower cobalt prices which more than offset the impact of higher nickel and cobalt sales volumes capital spend at ambatovy based on sherritt s ownership interest was 2 2 million in q1 2019 capital spending in 2019 will be largely aimed at improving the reliability of the acid plants replacement of mobile equipment at the plant site fixing corroded equipment and restoring general plant and equipment 2019 review of strategic priorities the table below lists sherritt s strategic priorities for 2019 and summarizes how the corporation has performed against those priorities on a

update newmont s capital efficient project pipeline supports stable production with improving margins and mine life near term development capital projects are presented below funding for ahafo mill expansion and quecher main has been approved and these projects are in execution additional projects represent incremental improvements to production and cost guidance internal rates of return irr on these projects are calculated at a 1 200 gold price ahafo mill expansion africa is designed to maximize resource value by improving production margins and accelerating stockpile processing the project also supports profitable development of ahafo s highly prospective underground resources both first production and commercial production are expected in the fourth quarter of 2019 the expansion is expected to increase average annual gold production by between 75 000 and 100 000 ounces per year for the first five years beginning in 2020 capital costs for the project are estimated between 140 and 180 million with expenditure of approximately 35 to 45 million in 2019 the project has an irr of more than 20 percent the ahafo mill expansion together with the company s recently completed subika underground project will improve ahafo s production to between 550 000 and 650 000 ounces per year for the first five full years of production 2020 to 2024 during this period ahafo s cas is expected to be between 650 and 750 per ounce and aisc is expected to be between 800 and 900 per ounce this represents average production improvement of between 200 000 and 300 000 ounces at cas improvement of

percent newmont outlook newmont issued its 2019 and longer term outlook in december 2018 and the figures did not include the impact of the newmont goldcorp transaction which closed on april 18 2019 or the proposed nevada joint venture the outlook reflected steady gold production and ongoing investment in its operating assets and most promising growth prospects newmont does not include development projects that have not yet been funded or reached execution stage in its outlook which represents upside to guidance attributable gold production is expected to be 5 2 million ounces in 2019 primarily driven by a full year of higher grade production from the recently completed subika underground project in africa production is expected to be 4 9 million ounces in 2020 and longer term production is expected to remain stable at between 4 4 and 4 9 million ounces per year through 2023 excluding development projects which have yet to be approved north america production is expected to be 1 9 million ounces in 2019 as higher grade production from northwest exodus and twin underground are offset by the depletion of silverstar ore at carlin and lower gold production at phoenix as mining shifts to higher copper grade ore from the bonanza pit production remains at 1 9 million ounces in 2020 and 2021 as higher grades at long canyon following the stripping campaign help offset lower grades at cc v north american production may be impacted by approximately 70 000 ounces following the gold quarry wall slip but mine plan optimization work is ongoing the company continues to pursue profitable growth opportunities at carlin long canyon cc v and galore creek south america production is expected to be 650 000 ounces in 2019 as productivity improvements at merian offset the transition to harder ore production is expected to decrease to 560 000 ounces in 2020 and 450 000 ounces in 2021 as the tapado oeste pit and yanacocha laybacks are mined out and merian transitions from saprolite to hard rock the company continues to advance near mine growth opportunities at merian and both oxide and sulfide potential at yanacocha australia production is expected to be 1 5 million ounces in 2019 with higher grades and throughput and productivity gains at tanami offset by lower mining rates at kcgm following the wall slips and the continuation of stripping at boddington production is expected to be 1 5 million ounces in 2020 and 1 6 million ounces in 2021 as boddington accesses higher grade ore kcgm s near term production has been lowered due to the wall slips but optimization work continues to recover the impacted ounces as part of the broader golden mile growth study the company continues to advance studies for a second expansion at tanami and expects to reach a full funds decision in the second half of 2019 africa production is expected to be 1 1 million ounces in 2019 with a full year of production from subika underground higher grades from the subika open pit and improved mill throughput in the second half of the year with the ahafo mill expansion production is expected to be 930 000 ounces in 2020 with lower grades at akyem and subika open pit which are partially offset by higher underground grades at ahafo and a full year of production from the ahafo mill expansion in 2021 production is expected to be 1 million ounces as akyem reaches higher grades near the bottom of the pit the company continues to advance the ahafo north project and other prospective surface and underground opportunities gold cost outlook cas is expected to be 710 per ounce for 2019 following higher production at ahafo lower mining costs at yanacocha and lower operational costs at tanami with the completion of the tanami power project the company continues to implement full potential cost and efficiency improvements and advance technology initiatives to offset inflation and input cost pressures cas is expected to be 750 per ounce for 2020 and between 690 and 740 per ounce longer term through 2023 aisc is expected to be 935 per ounce in 2019 on improved cas in africa and south america partially offset by higher sustaining capital aisc is expected

management uses free cash flow as a non gaap measure to analyze cash flows generated from operations free cash flow is net cash provided by used in operating activities less net cash provided by used in operating activities of discontinued operations less additions to property plant and mine development as presented on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows the company believes free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing the company s performance with its competitors although free cash flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies the company s calculation of free cash flow is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies the presentation of non gaap free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity as those terms are defined by gaap and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs the company s definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore the company believes it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to the company s condensed consolidated statements of cash flows the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by used in operating activities which the company believes to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash provided by used in investing activities and

plant and mine development which is included in the company s computation of free cash flow costs applicable to sales per ounce pound costs applicable to sales per ounce pound are non gaap financial measures these measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales of gold and copper by gold ounces or copper pounds sold respectively these measures are calculated for the periods presented on a consolidated basis costs applicable to sales per ounce pound statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap the measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap other companies may calculate these measures differently the following tables reconcile these non gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures costs applicable to sales per ounce three months ended march 31 2019 2018 costs applicable to sales 1 935 982 gold sold thousand ounces 1 338 1 312 costs applicable to sales per ounce 2 701 748 1

the three months ended march 31 2019 and 2018 respectively 2 per pound measures may not recalculate due to rounding all in sustaining costs newmont has developed a metric that expands on gaap measures such as cost of goods sold and non gaap measures such as costs applicable to sales per ounce to provide visibility into the economics of our mining operations related to expenditures operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from our continuing operations current gaap measures used in the mining industry such as cost of goods sold do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover develop and sustain production therefore we believe that all in sustaining costs is a non gaap measure that provides additional information to management investors and analysts that aid in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and provides investors visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production all in sustaining cost aisc amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap the measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles policies applied and in accounting frameworks such as in international financial reporting standards ifrs or by reflecting the benefit from selling non gold metals as a reduction to aisc differences may also arise related to definitional differences of sustaining versus development i e non sustaining capital activities based upon each company s internal policies the following disclosure provides information regarding the adjustments made in determining the all in sustaining costs measure costs applicable to sales includes all direct and indirect costs related to current production incurred to execute the current mine plan we exclude certain exceptional or unusual amounts from costs applicable to sales cas such as significant revisions to recovery amounts cas includes by product credits from certain metals obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore body cas is accounted for on an accrual basis and excludes depreciation and amortization and reclamation and remediation which is consistent with our presentation of cas on the condensed consolidated statements of operations in determining aisc only the cas associated with producing and selling an ounce of gold is included in the measure therefore the amount of gold cas included in aisc is derived from the cas presented in the company s condensed consolidated statements of operations less the amount of cas attributable to the production of copper at our phoenix and boddington mines the copper cas at those mine sites is disclosed in note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements the allocation of cas between gold and copper at the phoenix and boddington mines is based upon the relative sales value of gold and copper produced during the period reclamation costs includes accretion expense related to reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the related asset retirement cost arc for the company s operating properties accretion related to the reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the arc assets for reclamation does not reflect annual cash outflows but are calculated in accordance with gaap the accretion and amortization reflect the periodic costs of reclamation associated with current production and are therefore included in the measure the allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and copper at the phoenix and boddington mines advanced projects research and development and exploration includes incurred expenses related to projects that are designed to sustain current production and exploration we note that as current resources are depleted exploration and advanced projects are necessary for us to replace the depleting reserves or enhance the recovery and processing of the current reserves to sustain production at existing operations as these costs relate to sustaining our production and are considered a continuing cost of a mining company these costs are included in the aisc measure these costs are derived from the advanced projects research and development and exploration amounts presented in the condensed consolidated statements of operations less incurred expenses related to the development of new operations or related to major projects at existing operations where these projects will materially benefit the operation in the future the allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and copper at the phoenix and boddington mines general and administrative includes costs related to administrative tasks not directly related to current production but rather related to support our corporate structure and fulfill our obligations to operate as a public company including these expenses in the aisc metric provides visibility of the impact that general and administrative activities have on current operations and profitability on a per ounce basis other expense net we exclude certain exceptional or unusual expenses from other expense net such as restructuring as these are not indicative to sustaining our current operations furthermore this adjustment to other expense net is also consistent with the nature of the adjustments made to net income loss attributable to newmont stockholders as disclosed in the company s non gaap financial measure adjusted net income loss the allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and copper at the phoenix and boddington mines treatment and refining costs includes costs paid to smelters for treatment and refining of our concentrates to produce the salable metal these costs are presented net as a reduction of sales on our condensed consolidated statements of operations sustaining capital and finance lease payments we determined sustaining capital and finance lease payments as those capital expenditures and finance lease payments that are

sherritt reports record first quarter nickel and cobalt production at moa jv tweet sherritt international corporation sherritt or the corporation tsx s a world leader in the mining and hydrometallurgical refining of nickel and cobalt from lateritic ores today reported its financial results for the three months ended march 31 2019 all amounts are in canadian currency unless otherwise noted ceo commentary initiatives launched in 2018 to improve operational effectiveness increase mining equipment availability and improve ore access paved the way for the moa jv s highest ever first quarter nickel and cobalt production total said david pathe president and ceo of sherritt international our record production results in q1 2019 were negatively impacted however by the dramatic 70 decline in realized cobalt prices contributing to considerably lower by product revenue and higher ndcc than we have experienced in recent quarters our q1 progress was also impeded by the disappointing collections on our cuban overdue receivables mr pathe added since the start of q2 2019 we have seen a number of positive developments including the resumption of drilling on block 10 the recovery of cobalt prices by more than 15 and the continued draw down of class 1 nickel inventories combined these trends signal a more favorable outlook for our prospects for the balance of 2019 and beyond q1 highlights sherritt s share of finished nickel production at the moa joint venture moa jv in q1 2019 was 4 397 tonnes up 54 from last year while finished cobalt was 426 tonnes up 27 the combined nickel and cobalt total for q1 2019 marks the moa jv s highest ever first quarter production results q1 2019 adjusted ebitda 1 was negative 1 2 million down from positive adjusted ebitda of 35 5 million in q1 2018 the decrease was due to a number of factors including a 70 year over year decline in realized cobalt prices and lower contributions from the oil and gas business as a result of decreased net working interest production stemming from maturing oil fields and a lower profit share was negative 1 2 million down from positive adjusted ebitda of 35 5 million in q1 2018 the decrease was due to a number of factors including a 70 year over year decline in realized cobalt prices and lower contributions from the oil and gas business as a result of decreased net working interest production stemming from maturing oil fields and a lower profit share net direct cash cost ndcc 1 at the moa jv for q1 2019 was us 4 53 per pound of finished nickel sold up from us 2 06 per pound for q1 2018 the increase reflects the negative impact that sharply declining cobalt prices had on by product credits including the settlement of approximately 200 tonnes of provisionally priced cobalt sales 100 basis from q4 2018 the variance between q1 2019 cobalt reference and realized prices that resulted from provisional pricing adjustments negatively impacted ndcc by approximately us 0 40 per pound at the moa jv for q1 2019 was us 4 53 per pound of finished nickel sold up from us 2 06 per pound for q1 2018 the increase reflects the negative impact that sharply declining cobalt prices had on by product credits including the settlement of approximately 200 tonnes of provisionally priced cobalt sales 100 basis from q4 2018 the variance between q1 2019 cobalt reference and realized prices that resulted from provisional pricing adjustments negatively impacted ndcc by approximately us 0 40 per pound sherritt ended q1 2019 with cash cash equivalents and short term investments of 177 3 million down from 207 0 million at the end of 2018 the decrease was due to the timing of capital expenditures interest paid on outstanding debentures and changes to working capital including lower than expected cuban energy receipts reached an agreement in principle subject to final approvals with its cuban partners on a payment plan to reduce overdue energy receivables final approval of the agreement and payment schedule is expected shortly consistent with its previously announced strategy to no longer fund the ambatovy joint venture ambatovy jv sherritt elected to not fund its share of a us 45 million cash call and became a defaulting shareholder with reduced local influence and authority as a result the ambatovy jv is no longer considered an operating segment and its financial performance is not included in sherritt s combined or adjusted financial results developments subsequent to the quarter end resumed drilling on block 10 on april 1 using updated drilling parameters developed with the assistance of third party experts and the results of detailed lab analysis of rock cuttings collected previously the adoption of new drilling parameters will not result in any increases to planned capital spending previously disclosed for the oil and gas business any incremental capital spend at the oil and gas business in 2019 will be predicated on successful drill results on block 10 and collections on overdue receivables sherritt intends to explore partnerships for further investment in block 10 following completion of the current drilling which is expected in the second quarter of 2019 on april 17 the u s state department announced that effective may 2 2019 it will implement title iii of the helms burton act allowing u s citizens to bring lawsuits against foreign companies for using property that was nationalized by the cuban government beginning in 1959 sherritt has been working with its partners in cuba since 1994 producing nickel cobalt oil and gas and electricity and plans to continue to operate business as usual more details on title iii and its potential risks and uncertainties can be found in sherritt s annual information form dated february

8 million in interest payments on outstanding debentures and 7 8 million in capital expenditures principally earmarked for resumption of drilling on block 10 these outflows were partly offset by a 3 3

q1 2019 closing at us 5 90 lb on march 29 up almost 25 from the start of the year the recovery was driven by a number of factors including optimism that an international trade agreement between the u s and china would soon be reached underlying market fundamentals also contributed to the price recovery combined nickel inventories on the london metals exchange lme and the shanghai futures exchange at the end of q1 2019 totaled 191 292 tonnes down 13 from the combined total of 219 804 tonnes at the end of q4 2018 since the end of q1 2018 combined class 1 nickel inventories have declined by approximately 50 as demand continues to exceed available supply the nickel market is anticipated to be in a structural deficit in the coming years despite the recovery of prices since the start of 2019 the average reference price for nickel in q1 2019 was down 7 from last year declining from us 6 03 lb to us 5 62 lb nickel prices in april 2019 have averaged at us 5 85 lb and are currently trading on the lme at us 5 56 lb demand for nickel will continue to be driven by the stainless steel sector according to market research by cru stainless steel demand is expected to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 4 through 2022 with production emanating largely from china and indonesia demand for nickel particularly class 1 nickel from non stainless steel sectors is also expected to accelerate given the growth of the electric vehicle battery market class i nickel along with cobalt are key metals needed to manufacture electric vehicle batteries beyond 2019 a shortage of class 1 nickel is anticipated over the coming years since current market prices are below incentive levels needed to develop new nickel projects as a result no new class 1 nickel supply is expected to come on stream in the near term cobalt cobalt prices and demand experienced considerable softness and volatility in q1 2019 the reference price for q1 2019 was us 18 53 lb down 52 from us 39 01 lb for the same period of 2018 consistent with trends over the past several months the price decline was driven by increased supply of intermediate product from the democratic republic of congo as well as by the destocking of inventory by chinese consumers abundant available supply has recently resulted in cobalt producers selling product at significant discount to prevailing reference prices during the run up in prices from late 2017 through 2018 cobalt producers often sold cobalt at a premium to reference prices as consumers looked to lock supply since the start of april however cobalt prices have risen by approximately 15 as consumers renew purchasing activities the recent increase in cobalt prices is expected to be sustained through the balance of 2019 albeit with some volatility due to increased speculative interest growing demand from the electric vehicle battery market and persistent supply risk concerns linked to the democratic republic of congo which is currently the world s

bulletin 3 excludes right of use assets recognized on adoption of ifrs 16 refer to note 4 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information the moa jv produced 4 397 tonnes of finished nickel in q1 2019 up 54 from 2 854 tonnes produced in q1 2018 growth was largely driven by the deployment of new mining equipment acquired throughout 2018 that resulted in improved ore access and reduced equipment downtime compared to the same period of last year in q1 2018 the moa jv s results were impacted by the highest level of rainfall at moa in more than 20 years and by transportation delays to the refinery in fort saskatchewan by the railway service provider efforts at improving ore access and mining equipment reliability at moa have been instrumental in increasing inventory stockpiles and reducing the impact that adverse weather conditions may have on future production finished cobalt production for q1 2019 was 426 tonnes up 27 from q1 2018 due to higher mixed sulphides availability the ratio of finished nickel production to cobalt production was higher in q1 2019 compared to last year as a result of a higher nickel to cobalt ratio in mixed sulphides produced at moa despite the change which is due to ore grade variability the nickel to cobalt ratio is consistent with historical norms combined nickel and cobalt production totals for q1 2019 represent the moa jv s highest ever first quarter production results second quarter production will be impacted however by the annual maintenance shutdown of the refinery in fort saskatchewan this year s shutdown is expected to be similar in duration to the prior years revenue for q1 2019 totaled 102 3 million up 6 from last year the increase was largely due to higher sales volume of nickel and cobalt offset however by a 70 decline in the cobalt realized price over q1 2018 the realized price decline in q1 2019 was driven by lower consumer demand and the settlement of provisional q4 2018 pricing the average realized price for nickel in q1 2019 was 7 51 lb down 4 from last year mining processing and refining mpr costs for q1 2019 were us 5 59 lb up 6 from us 5 26 lb for q1 2018 due to the impacts of higher energy prices and higher utilization of moa mixed sulphides relative to third party feeds although partly offset by the impact of higher sales volume ndcc in q1 2019 was us 4 53 lb up from us 2 06 lb for the same period last year the increase was largely due to lower by product revenue stemming from lower cobalt prices and the settlement of approximately 200 tonnes of provisionally priced cobalt sales 100 basis from q4 2018 the variance between q1 2019 cobalt reference and realized prices that resulted from provisional pricing adjustments negatively impacted ndcc by approximately 0 40 per pound the decrease in cobalt by product revenue was partly offset by lower third party feed costs and a higher contribution from fertilizer sales sustaining capital spending in q1 2019 was 14 0 million up from 4 5 million in q1 2018 as the moa jv continued its new mining equipment initiative aimed at improving equipment reliability reducing maintenance costs and improving ore accessibility consistent with its efforts to improve operational effectiveness the moa jv also commissioned a new slurry preparation plant dump pocket at moa in q1 2019 that is designed to improve

oil production in cuba in q1 2019 was 4 443 barrels of oil per day bopd down 20 from 5 572 bopd for q1 2018 lower production in 2019 was primarily due to natural reservoir declines and the absence of new development drilling revenue in q1 2019 was 9 0 million down 50 when compared to last year the decline was attributable to lower total net working interest production due to the impact of the decrease in profit oil percentage to 6 from 45 with the renewal of the puerto escondido yumuri psc starting in q2 2018 the decline was partially offset by a higher usgc hsfo reference oil price and by a weaker canadian dollar relative to the u s currency unit operating costs in cuba in q1 2019 were 21 19 per barrel up 2 from q1 2018 driven largely by reduced production costs were also negatively

exploration capital spending was higher in q1 2019 as a result of the sourcing of materials and supplies in advance of resumed drilling on block 10 free cash flow for q1 2019 was impacted by the

sherritt announced on march 6 2019 that it would not fund a cash call requested by the ambatovy jv as a result of this decision sherritt became a defaulting shareholder losing its voting rights at the ambatovy jv board level and incurring a reduction in influence and authority at the local level given these developments sherritt no longer considers the ambatovy jv as an operating segment for accounting purposes and will no longer present ambatovy s financial results as part of sherritt s combined financial results including combined revenue adjusted ebitda and combined cash flow the accounting treatment for the ambatovy jv for financial statement purposes has not changed finished nickel production in q1 2019 was 920 tonnes and finished cobalt production was 81 tonnes up 38 and 65 respectively from q1 2018 production in q1 2019 was impacted by an accident and fatality in the hydrogen plant that resulted in a full shutdown of the ambatovy plant for a period of 10 days to undertake safety reviews and complete repairs production in q1 2019 was also impacted by unplanned maintenance activities in the acid plants as well as by equipment reliability issues in q1 2018 production was impacted by cyclone ava that necessitated a plant shutdown of approximately one month due to damage to equipment and facilities ndcc in q1 2019 was us 5 70 lb up 7 from q1 2018 the increase was attributable to lower cobalt by product credits resulting from lower cobalt prices which more than offset the impact of higher nickel and cobalt sales volumes capital spend at ambatovy

leveraging of the balance sheet within the context of a low commodity price environment sherritt s net debt at the end of q1 2019 was 560 million down from almost 2 billion at the end of 2016 the

about 30 basis points in addition we made positive gains in revenue quality international performance in this dynamic environment was strong in fact we expanded operating margins by improving currency neutral revenue yield and leveraging the flexibility of the network supply chain and freight outperformed our expectations with great execution to generate outstanding gains in operating profit we achieved the highest first quarter profit in the segment s history now i ll turn to the segments and give you greater detail in the us weather impacted all three months of the quarter and was a drag on both the top line and the bottom line results nonetheless volume and revenue for all products grew in the quarter average daily volume growth was led by the air services at nearly 8 total revenue quality improved on a year over year basis driven by continued growth in b2b volume and gains from smaller customers that we targeted with digital engagement strategy ups ground revenue per piece increased almost 3 driven by the balance and growth in b2b and b2c deliveries that we saw this quarter while air volume was up package characteristics customer mix and weather lowered revenue per piece yields overall we continue to make progress in transitioning to a higher quality revenue mix from targeted growth industries like healthcare manufacturing and e commerce on the expense side investments in our network are starting to pay off reducing growth in expense compared to recent periods as a result the us domestic segment achieved its lowest unit cost growth in many quarters us domestic operating profit was 694 million we estimate that weather diminished this quarter s operating profit by about 80 million impacting operating margin by about 70 basis points we are making progress with our investments in the us is the new automated facilities brought online in late 2018 delivered increased efficiency to the network now let s take a look at the international segment we delivered strong profit results while facing headwinds from changes in global trade and significant prior year growth international delivered its best first quarter operating profit of 612 million in part due to the efforts of managing cost tightly high growth in export daily volume in the first quarter of last year created tough comparisons on a two year stacked basis international exports achieved volume growth of nearly 12 led by europe and the americas europe s growth was primarily driven by inter region volume although results were impacted by the uncertainties around brexit as well as revenue management initiatives we implemented on low yielding volume asia also delivered positive volume growth driven by gains on virtually all lanes except asia to us trade lane on a currency neutral basis revenue per piece improved by 2 2 for export packages and 3 9 for international domestic these improvements were driven by asia and the americas due disciplined yield management and specific actions we took to shift customer mix most importantly operating margins expanded to 17 7 when compared to last year and on a currency neutral basis margins expanded to 17 our results were balance of three things first our ability to help customers adapt to the changing conditions second our efforts of flexing our global network and finally our success in controlling cost together enabling greater improvements in our bottom line results now let s look at the supply chain and freight segment the strong execution of our strategy which includes many asset light services enabled supply chain and freight to expand its margins by 150 basis points on lower year over year revenue the segment delivered excellent financial performance operating profit jumped more than 24 to 211 million profit contributions were broad among the units with particular good results from forwarding looking at the individual business units the 40 unit as a whole exhibit terrific execution of cost management strategy international air freight revenue was down in the quarter primarily on outbound links from asia through the slow recovery from the lunar new year however the team successfully expanded the buy sell spread both sequentially and year over year resulting in stronger profits additionally coyote truckload brokerage proactively adjusted their strategy during the current capacity in the market while continuing to deliver high quality service to our customers market rates on purchase transportation expense were down for the quarter in response to the changes in the market conditions coyote implemented a disciplined approach to cost management leverage and use of technology and continuing to focus on high quality loads to produce outstanding profit growth ups freight improved revenue quality and growth in middle market segments drove unit increase in revenue per hundredweight up by 5 4 overall the supply chain and freight team delivered robust profit to the company by leaning in on our asset light model to tightly control costs which helped offset volume and revenue softness now let s turn to the balance sheet ups generated 2 3 billion in cash from operations and about 760 million in free cash flow during the quarter and that is with capital investments of about 1 5 billion which mainly support network enhancements we are on track to meet our free cash flow target of 3 5 billion to 4 billion in 2019 with potential for additional upside produced from our working capital initiatives it should be noted as part of transformation we have adjusted the seasonality of free cash flow based on our working capital initiatives that we implemented throughout the last year in fact payments from the fourth quarter of 2018 have shifted somewhat into the first quarter of 2019 we saw the benefits in the fourth quarter of 2018 and we expect this pattern to continue moving forward ups distributed 867 million in dividends which represent about 5 5 increase on a per share basis over the same period last year and we repurchased 2 4 million shares for about 250 million our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 23 we expect our tax rate will be between 23 and 24 for the rest of 2019 now moving on to guidance as a reminder our transformation charges are not included in guidance 2019 is a year of investments in our network and executing our strategies to improve operating cost and deliver higher quality revenue growth despite uncertain conditions full year eps is expected to be in the range of 7 45 to 7 75 as we ve previously announced we view 2019 as a year of real progress with operating profit growth in all three segments up by low double digits turning to quarterly guidance we want to help you better understand our plans and how they unfold across the year for example last year we brought over 90 of our new us capacity online during the fourth quarter but this year we expect to bring nearly half of our new store capacity online by the end of the third quarter giving us the ability to deliver more benefits in the second half of the year we optimized our plans to enable us to open about 30 of our new capacity for 2019 within the second quarter in comparison during the same period last year no new facilities were opened the year over year expense related to the opening of these new facilities will affect second quarter results and will provide benefits throughout the remainder of the year total operating profit should grow in the mid single digits and adjusted eps is expected to be relatively flat to last year largely due to the planned pension financing costs which sit below the line third quarter eps is expected to be elevated due to a variety of material tailwinds including one additional operating day worth approximately 60 million to 70 million of profit additionally we expect benefits from first the automated facilities that come online this year along with the escalating efficiencies from the 2018 investments in facilities second the year over year international benefits from 2018 commodity headwinds that should not repeat and finally transformation gains from programs like the voluntary retirement plan that hits its full run rate in july the combination of these positive items will lift eps to around 28 of the full year guidance midpoint in summary during the first quarter we made progress in our plans and each business unit demonstrated gain in our strategies which improved efficiency and revenue quality and our investments in our smart global logistics network are starting to pay off providing enhanced productivity and more real time flexibility as the year unfolds we expect to expand margins and improve profits as we build on our momentum thank you i now ask the operator to open the line operator questions and answers operator operator instructions i will now turn the program over to iro mr childress please begin scott childress vice president and investor relations officer we re going to take an online question starting off here this question comes from scott schneeberger of oppenheimer please share your view of the u s china trade dynamic and its influence on global trade in your business david abney chairman and chief executive officer thanks scott this is david and then i m going to hand it over to jim to talk about some specifics ups like most other u s multinational we certainly advocate fair and balanced trade and the china u s trade uncertainty is prompting softer industry forecast in the region we certainly encourage leaders of the two countries to find solutions that support increased two way trade but also by ensuring many us companies have access to export to china some of our customers have adjusted their supply chains using the flexibility of the ups global network to adapt to changing trade dynamics and jim i m going to ask you to talk about a couple of specific instances james barber chief operating officer okay david thanks so i think david hit on it a couple times on this uncertainty word and i think that s an issue when you run a global network that you ve got to balance and deal with with regard to china specifically david also talked about in his opening remarks our addition of one of the 747 8s from hong kong into europe we still believe in china we are going to trade in and around china and how china evolves in the world we will move our network to support it keep in mind we re still bringing the 747 8 and very specifically as well i d like to add that position of our south china hub in the guangdong province connecting the hong kong connecting to the other growth markets really continue to power our apac network across the globe in fact this quarter that we just finished we actually had 3 more express on our airplanes out of apac than we did last in the same quarter to the us and 2 more to europe so we adjust the network we get the utilization rates right we re putting the right volume in the right network and will continue to adjust as trade develops in the world in front of us so appreciate the question scott childress vice president and investor relations officer we re going to take another online question this question comes from multiple people including ben hartford at rw baird given ups s recent introduction of marketplace shipping systems can you give us an update on where to go and the other initiatives scott price chief strategy and transformation officer yeah thanks for the question scott here so as we announced last year e commerce is one of our four strategic imperatives for growth it s focused upon supporting b2b growth as well improving our profitability of b2c e commerce focused on the smb segment in supporting marketplace growth we ve announced a number of important initiatives i ll quickly cover two in the b2b and then pass to kate for one recent announcement on b2c so shopify and where to go are both in early stages of the roll outs but progressing well in line with our expectations they both provide unmatched experience for our customers in the b2b and segment smb shopify is one of the new shipping integration solutions it covers 1 million smb companies with its web shop tech solution serving mainly b2b and b2c type merchants and overall we had added over 100 000 new customers to ups with this tool where to go which we announced yes last year is progressing very well we call it the airbnb of warehouse and fulfillment so it s a progress now the platform allows online technology that matches excess capacity of warehouse to merchants who are looking for transparent inventory and fulfillment and final mile through ups initially this is focused on serving b2b customers but we have a lot of interest from warehouses around the united states and are quickly building a national two day fulfillment network i ll now pass it to kate to talk about the b2c initiative kate gutmann chief sales and solutions officer thanks yeah i ll start with the customer small and medium sized customers really needed help with managing the complexities of bringing their product to market as they brought it through different channels and marketplaces so ups e fulfillment which we announced recently actually connects them to 21 marketplaces through just one easy ups login and we bundle the fulfillment and transportation services and give them two day time in transit which help them better compete in the market it also opens up opportunities for us as a company and different revenue streams so this along with what scott covered has given us a wide array of offerings for the customers and we have additional exciting new products coming soon david abney chairman and chief executive officer yeah so all of these products that scott and kate talked about and then the ones in the future that kate kind of referred all of these are about giving our small and mid sized customers a platform to really punch above their weight so a lot of these smaller businesses to actually compete with larger retailers but without having all the infrastructure in the cause that would burden them so this is really where we can give them an alternative solution it is a big focus of our smb imperative and we re really excited about it and have gotten excellent participation feedback so far so thank you for the question operator we have a question from the line of tom wadewitz please go ahead thomas wadewitz ubs inc analyst yes good morning wanted to ask you about your view on domestic package and kind of how you think things will play out this year your second quarter guidance is flat earnings is different from what the street has been looking for but i don t know if that reflects any change in your view of how domestic package is going to perform during the year or if that s just kind of a timing difference to street didn t recognize so just wondering if you could talk about that and ask about visibility to improvement in domestic package margin if you look at the second half thank you richard peretz chief financial officer sure tom this is richard i ll start the question and then jim will talk about a little bit about it if you look at the actual guidance we do see 2019 as a year of real progress the quarters are changing a little bit but they were in our plans that way but we wanted to make sure that you had the right visibility and understanding with transformation the quarters change because we re opening new buildings in the second quarter to drive benefits in the second half of the year in the third quarter we ve gotten those new buildings we see escalating efficiency in the buildings we opened in late 2018 we had the extra workday we had the commodity tailwind versus last year and we have the drp at full run rate in the third quarter those are all good proof points of why the year sets up well in the second half operating profit growth will lead to the double digit operating growth that we expect for 2019 in us james barber chief operating officer tom it s jim let me add something to what richard opened with and just to remind you that this year when we came out of gate we said 2019 in the u s was about creating operating leverage and you can start to see that in the first quarter if you look at the cost structure to remind you of a couple of other points that are beneath that we think are important first of all hand in hand with that comes our service our service is at very high levels relative to the competition and even to our sales over the last couple of years we re pretty proud of the service and by the way that leads into cost as well because we do things right the first time it s actually cheaper and we provide the customers a great service will keep on the revenue quality kate and others will talk about that as we go forward the transformation non ups is coming through the efficiencies are coming through we re focused on almost 80 of our network touching automation by the end of this year which is very good going forward remember we ve got 323 grounds saturday operations running in full flight this year and you just keep going and then you ll hear more in the future about peak season so for us as we move forward and the margins rich talked about you should start to see us perform better and better and better on operating leverage in the u s and that s our commitment to our shareholders this year thomas wadewitz ubs inc analyst great thank you operator we have a question from the line of ken hoexter bank of america please go ahead kenneth hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning if i could just follow up i guess digging into that a little bit further can you talk about the cost of those new centers maybe the magnitude and i guess in that vein i just want to understand i know amazon is always a topic of discussion but they ve been getting bigger and bigger in sourcing and we ve heard from whether new england motor freight or xp either they brought business in is that any part of pulling volumes in as to why ground was up less than call at gdp levels in the quarter is any of that starting to have an impact or is that related to other items richard peretz chief financial officer so first talk a little about the unpacking of the guidance and the revenue and this actually start with the revenue and then dave is going to talk a little bit on the second part of your question when you look at the revenue especially in the us what we see is underlying growth of about 4 5 but we had to recognize we had weather and operating day change as well as movement of easter so the organic growth was strong when you look at what we re doing and opening new buildings we called out in the past as we opened buildings we do have certain start up costs that go into those buildings by opening that 30 in the second quarter and totaled 50 by end of the third quarter what we re really doing is making sure that as we move into the fourth quarter the efficiency gains that we re seeing right now in the new building we re also seeing in this year in the second half of the year as we especially go into the third and fourth quarter those start up costs are around the things that you would expect as we hire and train people as we put in the last bit of supply and things like that so those are all part of what we ve put into the second quarter what we expect out of the third quarter and fourth quarter it s very deliberate that in the third quarter you see benefits from these new buildings as well as the other things i ve called out and with that i think that kind of tells you about why guidance and why we believe 2019 would be so well and i ll turn it over to david david abney chairman and chief executive officer yes richard when it comes to amazon we have to remember very large company they in source and outsource different portions of their transportation of work as they grow they continue to change and add those vendors we do not believe that there s been a decrease in our volume levels due to the making a switch from one company to another we still have a mutually beneficial relationship whereby amazon and we feel that while we continue to focus on serving their needs that there is so much more to e commerce than amazon and we also had shared how we are focusing on working with these other companies smbs and so we ve shared that at the end of last year and it s just a continued focus on improving the revenue quality and we re going to continue to do that thanks ken for the question kenneth hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks david thanks rich scott childress vice president and investor relations officer we re going to take a live question or an online question this question comes from a multiple of analysts fadi chamoun from bmo kevin sterling from seaport and chris wetherbee from citi the question is can you discuss the regional demands of what you re seeing in the international business related to europe and anything any dynamics that you re seeing from the customer side in that marketplace james barber chief operating officer let me start and then i ll give it to kate to and we certainly as we mentioned a minute ago the trade set up for this year has changed a little bit coming in we saw coming in but that s our job to adjust to that so we ve got situations in all the regions that we re adapting our global network out in asia as i talked about a minute ago with david it s moved keep in mind what i didn t mention to you at that time is that our black hours are down so that s how we end up creating operating leverage ultimately rich talked about the margins and we talked about the movement of that i mean when you really get behind international and how we are in our maturity we ve got great options to continue to grow no matter what products our customers choose from our us they will migrate between products based upon their needs and growth aspirations our job to get the network right we did manage some customers as rich talked about some some low yielding ones in europe this quarter that kind of mask some of the results and put some of that intra region growth in the mid single digits absent that you look to the bottom line profitability in the margins it was a really good quarter for us and we plan to continue that i ll ask kate to add a few comments to that kate gutmann chief sales and solutions officer we also said that for the 14th consecutive quarter we did see export growth in our international regions and also as jim mentioned before in asia as an example more express on the airplanes and again exports in europe continuing so our portfolio allows the customers to trade up and down and many are doing some of each thanks operator and we have a question from the line of david vernon please go ahead david vernon sanford c bernstein co analyst hey good morning thanks for taking the time i have general question on revenue quality it looks like top line came in a little bit later certainly the industry was expecting and i think in your commentary also maybe there was a little bit of a later start to the year on revenue can you talk a little bit about how maybe core price or shipment weights have been shifting in particularly around the express in the deferred products where the rpu was kind of down a little bit year over year well and that s just kind of a surprising result i m just like to see some added color on the mix trends of an express kate gutmann chief sales and solutions officer yes hey david this is kate i ll take that so overall we improve the revenue quality and again i ll just note the changes that or points that richard made on weather impact and the underlying performance that also impacts revenue per piece but ground rpu was actually at 2 9 in the us strongest quarter we ve had first quarter growth in four years and then if you look to where to your question we had above market air growth rates which we actually saw a broad base of customer usage small medium size business healthcare related as well as of course retail and yes to the question on mix seem or saw a more savor growth specifically within the next air product that ken impact revenue per piece as well as shorten zone which impacts that but it s just less of a flight path that the package takes so that s what we see we do continue our focus unchanged and remain committed to both quality revenue as well as maintaining market share thanks david vernon sanford c bernstein co analyst is there any sort of metric around sort of distance neutral weight neutral pricing that you guys kind of track or can talk to help us kind of understand that richard peretz chief financial officer so we do look at that over one quarter doesn t define how that product is moving generally speaking if i take the last four quarters combined the characteristics haven t been as pronounced as this quarter but i think you have to also remember weather has an impact because when you start having weather impacts your small and medium sized customers lose that day a business where your larger customers when it gets to customer mix can move it around the country and avoid the weather and we saw some of that in the numbers this quarter if it s appropriate at the right time it s really changing we would give you that color as well scott childress vice president and investor relations officer all right we re going to take a online question this online question comes from scott schneeberger at oppenheimer please address the progress in your recent completed of automated facilities and can you provide an update on orion npt and the other technologies you re bringing online juan perez chief information and engineering officer great scott good morning juan perez here thank you for the questions let me start first with the first part of the question related to automation couple of parts to that question in 2018 to your point we opened 22 new or retrofit automated facilities globally that represented an addition of about 5 million square feet globally 4 million in the u s 1 million in international and we ended up opening a number of regional sortation facilities that provided great benefit to the organization this past peak and we continue to see that now in atlanta salt lake city and a couple of other parts of the organization in 2019 we will be bringing on an additional 20 new or retrofit automated facilities globally that also represents roughly 5 million square feet or 400 000 packages per hour of automated sortation capacity in the organization and these expanded automated facilities are in tennessee and california we will have some in kentucky and ohio as well and will go to germany as well this year now looking at the benefits of that technology certainly we re seeing significant improvements in our productivity in those automated facilities as they continue to reach maturity to the second part of your question related to some of the operational technologies we ve implemented we are on track on getting the expected benefits of our ops technology they are all part of the smart logistics network strategy that we ve defined in the organization we re already in deployment of orion navigation in almost 10 000 drivers across the network seen significant benefits in terms of miles reduction related to the technology when it comes to edge the edge initiatives are in deployment we re now seeing improvements in consolidation of operations reducing expense work simplification and lastly as we look at the future we continue to find other opportunities to continue to improve our network we re well on our way on our smart package initiative that is going to provide great benefit to ups in the years to come new automation solutions as well and by the way i don t want to forget about these we re also very excited about the types of customer technologies that we re bringing on to the mix new solutions that we re deploying today but as kate alluded earlier we re also building new solutions to support our customers across the network thank you operator we have a question from the line of scott group of wolfe research please go ahead scott group wolfe research analyst hey thanks good morning guys so i wanted to go back to the third quarter guidance if we could so richard second quarter you re guiding to mid single digit profit growth and it looks like implied for the third quarter now is like mid 20 profit growth so i mean i get the operating day get you like 4 points of of extra growth but can you all bridge the rest like is there any way to quantify the commodity tailwind you re talking about and the headcount reductions you re talking about can you put some numbers around that so we can get a little bit more comfort with that guidance and then maybe it ll be helpful if you can sort of directionally talk about third quarter by segment if you can richard peretz chief financial officer so scott i think the first thing is the easiest one first we called out a specific number around commodity fx headwinds in the third quarter principally driven by the turkish lira last year did last something like 60 during the third quarter and came back a lot of it in the fourth i would call that out as well in terms of the work day we re giving you the information on that and then the vrp pool run rate is also something we gave the range of annual savings in the low 200s and so now we get a full quarter of that run rate so those are all very specific dollar amounts and then when you look across the international business separate from the commodities you also are wrapping the benefits we saw from some market activity based on some cyber attacks that occurred with one of our competitors and so this first and second quarter we re still wrapping that year over year but in the third or fourth we don t and then in supply chain freight we continue to see the benefits we see in this quarter we do expect to continue to see mid double digit growth there as we called out in the first quarter so third and fourth quarter are better returns and they re better returns for very specific reasons that we had set out both in the us because of what we re doing today i actually mentioned that the third quarter earnings per share should be about 28 of the annual guide number that we called out earlier in the year thanks scott childress vice president and investor relations officer we re going to take an online question this question comes from allison landry over at credit suisse she want to ask about the growth rates b2b and b2c last quarter we called the growth rates out can you provide an update this quarter and the growth rates on the b2b side kate gutmann chief sales and solutions officer hi allison this is kate i ll take that question so b2b growth as you noted was strong in the first quarter growth in several years as well as we saw similar rates of growth with b2c so a nice balance between the two when you look further into it we continue to enhance our leadership position in b2b and our solutions are resonating with healthcare customers for instance hospitals and labs and seeing the growth there throughout all of the segments and then also in retail extensive returns shipments going through say the ups store and our other access points to distribution centers and return centers grew quite well so we continue to focus on growing both and just will continue to fortify the mix that we see operator we have a question from the line of chris wetherbee of citigroup please go ahead chris wetherbee citigroup analyst hey thanks good morning i wanted to ask a question i guess on free cash flow and capex and maybe how you re thinking about sort of excess cash for shareholders as you move through the rest of the year so i think richard you mentioned that the cadence of free cash flow is changing to some degree the guidance is the same you ve mentioned that there s potential upside from working capital initiatives i guess you know when we have a little bit more confidence or color around the ability to maybe see some upside there and then how do you think about sort of capex this year is the cadence of capex changing do you think that there s potential upside or downside to what the guidance you ve given us just want to get a sense of how you re thinking about all of that richard peretz chief financial officer sure so i think the first thing we look at is ups generates strong operating cash flow i think 2019 will be another good year last year we started doing initiatives around working capital and we saw that benefit those working capital initiatives we have additional ones on the list that will continue to complete and as we complete those we will share the results and a go forward look at that now you did hit on this permit shift and what that means is we actually have better cash flow in the fourth quarter going forward because of the long term value of the transformation initiatives we put in place but most importantly as we do see upside potential with implementing initiatives and as they come through we ll start sharing that a little bit more in terms of the capex side of it our capex really is about improving the efficiency of our network and at the heart of that is both the technology and the buildings that we re creating and so this year we expect to spend about 7 billion we spent 1 5 billion in the first quarter which is right in line with where we expect it and will continue to lean into that we talked about this year level being about where we just talked about a moment ago and it is really about driving efficiency and lowering costs in the network over the long term and we do expect and we are seeing some of that now and we ll see even more of it in the second half of the year chris wetherbee citigroup analyst and no real change to the way you are thinking about the long term capex i guess through the next couple of years your guidance range as a percent of revenue that hasn t changed richard peretz chief financial officer well i think we ve given you guidance for that we re in the middle of the three year process and it s appropriate time and we continue to look at that and evaluate that we will come back to you with the right numbers scott childress vice president and investor relations officer we re going to take an online question here this question comes from helane becker over cowen incorporated how is the economy looking from your perspective and can you speak the pockets of growth that you re seeing david abney chairman and chief executive officer yes helane this is david let s start with the u s and u s forecasts reduce slightly there is a few mixed signals but we still see growth and we see opportunity there so starting out with what s driving the economy and the solid consumer spending and inventory replenishment and so we re certainly focused on those two areas when i said mixed the manufacturing activity has slowed a little bit and we re predicting a little bit lower industrial production in the second half and inaudible of increase has been reduced for 2019 still plenty of opportunity there and that s where our e commerce strategic imperative is focused and then we ll switch to the global economic environment it remains in a growth mode slightly slower pace and in europe the year gdp has been lowered for 2018 in part because of manufacturing smallness and then brexit of course remains a risk we certainly have plans in place to handle however that turns out but so we are prepared to assist our customers in asia china is still strong maybe not as strong as in previous years but jim talked about some of those opportunities we see there including into the u s and from the u s to china but also china and the rest of the world and so there is a lot of developments there that sometimes gets lost in the china u s discussion so that s what we see in the economy we think that it gives us plenty of opportunities to focus and to apply our strategic imperatives we feel good about the economy for the rest of the year scott childress vice president and investor relations officer we have a question from the line of allison landry of credit suisse please go ahead allison landry credit suisse ag analyst thanks good morning could you tell us how much the efficiencies from the facilities that opened up last year helped first quarter domestic margins or cost per piece and when would you expect the productivity benefits from the automation and new store capacity to begin to outpace the start up costs from the newer facilities and is this something that could occur by the end of this year thank you richard peretz chief financial officer so allison we re in the middle of really three years of opening some large amount of additional capacity the timing across quarters is going to be a little different because what we re seeing is the benefits are apparent our cost per piece ex fuel grew about just under 2 5 and if you adjust to weather it s actually around 2 growth which is the lowest it s been in several years that s principally driven by the efficiencies that we re getting out of the network we now have somewhere between 55 and 60 of eligible volume going through automated facilities that will keep growing we piled out not only the facility automation but when the middle of implementation of the orion 2 and i m actually going to hand it off to juan to talk a little bit about it but it s all part of what we laid out is our margin growth and getting to double digit operating profit growth for the u s for 2019 james barber chief operating officer rich i am going to take it from juan because i i think i want to package it together with someone what one mentioned on the first time we spoke i think it s important to remember that we went into transformations you hear scott and us talk a lot about non op and procurement and the other benefits but make no mistake because we invest in this network and put the capital in there are efficiency gains that are material in this business that will come through between now and this run rate of 2022 as we go forward and they are not insignificant and we are the in the early innings of that 2018 peak was step one you start to see the cost mitigate in q1 and the leverage we re talking about in this pivot year if there s a material piece on the cost side it s not just revenue quality and you ll see that on folders we go quarter by quarter by quarter allison and it s in all facets of the business that s the thing when you get the hub and spoke open back up the efficiencies come on the inbound side in the hubs in the network on the road and you put orion and you put edge and you put all the other technology one talks about it is material and as we go quarter by quarter and we actually put this on paper for you i think we ll do a really good job of laying out for you more and probably in a cost per piece example than then we are right now in the first quarter scott childress vice president and investor relations officer we re going to take online question here we ve got multiple analysts asking about the drone program that we launched in some of the activity that we re doing around these innovative solutions scott price chief strategy and transformation officer yeah thanks for the question scott here we re really very proud to have the very first faa sanction use of a drone for routine revenue flights which as david mentioned took place at the wakemed medical campus that certification from the faa is very important and we re really pleased to see that they quickly began to embrace other opportunities with subsequent approvals but we re early in the process we in the united states we announced yesterday that we have launched a continuation of a 13 000 program that we had launched in rwanda taking medical samples across the country and today now in rwanda 30 of rwanda s blood supply are done through these drones so we will continue to see in the united states opportunities to expand this to campuses in particular focusing upon healthcare the economics will we do see in the future to be positive and we will scale these and see that the opportunity to reduce our costs on the site type of campus programs is quite positive there s a supporting platform value to this as well juan juan perez chief information and engineering officer great thank you scott we ve learned a lot through our tests with drone technology one off drone solutions are not scalable to complement our already robust delivery network drone deliveries requires an effective ecosystem of solutions so what we re doing for that is we re bringing the great expertise we built over the years in analytics and operations research to be able to do a few things to support these ecosystem the first one is we re using analytics to identify how to best utilize this technology we re applying operations research expertise to determine how to maximize the value of this solution within the network that we already have which is very efficient and lastly we definitely believe that these are required to have a solid approach to optimizing the value of this technology in the future and we believe will happen operator we have a question from the line of brandon oglenski of barclays please go ahead brandon oglenski barclays plc analyst hey good morning everyone and thanks for getting my question in i want to come back to the longer term capex outlook because i think at prior events you guys have spoken about spending in the 8 5 to 10 of revenue range for the next few years and i really want to put that in the context of these facility investments you re making i think in the past you ve said that you have somewhere between like 30 to 35 major package health facilities in the us i was wondering if you could update us on just how many of those have actually been updated with the automated technology and then what is the outlook over the next couple of years for how many should get retrofitted looking forward richard peretz chief financial officer so brandon this is richard i think on the capex side i ll take that part and then i ll have juan talk a little bit about the actual buildings but on the capex side you re right we talked about a three year peak of capex and then it s moderating down we re still on plans for that it s just a little early to give you what we re going to do in 2020 and 2021 but we will continue to look at different options and alternatives based on the flow of packages and really the benefits we are getting out of these buildings which are slightly better than we originally thought even so it s a little too early to give that but at the same time what we ve guided in terms of three years and then coming down that moderation will occur and the appropriate time will give a better feel for that but i ll turn it over to juan to talk about the actual building juan perez chief information and engineering officer sure richard close to 60 of our planned building automation projects by 2022 are already completed that s one of the large building automation type projects and as david alluded earlier we re already seeing the types of benefits that we get from these automation in the network close to 65 of our small sort automation projects that we targeted by 2022 are also completed and in both scenarios we re actually on track to get to the targets that we defined to have solid automation across our network to provide benefits to the organization operator that concludes our q a session for today i would now like to turn the program back over to mr childress please go ahead sir scott childress vice president and investor relations officer thank you very much steven so we ll leave with closing comments from david david abney chairman and chief executive officer so as you heard during the call ups is adding innovative solutions and using technology to enrich our integrated network our transformation initiatives are improving efficiency and revenue quality and we ve made good progresses quarter in a dynamic environment strong execution and supply chain and international us domestic investments are driving momentum our both facilities are coming online earlier this year creating earlier benefits and we continue to see growth opportunities that kate has talked about earlier so in summary we had a good start to the year and we have momentum to embrace our future performance and thank you for joining us this morning duration 60 minutes call participants scott childress vice president and investor relations officer david abney chairman and chief executive officer richard peretz chief financial officer james barber

sherritt reports record first quarter nickel and cobalt production at moa jv tweet sherritt international corporation sherritt or the corporation tsx s a world leader in the mining and hydrometallurgical refining of nickel and cobalt from lateritic ores today reported its financial results for the three months ended march 31 2019 all amounts are in canadian currency unless otherwise noted ceo commentary initiatives launched in 2018 to improve operational effectiveness increase mining equipment availability and improve ore access paved the way for the moa jv s highest ever first quarter nickel and cobalt production total said david pathe president and ceo of sherritt international our record production results in q1 2019 were negatively impacted however by the dramatic 70 decline in realized cobalt prices contributing to considerably lower by product revenue and higher ndcc than we have experienced in recent quarters our q1 progress was also impeded by the disappointing collections on our cuban overdue receivables mr pathe added since the start of q2 2019 we have seen a number of positive developments including the resumption of drilling on block 10 the recovery of cobalt prices by more than 15 and the continued draw down of class 1 nickel inventories combined these trends signal a more favorable outlook for our prospects for the balance of 2019 and beyond q1 highlights sherritt s share of finished nickel production at the moa joint venture moa jv in q1 2019 was 4 397 tonnes up 54 from last year while finished cobalt was 426 tonnes up 27 the combined nickel and cobalt total for q1 2019 marks the moa jv s highest ever first quarter production results q1 2019 adjusted ebitda 1 was negative 1 2 million down from positive adjusted ebitda of 35 5 million in q1 2018 the decrease was due to a number of factors including a 70 year over year decline in realized cobalt prices and lower contributions from the oil and gas business as a result of decreased net working interest production stemming from maturing oil fields and a lower profit share was negative 1 2 million down from positive adjusted ebitda of 35 5 million in q1 2018 the decrease was due to a number of factors including a 70 year over year decline in realized cobalt prices and lower contributions from the oil and gas business as a result of decreased net working interest production stemming from maturing oil fields and a lower profit share net direct cash cost ndcc 1 at the moa jv for q1 2019 was us 4 53 per pound of finished nickel sold up from us 2 06 per pound for q1 2018 the increase reflects the negative impact that sharply declining cobalt prices had on by product credits including the settlement of approximately 200 tonnes of provisionally priced cobalt sales 100 basis from q4 2018 the variance between q1 2019 cobalt reference and realized prices that resulted from provisional pricing adjustments negatively impacted ndcc by approximately us 0 40 per pound at the moa jv for q1 2019 was us 4 53 per pound of finished nickel sold up from us 2 06 per pound for q1 2018 the increase reflects the negative impact that sharply declining cobalt prices had on by product credits including the settlement of approximately 200 tonnes of provisionally priced cobalt sales 100 basis from q4 2018 the variance between q1 2019 cobalt reference and realized prices that resulted from provisional pricing adjustments negatively impacted ndcc by approximately us 0 40 per pound sherritt ended q1 2019 with cash cash equivalents and short term investments of 177 3 million down from 207 0 million at the end of 2018 the decrease was due to the timing of capital expenditures interest paid on outstanding debentures and changes to working capital including lower than expected cuban energy receipts reached an agreement in principle subject to final approvals with its cuban partners on a payment plan to reduce overdue energy receivables final approval of the agreement and payment schedule is expected shortly consistent with its previously announced strategy to no longer fund the ambatovy joint venture ambatovy jv sherritt elected to not fund its share of a us 45 million cash call and became a defaulting shareholder with reduced local influence and authority as a result the ambatovy jv is no longer considered an operating segment and its financial performance is not included in sherritt s combined or adjusted financial results developments subsequent to the quarter end resumed drilling on block 10 on april 1 using updated drilling parameters developed with the assistance of third party experts and the results of detailed lab analysis of rock cuttings collected previously the adoption of new drilling parameters will not result in any increases to planned capital spending previously disclosed for the oil and gas business any incremental capital spend at the oil and gas business in 2019 will be predicated on successful drill results on block 10 and collections on overdue receivables sherritt intends to explore partnerships for further investment in block 10 following completion of the current drilling which is expected in the second quarter of 2019 on april 17 the u s state department announced that effective may 2 2019 it will implement title iii of the helms burton act allowing u s citizens to bring lawsuits against foreign companies for using property that was nationalized by the cuban government beginning in 1959 sherritt has been working with its partners in cuba since 1994 producing nickel cobalt oil and gas and electricity and plans to continue to operate business as usual more details on title iii and its potential risks and uncertainties can be found in sherritt s annual information form dated february

q1 2019 closing at us 5 90 lb on march 29 up almost 25 from the start of the year the recovery was driven by a number of factors including optimism that an international trade agreement between the u s and china would soon be reached underlying market fundamentals also contributed to the price recovery combined nickel inventories on the london metals exchange lme and the shanghai futures exchange at the end of q1 2019 totaled 191 292 tonnes down 13 from the combined total of 219 804 tonnes at the end of q4 2018 since the end of q1 2018 combined class 1 nickel inventories have declined by approximately 50 as demand continues to exceed available supply the nickel market is anticipated to be in a structural deficit in the coming years despite the recovery of prices since the start of 2019 the average reference price for nickel in q1 2019 was down 7 from last year declining from us 6 03 lb to us 5 62 lb nickel prices in april 2019 have averaged at us 5 85 lb and are currently trading on the lme at us 5 56 lb demand for nickel will continue to be driven by the stainless steel sector according to market research by cru stainless steel demand is expected to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 4 through 2022 with production emanating largely from china and indonesia demand for nickel particularly class 1 nickel from non stainless steel sectors is also expected to accelerate given the growth of the electric vehicle battery market class i nickel along with cobalt are key metals needed to manufacture electric vehicle batteries beyond 2019 a shortage of class 1 nickel is anticipated over the coming years since current market prices are below incentive levels needed to develop new nickel projects as a result no new class 1 nickel supply is expected to come on stream in the near term cobalt cobalt prices and demand experienced considerable softness and volatility in q1 2019 the reference price for q1 2019 was us 18 53 lb down 52 from us 39 01 lb for the same period of 2018 consistent with trends over the past several months the price decline was driven by increased supply of intermediate product from the democratic republic of congo as well as by the destocking of inventory by chinese consumers abundant available supply has recently resulted in cobalt producers selling product at significant discount to prevailing reference prices during the run up in prices from late 2017 through 2018 cobalt producers often sold cobalt at a premium to reference prices as consumers looked to lock supply since the start of april however cobalt prices have risen by approximately 15 as consumers renew purchasing activities the recent increase in cobalt prices is expected to be sustained through the balance of 2019 albeit with some volatility due to increased speculative interest growing demand from the electric vehicle battery market and persistent supply risk concerns linked to the democratic republic of congo which is currently the world s

bulletin 3 excludes right of use assets recognized on adoption of ifrs 16 refer to note 4 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information the moa jv produced 4 397 tonnes of finished nickel in q1 2019 up 54 from 2 854 tonnes produced in q1 2018 growth was largely driven by the deployment of new mining equipment acquired throughout 2018 that resulted in improved ore access and reduced equipment downtime compared to the same period of last year in q1 2018 the moa jv s results were impacted by the highest level of rainfall at moa in more than 20 years and by transportation delays to the refinery in fort saskatchewan by the railway service provider efforts at improving ore access and mining equipment reliability at moa have been instrumental in increasing inventory stockpiles and reducing the impact that adverse weather conditions may have on future production finished cobalt production for q1 2019 was 426 tonnes up 27 from q1 2018 due to higher mixed sulphides availability the ratio of finished nickel production to cobalt production was higher in q1 2019 compared to last year as a result of a higher nickel to cobalt ratio in mixed sulphides produced at moa despite the change which is due to ore grade variability the nickel to cobalt ratio is consistent with historical norms combined nickel and cobalt production totals for q1 2019 represent the moa jv s highest ever first quarter production results second quarter production will be impacted however by the annual maintenance shutdown of the refinery in fort saskatchewan this year s shutdown is expected to be similar in duration to the prior years revenue for q1 2019 totaled 102 3 million up 6 from last year the increase was largely due to higher sales volume of nickel and cobalt offset however by a 70 decline in the cobalt realized price over q1 2018 the realized price decline in q1 2019 was driven by lower consumer demand and the settlement of provisional q4 2018 pricing the average realized price for nickel in q1 2019 was 7 51 lb down 4 from last year mining processing and refining mpr costs for q1 2019 were us 5 59 lb up 6 from us 5 26 lb for q1 2018 due to the impacts of higher energy prices and higher utilization of moa mixed sulphides relative to third party feeds although partly offset by the impact of higher sales volume ndcc in q1 2019 was us 4 53 lb up from us 2 06 lb for the same period last year the increase was largely due to lower by product revenue stemming from lower cobalt prices and the settlement of approximately 200 tonnes of provisionally priced cobalt sales 100 basis from q4 2018 the variance between q1 2019 cobalt reference and realized prices that resulted from provisional pricing adjustments negatively impacted ndcc by approximately 0 40 per pound the decrease in cobalt by product revenue was partly offset by lower third party feed costs and a higher contribution from fertilizer sales sustaining capital spending in q1 2019 was 14 0 million up from 4 5 million in q1 2018 as the moa jv continued its new mining equipment initiative aimed at improving equipment reliability reducing maintenance costs and improving ore accessibility consistent with its efforts to improve operational effectiveness the moa jv also commissioned a new slurry preparation plant dump pocket at moa in q1 2019 that is designed to improve

oil production in cuba in q1 2019 was 4 443 barrels of oil per day bopd down 20 from 5 572 bopd for q1 2018 lower production in 2019 was primarily due to natural reservoir declines and the absence of new development drilling revenue in q1 2019 was 9 0 million down 50 when compared to last year the decline was attributable to lower total net working interest production due to the impact of the decrease in profit oil percentage to 6 from 45 with the renewal of the puerto escondido yumuri psc starting in q2 2018 the decline was partially offset by a higher usgc hsfo reference oil price and by

respectively from q1 2018 production in q1 2019 was impacted by an accident and fatality in the hydrogen plant that resulted in a full shutdown of the ambatovy plant for a period of 10 days to undertake safety reviews and complete repairs production in q1 2019 was also impacted by unplanned maintenance activities in the acid plants as well as by equipment reliability issues in q1 2018 production was impacted by cyclone ava that necessitated a plant shutdown of approximately one month due to damage to equipment and facilities ndcc in q1 2019 was us 5 70 lb up 7 from q1 2018 the

finance minister mthuli ncube yesterday urged business to tie prices to the consumption basket and not the exchange rate because people do not earn salaries to buy united states dollars but goods addressing industry and business at the zimbabwe international trade fair in bulawayo yesterday ncube said it is bad economics very bad economics where you tie price increases directly to the exchange rate good economics says tie prices around a consumption basket you don t earn your salary to go and buy us dollars so inflation thinking should be hinged around consumption basket and not us dollars zimbabwe has been experiencing a price spiral since october last year when the government re introduced foreign currency accounts inflation soared from 5 4 percent in september to 166 percent in march this year some economist say real inflation is about 270 percent the exchange rate between the surrogate currency the bond note and the united states dollar which was at par now stands at 4 66 on the black market opposition leader and former finance minister tendai biti says inflation could reach 400 percent by the end of the year mthuli ncube plans to reduce inflation to single digit level by year end but he is facing an uphill struggle as business is tailoring prices to the exchange rate on the black market ncube who was supported by vice president constantino chiwenga said current business practices were unethical we are doing very well on the fiscal front honourable vp your government is solvent we are running surpluses and we have been doing average surpluses of 100 million since september last year when we came in he said in january we had surplus of 102 million february 85 5 million as we had to take into account cushioning of civil servants in march our surplus doubled to be just about 200 million so where is pressure on the exchange rate coming from before we knew that it came from the fiscus we were monetising the fiscal deficit and then money supply would grow but now where is the pressure coming from so clearly as the vp said it is speculation and that speculation is not a good idea we know who is driving it chiwenga described those wantonly increasing prices as financial terrorists and warned them that this was a war they would never win ncube said the government was doing everything to make sure that the value of the local currency currently known as rtgs dollar was preserved but business must meet the government half way our job as government is to make sure that our fundamentals that determine value of a currency are still strong we are not careless in terms of how we spend and we make sure the value of the currency is preserved but you should meet us halfway he said the black market rate for the rtgs dollar was today pegged at 4 80 to the us dollar while the interbank rate stood at 3 22 to the greenback ncube said while the country was going through a bad patch the hardship should not exceed a year we need to go through some period of austerity as we build towards prosperity but quite clearly you can t do austerity for three years that s bad do it one year and move on he said 241 views
soon after notre dame in paris went up in flames teenage climate campaigner greta thunberg in a speech to the european parliament said she did not want to diminish the notre dame fire but wished there was an equal outpouring of funding support to combat issues such as climate change the outpouring of funding to rebuild notre dame was indeed impressive within 24 hours of the blaze french luxury tycoons had pledged donations in the hundreds of million euros françois henri pinault kering came through with 100 million his crosstown rival bernard arnault lvmh with 200 million the meyer bettencourt family oreal with 200 million add to that the 100 million announced by total ceo patrick pouyanné total 1er mécène de la fond_patrimoine depuis plusieurs années fait un don spécial de 100 millions d euros pour la reconstruction de notre dame de paris fluctuat nec mergitur pic twitter com wkxvzjm0sy patrick pouyanné ppouyanne april 16 2019 philanthropists are often accused of not giving to the right causes on this subject stephen l carter a nyt bestselling author yale university law professor and former clerk to u s supreme court justice thurgood marshall had some interesting things to say in a recent opinion piece for bloomberg aptly titled rebuilding notre dame is more than a vanity project he praised the generosity of private philanthropists while social media as he put it has been rich with furious suggestions of places the billions might be better spent yet carter has no doubts regardless of what causes are addressed charitable giving is an absolute good as he explains not only does private funding fill gaps that officialdom will miss often intentionally it also stimulates more private funding the notre dame example illustrates the way that the competition among the wealthy to outgive each other reflects the well known signaling effect of charity this benign view of charity is hotly contested in some quarters for example one comment to his article points to the 60 tax credit donors get under french law the problem is that such credit might result in a shortfall in government revenues and means either less money for government services and the commons or obliging others to make up the shortfall the others being your average tax paying joe in any case no matter how you view the issue private funding is never enough at the time of writing more than 1 billion euros have been pledged toward the reconstruction of notre dame cathedral sounds good but the total cost could run as high as 8 billion euros and most of it probably will not be covered by insurance in the end in spite of macron s efforts to organize an international fund raising effort the french taxpayers will likely bear most the cost let s be clear the billions going to notre dame are a drop in the bucket compared to what is required to fight climate change notre dame needs probably 8 billion to be rebuilt our planet s climate requires trillions to be fixed it s not as if nothing has ever been spent on fighting climate change or no effort has ever been made by policy makers contrary to what greta thunberg says but she s right on the fact that not enough has been achieved not enough by a long shot consider the history of aid to development and the environment the foundational role of official development assistance since the environmental alarm was first rung by rachel carson s silent spring in 1962 billions have been spent by western governments to help develop the world but most of it didn t go to protect the environment for decades it went mostly to industrialization contributing to the degradation of the environment but something changed in 1987 when the un s brundtland report introduced the concept of sustainable development and in 2000 when all un member states adopted the millenium development goals a precursor to the sdgs development aid morphed into largely sustainable development assistance the core of that aid is oda official development assistance oecd dac the development assistance committee of the oecd that groups main donor countries has measured public resource flows to developing countries since 1961 and oda is the key measure used in practically all aid targets and assessments of aid performance it excludes military aid and only includes that portion of peacekeeping operations aimed at closely defined developmentally relevant activities it also includes cultural programs provided they build the cultural capacities of recipient countries and excludes one off tours by donor country artists or sportsmen and activities to promote the donors image in short oda is a serious statistic whose definition has been further tightened in 2018 the data released on 8 april 2018 shows that public aid to developing countries has been relatively stable in recent years exceeding 100 billion for the first time in 2005 and coasting close to 150 billion since 2016 preliminary 2018 figures available here show similar trends everybody knows and laments the fact that official development assistance oda is woefully insufficient in relation to needs oda s 150 billion is a drop in the ocean compared to the trillions spent on the military the un has set a modest target of 0 7 of gross national income gni but except for the uk denmark norway sweden and luxembourg that equal or exceed the target no other donor country does so and the us lags behind at a miserly 0 17 of gni in 2018 even though the total volume of the us contribution to oda is over 34 billion an aside estimates of foreign assistance can differ depending on how broadly you define aid but if you include american military and security assistance to us allies it amounts to a third of us foreign aid then you can bring up the estimate of us assistance to roughly 49 billion for 2016 the last fiscal year that was fully analyzed that of course is not development assistance in the way it is defined by the oecd sounds like a lot but that figure pales in comparison to what the us government spends on the military about 3 5 of gdp according to nato data in 2018 the american military budget stood at 686 billion about fifteen to twenty times as much as foreign aid and much more in the future if trump has his way restoring and rebuilding america s military he signed a 1 3 trillion spending bill on march 23 2018 that includes a 160 billion boost in defense spending over two years a boost that in the words of the us department of defense is reversing years of decline and unpredictable funding another useful way to look at military expenditures taking per capita data according to the stockholm international peace research institute sipri data the us spent more than 1 879 per capita in 2017 that s more than double its european allies france spent 889 per capita the uk spent 713 and germany spent 539 per capita the world atlas has also updated the figures in 2017 but it has come up with a slightly different set that throws a harsh light on some unsuspected countries take a look saudi arabia is in the lead partly a result of its ongoing war in yemen followed far behind by singapore israel and the us but there are surprises for example debt ridden greece spends almost as much as oil rich norway and far more than france all four countries that meet or exceed the un donor target of 0 7 are among the top fifteen military spending countries the world loves guns as much as butter or rather more this suggests that the us should not be singled out as a major military villain the world as a whole is following in the footsteps of the us preferring to spend money on guns rather than butter a us government publication that comes out every year the world military expenditures and arms transfer published in december 2018 paints a grim picture from 2006 to 2016 the world spent on average close to 2 5 trillion each year calculated on the basis of purchasing power parity rates in 2016 military expenditures worldwide standing at 2 82 trillion trumped oda at 147 55 by a factor of 19 meanwhile trump plans to cut funding to the un and oda in general even though the share of foreign aid in the federal budget is only 1 2 percent can private investment fill the gap private investment in the form of charities has certainly helped but it is far from filling the gap public private partnerships also go some way to fill it incentivized by government policies subsidies grants concessional loans and risk mitigation mechanisms including insurance and government guarantees how much of this goes to sustainable development and the fight against climate change this is a very difficult question to answer though in recent years claims have been made including by the world bank in 2014 that trillions of dollars to finance the global environmental agenda are simply waiting to be unlocked and remember we re talking of trillions that are needed when oda is in fact a meagre 150 billion at best but there are several hurdles first measuring current financial flows for the environment and development is complicated by endlessly variable definitions and classifications for similar projects and the recurrent absence of mandatory reporting requirements second the architecture of blended finance is complex and ranges from traditional public private partnerships ppps to development finance institutions dfis such as the african development bank the world bank s ifc the asian development bank etc the latter is not to be confused with china s asian infrastructure investment bank part of its belt and road initiative focused on infrastructure building at the time of its founding the un was quick to say in a 2015 policy report that it had the potential for scaling up financing for sustainable development but between potential and realization the gap can be wide last but not least the number and variety of private actors have multiplied in recent years as interest in sustainable development has escalated new kinds of partnerships have emerged between government private sector ngos and civil society one such example is the tropical landscapes finance facility that blends public and private funding to provide long term financing to support sustainable land use some experts have tried to answer the question notably robyn clark james reed and terry sunderland in an article on science direct published in december 2017 they have attempted to quantify the amounts actually available for climate mitigation and adaptation conservation sustainable forest management integrated land management and landscape approaches the gaps are mind boggling take the first issue climate change to address it would require 1 6 to 3 trillion on an annual basis we are here in the range of world military expenditures about 2 5 trillion on average over the 2006 2016 period the actual aid from the public sector is 361 billion plus 131 from the development banks dfis a total of 492 billion not even half a trillion private investors provide only 141 million giving strength to greta turnberg s criticism yet ifc is sanguine about future prospects it predicts that there will be approximately 23 trillion of climate investment opportunities for private investors between 2016 and 2030 opportunities however are not necessarily realized if you consider the sdgs the gap is even greater though since this table was compiled there has been some small progress helped along by the fact that since 2015 the un adopted addis ababa agenda provides a new global framework for financing sustainable development but we re still far away from a functioning financial system that can deliver for the sdgs national and international financial systems need to change there is no doubt that the real source of funding is in private hands that s where the money is to get an idea of how much consider private foreign direct investment fdi that was also analyzed by clark reed and sunderland in their article as they point out historically fdi remains the most reliable and long term source of investment in developing countries with trade globalization according to wef 2016 data there has been a dramatic increase in fdi from 54 billion in 1980 to 1 23 trillion in 2014 this is encouraging while fdi is still far from the levels reached by military expenditures it is considerable some ten times the amount of oda yet it is so far from the 23 trillion of investment opportunities predicted by the ifc that it is hard to see how much difference it could make moreover there s a problem fdi is not shaped by the sdgs or concerned by sustainable development or climate change it is governed by the capitalist rules of profit making the bottom line is what matters to private investors not sustainable development what is stopping investment in sustainable development the causes are well known and include rapid changes in technology geopolitics and climate change and the inability of national and multilateral institutions to adapt to these changes the spotlight is on private finance and on the 300 trillion in financial assets managed by banks in september 2018 u n secretary general antónio guterres launched a new strategy to help finance the sdgs saying we need to act urgently to drive progress that means galvanizing political support across governments and local communities building momentum for change in corporate boardrooms and doing better in tapping resources that sit idle some 300 trillion in financial assets are managed by the global financial system on our collective behalf beyond the strategy the speakers sharing the podium of the crowded u n economic and social council chamber were a sign that times are changing notably laurence fink ceo of blackrock the world s largest asset manager was among them talking about why it is critical for investors to start to consider sustainability as a key part of its investing progress in april 2019 the un doubled down on its efforts to wake up the international financial community the fear is that the addis ababa financing summit will remain a dead letter if countries don t start creating the necessary framework for investment on 4 april it released 2019 financing for sustainable development report the work of some 60 un agencies and partners sounding the alarm and outlining recommendations for a path forward the implications of not investing will impact everyone said amina mohammed u n deputy secretary general on 14 april a coalition of the willing comprising finance ministers from more than 20 developed and developing countries pledged to drive stronger collective action on climate change and its impacts the coalition will pursue a set of six helsinki principles that promote national climate action especially through fiscal policy and the use of public finance this momentous event took place during the spring meetings of the world bank group and international monetary fund imf held from 12 14 april 2019 in washington dc us the coalition promises to have teeth as the world bank will serve as its secretariat finally the cherry on the cake un secretary general guterres will convene a summit in september 2019 to mobilize everyone on the theme climate action summit 2019 a race we can win a race we must win it will seek to challenge states regions cities companies investors and citizens to step up action in six areas energy transition climate finance and carbon pricing industry transition nature based solutions cities and local action and resilience nine coalitions set up to prepare the summit will propose meaningful actions during a preparatory meeting in abu dhabi uae in june 2019 there is no question that the un is making an all out effort to mobilize the world in the fight against climate change ultimately the outcome depends on you and me on all of us consumers we need to stop buying products just because the price is low we need to verify that they are sustainably produced and respect both the environment and human dignity we have only 12 years left to limit climate change catastrophe we have been warned by the ipcc the

the rainy river mine reported in line gold equivalent production of 62 278 ounces 61 557 ounces of gold and 60 383 ounces of silver for the quarter as previously disclosed production during the quarter included planned lower grades as mining operations continued the transition to phase 2 of the mine plan operating expense per gold eq ounce was 801 for the quarter which is a 35 decrease over the prior year quarter driven by improved operational performance and increased metal production and sales volumes achieved in the current year quarter all in sustaining costs aisc per gold eq ounce for the quarter were 1 330 which included 10 million of capitalized stripping costs 140 per gold eq ounce and 27 million of other sustaining capital expenditure and lease payments aisc per gold eq ounce for the quarter declined by 45 over the prior year quarter due to improved operational performance and an increase in metal production and sales volumes coupled with a decrease in sustaining capital it is expected that sustaining capital will be higher in the second and third quarters when weather conditions are more favourable for infrastructure and tailings construction and will decline in the fourth quarter growth capital for the quarter was 3 8 million related to underground mine development working capital payments and the transfer of infrastructure from the contractor during the quarter approximately 1 4 million ore tonnes and 8 6 million waste tonnes including 2 97 million capitalized waste tonnes were mined at an operating strip ratio of 6 10 1 mining operations in the quarter were primarily focused on waste stripping to expose ore for mining in future quarters additionally 0 9 million tonnes of out pit non acid generating nag material were mined in preparation for planned dam raises scheduled to begin during the second quarter mill throughput for the quarter averaged 19 725 tonnes per day below the annual target of 22 000 to 24 000 tonnes per day the lower average mill throughput was negatively impacted by the significant buildup of ice in the crushed ore stockpile above the apron feeders average mill throughput returned to target levels at the end of the quarter mill availability for the quarter was a record 89 95 in march despite the planned downtime to replace the ball mill trunnion and complete repairs gold recovery improved to average 90 for the quarter a significant improvement over the 89 reported in the fourth quarter when considering the 16 lower average grade milled recoveries are expected to continue to improve throughout the year to an average of 90 92 for the year during the first quarter of 2019 the company launched a comprehensive optimization study that includes the review of alternative open pit and underground mining scenarios with the overall objective of reducing capital and improving the return on investment over the life of mine an updated life of mine plan is anticipated to be completed in the fourth quarter

sherritt reports record first quarter nickel and cobalt production at moa jv tweet sherritt international corporation sherritt or the corporation tsx s a world leader in the mining and hydrometallurgical refining of nickel and cobalt from lateritic ores today reported its financial results for the three months ended march 31 2019 all amounts are in canadian currency unless otherwise noted ceo commentary initiatives launched in 2018 to improve operational effectiveness increase mining equipment availability and improve ore access paved the way for the moa jv s highest ever first quarter nickel and cobalt production total said david pathe president and ceo of sherritt international our record production results in q1 2019 were negatively impacted however by the dramatic 70 decline in realized cobalt prices contributing to considerably lower by product revenue and higher ndcc than we have experienced in recent quarters our q1 progress was also impeded by the disappointing collections on our cuban overdue receivables mr pathe added since the start of q2 2019 we have seen a number of positive developments including the resumption of drilling on block 10 the recovery of cobalt prices by more than 15 and the continued draw down of class 1 nickel inventories combined these trends signal a more favorable outlook for our prospects for the balance of 2019 and beyond q1 highlights sherritt s share of finished nickel production at the moa joint venture moa jv in q1 2019 was 4 397 tonnes up 54 from last year while finished cobalt was 426 tonnes up 27 the combined nickel and cobalt total for q1 2019 marks the moa jv s highest ever first quarter production results q1 2019 adjusted ebitda 1 was negative 1 2 million down from positive adjusted ebitda of 35 5 million in q1 2018 the decrease was due to a number of factors including a 70 year over year decline in realized cobalt prices and lower contributions from the oil and gas business as a result of decreased net working interest production stemming from maturing oil fields and a lower profit share was negative 1 2 million down from positive adjusted ebitda of 35 5 million in q1 2018 the decrease was due to a number of factors including a 70 year over year decline in realized cobalt prices and lower contributions from the oil and gas business as a result of decreased net working interest production stemming from maturing oil fields and a lower profit share net direct cash cost ndcc 1 at the moa jv for q1 2019 was us 4 53 per pound of finished nickel sold up from us 2 06 per pound for q1 2018 the increase reflects the negative impact that sharply declining cobalt prices had on by product credits including the settlement of approximately 200 tonnes of provisionally priced cobalt sales 100 basis from q4 2018 the variance between q1 2019 cobalt reference and realized prices that resulted from provisional pricing adjustments negatively impacted ndcc by approximately us 0 40 per pound at the moa jv for q1 2019 was us 4 53 per pound of finished nickel sold up from us 2 06 per pound for q1 2018 the increase reflects the negative impact that sharply declining cobalt prices had on by product credits including the settlement of approximately 200 tonnes of provisionally priced cobalt sales 100 basis from q4 2018 the variance between q1 2019 cobalt reference and realized prices that resulted from provisional pricing adjustments negatively impacted ndcc by approximately us 0 40 per pound sherritt ended q1 2019 with cash cash equivalents and short term investments of 177 3 million down from 207 0 million at the end of 2018 the decrease was due to the timing of capital expenditures interest paid on outstanding debentures and changes to working capital including lower than expected cuban energy receipts reached an agreement in principle subject to final approvals with its cuban partners on a payment plan to reduce overdue energy receivables final approval of the agreement and payment schedule is expected shortly consistent with its previously announced strategy to no longer fund the ambatovy joint venture ambatovy jv sherritt elected to not fund its share of a us 45 million cash call and became a defaulting shareholder with reduced local influence and authority as a result the ambatovy jv is no longer considered an operating segment and its financial performance is not included in sherritt s combined or adjusted financial results developments subsequent to the quarter end resumed drilling on block 10 on april 1 using updated drilling parameters developed with the assistance of third party experts and the results of detailed lab analysis of rock cuttings collected previously the adoption of new drilling parameters will not result in any increases to planned capital spending previously disclosed for the oil and gas business any incremental capital spend at the oil and gas business in 2019 will be predicated on successful drill results on block 10 and collections on overdue receivables sherritt intends to explore partnerships for further investment in block 10 following completion of the current drilling which is expected in the second quarter of 2019 on april 17 the u s state department announced that effective may 2 2019 it will implement title iii of the helms burton act allowing u s citizens to bring lawsuits against foreign companies for using property that was nationalized by the cuban government beginning in 1959 sherritt has been working with its partners in cuba since 1994 producing nickel cobalt oil and gas and electricity and plans to continue to operate business as usual more details on title iii and its potential risks and uncertainties can be found in sherritt s annual information form dated february

q1 2019 closing at us 5 90 lb on march 29 up almost 25 from the start of the year the recovery was driven by a number of factors including optimism that an international trade agreement between the u s and china would soon be reached underlying market fundamentals also contributed to the price recovery combined nickel inventories on the london metals exchange lme and the shanghai futures exchange at the end of q1 2019 totaled 191 292 tonnes down 13 from the combined total of 219 804 tonnes at the end of q4 2018 since the end of q1 2018 combined class 1 nickel inventories have declined by approximately 50 as demand continues to exceed available supply the nickel market is anticipated to be in a structural deficit in the coming years despite the recovery of prices since the start of 2019 the average reference price for nickel in q1 2019 was down 7 from last year declining from us 6 03 lb to us 5 62 lb nickel prices in april 2019 have averaged at us 5 85 lb and are currently trading on the lme at us 5 56 lb demand for nickel will continue to be driven by the stainless steel sector according to market research by cru stainless steel demand is expected to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 4 through 2022 with production emanating largely from china and indonesia demand for nickel particularly class 1 nickel from non stainless steel sectors is also expected to accelerate given the growth of the electric vehicle battery market class i nickel along with cobalt are key metals needed to manufacture electric vehicle batteries beyond 2019 a shortage of class 1 nickel is anticipated over the coming years since current market prices are below incentive levels needed to develop new nickel projects as a result no new class 1 nickel supply is expected to come on stream in the near term cobalt cobalt prices and demand experienced considerable softness and volatility in q1 2019 the reference price for q1 2019 was us 18 53 lb down 52 from us 39 01 lb for the same period of 2018 consistent with trends over the past several months the price decline was driven by increased supply of intermediate product from the democratic republic of congo as well as by the destocking of inventory by chinese consumers abundant available supply has recently resulted in cobalt producers selling product at significant discount to prevailing reference prices during the run up in prices from late 2017 through 2018 cobalt producers often sold cobalt at a premium to reference prices as consumers looked to lock supply since the start of april however cobalt prices have risen by approximately 15 as consumers renew purchasing activities the recent increase in cobalt prices is expected to be sustained through the balance of 2019 albeit with some volatility due to increased speculative interest growing demand from the electric vehicle battery market and persistent supply risk concerns linked to the democratic republic of congo which is currently the world s

bulletin 3 excludes right of use assets recognized on adoption of ifrs 16 refer to note 4 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information the moa jv produced 4 397 tonnes of finished nickel in q1 2019 up 54 from 2 854 tonnes produced in q1 2018 growth was largely driven by the deployment of new mining equipment acquired throughout 2018 that resulted in improved ore access and reduced equipment downtime compared to the same period of last year in q1 2018 the moa jv s results were impacted by the highest level of rainfall at moa in more than 20 years and by transportation delays to the refinery in fort saskatchewan by the railway service provider efforts at improving ore access and mining equipment reliability at moa have been instrumental in increasing inventory stockpiles and reducing the impact that adverse weather conditions may have on future production finished cobalt production for q1 2019 was 426 tonnes up 27 from q1 2018 due to higher mixed sulphides availability the ratio of finished nickel production to cobalt production was higher in q1 2019 compared to last year as a result of a higher nickel to cobalt ratio in mixed sulphides produced at moa despite the change which is due to ore grade variability the nickel to cobalt ratio is consistent with historical norms combined nickel and cobalt production totals for q1 2019 represent the moa jv s highest ever first quarter production results second quarter production will be impacted however by the annual maintenance shutdown of the refinery in fort saskatchewan this year s shutdown is expected to be similar in duration to the prior years revenue for q1 2019 totaled 102 3 million up 6 from last year the increase was largely due to higher sales volume of nickel and cobalt offset however by a 70 decline in the cobalt realized price over q1 2018 the realized price decline in q1 2019 was driven by lower consumer demand and the settlement of provisional q4 2018 pricing the average realized price for nickel in q1 2019 was 7 51 lb down 4 from last year mining processing and refining mpr costs for q1 2019 were us 5 59 lb up 6 from us 5 26 lb for q1 2018 due to the impacts of higher energy prices and higher utilization of moa mixed sulphides relative to third party feeds although partly offset by the impact of higher sales volume ndcc in q1 2019 was us 4 53 lb up from us 2 06 lb for the same period last year the increase was largely due to lower by product revenue stemming from lower cobalt prices and the settlement of approximately 200 tonnes of provisionally priced cobalt sales 100 basis from q4 2018 the variance between q1 2019 cobalt reference and realized prices that resulted from provisional pricing adjustments negatively impacted ndcc by approximately 0 40 per pound the decrease in cobalt by product revenue was partly offset by lower third party feed costs and a higher contribution from fertilizer sales sustaining capital spending in q1 2019 was 14 0 million up from 4 5 million in q1 2018 as the moa jv continued its new mining equipment initiative aimed at improving equipment reliability reducing maintenance costs and improving ore accessibility consistent with its efforts to improve operational effectiveness the moa jv also commissioned a new slurry preparation plant dump pocket at moa in q1 2019 that is designed to improve

oil production in cuba in q1 2019 was 4 443 barrels of oil per day bopd down 20 from 5 572 bopd for q1 2018 lower production in 2019 was primarily due to natural reservoir declines and the absence of new development drilling revenue in q1 2019 was 9 0 million down 50 when compared to last year the decline was attributable to lower total net working interest production due to the impact of the decrease in profit oil percentage to 6 from 45 with the renewal of the puerto escondido yumuri psc starting in q2 2018 the decline was partially offset by a higher usgc hsfo reference oil price and by a weaker canadian dollar relative to the u s currency unit operating costs in cuba in q1 2019 were 21 19 per barrel up 2 from q1 2018 driven largely by reduced production costs were also negatively

vice president mike pence who see bri as an attempt to undermine america s global influence yet the investments funded by chinese cash are not in china so china has limited ability to grab assets when governments default if it pushes too hard it may merely stoke antipathy instead it usually responds by reducing the amount of money that debtors have to repay countries with longer records of lending to poor countries often do the same the paris club of creditors was formed in 1956 to devise ways of reducing defaulters debt loads the centre for global development a think tank in washington has counted more than 80 cases between 2000 and 2017 in which china provided relief to its debtors overseas an oft cited example of china s supposedly predatory approach involves hambantota a sri lankan port which has flopped commercially in 2017 sri lanka handed control of the port to a state owned chinese company on a 99 year lease but deborah brautigam of johns hopkins university says that of more than 3 000 china financed projects that she and others have tracked hambantota is the only one that is used in support of the debt trap theory it is the exception not the rule what it lacks in malevolence the bri may make up in clumsiness this is the second concern that china is lending to vulnerable states without sufficient caution take a group of 37 poor countries monitored by the imf loans from traditional bilateral lenders including america and japan have declined from 7 of the debtors gdp to 2 over the past decade loans from china by contrast have soared from virtually nothing to 4 it is welcome that china is supporting hard up nations but its enthusiasm generates foolhardiness david dollar of the brookings institution in washington has found that chinese development lending appears indifferent to political and economic risks the centre for global development has identified eight countries drowning in red ink that could be further swamped by bri projects see chart a report in december released by peking university ranked 94 bri countries based on measures such as the quality of their financial regulation and their openness to trade pakistan came second to last that is awkward for china pakistan may receive as much as 60bn in bri loans which would make it the biggest recipient of all there is truth to claims that bri credit can be ruinously expensive consider china eximbank s lending to kenya for the nairobi mombasa railway local reports say half the 3 6bn loan was priced 3 6 percentage points above a floating market interest rate that is high for a poor country it is just one of many such loans by eximbank which said this week that its outstanding bri related credit was more than 1trn yuan or nearly 150bn the bri s success will depend on whether chinese lenders can tighten their procedures for assessing creditworthiness while making their loans more affordable there are some promising signs this week s forum in beijing is expected to stress the need for bri debt to be sustainable in the case of the railway in laos caution is already evident the project involves 6bn of chinese lending which is about one third of the gdp of laos so a joint venture has been created it draws 70 of its capital from china and 30 from laos to fund its portion laos took a 465m loan from eximbank the loan was generous according to local reports it matures in 35 years at a 2 3 annual interest rate well below the commercial price of such debt laos has five years before it has to begin making repayments that is the kind of concession that it might have got from the world bank china may offer such generous terms more frequently last year it set up an agency to oversee its foreign aid in part to turn the bri into a more co ordinated development programme but this points to another concern that will be harder for china to deal with because it relates to the very nature of the bri its sheer ambition potential benefits look impressive a recent study by the world bank concluded that bri transportation projects could lift global gdp by 3 that is larger than the benefits that are usually shown to be generated by free trade agreements it could yet bear out china s notion that westerners save donald trump just want to lower tariffs whereas china is trying to build the roads that let trade happen this though is where the risks come in the world bank s rosy analysis assumes that bri projects are completed and work efficiently the scale of the effort is a huge challenge and such projects are a magnet for graft vast sums are being spent quickly in badly run places the railway in laos ought to make the landlocked country more accessible but for it to prove effective much more will be needed better roads to link it to existing transport new urban centres around the stations and freer trade with other countries china cannot achieve this alone but its often overweening approach to the bri has alienated potential partners america india and japan want little to do with it one reason is that china is in effect asking others not only to sign up to its infrastructure plans but also to endorse mr xi s worldview it does not help that china reveals so little about its lending and that contracts go mainly to chinese firms

belt and road initiative two key channels to achieving financial connectivity as prepared for delivery governor yi minister liu distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen good morning zao shang hao i would like to thank the people s bank of china and the chinese ministry of finance for organizing this important event as we meet during this beautiful springtime weather it brings to mind the words of the chinese proverb the whole year must be planned for in the spring over the next three days we will consider the ways the belt and road initiative the bri can help better connect the world physically and financially for years to come it is fitting that we begin these conversations with financial connectivity why because history teaches us that physical and financial connectivity go hand in hand think of the original silk road the desire for trade drove merchants to travel thousands of kilometers over time infrastructure in the form of bridges buildings and even entire new cities were built to accommodate what began as small trading posts and financial exchanges so where there is financial connection we see that rapid improvements in quality of life can quickly follow in our modern context there are several important channels to achieving this greater financial connectivity i want to highlight two today increased capital mobility and increased financial inclusion 1 increased capital mobility first enabling capital to flow more freely allowing capital to flow across borders can help support inclusive growth how by enhancing investments in infrastructure manufacturing and even health care right now foreign direct investment fdi is only 1 9 percent of gdp in developing countries before the global financial crisis it was at 2 5 percent making progress on major infrastructure needs will require capital flows to rise again and to be managed safely greater openness to capital flows can also bring down the cost of finance improve the efficiency of the financial sector and allow capital to support productive investments and new jobs that is certainly the case here in china where a further opening of the bond market to foreign investors will enable diversification and foster the internationalization of the renminbi rmb in fact the imf recently published a book on this topic called the future of china s bond market it outlines how the inclusion of china s bonds in global indexes can be a gamechanger not only for china s own financial markets but also for global investors the book also underscores the challenges that come with opening up capital markets thankfully we know from experience the elements that are required for success these include sound financial regulation transparent rules for investment and attention to fiscal sustainability on this last point china s increased focus on the long term success of bri projects and the announcement today by finance minister liu of a bri debt sustainability framework are very welcome steps in the right direction so too is the work that is now beginning to ensure that investment in bri projects is green low carbon and climate resilient this will lead to increased environmental sustainability 2 increased financial inclusion we also need increased financial inclusion my second channel for a more effective bri a few numbers close to half of the adult popu lation in low and middle income asia pacific economies do not have a bank account less than 10 percent have ever borrowed from a financial institution and yet we know that closing the finance gap is an economic must have for nations to thrive in the 21st century imf analysis shows that if the least financially inclusive countries in asia narrowed the finance gap to the level of thailand an emerging market economy the poverty rate in those countries could be reduced by nearly 4 percent how can we get there in part through policies that enable more women and rural citizens to access financial services the financial gender gap for women in developing countries is about 9 percent and has remained largely unchanged since 2011 there is no silver bullet but we know that fintech can play a catalyzing role in cambodia for example strong public private partnerships in supporting mobile finance has led to a tripling in the number of micro financial institutions since 2011 these institutions have now provided loans to over 2 million new borrowers representing nearly 20 percent of the adult population many of these citizens had never had a bank account now they can save for the future and perhaps even start a business of their own these are ideas that can work everywhere but countries have to be willing to partner and learn from each other that is one of the major reasons why last october the imf and world bank launched the bali fintech agenda the agenda lays out key principles from developing financial markets to safeguarding financial integrity that can help each nation as it strives for greater financial inclusion it is a model for international collaboration much like this forum conclusion let me conclude i began with a chinese proverb in the spirit of global connections i will close with a western poet the english poet john donne who wrote about the silk road was right when he said no man or woman is an island entire of itself every man is a piece of the continent a part of the main just like our history our modern financial landscape reveals the enormous potential of better connections between nations and between financial institutions across borders these financial connections can lead to new construction new jobs new opportunities and ultimately the ability to achieve economic security if we find ways to harness the potential we can build more prosperous inclusive economies that benefit all thank you very much xièxiè international monetary fund 2018 financial inclusion in asia pacific asia pacific departmental paper no 18 17

trade related conflict by early may however if the negotiation process lingers beyond may investors are likely to get jittery resulting in volatile trading story continues any change in the fed s

the moves in australian government bond yields were probably even more remarkable they plunged by as much as 15 points around the front end of the yield curve and by as much as 10 points around the middle to back end of the curve with overall yield bending into even greater inversion 5 markets betting on two cuts from rba naturally the fall in the a dollar and bond yields was anchored in changing bets about what the rba ought to do with interest rate policy and perhaps more importantly when they might do it traders have priced in almost entirely 2 rate cuts from the rba in 2019 with a cut fully priced in for the month of july remarkably traders are also betting that the central bank s meeting in may is more or less a live meeting implied probabilities currently suggest a fifty fifty proposition that the rba cut rates at that meeting even despite the fact it will be held in the shadows of the federal election 6 the usd also weighing on aud it s worth noting too that in the broader currency complex weak domestic macroeconomic fundamentals isn t the only factor enervating the aud the usd has touched two year highs in the past several days owing to several fundamental and technical drivers primarily the greenback has been bolstered by further poor data out of europe which has seen the euro test life in the 111 handle again the other perhaps more curious driver of green back strength right now is tied back to circumstance with japan about to head into an 11 day public holiday traders are seeking usd denominated assets in anticipation of a period of relatively low liquidity 7 the asx rally helped by cpi numbers for all the bearishness when it comes to currency and rates markets the asx200 is thrived courtesy of the weaker aussie dollar and lower discount rates the asx had already followed through with wall street s lead on wednesday by the time cpi data was released however the extra leg up that came from the softer inflation numbers and the subsequent expectation of a cutting rba was the extra fuel to lift the asx200 to an 11 year high much like equity indices across global markets presently momentum for the asx is apparently tilted to this upside even in light of what are currently mixed fundamentals 8 market watch spi futures down 5 points to 6364 points at 7 15am aest aud down to 70 09 us cents at 5 15am aest on wall st at 2 50pm dow 0 3 s p 500 0 1 nasdaq 0 4 in new york bhp 0 3 rio 0 2 atlassian 1 2 in europe stoxx 50 0 3 ftse 0 5 dax 0 2 cac 0 3 spot gold 0 1 to us1277 60 an ounce brent crude 0 4 to us74 87 a barrel us oil 0 2 to us65 77 a barrel iron ore 0 05 to us93 50 a tonne dalian iron ore 0 6 to 624 yuan lme aluminium 0 8 to us1857 a tonne lme copper 1 3 to us6364 a tonne 2 year yield us 2 33 australia 1 31 5 year yield us 2 33 australia 1 37 10 year yield us 2 53 australia 1 78 germany 0 01 us australia 10 year yield gap 75 basis points this column was produced in commercial partnership between the sydney morning herald the age and ig
beijing and washington have been engaged in long standing negotiations to resolve an increasingly contentious trade dispute it looks like we are approaching the endgame but as james politi and lucy hornby report in the financial times the two sides remain apart on two key issues the fate of existing us levies on chinese goods which beijing wants to see removed and the terms of an enforcement mechanism demanded by washington to ensure that china abides by the deal assuming we resolve these final issues what will the ultimate deal look like will it rectify lingering structural problems that have devastated us manufacturing with genuine enforcement provisions or will the deal simply represent yet another faux bargain in which china in essence bribes us officialdom via purchases of some additional soybeans and wide bodied aircraft to make cosmetic reductions in beijing s trade surplus there s no question that a simple restoration of the status quo ante would not constitute a trade win for us president donald trump by any stretch that would be an epitomic case of sound and fury signifying nothing at the same time it would be highly unrealistic to expect beijing to eliminate its elaborate system of state subsidies for industry the basis for its state capitalist growth model which has accelerated china s quantum leap up the technology curve in this regard us trade representative ustr robert lighthizer will play a crucial role in determining the outcome although questions still linger as to whether he will ultimately be undermined by trump in the latter s quest to secure a win at any cost especially if this win comes with the usual pledges to purchase much higher quantities of american goods and nothing else behind it by the same token even if beijing goes beyond that and pledges to open up more sectors of china s domestic economy to us investment tighten laws on intellectual property etc such additional promises do not really help american workers quite the contrary if it means that companies like general motors keep shutting down domestic facilities and making increasingly large bets on the chinese market as they appear to be doing already using trump s simplistic metric of success the actual bilateral trade figures between the united states and china investing more in china will not reduce america s trade deficit with beijing and indeed might add to it as these chinese manufactured goods are re exported back to the american market the granting of a permanent normal trading relationship pntr and then the subsequent accession to the world trade organization in 2001 have been a boon for china but the persistence of ongoing us trade deficits have led many including the current president to judge the united states a loser in ongoing trade negotiations with beijing it s not a totally irrational judgment china s wto accession hasn t been great for us manufacturers part of the problem stems from the extraordinary fact that washington has seldom deployed a negotiator who is actually well versed in trade issues since the days of bill clinton s administration it has been the us treasury secretary as opposed to the country s chief trade representative who has consistently directed trade negotiations with the resultant and eminently predictable impact that financial interests have superseded those of any other economic sector that pattern was briefly disrupted when president george w bush appointed alcoa s chief executive officer paul o neill to head the treasury and then csx president john w snow but ultimately the wall street über alles mentality again prevailed with the appointment of hank paulson to be followed by tim geithner jack lew and now steve mnuchin all of whom have finance centric backgrounds for all of the supposed financial sophistication of america s wall street based treasury secretaries it is indeed ironic that china has consistently been able to play them for fools with the implied threat of its so called nuclear option a highly flawed narrative that alleges that as a final resort beijing would dump its huge stockpile of us treasuries thereby driving up us interest rates and creating a catastrophic depression for the us economy that so called threat to the bond market is the traditional reason successive treasury secretaries have been hesitant to resort to the blunt trauma force of trade sanctions or tariffs when it came to negotiating with beijing they were also comforted by the idea that as it modernized china would increasingly abide by traditional norms of free trade doctrine against all available evidence that shows that it has not played by the same rules let s leave aside the internal incoherence of the nuclear option china exiting dollar denominated assets could well create downward pressure on the external value of the free floating us currency but that would enhance us export competitiveness assuming of course that america has anything left to export an unfortunate legacy of the treasury s malign neglect of us manufacturing it s also operationally wrong see here for further detail and mistakenly assumes against all historical evidence to the contrary that beijing would pursue an economic policy that is the functional equivalent of cutting its own nose to spite its face as paul krugman among others notes even if paulson geithner lew mnuchin etc didn t truly believe in the nuclear option they have been happy to tamp down the possibility of a trade war in order to keep the capital markets stable each trade deal has therefore largely sustained the status quo the price for which sees beijing usually offering up a few well timed purchases of soybeans or boeing aircraft although the latter will be more problematic in light of the 737 fiasco but china s policymakers have never been forced to deal with the economic consequences of their country s mercantilism which has resulted in the steady erosion of america s rust belt as the us economy gave back the considerable employment gains it achieved during the 1990s via a historic contraction in manufacturing employment things have changed markedly since trump seized the china trade portfolio from the treasury s steve mnuchin and placed it under the control of the ustr robert lighthizer unusually for a member of the trump administration lighthizer actually knows his brief he has had literally decades of experience in trade issues dating from his days as a deputy us trade representative in 1983 when japan was widely perceived as the main trade threat to his current role as america s chief trade negotiator as trump s ustr he has provided policy flesh and bones to the president s robustly unilateral approach in trade if anything lighthizer s trade hawkishness has become even more pronounced over the years as he has shifted his attention away from japan to china in his 2010 congressional testimony he argued that us policymakers gravely underestimated the threat posed to american manufacturing by virtue of china s entering the wto marshaling an array of evidence to cast doubt on the idea that its entry had brought any significant economic benefits to us workers and businesses he also highlighted the mercantilist nature of beijing s state capitalism and noted that the country s administrative complexity likely precluded it embracing wto rules even if wanted to do so which he doubted as part of china s system specific large companies receive government patronage in the form of credit contracts and subsidies the chinese government in turn sees these national champions as a means of competing with foreign rivals and encourages their dominant role in the domestic economy and in export markets scholars have questioned whether given its lack of institutional capacity and the complexity of its constitutional administrative and legal system china is even capable of complying with its wto obligations no doubt in thrall to the prevailing free trade ideology washington s policy passivity made it loath to use available tools such as the wto s 421 special safeguards to counter the resultant trade shock in that same testimony lighthizer also signaled that he was uninterested in the niceties of wto style multilateralism more inclined to the use of aggressive unilateralism via executive orders diplomatic pressure and most important the use of section 232 of the 1962 trade expansion act to levy tariffs on various products premised on the notion that the targeted country in today s case china represented a national security threat most significant from the lighthizer perspective is an explicit rejection of the idea that china needs to do more than just buy more us goods before the two countries strike a permanent trade deal which in any case is highly problematic if the end objective is to bring the trade balance between the two countries to zero you can understand why for one thing the math doesn t add up even if china were to raise its agricultural purchases by us 30 billion as it has reportedly pledged to do this is pretty small beer in the context of a 300 billion bilateral trade deficit as economist brad setser highlights the scope for explosive growth in soybeans is actually fairly limited as the pre tariff base for soybeans was quite high the united states was supplying 12 billion of china s almost 40 billion in oil seed imports a huge tilt away from brazil might cause us beans exports to double but getting much more than that would be difficult there is a natural seasonality to soybean trade that favors alternating supply from the southern and northern hemispheres the real growth would need to come in sectors where china doesn t buy much now corn rice perhaps pork and beef getting really big numbers there though would risk pushing up us prices and getting china to abandon its goal of self sufficiency in basic grains so us farm prices would be pushed up which would hurt us domestic consumers even as it cosmetically dresses up america s trade position vis a vis china setser adds china has signaled it is willing to let foreign firms take majority stakes in a few more sectors and has reiterated its belief that technology transfer isn t a legal requirement for entry into the chinese market there are likely to be settlements on some long standing disputes as well the rating agencies have gotten approval to enter the chinese market visa american express and mastercard likely will finally get approval too mastercard through a joint venture not everything changes and some tariffs introduced as retaliation in the past may get dropped but how does the entry into china of consumer credit card companies or the ratings agencies help americans ironically this looks precisely like the kind of sop to finance that trump said he would eschew however because of corporate wall street pressure the trump agenda pivoted a few months ago from selective decoupling and protection of american strategic industries to opening up china for us investment and pushing china to treat american companies doing business in china more equally that is why leading us companies have become friendlier and increasingly less critical of trump s trade policy even as the economic commentariat has continued to blast him trump himself needs to understand that a third to a half of trade is really transnational production with inputs from suppliers coordinated by mostly third party manufacturers in asia notably in semiconductors the purpose of modern mercantilism particularly as it is practiced in china is not just to sell more finished goods but to try to monopolize the high value added rungs of supply chains it is unclear that targeting china s trade surplus with the united states will ultimately disrupt these entrenched supply chains it almost certainly won t bring semiconductor manufacturing back to america s shores in the end therefore pushing china s leadership to make structural changes to open up china to american companies is probably an illusion beijing is unlikely to rip up the model that has seen it create national champions that can now compete successfully with america s biggest corporations it may make token promises to curtail cybertheft or the subsidies that the trump administration complains create an uneven playing field for american companies but as noted above even lighthizer himself has cast doubt that beijing could enforce those promises given the administrative complexity of its system of governance in his eagerness to claim a win therefore trump ironically might end up settling for the usual faustian bargain more large chinese purchases selective decoupling of supply chains as american companies rethink their reliance on china and increased domestic protection for certain sectors such as 5g on national security grounds lighthizer s considerable efforts notwithstanding we may have reached the peak as far as this particular tariff war goes but the longer term trade tensions will almost certainly persist well beyond this hollow victory which mr art of the deal will no doubt claim for himself when the negotiations do officially end this article was produced by economy for all a project of the independent media institute which provided it to asia times
