overview the holiday shortened week is off to a slow tentative start the surge of the s p 500 before the weekend failed to inspire today asia markets were mostly firmer led by japan while china hong kong and singapore moved lower the nikkei gapped higher jumping above the 22k level that had been holding it back it is at its best level since early last december the us coattails are even shorter in europe where the dow jones stoxx 600 is little changed with a three day rally in tow us shares are a little heavier us treasuries are consolidating the pre weekend drop which weighed on asia pacific bonds earlier today and european benchmark yields are firmer with italy bucking the trend the dollar is mostly softer with sterling and the swedish krona the strongest of the majors 0 20 0 25 higher while the australian and canadian dollars are lightly softer alongside the norwegian krone the south korean won is the strongest of the emerging market currencies today helped by the rally in us stocks and chinese economic data asia pacific us treasury secretary mnuchin suggested that the trade talks with china are nearly complete he acknowledged it seemed for the first time that the enforcement mechanism would work both ways meaning that the us could also be subject to repercussions if it were to fail to make good on its commitments still us officials have been claiming progress on a nearly daily basis when a date is set for the next trump xi meeting that will be the best indication that a deal has been reached note that unlikely nafta 2 0 this is not a treaty that requires congressional approval this is an executive agreement the us japanese trade negotiations begin in the middle of the week this too will be an executive agreement that does not require approval from congress some critics see these executive agreements as a way to bypass the legislative branch talks this week will lay the groundwork for abe s us visit later this month part of the problem is that japan has struck agreements with europe and the trans pacific partnership and it now grants others greater access than the us this has hit the us agriculture where us pork exports to japan for example are off by more than a third this year as the us insisted in the nafta 2 0 talks and in negotiations with china it seeks protection against currency manipulation which seems to be mostly a question of transparency of actions japan does not appear to have intervened in the foreign exchange market for several years china reports march industrial production and retail sales and q1 gdp in the middle of the week sequentially march industrial output and retail sales are expected to have improved while q1 gdp is expected to have slowed to 6 3 year over year from 6 4 chinese lending and trade figures released last week confirm officials have switched gears and are doing more to support the economy the strong export figures are good for china but also reflect stronger world demand the dollar has been confined to about a 10 tick range on either side of jpy112 00 where a 640 mln option expires today technically a convincing move above jpy112 would target jpy114 we remain concerned that not only is the japanese economy struggling to show any meaningful traction but the closure of the markets for a long period at the end of the month as the abdication of the emperor and the ascension of the new emperor is potentially disruptive the market is pausing after bringing the australian dollar close to 0 7200 it has not closed above this level in more than two months and the market has not given up on it initial support is seen in the 0 7140 0 7160 band foreign investors continue to favor south korean shares this month they have plunked down more than 2 0 after buying more than 4 5 bln in q1 demand for indian shares appears to have cooled this month after foreigners bought roughly 8 2 bln in q1 europe the uk parliament is on recess until april 23 in the meantime the government and labour continue to talk the situation still looks fluid and continues to be talk of some kind of customs union arrangement a referendum on the final agreement remains an open possibility in the end maybe it is a be reminiscent of how france removed its troops from joint nato command but still exercised and prepared with nato and later relented and its forces were again part of nato s command structure observers will scrutinize the may 3 local elections for signs of the political consequences the social democrats came out narrowly ahead in the national elections in finland for the first time in 16 years the populist finns came in second it has added a hostility to policies and taxes meant to address climate change to its anti immigration rhetoric the market reaction appears to be limited to some additional pressure on the short end of its curve where the two year yield is up four five basis points the worst performer in europe the stock market is heavy losing about 0 4 today and paring this month s gain to a still impressive 3 6 the 10 year yield is up half of a basis point at 0 27 the social democrats now need to forge a coalition and this may force it to be centrist an estimated 31k yellow vest protesters took to the streets this past weekend this evening in paris before the us equities close president macron will make a national address later this week markit will report the flash april pmi recall in march that both the manufacturing and service pmis were below the 50 boom bust level while france s voice in europe has not lessened as illustrated by the shorter brexit extension than the european council president tusk proposed the economic weakness keeps macron on the defensive nationally the european parliament elections at the end of next month may seem him punished the euro is consolidating last week s gains that took it above 1 13 for the first time since march 26 it is not managed to push through the pre weekend high of just below 1 1325 there is an option for 555 mln euros at 1 1335 that will be cut today chart resistance is seen near 1 1350 though some are talking about a move to 1 1400 initial support is pegged near 1 1290 and a break of 1 1280 would likely signal a near term top and the start of a potential reversal sterling is firm in a narrow range the general consolidative tone remains intact the 1 3120 area is important it houses a gbp300 mln option that expires today and the 20 day moving average sterling has not closed above its 20 day moving average since march 27 support is pegged near 1 3050 america president trump again took to twitter to criticize the federal reserve claiming the stock market and the economy would be much stronger had the central bank not engaged in quantitive tightening the president s comments and his candidates for the federal reserve board of governors have sparked widespread criticism and concern about the central bank s independence ecb draghi who rarely comments on us developments expressed concern about the fed s independence although we will address it in a longer note later for now allow us to make two points first observers may be tut tutting but investors see past it market prices level of interest rates and the slope of the curve do not indicate investor concern that the fed has been compromised second neither moore nor cain has been officially nominated the senate has sometimes failed to confirm nominees many expect cain to remove himself or that the president does not go forward with the nomination the power of appointment to the central bank is the approved way to influence the direction of monetary policy in many countries leaving aside the ecb the system of checks and balances is working eight fed officials speak this week beginning today with evans and rosengren the data diary begins with among the first looks at april outside of the weekly jobless claims which point to a robust labor market it is expected to have improved but this week s focus is on march industrial output and retail sales both are expected to have improved sequentially also this week earnings from the financial sector are among the highlights canada reports march existing home sales today they fell 9 in february and a small bounce is expected the canadian dollar will likely be the brunt of disappointment the bank of canada s senior loan officer survey results will also be announced the dollar index is trading in a narrow range near the pre weekend low 96 75 additional support is seen near 96 60 some observers think that that stale longs have to be forced out and this may take a push through the 200 day moving average 96 10 with a few minor exceptions the us dollar has chopped betweencad1 33 and cad1 34 playing the range makes money now for the nimble

we expect data due on tuesday to show that industrial production rose only slightly in march as increases in utilities and mining output were offset by another decline in manufacturing wrote andrew hunter from capital economics the recent improvement in some of the global manufacturing surveys particularly in china suggests that the outlook for the factory sector is not quite as bad as it

national budget is a growth influencer but in nigeria with the concentration of resources at the centre and the associated undercurrents it has turned to a harbinger of underdevelopment following poor implementations over the years assistant editor finance and economy chijioke nelson writes on the unending trend and how the 2019 version would sustain the pattern of dismal execution boni irikafe is a retired directorate level federal civil servant who now co promotes an investment bank located in the city of lagos he now realises what delayed budget does to businesses and economy and recounts lost opportunities the national budget is a deliberate estimate of the course of action of a government in the form of planned revenue proposed expenditure and debts financing when necessary over a fiscal year this course of action has become a serial controversy especially how capital expenditure votes suffer implementation inertia year after year while the fiscal document is yearly infiltrated with repetitions ambiguous terms bogus allocations for some items and paltry sum for others besides the serial delay in approving the document that has defied the four year old administration of president muhammadu buhari and his change mantra has continued to jolt the business community for one thing national resources are concentrated at the centre until government signs a budget all economic agents will only speculate and most businesses if not all do not thrive with guesswork now my company uses estimates and historical methods to plan pending the approval of budget we have always ended up readjusting our projections our foreign partners and clients would be hesitant despite assurances because they would always insist on certainty not assumed numbers irikafe added though the country s budget presentation to the national assembly had usually run counter to the fiscal responsibility act it was worse with the 2019 budget document which was presented on december 17 2018 this was caught between legislative recess and general elections the first legislative mention was march 12 2019 an indication of the usual trajectory an economist dr uzochukwu amakom at the 2019 budget summit organised by the centre for social justice in conjunction with friedrich ebert stiftung nigeria office told the guardian that budget is an important document in every economy which dictates the decisions of not only the public sector but also those of the private sector in nigeria the budget since return to democracy has reflected a tussle between politics and economics with the former prevailing over the latter to an average nigerian including entrepreneurs investors and the organised private sector the credibility of the document is doubtful there exist large variances between the projected parameters and the actual results over the years he said in the 2019 budget proposal oil price is benchmarked against 60 per barrel currently around 70 after trading far below 60 for one full month this year it is worth noting that over 90 per cent of foreign exchange earnings come from oil sector and over 70 per cent of national income is generated there too oil production estimate of 2 3 million barrels per day mbpd including condensates is currently at 1 9mbpd indicating unrealistic projection that would distort the system as usual as such production level has never been met in the last five years more so the global oil cartel has capped production in nigeria at below 1 8mbpd while the united states has used increased shale production to checkmate price changes occasioned by supply shortfalls so price of crude oil is largely uncertain there is also alleged double standard in exchange rate projection of n305 currently at n306 75 as all eurobond debts proceeds are usually converted at nearly the market rates in the bureau de change sector n360 also there is the projection of real gross domestic product gdp growth at 3 01 per cent and currently at less than two per cent for 2018 against the projection of the economic recovery and growth plan which targets about five per cent in 2019 and seven per cent in 2020 these yearly projections appropriations and patterns have consistently failed overtime it is now a trend thereby raising the questions of political will to cause change the capacity of the budget crafters and the genuineness of the projections especially as the economy remains exposed to development challenges serial violations of fra the 2019 budget proposal like the previous ones followed processes that clearly depict hush preparation and generic computation setting in motion another failed implementation it was caught in the web of general elections when governance was highly on the sidelines the fiscal responsibility act 2007 provides that the medium term expenditure framework mtef which shall be the basis for the preparation of the yearly budget shall be ready before the end of the second quarter june a fact check by the guardian showed that as at the middle of october there was no mention of mtef in public circle which is an indication of poor preparations but the dramatic turn of its approval and compilation of the fiscal appropriation proposal in less than three months call to question when and how the stakeholders inputs were aggregated for a guide into the 2019 items and numbers this is a general ugly trend over the years the programme officer public finance management at csj fidelis onyjegbu said the nation s budget presentation has been reduced to a show for the fun of it and to fulfill all righteousness adding that there is nothing to be optimistic about in presenting the budget on december 19 to lawmakers of course it is a fact that once the season of campaigns arrive both the legislature and executive would kick the budget out of the way until the elections are unfortunately it is development issues and future that they kicked aside march has ended and we are still talking about budget this is the tradition over the years he said the truth is that the 2019 budget proposal as presented in december 2018 was just mere guesswork because the mtef which forms the basis for its preparation was just approved last week what a violation of the law the president had in november 2017 while presenting the 2018 budget proposal indicated his intention to return the financial year to the january december timeline and blamed the nass for the delayed approval of the budget despite the repeatedly failed promises the current delay in presentation which was worse than other years has indirectly exonerated the lawmakers and shows lack of commitment to effect the change besides for sitting atop an amendment that proposed a new sub section and timeline for federal and states lawmakers to pass the budget without explanation his political will to stand by his promises is doubtful an abuja based development consultant jide ojo said it is quite unfortunate that instead of nigeria to move to the january december budget cycle the process has worsened under this administration even the presentation of the budget on december 19 was threatened by the strike of parliamentary staff association of nigeria and walk out by members of house of representatives the executive that has been tardy with the budget preparations is to blame the 2019 2021 mtef and fiscal strategy paper fsp was sent to the nass on november 6 2018 this delayed budget presentation is a blatant breach of fiscal responsibility act 2007 this uncoordinated and capricious budgeting by the federal government will impact negatively on the implementation and performance of the economic recovery and growth plan he said frivolous flags about n74 16 billion has been flagged as frivolous inappropriate unclear and wasteful among the lines items that dotted the nation s appropriation bill the centre for social justice csj and its partners the citizens wealth platform sustained their yearly vetting of the national budget plan discovering 117 questionable line items in a document that is being distributed among the lawmakers shortly before the belated approval of the medium term expenditure framework mtef last week the sylvester ogbaga led house of representatives committee on commerce raised the alarm over a n14 billion transfer by the ministry of industry trade and investments which status appropriated vired or kept with nigeria export processing zones authority was unknown the development which led to a 24 hour ultimatum on the minister to explain the ministry s spending in 2018 and proposed budget for 2019 is yet to be resolved the committee is also querying federal government s full payment of n14 billion counterpart fund in a public private partnership business with private ownership of 75 per cent share and no financial commitment while two persons associated with minister are directors many insider abuses like this have gone unnoticed and covered up in the national budget over the years yet key government officials especially those in charge of budget openly deny the existence of questionable items in the fiscal document the assessed tardiness and recurring issues of non clarity in the nation s budgeting process affect the proposals by the public complaints commission independent national electoral commission national judicial council niger delta development commission among others besides virtually every ministry department and agency mda got a vote for clothing and uniforms with a total vote of n3 277 billion even when most mdas have no need for uniforms and clothing the public complaints commission had a bulk sum of n4 2 billion with no details the same argument that now seeks to compel the national assembly to disclose the details of its budget the independent national electoral commission made a bulk sum of n45 5 billion national judicial council abuja n110 billion and niger delta development commission n95 19 billion the niger delta development commission has a vote of n95 188billion ministry of niger delta gets n41 60billion while the amnesty programme has a vote of n65 billion the total of these figures for the niger delta comes up to n201 789billion the niger delta master plan should be the basis of budgeting instead of the current uncoordinated approach at the office of the secretary to the government of the federation a provision for the north east development commission worth n10 billion was made when the service wide vote at n45 billion has captured the same also provisions in the service wide votes like the sustainable development goals north east interventions have no details but are stated as lump sums the ministry of agriculture allocated various hefty sums for undefined value chains other revenues expected in 2019 include various recoveries of n38 billion proceeds from the restructuring of government s equity in joint ventures n710 billion and other sundry incomes of n104 11 billion it is pertinent to state that revenue projections undergird a budget and the variance between projected revenue and the actual realised should not be very wide and if at all it must not become a trend not more than a five per cent variance may be tolerated as a good and fit practice considering that we are running a human system which may never attain perfection this is not to be for the country but the director general of the budget office of the federation ben akabueze insisted that the underlying drivers of the 2019 revenue projections such as oil price benchmark of 60 b oil production of 2 3mbpd exchange rate of n305 per dollar growth rate of 3 01 per cent and inflation rate of 9 98 per cent were projected to reflect current and near term realities on the global and domestic fronts notwithstanding the recent softening in international oil prices the considered view of most reputable oil industry analysts is that the downward trend in price towards the end of 2018 is not necessarily reflective of the outlook for all of 2019 however we will closely monitor the situation and will respond to any changes in the international oil price outlook for 2019 mr president has directed the nnpc to take all possible measures to achieve the targeted oil production of 2 3 million barrels per day mbpd given that the technical capacity to produce up to 2 5 mbpd exists government will intensify its efforts at pursuing a non oil revenue driven economy the medium term goal is to ensure that the recurrent budget can be funded with non oil revenues our approach is to open up new opportunities for non oil activities and optimise efficiency in non oil revenue collections particularly by expanding the tax base and strengthening tax administration of course there may also be some upward adjustment in the value added tax vat and excise rates he said but these contrast with ongoing developments first the chairman of federal inland revenue services babatunde fowler has denied plans to increase this came after a mass of pressure was put on government s plan citing the economic hardship in the land still in what appears like a losing streak for vat plans at the lottery and gaming sub sector the operators described the automated collection process of the federal inland revenue service firs as lacking in consultations and would not work well the founder of nairabet and house of representatives member elect akin alabi said the potential reduction in hoped for winnings especially on low odds bets would drive customers from regulated operators into the hands of unregulated ones according to him firs should have consulted operators before taking the decision to impose five per cent vat and the automation of collection in retrospect the 2017 budget implementation report showed that out of projected retained revenue of n5 08 trillion only n2 37 trillion was realised being 46 75 per cent of the projected revenue and a variance of 53 per cent when other non budgeted revenue heads like refund from the nigerian national petroleum corporation and exchange rate differential were added it came up to n2 66 trillion being a paltry 52 27 per cent of the budgeted revenue and a variance of about 48 per cent the components of this revenue big picture that created the hole started with government s share of oil revenue projected at n2 12 trillion which returned only n1 13 trillion 53 01 per cent leaving a variance of 47 per cent non oil revenue projection was n1 41 trillion but the actual figure showed n956 67 billion that is 67 82 per cent performance leaving a gap of 32 per cent the expectation from vat was n241 92 billion while n130 05 billion was realised being 53 75 per cent performance company income tax at n807 82 billion recorded n543 34 billion customs and excise was projected at n277 56 billion while the actual was n261 41 billion the perennial underperformer was independent revenue which had a projection of n807 57 billion while the actual was n295 29 billion being a performance of 36 5 per cent these poor records were noticed in all the quarterly budget implementation reports of 2018 so far accessed but more worrisome is that the stage is set for the trend to continue in 2019 first it was too ambitious for the budget managers to benchmark crude oil price at 60 per barrel against global oil price forecast at 61 per barrel nearly all the crude oil trading contracts in the first two months of 2019 were done below 55 per barrel how would the country recoup the lost dollars that are already earmarked in the budget these continue to throw up questions about capacity ingenuity and leadership commitment to using the budget to influence economic development borrowing for debts salaries the guardian s analysis of government s 2017 expenditure side showed that personnel costs were projected at n1 88 trillion while the actual is n1 87 trillion representing 99 per cent performance there were debt projections at n1 66 trillion and an actual figure of n1 64 trillion 98 per cent performance but excludes other peripheral debt items that ballooned the figure further this means that the combination of personnel expenditure and debt repayment amounted to n3 51 trillion exceeding the realised overall revenue by n845 billion the implication is that the country borrowed to the tune of n844 88 billion to pay salaries and debts also whatever was spent on capital expenditure was borrowed if we are not raising enough money to repay toady s debts how shall we pay back bigger debts tomorrow with an economy that is losing steam with citizens and investor s confidence at an all time low the lead director at centre for social justice eze onyekpere pointed out that the figures which have become yearly trend were worrisome and worth raising alarm for as they are not sustainable either in the short medium or long term and totally unacceptable for a country of this size with available resources and aspiration of nigeria the figures show that our budget is a huge joke projections are never near the actual and the budget is reduced to a mere exercise in projecting for what is not realisable we are borrowing to pay salaries and repay previous debts and all talks about executing capital projects are deceitful if they are based on borrowing the debt is growing at an unprecedented scale and in geometrical proportions and no one seems to care the unexecuted 2018 federal budget is going to be heavily reliant on borrowing while 2019 will follow the same trajectory unfortunately bloomberg com on february 22 2019 published an article that estimated six nigerians in every minute falling into extreme poverty he said missing pro poor goals as an inclusive growth oriented document every version of the national budget must prioritise the rural poor it s sad to say that education and health sectors budgets have not only betrayed international treaties the country is signatory to but have neglected issues that can trigger mass disorder for example the proposal on the health sector currently at the national assembly has been described as a tacit support for the huge and ongoing foreign exchange outflow through medical tourism at the detriment of the economy it also portends a gloomy future for mothers and newborns as well as the overall human development index of the citizenry as a paltry provision at n366 billion for the nation s health system would soon throw up more challenges foreign donors are fast withdrawing their support because of a mix of allegations of non transparent implementations of previous donations and the country s new classification which put it out of the lower income countries although it is atop the ranking of poorest people on earth a civil society activist dr david agu said the health sector s total budgetary allocations at n370 billion fell by n1 05 trillion in 2019 proposal compared to n1 42 trillion recommended with some critical line items related to the rural mass being neglected for a nation like nigeria with this huge population to propose n15 billion against n189 8 billion for immunisation and n1 2 billion against n18 billion recommendation to provide for family planning is a far cry also proposing n124 million against n100 billion recommendations for hiv testing n7 6 billion in place of n120 billion for hiv treatments and n2 35 billion against n6 2 billion recommendations for vvf treatment are plans for health crisis in the country he said the president after his re election told nigerians to be prepared for tough times in the next four years but onyekpere added living in denial will not help preparing for the tough time will involve a call for sacrifice to ride over the tough times but this must be premised on cutting down waste frivolities and reducing the cost of governance the poor nigerians who are helpless need paracetamol in their local health centre to cope the health sector plan is a disaster with improvement in child healthcare and emphasis on the achievement of the millennium development goals the number of under five deaths that occurred in the world declined to 5 42 million as at 2017 unfortunately about 2 79 million under five deaths representing 51 61 per cent of global record occurred in sub saharan africa ssa as at 2017 out of this about 714 188 under five deaths representing 13 18 per cent of global record and 25 55 per cent of sub region s record occurred in nigeria as at 2017 also about 465 681 infant deaths representing 11 40 per cent of global record and 24 11 per cent of ssa s record occurred in nigeria as at 2017 these were indeed on the increase and have merited the country the notoriety for a dangerous place for mother and child is it not time the budget is used for the masses the envelop allocated to the health sector is way below the recommended amount so certain line items should be given priority in terms of spending of the lean envelop revise the proposed budget to make every unit of spending count for the wellbeing of nigerians in 2019 identify and remove all wasteful frivolous unclear and inappropriate line items and channel the recovered funds to the already identified priority items in the csos memorandum on health sector mtss 2019 2021 agu added transparency issues when the minister of finance mrs zainab ahmed was confronted bythe guardian on debt and budget issues she repeatedly said that the country has no debt profile to be afraid of much less of becoming a crisis but she admitted there was revenue crisis and in reality her response was an approach to fend off fearful realities that confounded the economy granted nigeria s debt to gross domestic product gdp ratio is below the international threshold but that does not determine ability to pay only revenue stream does given the current low fiscal capacity as admitted by her it becomes contradictory to affirm revenue crisis but deny debt crisis it is living in denial to use 68 per cent of revenue to service debts crowding out investible funds and perpetually live by borrowing mr martins eke of the citizen wealth platform said it is an unfortunate situation to go back to the scenario before the 2005 debt relief the current administration ramped up domestic and foreign borrowing and has not come up with any feasible funding alterative to reduce the deficit financing of the budget we are currently paying debts with 68 per cent of our retained revenue in essence we are using up 68 kobo out of every 100 kobo earned by the country to service debts and the irony is that we are still borrowing more thereby increasing the percentage of retained revenue that will be required to service debts in the future he said the continued shallow revenue base and admittances by government officials that the much touted diversification and its benefits would remain deferred due to long term nature of investments continue to call to question the implementation of the more than n10 trillion debt deals in the last four years while the minister affirmed that all the eurobond proceeds were programmed for capital expenditure implementations from 2017 to 2018 the questions about which projects where when and how much per project continue to linger till date this has remained the challenge of the country s utilisation of debt proceeds and its transparent reporting as discordant tunes over parlous infrastructure linger the routine of delayed budget implementation report spanning several administrations with capital budget releases that are devoid of specifics have created more suspicions especially with observed non incremental in infrastructure stock admitting that the ministry would consider listing of projects covered under each capital expenditure release she said we are looking at the possibility of that when we release capital projects going forward we want to do that as a support in monitoring the implementation from the beginning not just after the funds have been utilised as currently obtains after six months she made this pledge in far away indonesia on the sidelines of the international monetary fund and world bank group meetings she is yet to make good her words lawmakers national cake the national assembly nass an arm of government that is supposed to uphold accountability and symbol of transparency has remained an impregnable black box which defies public scrutiny with its budget issues it is their share of national cake and dictated by them what an irony the lawmakers beside being ranked as world s top paid legislators at public expense according to budgit a civic organisation their yearly budget is a one line statutory transfer which is neither reviewed by any authority nor at the very least made accessible to the public thus enabling unbridled corruption the communications associate at budgit shakir akorede told the guardian that at this age of digital governance and global calls for transparency in public institutions it is a national disrepute that the parliament has refused to eschew anti democratic practices as it continues to bury its yearly allocations under the hallowed chambers more disappointing is the fact that despite nigeria s membership in open government partnership and tonnes of pledges by the senate leadership to run an open nass everything has relapsed to default setting after a breakdown of the budget was made public in 2017 he said just last week the senate president bukola saraki announced that the 2018 budget of the national assembly has been released this was the first time and the only fiscal year to be released since 1999 but akorede added objectively speaking what the senate president has done is a right step in the direction of transparency and accountability which we have reached a new agreement with him but we have perused the released document and i can tell you it s a tip of the iceberg we are not fully satisfied in that the financial account is full of grey areas to be exact the details are not enough item by item figures are missing it is not enough to see what goes to the senate house of representatives and whatnot a full breakdown of the figures is the true execution of opennass we have upon receiving the document escalated our observations to him hopefully those concerns would be fixed in the highly expected 2019 budget of the legislature what s more budgit is even ready to offer for free its expertise to the national assembly management in view of preparing a better document that s in full compliance with opennass demands and standards budgit s principal lead gabriel okeowo added starting again with the 2019 budget a line by line breakdown of the nass allocation must be made public going forward that is the ultimate way the legislature can lead by example in making public accountability a nigerian culture it is worth a great legacy one that history would never forget by truly and finally opening up nass
usdjpy climbed to a one month high last week as euro rose to its best level against the us dollar since the 26th of march the only times that we see simultaneous strength in pairs like usdjpy and eurusd is when risk appetite is strong stocks pulled back at the start of last week but they rebounded strongly on friday to end the week not far from 6 month highs there s been a lot of talk about recessions trade tensions between the eu and us are escalating and there s still no final resolution to us china trade talks or brexit and yet investors are optimistic because bank earnings are strong and they believe that policy accommodation abroad will help to mitigate a deep slowdown in global growth they are also relieved that the federal reserve won t add to the pain by tightening again this year while this may be incredibly optimistic until all signs point to a significant slowdown in the us that will spill over to the rest of the world investors see their glasses as half full easter week is always an interesting one in the fx market we usually see a burst of activity the first three days followed by consolidation this year may be different because there are a number of important economic reports scheduled for release on thursday so volatility could extend until then nonetheless most markets are closed for good friday and easter monday the us is only closed friday so many

usdjpy 114 or 110 treasury yields rebounded last week squeezing usdjpy higher in the process us economic reports were stronger than expected with consumer and producer prices ticking upwards the rise in price pressures was driven mostly by higher food and energy costs which is not sustainable but when low inflation is one of the main reasons why central bankers are slowing policy normalization it is good news for the greenback jobless claims also fell to a 40 year low this confirms that the labour market the strongest part of the us economy is still very tight more than 190k jobs were created last month and usdjpy s strength reflects the market s hope that job growth will exceed 200k in april retail sales are scheduled for release and with gas prices on the rise and job growth rebounding spending should recover in march after falling in february this report will not be released until thursday but when it comes out it should be positive for usdjpy the big question now is whether the trend has completely shifted for usdjpy making 114 more likely to be hit before 110 we are sceptical of the rally because us growth is slowing not accelerating and central bankers are worried last week vice chair clarida said the labour market is healthy and the economy is in a good place but fed president bullard thinks the march hike marked the end of policy normalization and favours removing the word patient from the policy statement because it suggests a tightening bias fed fund futures are pricing in a 48 chance of a rate cut in january so easing is certainty on their minds fundamentally usdjpy should see 110 before 114 but technically usdjpy hit a 7 week high and the positive momentum is strong the 200 week sma is at 112 so if the pair breaks this year s high of 112 14

stories in the fx market last week was the european union s decision to extend britain s exit from the european union by 6 months to the 31st of october this was longer than the prime minister requested and shorter than the one year option some eu members preferred there will be a formal review in june and if the uk wanted to leave sooner it could as a result the uk will be participating in the european parliamentary elections unless it reaches an agreement internally to leave the eu before june 1st the good news is that this extension averted a no deal brexit last week that would have caused major disruptions in the financial markets it also provides six months of relief for uk businesses who were looking at the loaded end of a gun if the uk would have had to suddenly exit out of eu within days the bad news is that while the agreement brings much needed respite the market reaction was less than stellar as brexit fatigue and lack of clear outcomes have clearly taken their toll on traders the eu refuses to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and the fear is that prime minister may still won t receive the support she needs to pass the current withdrawal agreement in 6 months time after all is said and done uk still faces the same three choices a hard brexit under wto rules a possible 2nd referendum that could overturn article 50 or some sort of a customs union that would leave the issue of the irish border unresolved cable held steady under the 1 3100 figure but showed little sign of life finally the six month delay could prove to be positive for the uk economy as it may provide a boost in spending from a more confident uk consumer regardless of pick up in data the boe is likely to remain stationary erring on the side of caution as the risks of hard brexit remain and this should keep a cap on cable unless some genuine political breakthrough is achieved in the near term this 6 month relief allows investors to turn their focus back to data the latest economic reports were mixed with manufacturing activity slowing and service sector activity accelerating this week s inflation employment and retail sales reports will provide a better look at how much of a

german trade surplus growing and industrial production falling less but these reports are not enough to be optimistic about the euro trade tensions between the european union and the us are at a boiling point with president trump threatening 11b in tariffs over airbus subsidies in response the eu is preparing its own list of retaliatory tariffs worth over 22b the world trade organization hasn t officially recommended a penalty for the eu but if they do or the us pushes ahead with the tariffs it will be very damaging to the region s economy and the euro this is a risk that the central bank is fully aware of so much that ecb president mario draghi expressed concerns about the slowdown in the economy and teased investors about the possibility of more stimulus during his post ecb meeting presser he said tltro 3 was their first defence to slowing growth and if the weakness deepens they have plenty of instruments at their disposal in june they ll also decide if negative interest rates need mitigating but for now draghi made it clear that there are many things keeping them up at night from tariffs to brexit protectionism low inflation and the possibility of a recession in italy so not only do they feel that rate hikes are unnecessary this year but they could delay them further if needed in june they ll announce the details of tltro and the program could be more extensive if the slowdown deepens the german zew survey and eurozone pmis are scheduled for release this week and if the data softens reinforcing the central bank s concerns eurusd will resume its slide ultimately we expect the pair to test 1 10
the central bank of egypt cbe said that emerging markets ems have slightly witnessed the recovery of capital inflows in january after a long period of absence since february 2018 in its quarterly report on monetary policy the cbe said that the capital flows in the coming period will be linked to three main factors the tightening global financial conditions the economic activity forecast and prospects for more tension in international commercial policies it is expected for egypt s gdp to continue recovering supported by ongoing structural reform despite the possible impacts of such procedures to control the state s general finances the cbe explained that the cut off date for the data included in this report is 10 january 2019 some of the presented data are preliminary or subject to revisions there has been new incoming data since the cut off date including but not limited to the release of the inflation statistics for january and february 2019 furthermore the cbe s monetary policy committee decided to cut the cbe s key policy rates by 100 basis points bps in its meeting held on 14 february and kept policy rates unchanged in its meeting held on 28 march initial conditions global economic as well as trade growth continued to slow down while international oil prices continued to decline and ems witnessed net capital inflows for the first time since january 2018 economic growth of egypt s external environment is estimated to have continued to soften for the second consecutive quarter during the fourth quarter q4 of 2018 registering 2 5 down from 2 7 in the previous quarter and from 3 2 in q4 of 2017 the highest pace since 2011 economic growth in advanced economies is estimated to continue its ease for the fourth consecutive quarter to register 1 5 in q4 of 2018 compared to 1 8 in q3 of 2018 as slower growth in the euro region the united kingdom and japan more than offset a stronger growth in the united states on the other hand economic growth in emerging economies continued to inch up registering 4 8 in q4 of 2018 maintaining continuous improvement between q4 of 2015 and q2 of 2018 higher growth in brazil and russia more than offset slower growth in india and china compared to the previous quarter the cbe noted that headline inflation of egypt s external environment declined slightly in q4 of 2018 for the first time since q1of 2018 registering 2 3 compared to 2 5 in q3 of 2018 inflation in several advanced economies declined to register 2 0 in q4 of 2018 down from 2 2 in q3 of 2018 meanwhile inflation in emerging economies dropped slightly to register 2 9 in q4 of 2018 after accelerating to 3 0 in q3 of 2018 the deceleration of the inflation rate in china brazil and india more than offset the acceleration of the inflation rate in russia compared to the previous quarter meanwhile annual growth of global trade continued to slow down for the fourth consecutive quarter in q3 of 2018 to register 3 6 compared to 3 8 in the previous quarter and down from a peak of 5 3 in q3 of 2017 brent crude oil prices continued to decline to register an average of 7 4 per barrel in december 2018 after peaking at 86 1 a barrel in mid october 2018 and before inching up slightly in january 2019 lower oil prices were mainly driven by a more favourable contribution from the supply side which led major producers to agree on implementing a production cut of 1 2m barrels per day starting january 2019 meanwhile a less favourable contribution from the demand side reflected concerns regarding global economic growth international food prices using domestic consumer price index cpi basket weights of core food items continued to decline on annual terms in december 2018 for the sixth consecutive month however by the weakest magnitude since july 2018 at negative 2 4 the cbe attributed the decline to dairy products oils and red meat as production conditions improved the federal reserve fed raised its policy rate by 25 bps in december 2018 marking the fourth policy rate hike in 2018 and bringing the cumulative changes during 2018 to 1 0 percentage point this comes after raising policy rates by 1 25 percentage points during five meetings between december 2015 and december 2017 the bank of england kept its policy rates unchanged in november 2018 after raising it by 25 bps in august 2018 for the second time since november 2017 the european central bank ecb also kept its policy stance unchanged the three central banks made no changes to their asset purchase programmes since the previous monetary policy report the fed maintained its balance sheet unwinding plan which started in october 2017 slowing down the amount of government debt it reinvests meanwhile the ecb maintained its plan for phasing out its asset purchase programme halving monthly purchases since january 2018 to 15bn until the end of december 2018 capital flight from ems which started in february 2018 reversed slightly in january 2019 the direction of net capital flows into ems remains subject to the pace of tightening global financial conditions the growth outlook as well as the prospects of further escalation of trade tensions improvement of the current account continued to slowdown the cbe explained that after improving for seven consecutive quarters the current account deficit stabilised in q3 of 2018 compared to q3 of the previous year a less favourable contribution from the hydrocarbon trade deficit remittances and net income payments have more than offset the more favourable contribution from net services receipts and the non hydrocarbon trade deficit nevertheless the negative net exports of goods and services continued to narrow in q3 of 2018 on annual terms for the seventh consecutive quarter this was due to a more favourable contribution from exports of goods and services which more than offset the less favourable contribution from imports however the pace of annual improvement in net exports of goods and services continued to slowdown for the fourth consecutive quarter the hydrocarbon trade deficit continued to improve on annual terms in q3 of 2018 for the third consecutive quarter however at a slower pace compared to the previous quarter the improvement was mainly driven by higher exports which more than offset the increase in imports the non hydrocarbon trade deficit continued to widen on annual terms in q3 of 2018 for the fourth consecutive quarter however at a slower pace compared to the previous quarter it explained that this was mainly due to slower growth of imports which more than offset the annual decline in exports for the first time since q2 of 2017 the services surplus continued to increase in q3 of 2018 on annual terms and its contribution to the improvement of the current account deficit rose yet its pace of growth stabilised in q3 of 2018 a more favourable contribution from transportation excluding suez canal tolls net government services as well as net receipts from tourism have offset the less favourable contribution from suez canal tolls and net other services meanwhile the annual improvement of remittances declined in q3 of 2018 to its slowest pace since q3 of 2016 after witnessing an annual increase in q2 of 2018 for the first quarter since q2 of 2017 the growth of net foreign direct investment fdi inflows resumed its decline in q3 of 2018 ss the cbe attributed that to lower gross inflows and stronger gross outflows the decline in gross inflows was due to a less favourable contribution from newly issued capital and the oil and gas sector which more than offset the more favourable contribution from non residents purchases of real estate and net purchases of companies and assets by non residents portfolio flows excluding bonds continued to register a net outflow in q3 of 2018 for the second consecutive quarter amid unfavourable global conditions for ems this however was more than offset by net inflows from net foreign assets of commercial banks gross international reserves declined to 42 6bn in december 2018 from the historic peak of 44 5bn which was registered in the previous month annual real gdp growth softened slightly to 5 3 in q3 of 2018 while the unemployment rate inched up slightly to 10 0 after increasing for six consecutive quarters and stabilising in q2 of 2018 at 5 4 real gdp growth softened slightly to 5 3 the decline in the contribution of investments to the gdp has more than offset the improvement in that of net exports and by a lesser extent consumption meanwhile the unemployment rate inched up slightly to 10 0 in q3 of 2018 after declining for seven consecutive quarters the drop in the contribution of investment was mainly driven by the public sector while investments by the private sector contributed positively the improvement in the contribution of net exports was mainly driven by the decrease in real imports as growth of real exports continued to weaken since q4 of 2017 at the sectorial level the cbe added growth softened mainly due to the construction and the non petroleum manufacturing sectors in addition to small weaknesses in other sectors this has more than offset the improvement in tourism communication and natural gas extractions available leading indicators for the non hydrocarbon sector mostly point to weakening activity in q4 of 2018 the purchasing managers index pmi weakened compared to its average level in q3 of 2018 industrial production contracted on annual terms in october and november 2018 compared to an average expansion in q3 of 2018 suez canal net tonnage grew on annual terms at a slower pace in q4 of 2018 compared to q3 of 2018 on the other hand total car sales grew on average at a faster pace in october and november compared to the average pace registered in q3 of 2018 meanwhile natural gas production increased on annual terms at faster pace during october 2018 compared to the average pace in q3 of 2018 broad money growth continued to decline supported by fiscal consolidation following the fading of the exchange rate revaluation effect in q4 of 2017 annual m2 growth continued to decline to average 14 2 in q4 of 2018 supported by fiscal consolidation according to the cbe in q4 of 2018 the contribution of foreign non bank and external financing continued to decline in line with the reversal of net portfolio inflows due to global factors as well as the absence of eurobond issuances together they have more than offset the increase in domestic bank financing in addition to the decline in m2 growth inflationary pressures were further dampened by the drop of broad money velocity in q3 of 2018 after having increased between q3 of 2017 and q2 of 2018 albeit by a weaker momentum since q1 of 2018 meanwhile following its decline between q2 of 2017 and q1 of 2018 the contribution of claims on the private sector to m2 growth continued to increase in q4 of 2018 for the third consecutive quarter supported by initiatives at preferential interest rates similarly inflation adjusted letters of credit l c claims on the private sector began to witness annual increases since q1 of 2018 after recording annual contractions in 2017 the recovery was especially evident for claims on the private business sector while claims on the household sector recovered by a relatively weaker magnitude furthermore the negative contribution of net foreign assets that are not related to fiscal deficit financing continued to ease since the fading of the exchange rate revaluation effect on the other hand the contribution of net claims on public economic authorities declined slightly and claims on public sector companies roughly stabilised in q4 of 2018 within the components of m2 the currency in circulation cic as a percent of l c deposits in m2 declined slightly in q4 of 2018 for the second consecutive quarter recording a ratio below its long term historical average suggesting lessening currency holding behaviour furthermore despite the slight increase in the annual growth of foreign currency f c deposits in us dollar in q4 of 2018 the composition of private sector deposits continued to be increasingly leaning towards l c leading the dollarization ratio of f c deposits to total deposits in m2 to continue falling moreover the structure of household deposits in l c continued to be dominated by deposits more than three years since may 2018 following one and a half years of dominance by deposits less than three years amid the introduction of one and a half year saving certificates at a higher rate compared to longer term saving certificate rates the reversal of the structure of household deposits is consistent with redemptions of these certificates since may 2018 given their cancellation by public banks in late april 2018 annual growth of the monetary base m0 adjusted by total excess liquidity continued to decline in q4 of 2018 for the fifth consecutive quarter due to the cbe balance sheet operations which lowered excess liquidity growth the money multiplier measured as the ratio between local currency components of broad money and m0 as defined above remained broadly stable for the fifth consecutive quarter in q4 of 2018 following its decline between q3 of 2016 and q3 of 2017 real monetary conditions remained tight real monetary conditions remained tight backed by receding inflationary pressures as well as previous policy rate increases notwithstanding the cumulative 200 bps policy rate cuts in the beginning of 2018 excess liquidity declined in december 2018 for the first time since december 2017 to record an average of egp 717 3bn 13 5 of the gdp during the maintenance period ending in 31 december 2018 however the absorption of excess liquidity over the short term via the seven day deposit auction and overnight deposit facility remained relatively stable recording egp 63 6bn 1 3 of the gdp and 8 9 of excess liquidity since mid february 2018 the effective maturity of liquidity withdrawing operations greater than seven days continued to range between 38 and 69 days since april 2018 compared to 21 days on average between october 2017 and march 2018 thus interbank activity and the interbank yield curve remained relatively stable since april 2018 with interbank rates continuing below the policy rate by around 30 bps yields for l c government securities stayed stable at 15 8 net of tax since october 2018 after continuously rising between may and september 2018 this compares to 13 7 in april 2018 and 14 6 on average in q4 of 2017 before the policy rate cuts by the cbe the impact of rising risk aversion toward demand for em assets has more than offset the impact of the cumulative 200 bps policy rate cuts in february and march 2018 notwithstanding the recovery of demand for l c government securities in january 2019 the weighted average cost of finance remained relatively stable during the first two issuances due to a higher acceptance to required ratio meanwhile egyptian eurobond yields declined somewhat in january 2019 in line with the improvement in the risk premium for ems after it has been increasing during most of 2018 moreover egypt s cds spreads remained relatively low compared to most peers with similar sovereign credit rating furthermore egypt s outlook was raised to positive in august 2018 by moody s while s p upgraded egypt s credit rating in may 2018 in the banking sector rates for new deposits remained relatively stable to record 12 8 on average since april 2018 after declining in response to the cumulative 200 bps cut in february and march 2018 concurrently rates for new loans inched up slightly to 17 3 on average during october and november 2018 after receding to 17 0 in q3 of 2018 the pricing of new deposits declined by 1 3x compared to the cumulative 200 bps policy rate cut mainly driven by strong drops of deposit rates in public sector banks while the pricing of new loans decreased by 0 9x in equity markets real prices continued to be affected by the negative sentiment on ems nevertheless the egx 30 usd index continued to outperform the msci ems index since march 2018 despite its drop since june 2018 at the same time real unit prices remained relatively stable in q4 of 2018 after declining in select districts of cairo s residential real estate sector during q3 of 2018 for the first time since q4 of 2016 the demand continued to shift from the secondary market toward the primary market given more flexible payment plans offered by numerous developers headline inflation target for q4 of 2018 has been achieved annual core inflation continued to record single digits for sixth consecutive month annual headline inflation declined to 12 0 in december 2018 from 15 7 in november 2018 thereby leading average inflation during q4 of 2018 to record 15 1 as a result the inflation target of 13 3 percentage points for q4 of 2018 which was announced in may 2017 has been achieved the deviation from the target mid point was due to supply side factors that are outside the scope of monetary policy annual headline inflation has been affected by fiscal consolidation measures which were impacted by a higher than expected increase of international oil prices furthermore headline inflation was affected by temporary supply shocks in select fresh vegetables in september and october 2018 these factors led inflation to rise to 17 7 in october 2018 from the 25 month low of 11 4 in may 2018 the decline of annual inflation in november and december 2018 reflected the reversal of the temporary supply shocks in select fresh vegetables as well as the containment of underlying inflationary pressures in the meantime annual core inflation continued to register single digits for the sixth consecutive month averaging 8 5 between july and december 2018 the lowest rate in over two years this combined with the decline of annual headline inflation in november and december 2018 led the spread between annual headline and core inflation to narrow significantly after peaking in october 2018 monthly headline inflation was mainly driven by food inflation since august 2018 while non food inflation has been contained reflecting only expected seasonal increase in clothing prices in november 2018 inflation of fresh vegetables was the main contributor to food inflation it was elevated between june and october 2018 due to seasonal effects which were heightened by the indirect effects of the fiscal consolidation measures as well as transitory supply shocks related to potatoes and tomatoes which reversed in november and by a larger extent in december 2018 prices of tomatoes declined for the second consecutive month in december 2018 after recording price increases for four consecutive months also prices of potatoes declined after recording price increases for nine consecutive months simultaneously prices of core food items were largely stable except for poultry and eggs which experienced volatility since july 2018 as well as rice which increased in december 2018 for the third consecutive month the largely stable core food inflation witnessed domestically since august 2018 led to divergence between domestic and international core food price developments international core food inflation recorded its first positive monthly rate in december 2018 after consistently recording negative monthly rates since june 2018 driven mainly by prices of poultry red meat and dairy products this comes after domestic and international core food price developments have been largely consistent in the first half of the year except in june 2018 due to domestic fiscal consolidation measures outlook the cbe stated that policy rates and the inflation outlook remain consistent with achieving the targeted disinflation path this includes achieving the 9 3 percentage points inflation target for q4 of 2020 which was announced in december 2018 down from the 13 3 percentage points inflation target for q4 of 2018 announced in may 2017 which has been successfully achieved declared the cbe real gdp growth is expected to continue recovering benefiting from continued structural reforms despite being affected by potential fiscal consolidation measures it added the cbe explained that the primary fiscal balance is targeted to record a surplus of 2 0 of the gdp in 2018 19 compared to an estimated surplus of 0 1 of the gdp in 2017 18 and a deficit of 1 8 of the gdp in 2016 17 and is targeted to maintain this surplus thereafter meanwhile the overall fiscal deficit is targeted to decline to 8 4 and 7 2 of the gdp in 2018 19 and 2019 20 respectively compared to an expected 9 8 in 2017 18 and 10 9 in 2016 17 and is targeted to continue declining subsequently the outlook for brent crude oil prices incorporated in the domestic inflation outlook remained broadly unchanged following its downward revision yet spot prices remained subject to volatility due to potential supply side factors cost recovery for most fuel products is expected to be reached by mid 2019 and automatic fuel price indexation is expected to be implemented meanwhile international food price forecasts relevant to egypt s consumption basket are expected to be stable during 2019 before increasing in 2020 in addition to international commodity price developments risks surrounding the inflation outlook from the global economy continue to include trade tensions economic growth developments as well as the pace of tightening financial conditions meanwhile domestic risks continue to include the timing and magnitude of potential fiscal consolidation measures and the evolution of inflation expectations it concluded

1 the establishment and stages of economic and monetary union prior to the introduction of the euro the push for integration which started in western european countries after world war ii did not originally involve economic and monetary policy the primary objective at that time was to rebuild the economy after the war and to that end to lift trade barriers and expand markets stronger integration in the 1980s the maastricht treaty the idea of more intensive monetary integration was tabled in the late 1980s after the adoption of the single european act 1987 which set a course towards full integration of the single internal market in this light a single currency seemed to be one of the fundamental attributes of the single internal market the main political steps towards the future monetary union included the meeting of the european council in hannover in 1988 the delors report of 1989 and the maastricht meeting of the european council in december 1991 which on the basis of the delors report approved the plan for creating the economic and monetary union the legal foundations of the economic and monetary union were laid down in a set of agreements signed in february 1992 in maastricht commonly referred to as the maastricht treaty these documents came into force on 1 november 1993 under the treaty the changeover to the single currency was to take place in three stages two preparatory stages and a third and final stage of euro adoption convergence criteria to check whether the conditions had been created for moving to stage three of economic and monetary union emu involving the actual introduction of the single currency the treaty laid down convergence criteria these criteria were defined on the basis of theoretical considerations about the conditions needed to ensure sustainability of a single currency in a group of countries they include in particular requirements for low inflation and long term stability of mutual exchange rates with respect to balance of payments equilibrium the other criteria focus on ensuring public finance sustainability by setting a maximum ratio for the public budget deficit as a percentage of gdp and a maximum ratio for the absolute volume of public debt as a percentage of gdp at market prices a criterion leading to convergence of the interest burden of long term public borrowing was also defined the relatively detailed fiscal criteria stemmed from the fact that although the political negotiations on the conditions of operation of the new currency had resulted in support for the idea of a single currency and a single monetary policy no corresponding measures had been taken in the economic and fiscal policy area where coordination became the main method of cooperation the treaty provides for a derogation regime a temporary exemption allowing later entry into stage three for countries that have not yet satisfied the convergence criteria the changeover scenario the scenario for the changeover to the single currency which was given the name the euro was defined at the madrid meeting of the european council in december 1995 in line with the treaty timetable 1 january 1999 was set as the start date of stage three of emu stability and growth pact at the time the maastricht treaty which among other things stipulated an excessive deficit procedure entered into force most eu countries were not compliant with the two criteria limiting excessive deficits there were also doubts about whether the public finance deficit requirements were merely an eligibility criterion for euro adoption or whether they would also have to be met in the future on the basis of this debate the european council adopted a resolution on the stability and growth pact sgp at its meeting in amsterdam in june 1997 confirming the general validity of the deficit requirements after euro adoption and declaring the validity of the procedures and measures laid down in the treaty the changeover to the euro as expected an extraordinary eu summit held in early may 1998 approved the membership of 11 countries in the euro area commonly called the eurozone although a more tolerant interpretation of the treaty was applied in the case of compliance with the fiscal criteria in some countries greece joined the euro area on 1 january 2001 although it turned out later that some of the statistical documents it had submitted especially in the public finance area had been intentionally distorted and had not reflected the actual situation of the greek economy the legal acts completing the changeover to the euro were passed in 1997 1998 the non cash changeover at the start of 1999 proceeded smoothly during the changeover weekend government finances were converted to the euro and most government securities were redenominated in the euro commercial banks were also ready to provide services in the new currency the national legislation allowing the euro area countries to introduce the euro as their national currency took effect on 1 january 1999 the national currencies which continued to exist for another three years technically became subdivisions of the euro non decimal denominations the period 1999 2001 saw preparations for the cash changeover the situation at that time was made easier by the fact that the necessary institutions and mechanisms in particular the european central bank which created the monetary policy of the euro area and coordinated the preparations for issuing euro banknotes and coins had already been established the situation was also simplified by dual display of prices during the transition period as this prepared the public for the new prices of goods after euro adoption for these reasons it was possible to shorten the originally planned changeover period from six to two months current composition of the euro area the twelve countries that adopted the cash euro in 2002 were joined by slovenia in 2007 malta and cyprus in 2008 slovakia in 2009 estonia in 2011 and latvija in 2014 lithuania in 2015 and croatia in 2023 these countries introduced the euro under the big bang scenario i e the euro started to be used for both cash and non cash payments on the changeover date with no non cash transition period this took the number of euro area countries to 20 2 the economic crisis and the search for new ways forward the first ten years of the euro can be described as a period of relative calm despite gradually growing imbalances between individual countries this calm was aided chiefly by the following factors the smooth start of the new currency its timing a period of globally low inflation the relatively smooth running of the single monetary policy especially in the initial period link to the ecb website falling long term interest rates in most member countries gradual appreciation of the euro against the dollar and rising use of the euro as an international trading and reserve currency in the same period however the member countries showed increasing structural imbalances arising mainly from their different levels of competitiveness these imbalances were manifested among other things in different inflation rates and growing balance of payments deficits surpluses one disappointment was that the expectations of higher economic growth and labour productivity failed to materialise a fact confirmed in the european commission 2008 evaluation report successes and challenges after ten years of economic and monetary union pdf link to the european commission website the public in the euro area countries felt that prices especially of services had gone up even though the actual act of euro adoption and the price conversion process were meant to have been price neutral the financial and economic crisis and its implications for the euro area the outbreak of the financial and economic crisis was a turning point in the development of emu in the second half of 2008 the crisis manifested itself in an increased number of bankruptcies most of them outside the eu the united states iceland but with direct impacts on the assets of most western european banks the banking sector crisis spilled over to other sectors this necessitated a massive increase in state subsidies and interventions resulting in the fiscal maastricht criteria being exceeded far beyond the levels stipulated in the treaty at the same time the imbalances which had long been accumulating were revealed in full at the start of 2010 therefore we can say that the crisis entered a new phase a public debt crisis see below this crisis was most acute on the southern periphery of the eu and also in ireland in response decisions were taken to immediately stabilise the situation in these countries see the section european financial stabilisation mechanism and measures were adopted to implement a long term reform of economic governance of the eu and to enhance coordination of the member states economic policies remedial measures at the march 2010 meeting of the european council a discussion took place about the need for longer term measures to correct the fiscal situation and imbalances in the euro area the european council decided to establish a task force on economic governance headed by the president of the european council herman van rompuy in october 2010 the task force submitted a final report containing the following recommendations greater fiscal discipline by tightening the stability and growth pact and applying it more consistently stronger fiscal rules and frameworks better quality statistical data a new system of surveillance of macroeconomic imbalances including a sanction mechanism deeper coordination of economic policies by implementing the european semester a permanent stability mechanism for euro area countries in the medium term stronger or new institutions to provide independent macroeconomic and fiscal analysis at both eu ec and national level the european semester was approved by the european council in june 2010 the semester is a cycle of economic policy coordination that involves aligning the dates of submission of stability convergence programmes and national reform programmes by the member states as from 2011 these programmes will be submitted by the end of april of the current year the european semester should result in better coordination of the economic policies of eu countries as it will be possible to incorporate council recommendations into draft national budgets and their medium term outlooks in the current year the tightening of the sgp the introduction of surveillance of macroeconomic imbalances and the setting of minimum requirements for national fiscal frameworks were the subject of six legislative proposals issued by the european commission in september 2010 in addition to the above measures aimed at enhancing budget policy responsibility two programme documents focusing on economic policy coordination were recently adopted the europe 2020 strategy and the euro plus pact the europe 2020 strategy is the basic development strategy for the eu as a whole until 2020 it was approved by the european council in june 2010 and contains five headline quantified objectives and ten integrated guidelines based on the national reform programmes the european commission will in 2011 prepare a common strategic framework which is designed convert the objectives of the europe 2020 strategy into investment priorities of future eu cohesion policy after 2013 it should bring together the cohesion fund the european regional development fund the european social fund the european agricultural fund for rural development and the european maritime and fisheries fund the euro plus pact the original informal french german proposal to establish a competitiveness pact was replaced by a joint proposal of the president of the european council and the president of the european commission which was subsequently modified into the final form of a pact for the euro agreed by top euro area representatives at a summit on 11 march 2011 the document was approved at the european council meeting on 24 25 march 2011 as the euro plus pact link to the council of the european union website the pact is consistent with existing economic instruments or proposals such as the europe 2020 strategy the european semester the stability and growth pact and the new macroeconomic surveillance framework it develops them by setting more ambitious political objectives at the highest political level in several key areas the proposal pursues four goals to foster competitiveness to foster employment to contribute to the sustainability of public finances to reinforce the financial stability of eu member states the countries will voluntarily adopt specific commitments and at their discretion set their own choice of actions to achieve them always for a timeframe of 12 months if a member state can show that action is not needed in one or the other areas it will not include it no concrete figures have been set yet for the indicators of achievement of the basic goals the czech government s position on the pact s proposals was broadly positive but it decided that the czech republic would not sign up for the time being mainly because the czech republic had not been invited to participate in the preparation of the pact and some of its consequences for example in the tax area were not yet clear the uk sweden and hungary also opted out of the pact however it is possible to join at a later date 3 rescue mechanisms esm at the start of 2010 the financial and economic crisis in the eu entered a new phase a public debt crisis in some countries owing to adverse developments in greece steps had to be taken to safeguard financial stability in the euro area and to create a framework for assisting those eu countries whose debt problems might prevent them from obtaining further financing in the market in may 2010 greece was provided with a loan of 110 billion 80 billion in bilateral loans from the euro area members and 30 billion from the imf these steps did not definitively end the greek problem as the debt crisis resurfaced in mid 2011 in the meantime serious problems also emerged in other countries which owing mainly to their difficult public finance situation gradually became the focus of financial market attention euro area rescue mechanisms in may 2010 ecofin approved a rescue mechanism totalling 750 billion comprising 440 billion from the european financial stability facility efsf and 60 billion from the european financial stabilisation mechanism efsm supplemented by an expected imf contribution of up to 50 of the eu contribution on an individual basis this rescue mechanism was applied for the first time in november 2010 when ireland ran into serious debt problems after bailing out its banks total amount of the rescue package 85 billion in may 2011 financial assistance totalling 78 billion was granted to portugal in july 2011 greece was granted further financial assistance amounting to 109 billion including contributions from the private sector in addition to efsf and imf funds the czech republic is not a euro area member and so was not obliged to contribute in any way to the efsf by contrast loans from the efsm which is a european commission facility that operates on a similar principle as the balance of payments facility intended for non euro area eu member states and applies to all eu member states are guaranteed from the eu budget to which the czech republic also contributes its share in the guarantees was czk 6 7 billion for the loan to ireland and czk 7 7 billion for the loan to portugal as the aforementioned assistance framework was in place only until 2013 discussions started in 2010 about creating a permanent facility to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area the december 2010 meeting of the european council agreed on the creation of a permanent european stability mechanism esm to replace the temporary efsf and efsm facilities in 2013 see below the establishment of this mechanism was enabled by an addendum to article 136 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union the esm was eventually launched earlier than planned on 15 october 2012 the wording of this addendum and the general provisions on the esm were approved at the european council meeting on 24 25 march 2011 see the conclusions of the european council 24 25 march annex ii term sheet on the esm pdf link to an external website characteristics of the esm the esm was established by a treaty between the euro area member states as a new international financial institution to be activated if indispensable to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole the esm has capital of 700 billion of this amount 80 billion was deposited by the euro area members in cash and 620 billion will take the form of callable capital however the lending capacity of the esm will be only 500 billion as 200 billion will be necessary to secure the highest aaa aaa rating financial assistance is provided on the basis of strict policy conditionality under a macroeconomic adjustment programme and rigorous analysis of debt sustainability which are conducted by the european commission together with the imf and in liaison with the ecb esm assistance has already been drawn by spain 40 billion out of a total of 100 billion this programme has now been concluded and cyprus 9 billion from the esm pledged 4 6 billion drawn so far in addition the possibility of direct recapitalisation of banks established in the euro area using the esm was approved in 2014 the czech republic and the esm the czech republic is not obliged to participate in the esm nor has it been invited to do so non euro area countries can however contribute to the loans provided by the esm on an ad hoc basis as regards the impact of any enlargement of the euro area on the esm euro adoption is not conditional on esm participation access to the esm is a consequence of joining the euro area it is assumed that a member state will become a member of the esm with full rights and obligations on adopting the euro turning to the esm contribution key the standard key was based on the paid in capital key of the ecb new euro area countries i e potentially also the czech republic if it joins the euro area will be subject to a potentially more advantageous regime that will take into account whether the country has a gdp per capita of less than 75 of the eu average for a temporary period of 12 years after establishment of the esm entry into the euro area private sector involvement is envisaged in the form of encouraging private investors to maintain their exposures when esm funds are being used to resolve a crisis 4 the czech republic in the emu on joining the eu on 1 may 2004 the czech republic became an emu member with a derogation as regards the introduction of the euro see the act concerning the conditions of accession of the czech republic and nine other countries and the revisions to the treaties on which the european union is founded pdf link to the eur lex access to european union law website the euro should be introduced after the czech republic fulfils the necessary conditions the maastricht criteria whether the necessary conditions for adopting the euro have been satisfied is analysed and assessed in accordance with article 140 of the treaty on the functioning of the european link to the eur lex access to european union law website union by the european commission link to the european commission website and the european central bank link to the ecb website in their convergence reports which are issued once every two years or at the request of a member state with a derogation the final decision on the fulfilment of the conditions is made at the eu council level assumption in the composition of the ministers of economy and finance ecofin unlike denmark and the uk the czech republic was not able to negotiate a permanent opt out clause its derogation is therefore only temporary each eu country with a derogation has its own euro adoption strategy this contrasts with the twelve original euro area countries which adopted the euro in a coordinated manner accession of the czech republic to the euro area the czech republic formulated its vision for euro adoption in 2003 when the czech government approved its euro area accession strategy pdf 130 kb eurostrategy the strategy set an indicative euro adoption date of 2009 2010 an authority for the coordination of legislative and technical measures for the adoption of the euro the national coordination group was established in 2005 link to the zavedení eura v české republice website in 2006 the government approved a single step changeover scenario and in 2007 a national changeover plan pdf link to the zavedení eura v české republice website the date of euro adoption in the czech republic was meant to have been specified on the basis of regular assessments of the fulfilment of the maastricht convergence criteria and the degree of economic alignment of the czech republic with the euro area which have been prepared by the czech national bank and the ministry of finance since 2005 this assessment results in a recommendation to the czech government on whether the czech republic should or should not join erm ii in the coming year to fulfil the maastricht criteria it is necessary to participate in erm ii for at least two years it is therefore necessary to enter it at least three years ahead of the actual changeover date two years in the system one year needed for evaluation and technical preparation the czech government made no decision on erm ii entry in the period during which the original version of the eurostrategy was valid the main reasons at the time were public finances which were not compliant with the relevant maastricht criterion and insufficient alignment of the czech economy with the euro area the original indicative deadline for euro adoption 2009 2010 was therefore not met the updated and still valid eurostrategy of 2007 no longer contains any indicative target date the degree of economic alignment of the czech republic with the euro area and the fulfilment of the maastricht criteria continue to be assessed on a regular basis the czech republic currently does not fulfil the maastricht criteria required for euro adoption therefore the government of the czech republic has at the end of 2022 approved recommendation by the ministry of finance and the czech national bank currently not to set a date of accession of the czech republic into the euro area and the erm ii exchange rate mechanism

and respond to future stress events â recent performance and outlook â growth in 2018 was backed by buoyant tourism and construction activity real gdp is estimated to have grown by 2 3 percent in 2018 and growth is projected to steady at 2 1 percent in 2019 underpinned by continued growth in the tourism sector despite positive jobs growth however the unemployment rate remains high and is projected to decline only gradually inflation increased to an average of 2 2 percent in 2018 but is projected to fall to 1 6 percent in 2019 as the temporary effect of the vat rate increase fades the medium term outlook is positive but risk factors could weigh on growth economic growth is projected to converge to its potential of 1â½ percent in the medium term as tourism growth normalizes a significant

point to weaker than expected revenue performance partly due to grace periods granted for the implementation of revenue measures and legal disputes the fiscal deficit is therefore projected to narrow

the dollar s stability is key to the health of global currency markets among external geopolitical factors the erratic domestic policy decisions of president trump also threaten its solidity after a turbulent end to 2018 the new year has gotten off to an equally volatile start a flash crash greeted investors in the first two days of trading but since then some of the pessimism surrounding the outlook for world growth has lessened while 2018 was all about the us dollar the greenback got off to a softer start in 2019 as expectations of further rate hikes by the federal reserve faded but as predictions of a dollar downtrend start to gather there is little on the horizon that bodes well for other currencies a slowing us economy could still outrun its peers albeit negligibly which would keep any sell off well contained political gridlock in washington and the constant threat of government shutdowns could haunt the us currency following a year of broad dollar strength due to widening interest rate differentials a booming us economy and investors seeking the reserve currency s safety amid global trade tensions the risks surrounding the greenback in 2019 appear to be subsiding the fed is now approaching or has arguably already reached terminal rates at a time when most other central banks are preparing to start their own tightening cycles hence the monetary policy divergence theme may have largely run its course and the dollar s carry appeal could gradually lessen separately although markets have turned a blind eye lately investor concerns about the twin fiscal and current account deficits could return especially if the economy slows more sharply than anticipated and the higher tariffs have no impact in narrowing the huge trade deficit with china political gridlock in washington and the constant threat of government shutdowns could also haunt the us currency however there are also upside risks any further deterioration in us china trade relations may in fact see the dollar attract fresh safe haven bids likewise if congress agrees on a massive infrastructure programme that has the potential to boost growth and inflation it would be a game changer risks to recovery despite starting 2018 on a strong note the euro s gains quickly evaporated and the currency closed the year much lower amid cautious forward guidance by the european central bank ecb regarding italian and brexit risks as well as global trade worries while things currently don t look good for the common currency better days may lie ahead the italian financial crisis seems to have subsided and more importantly the ecb is preparing to lift rates sometime after the summer markets still haven t priced in much tightening by the ecb this suggests the euro has lots of room to run higher if economic growth picks up some steam and allows it to take the next step especially since the fed will be near so called peak rates by then a potential euro comeback may also be amplified by an unwinding of heavy speculative net short positions the obvious risk is that growth doesn t recover leading the ecb to delay or even abandon its tightening plans a disorderly brexit could also derail any euro rebound meanwhile for the swiss franc the most important drivers will be the swiss national bank s snb policy stance and safe haven flows the snb seems unlikely to risk making a hawkish turn anytime soon swiss data continues to tread water and the bank will probably want to avoid tightening its policy before the ecb does for fear of a drastic franc appreciation hence aside from some major deterioration in risk sentiment that generates haven demand for the swiss currency in particular from a resurfacing of the italian budget row or a new political headache from another eurozone member the risks surrounding the euro franc currency pair may be positively skewed over the coming year as markets see little chance of snb normalisation prior to the ecb s action in the uk delivering brexit will be the government s top priority in 2019 and hence the primary driver for the pound on january 15 british mps overwhelmingly rejected prime minister theresa may s hard fought withdrawal agreement however markets are less fearful of a cliff edge brexit as there seems to be a majority in parliament that is determined to avoid a no deal scenario the question now is whether lawmakers would back a revised deal with the eu or whether a second referendum is becoming the only viable option at the time of world finance going to print things remain uncertain but a delay to the departure date is looking increasingly inevitable an eventual compromise or the remote possibility of the uk deciding to remain in the eu should a second referendum occur could send the pound surging higher as this would not only lift the brexit fog from the uk economy but it would also put the bank of england on course to raise interest rates however if the uk leaves without a deal it could send shockwaves through global financial markets and the pound could well crash back below the 1 20 level declining trend after a brief spell of above trend growth the japanese economy switched back into low gear in 2018 see fig 1 dissuading the bank of japan boj from scaling back its massive stimulus programme accordingly the defensive yen has been trading mainly as a function of global risk appetite paying little attention to domestic economic data although market chatter suggests the boj could start normalising as early as this year that prospect remains remote the economy contracted in q3 2018 underlying inflation is muted and the government plans to raise the sales tax in october 2019 the last time it increased this tax a recession ensued so the boj will probably avoid any bold moves ahead of it hence rate differentials between japan and other economies may stay wide or widen further which in isolation argues for a weaker yen over time for the currency to soar it may require an unexpected pick up in inflation or more realistically a sustained period of global risk aversion similarly the canadian cad australian aud and new zealand nzd dollars all had a difficult time in 2018 amid struggling commodity prices a resurgent us dollar and flaring trade tensions between the us and china given that these economies are heavily export orientated dwindling global trade volumes could impact them severely for the cad collapsing oil prices were crucial too the outlook for 2019 depends predominantly on whether the us china trade negotiations bear fruit or simply fall apart in early january optimism that the two trading giants were making progress in ironing out their differences over trade policy prompted an immediate rally in oil and commodity linked currencies this suggests the cad aud and nzd stand to gain significantly from any sino us trade breakthrough in terms of monetary policy no rate hike is expected by either the reserve bank of australia or the reserve bank of new zealand in fact market pricing implies a small probability for a rate cut by both central banks amid slowing growth and sluggish inflation odds for a rate increase by the bank of canada have also dissipated rapidly though not completely following the turmoil that jolted markets in december downward skew at this point in the year many of the headwinds and uncertainties that determined price action during 2018 have yet to be resolved as a result monetary policy normalisation outside the us which many traders saw as a sure bet at the start of 2018 is looking increasingly precarious in 2019 with growth and inflation in the eurozone and japan the world s second and fourth largest economic blocs dwindling again there s a real danger that interest rates may not return to positive territory before the next recession this raises questions about what additional policy tools would be available to central banks when the next downturn strikes which could well be in 2019 both economies are highly vulnerable to an escalation in the us trade fight while the eurozone faces additional risks from a no deal brexit and from populist european governments upsetting the eu political order the risks for the chinese economy are also tilted to the downside a profound slowdown in china is likely to hurt the global economy more than the us which would likely still outperform the rest of the world even if trade frictions were to intensify a bigger threat for the dollar than a fed rate pause and moderating growth could be political instability in the white house given president trump s continued if not worsening unpredictable and destabilising behaviour however with us treasury yields still at relatively high levels any sustained decline in the dollar is likely to be limited in a risk off environment without a rebound in growth in other parts of the world the dynamics that came into play in the currency markets in late 2018 could persist well into 2019

by john mauldin regular readers may have noticed me slowly losing confidence in the economy your impression is correct and there s a good reason for it as i will explain today the facts have changed so my conclusions are changing too i still think the economy is okay for now i still see recession odds rising considerably in 2020 maybe it will get pushed back another year or two but at some point this growth phase will end either in recession or an extended flat period even flatter than the last decade which says a lot and i still think we are headed toward a global credit crisis i ve dubbed the great reset what s evolved is my judgment on the coming slowdown s severity and duration i think the rest of the world will enter a period something like japan endured following 1990 and is still grappling with today it won t be the end of the world japan is still there but the little growth it s had was due mainly to exports that won t work when every major economy is in the same position describing this decline as japanification may be unfair to japan but it s the best paradigm we have the good news is it will spread slowly the bad news is it will end slowly too losing decades before i explain why we will follow japan i want to briefly explain how japan got to where it is it was a long slow process that like the proverbial frog in boiling water wasn t fully obvious in real time japan experienced rapid growth following world war ii as the us and others helped rebuild its economy that wasn t all out of generosity the country was geopolitically important as a western bulwark against russia and china we didn t want it to fall under the other side s influence this eventually led to a roaring expansion that culminated in the 1980s japanese asset bubble which popped in the early 1990s there followed what came to be called the lost decade it was really more than a decade as the early 2000s brought only mild recovery gdp shrank wages fell and asset prices dropped or went sideways at best the lost decade had monetary roots namely the 1985 plaza accord that drove the yen higher and inflated the asset bubble the bank of japan tried to pop the bubble with a series of rate hikes beginning in 1989 this chart shows the boj s benchmark rate source tradingeconomics com upon reaching 6 in 1992 the boj began cutting rates and eventually reached zero a few years later since then it has made two short lived tightening attempts shown in the red circles neither worked and that was it no more rate hikes period the boj has now kept its policy rate at or near zero for 20 years making conventional monetary policy essentially irrelevant the boj resorted to increasingly large qe like programs that also had little effect meanwhile the government tried assorted fiscal policies infrastructure projects deregulation tax cuts etc they had little effect too gdp growth has been stuck near zero plus or minus a couple of points so has inflation the only thing that really helped was driving down the yen s exchange rate which successive governments and central bank governors have done enthusiastically which i kind of understand when your only tool is a hammer you treat everything as a nail that said the boj s asset purchases certainly had an effect they more or less bought everything that isn t nailed down including stock etfs and other private assets japan is a prime example of the faux capitalism i described last week all this capital is going into businesses not because they have innovative profit generating ideas but simply because they exist that s how you get zombie companies the result at least so far has been neither boom nor depression japan has its problems but people aren t standing in soup lines the bigger issue is that the population is aging rapidly many say the present situation can t go on indefinitely but there s no exit in sight the bank of japan has bought every bond it can except those the government will create to fund future deficits which is why they are buying stocks not just in japan but in the us as well they are trying to put yen into the system in an effort to generate inflation it simply hasn t worked when you don t have a better answer the default is to do more of the same that s the case in japan europe and soon the us charles hugh smith described it pretty well recently the other dynamic of zombification japanification is past success shackles the power elites to a failed model the greater the past glory the stronger its hold on the national identity and the power elites and so the power elites do more of what s failed in increasingly extreme doses if lowering interest rates sparked secular growth then the power elites will lower interest rates to zero when that fails to move the needle they lower rates below zero i e negative interest rates when this too fails to move the needle they rig statistics to make it appear that all is well in the immortal words of mr junker when it becomes serious you have to lie and it s now serious all the time do more of what s failed in increasingly extreme doses is also a good description of federal reserve policy from 2008 through 2016 zero rates having had little effect the fed launched qe and continued it despite the limited success and harmful side effects the european central bank did the same in even larger amounts than the federal reserve also with little effect which brings us to the next point why europe and the us will follow japan too much too fast as noted in the introduction i change when the facts change and in the last few months they did the federal reserve spent 2017 and 2018 trying to exit from its various extraordinary stimulus policies it began raising short term interest rates and reversing the qe program i think it should have done both sooner and not at the same time but both needed to happen in hindsight it now appears the fed tried to do too much too fast which was my point when they started the process either raise rates slowly or reduce the balance sheet but not both at the same time reducing the balance sheet has an effect on effective rates just as actually raising rates does but not as obvious my friend samuel rines calculated that when you include the qe tapering this fed tightening cycle was the most aggressive since paul volcker s draconian rate hikes in the early 1980s they should have started sooner and tightened more gradually for whatever reason they didn t and so the complaints began wall street wasn t happy but more important president trump wasn t pleased with the rate hikes why it surprised him i don t know jerome powell s hawkish bent was no secret when trump made him fed chair whatever the reason the president has made his displeasure with fed policy clear but the real deal breaker may have been the late 2018 market tantrum lenders and borrowers alike grew increasingly and vocally distressed as the yield curve flattened and threatened to invert then this year it did invert at several points along the curve coincident with weakening economic data that was probably the last straw the fed hasn t exactly loosened but there s a good chance it will later this year meanwhile across the pond mario draghi had one foot out the door and until a short while ago had a tightening plan in place that plan is now out the door before draghi is even close to gone so on both sides of the atlantic plans to exit from extraordinarily loose money now look disturbingly like those two little circles in the boj rate chart when it tried to hike and found it could not worse we are also replicating japan s fiscal policy with rapidly growing deficit spending in fact this year we will be exceeding it the japanese deficit as a percentage of gdp is projected to be below 4 while the us is closer to 5 and given the ever widening unfunded liabilities gap the us deficit will grow even larger in the future turning japanese i think we re turning japanese i really think so with a musical nod to the vapors a 6 trillion 10 trillion federal reserve balance sheet let me give you the cliffs notes version of how i think the next decade will play out more or less kinda sorta we already see the major developed economies beginning to slow and likely enter a global recession before the end of the year that will drag the us into a recession soon after unless the federal reserve quickly loosens policy enough to prolong the current growth cycle other central banks will respond with lower rates and ever larger rounds of quantitative easing let s look again at a chart courtesy of my friend jim bianco that i showed three weeks ago showing roughly 20 trillion of cumulative central bank balance sheets as of today if i had told you back in 2006 this would happen by 2019 you would have first questioned my sanity and then said no way and even if it did happen you would expect the economic world would be coming to an end well it happened and the world is still here source jim bianco before 2008 no one expected zero rates in the us negative rates for 11 trillion worth of government bonds globally negative rates out of the ecb and the swiss national bank etc things like tarp qe and zirp were nowhere on the radar just months before they happened numerous times markets closed on friday only to open in a whole new world on monday in the next crisis central banks and governments in an effort to be seen to be doing something will again resort to heretofore unprecedented balance sheet expansions and it will have less effect than they want those reserves will simply pile up on the balance sheets of commercial banks which will put them right back into reserves at their respective central banks during the worldwide recession there will be few qualified borrowers but a great demand for liquidity as corporate debt goes from investment grade to junk seemingly en masse which will disqualify them from being bought by pensions insurance companies and many other purchasers normally looking for yield the inverted yield curve is a classic sign that the central bank in this case the federal reserve has tightened monetary conditions too much which is why trump wants the fed to lower rates now plus he doesn t want a recession in an election year and powell and the fed turned so dovish i will admit the fed s 4 trillion balance sheet expansion surprised me at the time fool me once shame on you we ve now seen the new playbook at a minimum they will keep the balance sheet at its present barely diminished size and eventually add a lot more when we go into recession i think 10 trillion is almost a sure thing by the mid 2020s by which point we will have been through our second recession why because we will see a new government at some point that raises taxes enough to actually send a still weak economy into another recession that s pure speculation on my part but is what i foresee what assets will the fed buy under current law that s pretty predictable treasury securities and a few other government backed issues like certain mortgage bonds that s all the law allows but laws can change and i think there is a real chance they will regardless of which party holds the white house and congress in a crisis people act in previously unthinkable ways think 2008 2009 they will think the unthinkable in the next crisis and try everything including the kitchen sink but it will just increase government debt and as lacy hunt has shown us from numerous sources in the academic literature and i ve tried to explain that debt will be a drag on future growth another reason to expect a 10 trillion federal reserve balance sheet is that us government debt will be north of 30 trillion on top of that in the next five years the credit markets have to fund 5 trillion of corporate debt rollovers plus new debt plus state and local debt it won t be coming from outside the us and there is only so much that banks and big pension funds and individuals can do unless the federal reserve steps in interest rates will soar and the crisis will become much worse it will have little choice but to step in and buy us government debt yes i know this is a self fulfilling prophecy and it has to end but the question is when we re already seeing serious analysts say it really doesn t have to end this from none other than goldman sachs daan struyven and david mericle economists at goldman sachs said the example of japan could prove instructive as the world s third largest economy had not suffered a debt crisis even though it arguably has the most public debt as a share of its gdp in the world japan s government debt to gdp ratio sits at 236 in 2017 more than double that of the us which stands at 108 according to the international monetary fund source marketwatch i could spend the entire letter giving you quotes like that from mainstream economists note you can quibble with the exact numbers but in any case the bank of japan holds at least 100 of japanese gdp in debt plus an enormous amount of japanese stocks not to mention global stocks the federal reserve holds roughly 35 give or take of us government debt can we even imagine the federal reserve at some point holding 20 trillion of us government debt i don t think the japanese imagined that 20 years ago i keep saying we have to think the unthinkable as we plan for our futures because i can guarantee you that future leaders will when there is a true crisis they whoever they may be will be looking for action and do nothing will not be an option maybe it should be but that is a metaphysical argument for another day they will do something quantitative easing is now on the table and i think will be almost a reflexive move during the next recession crisis so will we have japan like flat markets and low growth for years on end will we create a demographic crisis by limiting immigration public pensions and insurers are already struggling to meet obligations after years of low rates those betting on 7 returns and many are won t make anything close to that this will make government debt and state local pension fund obligations a massive problem that the federal reserve and the us government right now are not politically or legally capable of handling will we change the rules in the future tell me who s going to be in charge during that crisis and then let s ask the question but will it play out over a longer period of time than we might think now almost surely yet the world will not end and for those paying attention will be a better world stay tuned and stay

by mukwanason a hyuha i read in the new vision newspaper of monday january 21 2019 an article by andrew mwenda in which he attempted to analyse the current issue of whether or not uganda s public debt is sustainable mwenda s article was based on discussions in a tv talk show moderated by charles odongtho the article is basically a critique of the views of the talk show moderator and six panellists fortunately i did watch and follow the live talk show on tv from beginning to end the talk show followed a claim by the minister of finance planning and economic development matia kasaija that uganda s external debt is sustainable a view that was not supported by some ugandans for example panellists dr fred muhumuza norbert mao dp president salaamu musumba fdc vice president and nandala mafabi fdc secretary general did not hold the same view as kasaija in the talk show these four aired the view that uganda should seriously worry about her debt however panellists david bahati state minister for finance and ofwono opondo a government spokesperson were of the opposite opinion soon thereafter prof augustus nuwagaba in an interview published in the new vision newspaper of monday february 4 2019 did agree with minister kaisaija s claim although nuwagaba s interview is based on generalities and noticeably devoid of detailed empirical or researched evidence worth quoting or mentioning mwenda s views are laced here and there with half truths generalities superfluous political undertones irrelevancies and digressions and diversions from the main issue of discussion namely the sustainability or lack of it of uganda s public debt further as usual mwenda s critique unfortunately occasionally degenerates into verbal and vulgar attacks on the persons of some of the panellists instead of focussing purely on an intellectual analysis of the issues at hand in boxing this is known as hitting below the belt an act that normally leads to loss of marks by the offender by the way this unleashing of a barrage of verbal and vulgar attacks appears to be a common weapon of mwenda when dealing with opposing views besides in an intellectual debate or analysis mwenda s statement that even a third rate economist would tell you that uganda s average gdp growth performance is a miracle a statement displaying utter lack of respect for other analysts and bordering on arrogance and sheer bankruptcy of analytical rigour or demonstration of paucity of the basics of intellectual maturity leaves a lot to be desired if one wanted to match mwenda s crudeness one would chip in that a non third rate economist or analyst can never make such a derogatory statement in a serious intellectual discussion at the risk that i am consciously taking of attracting the same behaviour from mwenda in this paper i do shed intense light on a number of issues surrounding the subject of debt sustainability and the debt burden in uganda in so doing i discuss some of the half truths myths irrelevancies and digressions in mwenda s article and nuwagaba s interview i begin by offering some definitions and examination of the issue of the ability by a country to repay her debt the concept of the debt burden and foreign aid productivity and absorption vis a vis debt sustainability some definitions in 2017 a publisher based in germany published two graduate level textbooks i authored in the area of monetary economics this paper benefits a lot from chapters 2 and 5 of the second of the textbooks entitled international money finance growth and policy in an african setting a country incurs two types of debts namely the internal debt and the external debt the internal debt is the debt owed by all of us to some of us it is the sum of unpaid past and current government domestic borrowing this domestic borrowing is effected mainly through issuance of treasury bills government bonds treasury notes and other financial papers issued by government government revenue rg consists of net returns on government investment direct and indirect net tax collections revenue from fines rates and other non tax sources and grants or net transfers from the rest of the world this revenue is collected continuously throughout the year and the amount collected varies from month to month hence in a given month the revenue collected may fall short of equal to or exceed government expenditure eg during that month hence even if the government balances its budget over the year eg rg it has to borrow from time to time to meet various revenue shortfalls during certain parts of the year the internal debt arises if the government does not have adequate revenue to repay its debts during a year or if the government decides to live beyond its means the debt is a mortgage on future generations since it is these generations that will have to raise the revenue mainly through higher taxes to pay off the debt the main focus of this paper is the external debt which is the debt owed by us to the rest of the world it is government plus private borrowing from the rest of the world thus the external debt is a country s sum of the stock of past and current unpaid public and private loans and advances whereas the internal debt has a crucial impact on a country s efforts to attain internal balance the external debt basically impacts on the nature of the external balance of the country concerned the debt is a stock not a flow mwenda asserts that it is hard to nail down the actual debt since it is a moving figure this is not true since any stock can be ascertained at any point in time the debt problem arises in situations where the debtor borrower finds difficulties in repaying the debt that is paying back the amount borrowed plus interest and other charges as agreed between the lender and borrower in this case there might be problems of servicing the debt and problems of repayment of the entire debt at the end of the agreed period since repayment is usually in periodic instalments at agreed dates the problem of debt servicing arises if the borrower is unable to comply with the agreed schedules of repayment that is the instalments are not effected on time or at the agreed date or the borrower is unable to raise the required amount of the instalment due then debt servicing and debt repayments are serious problems in maskini poor countries including uganda is comparing of uganda with the rest of the world mandatory the talk show panellists discussed the issue of whether or not uganda s debt is sustainable that is should uganda be worried about her growing public debt the answer to this question revolves around uganda s ability to generate adequate funds or foreign exchange to repay the debt and not on east africa s or the rest of the world s ability to clear her public debt now assuming away debt repudiation or unwillingness to repay the debt and exogenous shocks that impact adversely on the productivity of borrowed funds ability to repay a debt including its servicing depends on how the borrowed funds are were used or invested to illustrate let the amount of borrowed funds total interest to be paid on the debt other charges commitment fee disbursement charges bank charges etc on the debt and total net income realised by investing this means that the borrower invested the in productive ventures and earned a net income of from the investments the debt problem occurs if and only if i d r c the bigger the difference between me and d r c the better for the borrower therefore the productivity of the borrowed funds is the crucial factor in stress if the debt problem is to be avoided this is true regardless of whether one is focussing on a personal or a country s total or internal or external debt note that even if borrowing is at zero interest rates i e r 0 as long as d consists of loans rather than grants and c is not zero the debt may not be sustainable that is the income i may still consistently fall short of d c therefore it is not entirely true as mwenda would like us to believe that if borrowing is at zero or highly concessionary interest rates the debt will be sustainable low interest rates only mean that the debt burden will be lessened by reducing the r in the above formula in my view dr muhumuza and other panellists did a good job in discussing this issue of uganda s debt sustainability even if i do not necessarily agree to some of their views further in answering this question it was not necessary to compare uganda s borrowing magnitude frequency or rate with those of east african or other countries as mwenda argues if other countries debts were are unsustainable or as unsustainable or as sustainable or more sustainable than uganda s would that make uganda s debt sustainable or would uganda be comfortable even if her debt were visibly unsustainable so comparison in answering the relevant question is optional rather than compulsory the panellists therefore had no obligation to make such superfluous comparisons even if uganda is not an island however if the question under discussion had been is uganda s performance with regard to the question of debt sustainability or borrowing better equal or worse than that of kenya tanzania or rwanda or those of other countries then comparisons would have been mandatory and relevant by using comparisons mwenda is therefore answering a significantly different question formulated by none other than himself it is therefore extremely unfair and wrong on his part to fault the panellists for not having answered his personal question this is one of the irrelevancies alluded to above is uganda s economy growing below potential is 6 92 optimum panellist muhumuza stated that uganda s economy has been growing below its potential which idea mwenda disputes with hardly any theoretical or empirical evidence in regard to this issue one has to examine inter alia the productivity absorption management and coordination of borrowed funds or foreign aid in general as well as debt sustainability uganda s external public and publicly guaranteed debt is as hon kasaija claims sustainable and at low risk of debt distress however at a review of the policy support instrument psi meeting in kampala in july 2017 the imf board of directors commented as follows directors emphasized the importance of strengthening fiscal policy implementation they welcomed the increase in revenue collection in fy16 17 but noted the large under execution of the externally financed investment budget which could undermine growth prospects directors regretted the government s recourse to central bank financing this year noting its inconsistency with the inflation targeting framework they called on the authorities to settle outstanding external arrears expeditiously while taking measures to prevent any recurrence emphasis added as a country borrows for one reason or another it must take into account at least two basic factors namely the expected productivity of the borrowed funds and the country s absorption capacity via a vis the implicit debt these factors are both based on the concerned country s management and coordination of its public debt including the external debt in addition the issues of under execution of debt financed projects untimely disbursement of funds embezzlement of borrowed funds and related leakages must be taken into account if not well managed and well coordinated foreign aid or the debt can inter alia lead to the emergence of the following factors 1 productivity rates that are less than optimal as well as suboptimal absorption rates 2 aid funds being embezzled by corrupt personnel in view of the high levels of corruption in many of these maskini countries including uganda 3 capital flights and unwarranted reverse flows via overpricing of imports and underpricing of exports according to shah 2010 whilst countries in africa receive us 162 billion in resources such as aid loans and foreign investment a whopping us 203 billion is taken out mostly by multinational corporations debt payments tax dodging and the costs imposed by climate change caused by the rest of the world in total the rest of the world receives over us 41 billion a year from african countries this is more than enough money to provide decent healthcare to all people in africa this stands the story about poverty on its head given this situation and the logic or philosophy africa is in the real sense the foreign aid donor while the rest of the world is actually the recipients of africa s aid this is food for thought anup shah 2010 see details in the appendix 4 low or minimal local content of debt financed projects plus high unit costs of the projects many skilled and unskilled workers in projects managed by chinese and some raw materials are sourced from donor countries and the unit cost of say road construction is very high in uganda compared to say ethiopia the resultant repatriations by foreigners enhance the reverse flow of dollars to the donor country 5 discouraging domestic production in favour of imports thereby constraining foreign exchange generation 6 importation of unnecessary commodities such as cosmetics hair dos etc using the scarce foreign exchange 7 overt and covert political strings and unfavourable conditionalities may be attached to the aid 8 borrowed funds being used to add to reserves rather than investing in productive ventures 9 borrowed funds being expended mostly on consumption rather than investment goods 10 aid may lead to adverse impacts on domestic cultures and values systems most of the above factors for sure apply to uganda hence there have been questions on the productivity of borrowed funds in uganda there is ample evidence that productivity of aid is suboptimal and there are serious issues of absorption the less than optimal aid absorption and productivity rates result from among other reasons poor management of loans untimely and sometimes inadequate release of counterpart funds by the government occasional delays in the release of aid by donors poor planning and coordination and related political and administrative shortfalls in the face of constraints imposed by the high corruption level in the country of course mwenda will state correctly that many other maskini countries at least in africa suffer from the same problems if so so what should uganda derive comfort in such a statement this means that with maximum absorption and productivity rates timely release of counterpart funds and donor aid sound planning and coordination no other administrative bottlenecks no embezzlement of funds and other overt and covert types of corruption any first second third or the rate economist statistician or intellectual analyst would see that uganda s economy would have grown at a higher rate for example 7 8 9 or higher than the 6 92 per annum muhumuza is therefore right on this issue obviously if the annual growth rate of 6 92 is a miracle definitely even mwenda would concede that a higher rate would even be a more fascinating miracle mwenda faults muhumuza for the latter s statement that uganda s growth rate is below potential one expected mwenda to state what rate he considers to be the potential or optimum is it the 6 92 can this rate of growth of the economy be shown argued or proved to be the optimum vis à vis the country s debt or high propensity to borrow and the implicit rate of return on investment unfortunately mwenda just rebukes muhumuza but does not offer any discussion of these questions instead he digresses into discussing what a miracle the 6 92 growth rate is how only a few countries have historically ever sustained for 30 years such a miracle rate how between now and 2025 uganda will be the second fastest growing economy in the world and other irrelevancies that may be interesting but are off the mark or offside and you know offside goals are always disallowed debt sustainability does a low borrowing debt gdp ratio imply sustainability it is important to note that the debt to gdp ratio of 50 is just an average just like a life expectancy figure of say 52 years for a country is an average the life expectancy of 52 years does not mean that everybody in that country lives for only 52 years some live for over 70 years like the writer and others for less similarly the debt gdp ratio of 50 is a safety measure for some countries and not for others for example the usa and other developed countries and maybe botswana and south africa are comfortable with ratios of 80 and above whereas many maskini countries safety rates must be far below the 50 ratio hence uganda s ratio is at 41 does not necessarily mean that uganda is safe one needs more and better empirical evidence the debt gdp ratio being below 50 is therefore most likely a necessary but not sufficient condition for debt sustainability further mwenda appears to believe that a zero or highly concessionary interest rate on borrowed funds implies debt sustainability this is not correct at best it is a half truth as stated earlier a zero or highly concessionary borrowing rate only implies that the debt burden will be less than if the rate had been higher like commercial rates as noted earlier debt sustainability crucially depends on the productivity and absorption of the borrowed funds in the formula given earlier sustainability depends on whether or not i d r c the higher the difference between the i and the d r c the better rate of return infrastructure vs industry or the superstructure mwenda asks a rhetorical question is the cost of borrowing prohibitive and is the debt therefore unsustainable he answers his rhetorical question by stating that most 99 of uganda s loans are at highly concessionary rates and of long maturity periods without a discussion of the sign of the difference between the i and the d r c he myopically concludes that this borrowing at highly concessionary rates accompanied with long maturity periods is what makes our foreign debt sustainable surely is it only the size of the r that matters besides the debt burden of a country inevitably imposes a number of constraints on that country s growth prospects including curtailing the degree of its participation in international trade the burden of principal and interest payment for instance drains the nation s resources and curtails the possible expenditure of resources on other productive ventures in the country this is even more constraining considering that the incomes from which the debts are to be serviced are meagre for the countries suffering most seriously from the burden of the debt are among the poorest of the poor this gives rise to at least three macroeconomic problems 1 the macroeconomics of earning foreign exchange export promotion can trade be used as an engine of growth 2 the macroeconomics of finding extra budget resources to service the debt on a sustainable basis and 3 the macroeconomics of adjusting to a constant reduction year in year out in spendable resources in order to reduce the debt burden on a sustainable basis and increase the debt servicing capacity there is a need for an increase in exports and a reduction in world interest rates among other things this raises basic macroeconomic issues relating to international trade and costs to the extent that the increasing protectionism of the developed countries prevents the entry of third world countries into markets in developed countries and in view of the rising real interest rates in these markets in the absence of concessions the debt burden of many developing countries is not likely to abate in the foreseeable future thus part of getting out of debt is related to events in the international sector impinging heavily on the actions of the developed countries vis à vis protectionism cost of doing business interest rates etc aid resource flows in real terms to the developing world and a commitment to achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs by 2030 both developed and developing countries need to take these issues into account in their trade and other economic activities are the hipcs public private partnerships and economic partnership agreements epas between acp countries and the european union likely to be the solution to the problem of debt or the indebtedness of the third world this is a highly moot issue uganda is needless to state negatively affected like other third world countries by the burden of the debt due to this pressure of the debt burden on the country the uganda government has tried to follow its debt management strategy the strategy requires any new borrowing to be on highly concessionary terms a minimum of about 80 of borrowing should be on the international development agency ida terms or better i e 40 year maturity 10 year grace period and 0 75 interest rate the remaining borrowing should also be on highly concessional terms 23 year maturity 6 year grace period and not more than 2 interest rate efforts to obtain relief from non paris club bilateral creditors on terms comparable to those of the paris club members are always ongoing the debt burden is an uncomfortable noose around uganda s neck a noose that is getting tighter and tighter as time goes on this is why the imf executive board remarked as follows directors stressed that safeguarding debt sustainability should be a priority in this regard they called for continued domestic revenue mobilization and sound project implementation especially to realize the envisaged growth dividend from infrastructure investment they advised the authorities to target the projected debt trajectory to provide a buffer relative to the charter of fiscal responsibility s debt ceiling in case of adverse shocks imf report 2017 p 3 other irrelevancies in mwenda s article mwenda poses another rhetorical question do our investments in transport and energy infrastructure have a good rate of return compared to investments in agribusiness and other types of industry as well as in services the answer is definitely no returns on investment in the infrastructure compared to investment in the secondary and tertiary sectors or superstructure are spread over a long period of time in the short and medium terms the returns are normally low however available evidence shows that investments in the infrastructure provide not only a necessary but a fundamental and sufficient condition for long term growth and development this means that in the short and medium runs the borrowed funds even without corruption and the shortcomings noted earlier are bound to generate less dollars than required thereby straining the debt servicing and debt repayment capacities or capabilities of the borrower country one expects that the situation may change for the better in the long run as a result of among other things multiplier and trickle down effects emanating from the fundamental and sufficient condition referred to above this is what mwenda should have stated and discussed in fair detail the last part of mwenda s article is interesting and contains some relevant discussions on deficiencies in policy and project coordination need to plan how the extra power will be used and so on but the part is full of additional irrelevancies the electricity indeed facilitates pupils and students in rural areas to read just like tirinyi road enables peasants to dry their cassava on the road edges the infrastructure may indeed adduce votes for politicians etc but do these activities generate the dollars needed to service the debt and finally amortise it concluding remarks in my opinion given evidence based objective intellectual analysis it is self evident that uganda definitely needs to worry a lot about her growing public debt the talk show panellists may not have been as analytical as was necessary but they were not of the point considering their varied potential audiences one of the ways to oppose their views is to come up with more believable robust and coherent empirical evidence showing that indeed uganda s debt is sustainable mwenda s article is coherent well sequenced spiced with political undertones full of diversions and irrelevancies and based on his usual arrogant stance but lacks objective intellectual analysis and focus with respect to the topic under discussion hence its value addition is minimal this is the considered view of the writer an nth rate economist then ranging from one to infinity appendix the magnitude of the reverse flow of resources from africa in this annexe the reverse flow with regard to africa is highlighted anup shaw states that africa is rich but the rest of the world is benefitting from its wealth his report reveals that countries in africa are rich however this wealth is not benefitting african citizens but the rest of the world according to him whilst countries in africa receive us 162 billion in resources such as aid loans and foreign investment a whopping us 203 billion is taken out mostly by multinational corporations debt payments tax dodging and the costs imposed by climate change caused by the rest of the world as the diagram below shows in total the rest of the world receives over us 41 billion a year from african countries this is more than enough money to provide decent healthcare to all people in africa this stands the story about poverty on its head africa is already rich according to shah what is needed therefore are policies that mean that ordinary africans benefit from this wealth rather than seeing it taken out by multinational corporations and global elites if ordinary africans could benefit from this wealth it would help provide education clean water housing and so forth action is needed to address the causes of poverty in africa these causes include tax dodging a lack of corporate regulation debt climate change and unfair trade policies occasioned by the continent s aid donors the diagram map below summarises this view of africa s exploitation diagram showing the magnitude of the reverse flow of resources from africa given this situation and the logic or philosophy africa is in the real sense the foreign aid donor while the rest of the world is actually the recipients of africa s aid this is food for thought the writer is a professor of economics
islamabad pakistan has reached an agreement in principle with the international monetary fund imf over a bailout programme and expects to formally secure a rescue package later this month a pakistani minister said on monday the long delayed rescue package would be pakistan s 13th imf bailout programme since the late 1980s and comes at a time of worsening economic outlook for the south asian nation of 208 million people earlier this month finance minister asad umar visited washington for meetings with the imf which on monday called the talks constructive discussions muhammad azhar state minister for revenue tweeted that an agreement in principle has been reached on all outstanding issues with imf during umar s trip technical details and formalities will now be finalised during the imf s staff level visit to pakistan later this month azhar added the imf said on monday its mission team will be visiting islamabad before the end of april pakistan s central bank last month lowered growth forecasts and raised interest rates at a time when inflation is at a five year high the rupee currency has also lost about 35 percent since december 2017 the bailout has been delayed since last year as pakistani officials have said they worry conditions attached to the proposed imf loans could hurt economic growth analysts have been expecting the package to be concluded this month but say the contours of any proposed assistance programme are unclear there are questions if there will be any further devaluations how much interest rates will be hiked what taxation measures are expected of pakistan and will there be any further increase in electricity or gas prices said saad hashemy chief economist for pakistani brokerage house topline securities the government of prime minister imran khan who took power in august has obtained temporary relief from close allies such as china and saudi arabia with short term loans worth more than 10 billion to buffer foreign currency reserves and ease pressures on the country s current account but analysts have called an imf bailout inevitable with pakistan also facing an increasing fiscal crunch ahead of the annual budget spending review for the next financial year starting july 1 khan s government is facing increasing public anger over rising utility prices many of which have been subsidized by successive cash strapped governments inflation was over 9 4 percent in march its highest since november 2013 with strong increases in food and energy the two most sensitive items for most consumers the central bank forecasts growth at 3 5 to 4 percent in the 12 months to end june well short of a government target of 6 2 percent the imf paints a gloomier picture predicting pakistani growth of 2 9 percent in 2019 and 2 8 percent the following year
as a financial crisis spread across the globe in september of 2008 the u s federal reserve gathered in an emergency atmosphere as requests flooded in from other central banks for access to dollars the swap lines that the fed quickly approved helped ease intense financial stress in foreign markets but also showed the u s central bank was prepared to stand behind the global system would an america first fed do the same the question is suddenly relevant for global economic officials and central bankers after moves by president donald trump to put two strong partisans on the federal reserve board both economic commentator stephen moore and businessman herman cain have been critical of fed policies and moore in particular has opposed the extraordinary measures employed to stabilise the economy through the deepest crisis since the great depression should trump shape a fed that answers first to his politics it could roil the landscape for other central banks and for a dollar dependent world financial system whose fortunes can swing dramatically based on fed decisions i m certainly worried about central bank independence in other countries especially in the most important jurisdiction in the world said european central bank president mario draghi in washington for spring meetings of the international monetary fund and world bank sensitive moment trump s decision to consider close political allies for the central bank comes at a sensitive moment for the world economy and the imf fund managing director christine lagarde last week asked member countries to strive to do no harm yet its largest shareholder the united states has become a concern trump s ongoing trade battles have been cited as a reason global growth is slowing and the idea of a fed stacked with officials looking first at the u s political calendar has overseas central bankers nervous the imf has commended the steady evolution of fed policy under chairman jerome powell but trump has demanded he cut rates and moore has endorsed the idea the actions of one central bank often impacts the economies of other nations but the rule of thumb is to set policy as much as possible on the basis of detached analysis not to gain a short term trade or political advantage if the fed were to cut rates to counter a u s slowdown it would be one thing but juicing a mostly healthy economy to make trump look good would send a bad signal and hurt countries that are grappling with their own economic problems lower rates could weaken the dollar boosting u s exports and appealing to a core trump campaign aim of expanding u s manufacturing jobs but it would make it harder for the bank of japan to follow its own strategy of targeting specific levels for long term bond yields and undercut growth in europe that the european central bank is trying to support emerging markets could see destabilising capital flows can a politicized fed be relied on to do what it did in 2008 when it was lender of last resort for the world you would really have to worry about this that rather than be the strongest proponent of stability the fed all of a sudden becomes an agent of instability said jacob funk kirkegaard a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics already some of trump s policies have european financial leaders thinking about ways to boost the euro as a reserve currency on views the oversized influence of the dollar in global markets leaves europe vulnerable to u s political decisions poor history for politicized fed both moore and cain have yet to be nominated formally and cain s prospects look bleak fed governors must be approved by the u s senate and enough republican lawmakers have come out against cain to scuttle his chances moore meanwhile has sent mixed signals about his policies but in general has criticized the fed flooding markets with dollars during the crisis and its aftermath he has favoured tying the fed to a strict rule based on commodity prices critics of rule based monetary policy cite its lack of flexibility to respond to unexpected events the fed has had deeply political governors before perhaps most notably in the 1980s when a group loyal to then president ronald reagan opposed policy set by then chairman paul volcker said william english the former head of the fed s monetary affairs division and now a professor at yale they didn t succeed english said evidence of the influence of a strong fed chair and of the limits an individual governor has in an institution with a strong technocratic bent and on a policy panel that at peak strength includes 19 people twelve of them moreover are appointed by regional banks outside the president s reach but before volcker he said the fed did mold policy around the demands of presidents lyndon johnson and richard nixon and arguably contributed to the runaway inflation of the 1970s we did that experiment the outcome was bad he said for the imf and other global institutions there s a broader issue if the world s dominant economy steers away from the norms recommended for other countries as the trump administration has already done on trade whether it is the potential for unhindered government borrowing or a politicized central bank the united states may be writing a script that other less resilient countries may be tempted to follow the fund likes to live in a world where all of its members are treated evenhandedly said nathan sheets former under secretary of the treasury for international affairs and now chief economist at pgim fixed income if the united states starts opening the fed to partisan politics or shifting away from other norms that is a risk for them source reuters by howard schneider additional reporting by balazs koranyi editing by andrea ricci
ghana s cedi has recovered to levels that appropriately reflect the state of the economy after overshooting during a slump in the first quarter the head of the central bank has said the local currency collapsed as much as 16 percent against the dollar after offshore holders of domestic debt failed to roll back their maturing investments at the same time as when the central bank was building reserves to meet targets under a programme of the international monetary fund it pared its year to date losses to 6 4 percent trading at 5 2513 against the greenback by the close in accra on thursday we think that is probably where the fundamentals would say it should be bank of ghana bog governor dr ernest addison said in an interview thursday with bloomberg television in washington the key thing to recognize is that the exchange rate will reflect the fundamentals of the ghanaian economy and we believe that the fundamentals are at the appropriate places since coming to power in january 2017 the government of president nana akufo addo has overseen accelerating economic growth as ghana finalized a four year imf bailout programme which ended earlier this month over the same period the central bank cut interest rates by 950 basis points as consumer price growth eased to within the target band of 6 percent to 10 percent a surprise cut in january was informed by the u s federal reserve s more accommodative stance giving the bank of ghana room to reduce the policy rate at home said addison further easing will hinge on the monetary policy committee s expectations for price growth addison said we are very cognizant of the need to stay focused on inflation the central bank may start a review of the target band after elections which are due in december 2020 he said ghana can t remain competitive having inflation rates of 8 percent when our trade partners have lower inflation of about 5 percent he said that creates problems for currency stability he said bloomberg
with the global economy slowing and showing signs it may need support economists are pointing fingers at germany and a few other countries that are in a position to provide a lot of stimulus but are choosing not to what stimulus measures policy makers can use to support their flagging economies has been a key issue during weekend meetings at the international monetary fund in washington in its annual report on global fiscal policies the imf singled out germany korea and australia as places where fiscal stimulus could makes sense earlier this month the imf called on switzerland to ramp up public spending the imf backed by the u s has pressed germany and others with budget surpluses to cut taxes or raise spending to prop up growth countries with budget surpluses should certainly make use of it and have the space to invest and to participate in the economic development and growth imf managing director christine lagarde said but not enough has been done on that front treasury secretary steven mnuchin said he agreed with the imf s stance on surplus countries such as germany the u s is now running large deficits the idea behind debt financed stimulus is that when economies are weak governments substitute for a lack of private demand through spending or tax cuts in times of intense stress such as the global financial crisis a decade ago economists agree that governments should do all they can to prop up growth but using large scale fiscal stimulus to address an economic soft patch has met with resistance from countries like germany that run a conservative economic policy germany s finance minister olaf scholz fired back at criticisms pointing to increased public investment reduced taxes and higher support for low income families it would be a very nice service if you could tell the rest of the world that they are demanding something we already did he said to a reporter at a press conference friday germany s stable finances put it in a better position to respond to the next recession he said and the current global risks aren t germany s finances but rather man made ones including brexit and trade disputes korea runs an annual budget surplus and australia is expected to swing to a surplus in the coming years unlike europe these economies don t appear to be in need of much stimulus and their central banks have scope to cut interest rates if needed germany and switzerland are using annual surpluses to cut debt and prepare for expected budget strains from future retirees germany s position is the most relevant among surplus countries given its dominant role in european growth and politics if germany were to launch a big stimulus program it could encourage deficit countries like france and italy to ease off measures to bring their budgets closer to balance european rules set a ceiling on deficits of 3 of gross domestic product though exceptions are made in times of stress the u s has no such limit germany s export dependent economy contracted in the third quarter of last year and was flat in the fourth a string of weak manufacturing figures suggests it could contract again in the first half of this year that soft patch will affect the 19 member eurozone where germany is the biggest member and ripple across non euro countries like switzerland that rely on europe for exports china s economic slowdown has hit the germany economy hard and there is a good case for using fiscal policy to smooth adjustment said ken rogoff professor at harvard university noting germany s huge latitude from its low public debt which equals less than 60 of gross domestic product and could shrink to less than 50 by 2022 according to imf estimates germany has run annual surpluses since 2014 and is expected to do so through 2024 according to the imf tax revenues have increased 8 since 2017 faster than welfare spending and working germans today pay the second highest level of income tax of all members of the organization for economic cooperation and development behind only belgium the u s position is in stark contrast to germany s despite facing similar problems with old age spending the government has pumped the u s economy with tax cuts and higher spending with the aim of generating 3 annual gdp growth rates annual deficits are over 4 of gdp the hope is that by expanding the size of the economy the u s will be in a better position to service its debt down the road the usual side effects of stimulus higher bond yields and rising inflation have failed to materialize strengthening the argument of the stimulus camp and weakening germany s view that it s best to keep the powder dry for the next recession germany is currently learning the hard way that they are the only country around playing according to these rules said carsten brzeski an economist at ing bank source dow jones
in its second bi monthly meeting held on march 25 and 26 this year the monetary policy committee of the central bank of nigeria delivered a pleasant surprise in the form of a minor cut to the monetary policy rate from 14 per cent to 13 5 per cent it was the first time the mpr would be tinkered with since july 2016 the mpc points to the relative stability in the key macroeconomic variables as well as the need to signal a new direction that is pro growth as justification for the 50 basis point reduction specifically the committee was emboldened by the continued moderation in inflationary pressure and the stability in the foreign exchange market although still in breach of the cbn s upper band target of 9 per cent headline inflation slowed to 11 31 percent in february 2019 from a peak of 18 72 in january 2017 according to the national bureau of statistics on the external front the mpc equally found solace in the moderate improvement in crude oil prices and stable accretion to external reserves especially against the backdrop of current developments in the oil futures market which indicate that oil prices will remain considerably above the federal government s 2019 budget benchmark equally heartwarming for the monetary authority is the trend of declining long term yields in the united states of america in the wake of the federal reserve s shift to a more dovish stance and the likelihood that capital flows in the medium term may be redirected to frontier and emerging markets including nigeria without any doubt this move by the mpc bodes well for the nigerian economy which requires a great deal of real sector traction to achieve full recovery and inclusive growth typically as the mpr which is the rate at which banks borrow money from the cbn is reduced the banks in turn are expected to pass on the benefits to customers by reducing interest rates on loans admittedly a 50 basis point reduction may not be significant to translate to lower lending rates in the near term explaining in part why financial markets reaction to the surprise rate cut seemed subdued the equities market for instance closed in the red with the all share index shedding 0 67 per cent on wednesday being the first trading day following the announcement of the rate cut and only managed to eke out a gain of 0 01 per cent at the close of trading the following day nevertheless the mpc decision has opened the door which seemed shut for about 33 months to subsequent rate cuts in the medium term going forward against the backdrop of benign inflation an accommodative monetary policy will provide room for increased channeling of credit to the real sector thereby reducing the cost of funds for many small and medium enterprises the capital market stands to benefit from a low interest rate environment given that some of the increased liquidity will likely flow into the equities market it will also be positive for the government s fiscal position arising from cheaper bonds issuance considering that part of this year s budget deficit will be financed through borrowing from the domestic capital market
us federal reserve chairman jerome powell arrives for a g 20 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting at the imf and world bank s 2019 annual spring meetings in washington on april 12 photo reuters as a financial crisis spread across the globe in september of 2008 the us federal reserve gathered in an emergency atmosphere as requests flooded in from other central banks for access to dollars the swap lines that the fed quickly approved helped ease intense financial stress in foreign markets but also showed the us central bank was prepared to stand behind the global system would an america first fed do the same the question is suddenly relevant for global economic officials and central bankers after moves by president donald trump to put two strong partisans on the federal reserve board both economic commentator stephen moore and businessman herman cain have been critical of fed policies and moore in particular has opposed the extraordinary measures employed to stabilize the economy through the deepest crisis since the great depression should trump shape a fed that answers first to his politics it could roil the landscape for other central banks and for a dollar dependent world financial system whose fortunes can swing dramatically based on fed decisions i m certainly worried about central bank independence in other countries especially in the most important jurisdiction in the world said european central bank president mario draghi in washington for spring meetings of the international monetary fund and world bank trump s decision to consider close political allies for the central bank comes at a sensitive moment for the world economy and the imf fund managing director christine lagarde last week asked member countries to strive to do no harm yet its largest shareholder the united states has become a concern trump s ongoing trade battles have been cited as a reason global growth is slowing and the idea of a fed stacked with officials looking first at the us political calendar has overseas central bankers nervous the imf has commended the steady evolution of fed policy under chairman jerome powell but trump has demanded he cut rates and moore has endorsed the idea the actions of one central bank often impacts the economies of other nations but the rule of thumb is to set policy as much as possible on the basis of detached analysis not to gain a short term trade or political advantage if the fed were to cut rates to counter a us slowdown it would be one thing but juicing a mostly healthy economy to make trump look good would send a bad signal and hurt countries that are grappling with their own economic problems lower rates could weaken the dollar boosting us exports and appealing to a core trump campaign aim of expanding us manufacturing jobs but it would make it harder for the bank of japan to follow its own strategy of targeting specific levels for long term bond yields and undercut growth in europe that the european central bank is trying to support emerging markets could see destablizing capital flows can a politicized fed be relied on to do what it did in 2008 when it was lender of last resort for the world you would really have to worry about this that rather than be the strongest proponent of stability the fed all of a sudden becomes an agent of instability said jacob funk kirkegaard a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics already some of trump s policies have european financial leaders thinking about ways to boost the euro as a reserve currency on views the oversized influence of the dollar in global markets leaves europe vulnerable to us political decisions both moore and cain have yet to be nominated formally and cain s prospects look bleak fed governors must be approved by the us senate and enough republican lawmakers have come out against cain to scuttle his chances moore meanwhile has sent mixed signals about his policies but in general has criticized the fed flooding markets with dollars during the crisis and its aftermath he has favored tying the fed to a strict rule based on commodity prices critics of rule based monetary policy cite its lack of flexibility to respond to unexpected events the fed has had deeply political governors before perhaps most notably in the 1980s when a group loyal to then president ronald reagan opposed policy set by then chairman paul volcker said william english the former head of the fed s monetary affairs division and now a professor at yale they didn t succeed english said evidence of the influence of a strong fed chair and of the limits an individual governor has in an institution with a strong technocratic bent and on a policy panel that at peak strength includes 19 people twelve of them moreover are appointed by regional banks outside the president s reach but before volcker he said the fed did mold policy around the demands of presidents lyndon johnson and richard nixon and arguably contributed to the runaway inflation of the 1970s we did that experiment the outcome was bad he said for the imf and other global institutions there s a broader issue if the world s dominant economy steers away from the norms recommended for other countries as the trump administration has already done on trade whether it is the potential for unhindered government borrowing or a politicized central bank the united states may be writing a script that other less resilient countries may be tempted to follow the fund likes to live in a world where all of its members are treated evenhandedly said nathan sheets former under secretary of the treasury for international affairs and now chief economist at pgim fixed income if the united states starts opening the fed to partisan politics or shifting away from other norms that is a risk for them
uche usim abuja on april 4 the director general of the debt management office dmo patience oniha dropped a bombshell that nigeria s bloating debt portfolio has hit n24 39 trillion as at december 31 2018 the debt rose by n2 66 trillion in one year as the 2017 figure was n21 72 trillion according to her the new debt stock represents a year on year growth rate of about 12 25 per cent but to economy watchers the revelation was not totally a surprise because the central bank of nigeria s monetary policy committee cbn mpc rose from its first 2019 meeting in january with a red flag over government s insatiable appetite for external borrowing the committee then warned that nigeria s debt level could fast be approaching the pre 2005 paris club exit level of 30 billion before a two time finance minister dr ngozi okonjo iweala brokered a deal with the paris club an informal group of creditor nations and brought the country a whopping 18 billion reduction experts insist that the growing debt remains a product of poor financial decision making fiscal management on the part of government as many nigerians are yet to feel the impact of what the borrowed money has been ploughed into since poverty still stares the citizens in the face while the federal government boasts of a robust debt sustainability programme and the country s capacity to pay back finance experts and the international community are rather uncomfortable with the figures that grew from n21 12 trillion in 2015 to n24 39 trillion last year their fears spring from a plethora of challenges ranging from heavy reliance on dwindling crude oil sales and a slow economic diversification pace to revenue leakages and systemic corruption in form of inflated petrol subsidy payouts and others there is palpable fear that the country might be boxed into a debt trap considering that 70 per cent of her income will be channeled into debt servicing consequently christine lagarde the managing director of the international monetary fund imf has called for the total dismantling of all forms of subsidies saying it was the only option left for nigeria to raise more money to fund its dilapidated infrastructure and improve the living standards of the people given its poor tax to gdp status compared to other countries in its income bracket she lamented that 5 2trillion has so far been spent by oil producing nations across the world on fuel subsidy in the last four years more so the imf s financial counsellor and director monetary and capital markets department tobias adrian while presenting the global financial stability report at the just concluded joint annual spring meetings with the world bank in washington dc said nigeria has been borrowing in international markets but we worry so on the one hand that is very good because it allows nigeria to invest more but on the other hand we do worry about rollover risks going forward at the moment funding conditions in economies such as nigeria and other sub saharan african countries are very favourable but that might change at some point and there is a risk of rollovers and there is the risk of whether these needs for refinancing can be met in the future he said incidentally the anxiety over the country s swelling external borrowing is not felt only in the aforementioned quarters in september 2018 former minister of environment and deputy secretary general of the united nations un amina mohammed warned about the buhari administration s addiction to borrowing stating at a public event that as i was coming up from new york some of the concerns that came up from the meeting we had in china just recently and reports that we have the debt issues are really big i mean having experienced what it was for ngozi okonjo iweala to get debt relief it took her a few years to convince people and we are now back again in the country with a level of debt that is worrying but the minister of budget and national planning udoma udo udoma and his finance counterpart mrs zainab ahmed insist that the debts are sustainable though they also concede that the country has a huge revenue challenge udoma said with regards to our debts our debts are sustainable we do have a revenue challenge and we are focusing on that every nation borrows once the revenues come up it will be obvious that we don t have a debt problem at all we are working on a number of initiatives to increase our revenues we are looking at initiatives to widening the tax payers base we are looking at initiatives to increase efficiency in collections we are looking at a single window which will help to increase efficiency customs collections we are looking at many different ways to improve revenues while the government maintains it is borrowing to finance infrastructure there are also concerns over the capability of the government owned and operated infrastructure to liquidate the loan used in building it on schedule for instance the 1 46 billion abuja kaduna rail service that was inaugurated by president muhammadu buhari on july 26 2016 is yet to break even let alone making profit the managing director of the nigerian railway corporation nrc fidel okhiria said earlier in the year that the train service generated over n80million monthly in 2018 he said the figure was higher than the n16 million generated monthly in 2017 but noted that in spite of the increase in revenue the corporation had yet to break even as it still spent over n100million monthly as running cost mainly due to poor public power supply so analysts are wondering how soon that service will break even make profit repay its loan and sustain a safe and efficient operations using locomotives there are already complaints of frequent blackout in some of the coaches ticket racketeering poor air conditioning system onboard and other blights synonymous with government enterprises it is believed that these issues if not hurriedly and sufficiently tackled may eventually shrink patronage as government is yet to engage the private sector in operating the service to allow it bring in the needed expertise to offer higher service than the current in house effort there is also a stumbling block on the path to diversifying the economy via agriculture in the form of the persistent farmers herders clashes that have reduced food production volumes in no small measure hence the central bank of nigeria has repeatedly called for solutions to the menace to enable agriculture take its rightful place in the economy tongues are also wagging over the federal government s fixation on crude oil when virtually all the states in the north have vital natural resources like gold zinc uranium and others in commercial quantities according to a report by the nigerian extractive industries transparency initiative neiti nigeria lost a whopping 9 billion in 2014 and 2015 to illegal mining unfortunately the activities of illegal miners have not been addressed till date lately it snowballed into turf wars in zamfara state where over 3 000 people have been killed as many interest groups battle to control lucrative gold mining sites rather than go cap in hand securing offshore loans many have urged the government to develop the lucrative mining sector rather allow illegal miners snatch the sector from the government and rob it of all accruable revenue therein more so studies by the imf and world bank reveal that nigeria could even better with these solid minerals than crude oil if well harnessed a professor of capital market and head of department banking and finance at nasarawa state university keffi uche uwaleke described the growing debts as a huge challenge he however said borrowing to diversify the economy and expand the export base was not a challenge as long as the projects the loans are channeled into are self liquidating borrowing for capital projects is not an issue but the project should liquidate the loan and still offer the services it was meant to provide we should not use taxpayers money to subsidise such projects for which the loans were secured we should hand over such projects to the private sector to run it strictly as a business concern the real issue here is not the debt figure but the cost of servicing it at 70 per cent that s very high and that s why we must urgently expand our revenue base our debt to gdp is lower than south korea that is 38 per cent the issue with nigeria is really debt service to revenue ratio we must cut down waste drastically and identify those self liquidating projects and get concessionary loans for them loans with long gestation period and low interest rate south korea offers official development assistance oda to some african nations but nigeria is not on the list when i asked they said we did not approach them for it oda flows are defined as those flows to countries and territories and to multilateral development institutions which are provided by official agencies including state and local governments or by their executive agencies and it is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective it is also concessional in character such a facility will help us a great deal he said also commenting on the development the centre for social justice in its report on the review of the 2019 appropriation document urged the government to hurriedly create new sources of revenue the national coordinator of the group and seasoned economic analyst eze onyekpere urged the president and national assembly to consider the reduction of domestic and foreign borrowing and instead focus on increasing public private partnerships ppps through well prepared projects involving the ministries departments and agencies mdas the infrastructure concession regulatory commission icrc and the private sector the president and national assembly should set the consolidated debt limits of the three tiers of government in accordance with section 42 of the fra mandating these limits he added he also called for special purpose vehicles that garner and aggregate resources from a plethora of sources including institutional and retail investors to fund priority capital projects the government should consider increasing value added tax vat from 5 per cent to 7 5 per cent and also initiate measures to increase collection efficiency

if you don t think you will be able to complete and file your taxes on time request an extension filing an extension helps taxpayers avoid penalties for a late return according to the irs associated press monday is tax day the due date for americans to file their 2018 taxes it also marks a milestone the country has made it through a full year of president donald trump s new tax code and the first tax filing season under the new rules trump and his fellow republicans promised their bill would cut taxes make filing simpler and boost wages business spending and the overall economy trump signed the most sweeping overhaul of the u s tax code in three decades into law on december 22 2017 with zero democratic votes with year one in the books it s fair to say some of those promises came true some did not and some it s still too early to definitely say here s a rundown of what we know so far 1 promise your taxes will fit on a postcard this didn t happen the main form almost all tax filers fill out the 1040 did shrink but much of the information that used to appear on the 1040 now appears on schedules meaning a lot of taxpayers simply ended up filling out more pages instructions for the main form also grew by 10 pages it s not simpler the only real piece that was removed from the 1040 was the personal exemption and that was just one line said bradley heim an indiana university professor and former economist in treasury s office of tax analysis a lot of what was changed was lines were taken from the 1040 and moved to other schedules but heim says many taxpayers probably won t notice the extra schedules and instructions since most people use some sort of service or computer program to do their taxes for them many also took advantage of the higher standard deduction so they didn t have to itemize but heim points out people still had to keep track of their various charitable receipts and state and local taxes to figure out if taking the standard deduction was their best option or not 2 promise the middle class will benefit yes the vast majority of americans 65 percent did get a tax cut looking specifically at the middle class the tax policy center predicted 82 percent of middle class earners households who make 49 000 to 86 000 a year would receive a tax cut averaging about 1 050 the data out so far backs up the estimates h r block said among the millions of tax returns it processed by the end of march the average tax cut was 1 200 it s also true not everyone is celebrating about 9 percent of middle income families had to pay more and the rest paid about the same in taxes according to the tax policy center 3 promise your wages will rise trump kept claiming the average american would get 4 000 more a year due to the tax bill that hasn t panned out although there is some good news on pay some companies gave employees a one time bonus or raised pay and credited the tax bill but that only impacted a few million people out of the nearly 157 million employed the white house is now pointing to the rise in average hourly pay as a sign of success for the average worker wages are now growing over 3 percent a year according to the labor department and they are growing fastest for lower income workers that s the best nominal not adjusted for cost of living gain in about a decade but it s important to point out that wage gains had been slowly trending up for the past several years in 2015 wages rose an average of 2 3 percent in 2017 it was about 2 6 percent economists say the tax bill probably helped push wages above 3 percent but there was some momentum already for a worker making 60 000 a year the faster wage growth added about 240 more than what the person would have received if wages had remained at the 2017 pace some of the gains from higher wages and lower taxes have been offset by inflation there are several measures of inflation but none of them show prices rising fast enough to erase workers wage gains right now mainly because gas prices haven t jumped much in the past year 4 promise the tax cut will pay for itself this is not happening the white house stood almost alone on this vow economists and budget experts across the political spectrum predicted the tax bill s 1 5 trillion price tag would have to be funded mostly by debt the early results indicate that is exactly what is happening despite a strong economy tax receipts are down the committee for a responsible federal budget predicts the budget deficit this fiscal year will hit almost 900 billion the tax bill accounts for 230 billion of that deficit or about a quarter of it crfb calculated 5 promise there will be a capex boom there was a bounce but it might be short lived capex stands for capital expenditures a wall street term for the investments that businesses make in equipment technology new buildings and research these kinds of investments tend to make workers more productive which boosts wages and economic growth the white house argued this is what the tax bill was all about and why it would cause much faster growth for years to come here s what capex looks like in recent quarters according to the commerce department there s a noticeable jump in the first and second quarters of 2018 just after the tax bill is enacted but that momentum appears to be fading back to more normal levels i m not buying the thesis that the tax cuts gave the biggest boost to capex said rajeev dhawan director of economic forecasting center at georgia state university if tax cuts cause capex boom then why did it fizzle in the second half of the year some argue that businesses need more time to digest the tax code changes before they make these big investment decisions so there could be another surge but dhawan points out that surveys like morgan stanley s capex plans index aren t predicting that for this year 6 promise money will come flooding back from abroad so far it s been a trickle trump kept talking about 4 trillion to 5 trillion that big companies had stashed overseas because they didn t want to bring the money back to the united states and get socked by a high tax rate trump cut the tax rate on repatriated money and said it would unleash a flood of cash coming home according to government data 665 billion has come back so far a fraction of the roughly 3 trillion many analysts believe is overseas but experts say there are many reasons companies might be waiting including that the lower tax rate will be in place for several years it s really too early to tell fortune 500 company tax directors are still figuring out the law and how to do their taxes said victor fleischer a tax law professor at university of california irvine they haven t really gotten to the step of changing the way they make investments going forward 7 promise more companies will want to do business in the united states business sentiment jumped after the largest corporate tax cut in u s history executives of big companies gave trump a warm welcome at the world economic forum just after the bill passed and firms like jpmorgan chase reported billions in tax savings last year which helped boost profits and stock prices but it remains to be seen whether businesses will use the extra cash on hand to invest here a few companies have made a big show of opening a new plant in the united states but the hard data show the 500 largest public companies have used their tax savings to buy back stock far more than they have on capital spending 8 promise gdp will be 3 percent or higher yes trump basically achieved this in the first year after the tax cuts the official statistic is 2 9 percent but the way many economists prefer to calculate gdp growth showed 3 percent growth trump has predicted similar growth every year for the next decade but almost no one else agrees with that forecast most experts say growth this year will be closer to 2 percent even a white house report released last month asserted it would take additional tax cuts and a big infrastructure bill to keep growth as high as trump wants for years to come 9 promise americans will love this bill more people give the bill a thumbs down than a thumbs up according to the realclearpolitics tracker a trend that has been pretty consistent since it passed republicans didn t even campaign on it much during the midterm election but kevin hassett head of trump s council of economic advisers points out trump s approval rating on the economy overall is pretty good right now in a cnn poll last month for example 71 percent of americans said the economy is in good shape the highest reading since 2001 in that poll in short polling on the tax bill splits mostly along partisan lines but americans seem pretty happy with the economy overall right now and some of that is due to tax cuts a key reason many disapprove of the tax cuts is because while most americans did receive a lower tax bill the biggest benefits went to the wealthy according to independent analyses 10 refunds there was no promise on refunds but fewer people received one this year and they are not happy about it according to irs data through the first week in april about 800 000 fewer tax filers received refunds a number that s likely to grow by the end of the tax season tax refunds tell you nothing about how much someone paid in taxes most americans did pay less in federal taxes in 2018 but they received that savings via fatter paychecks last year instead of in a one time payment getting a refund means someone overpaid taxes to the government during the year and thus gets that extra money back many people paid less in taxes at all income levels said john petosa an accountant and professor of practice at the martin j whitman school of management at syracuse university but i had a number of clients that had to write a check at the end of the year because even though they paid less overall in taxes they didn t have enough tax withheld from their paycheck they weren t used to that and they felt the tax cut promise hadn t been delivered upon most tax experts advise people not to get a refund but republicans learned just how much americans love their refunds as outrage grew about smaller or disappearing refunds

as another tax day arrives americans are surely wondering where their hard earned federal taxes go this year washington will spend a staggering 35 148 per household and collect 26 677 per household in taxes and who represents the kids who will inherit much of the bill the resulting budget deficit of 8 471 per household will bring the total national debt to 177 000 per household federal spending has soared nearly 7 000 per household since 2007 and is projected to rise another 7 000 over the next decade all numbers in this article are adjusted for inflation unless spending is reined in tax

costs the typical couple retiring today will receive social security benefits 13 percent higher than their lifetime contributions and medicare benefits that are triple their lifetime contributions into the system even after adjusting for inflation and net present values as 74 million retiring baby boomers are added to this fragile system paying all promised benefits would eventually require raising the payroll tax to 33 percent or imposing a 34 percent value added tax basically a national sales tax this year washington will spend a staggering 35 148 per household and collect 26 677 per

however the national debt is in the process of surging to nearly 38 trillion by 2029 it stood at 10 trillion in 2008 which will push annual net interest costs to nearly 6 000 per household or double

oliver kazunga natasha chamba business reporters zimbabweans should engage towards a social contract and instil discipline in the marketplace to prevent the country from plunging into a recession economic analysts said yesterday although government has set the economy on a positive footing under its comprehensive economic reform drive guided by the transitional stabilisation programme tsp poor rains experienced this season devastating effects of cyclone idai and wanton price increases driven by speculative parallel market distortions have slowed down progress last week the international monetary fund imf expressed fears that zimbabwe could slide into recession this year a move that would likely dent the economic gains achieved so far under the tsp a recession generally refers to a significant contraction in economic activity spread across the country previously the imf had projected an economic growth of at least 4 2 percent this year based on the hope of a resurgent mining sector and an anticipated increase in foreign direct investment in separate interviews economic analysts said urgent measure should be taken collectively in order for the country not to slide into recession prominent businessman and zimbabwe national chamber of commerce past president mr luxon zembe said it is important for the nation to come together in the form of a social contract and agree as social partners between business labour government and the civil society in terms of discipline so that we all agree that we adhere to a code of ethics to a code of practice that enforces discipline in the market place if we are to arrest these rampant price increases which are obviously being driven by the unstable macro economic environment and the uncertainty that exists in the environment as well as the gap between the official exchange rate and the parallel market rate we will avoid zimbabwe from sliding into recession he said mr zembe highlighted that what was now happening in the economy in terms of price madness was an epitome of a dog trying to chase its tail where the parallel market is now a runaway target he said it was critical for the country to secure significant inflows of foreign exchange or the united states dollars into the official system to manage and arrest the runaway inflation the exchange rate also has got a lot to do with the price increases that are taking place because of uncertainty that is being created where people are charging premium prices for the uncertainty because you don t know what s going to happen tomorrow he said the government should try and mobilise as much lines of credit if possible so that we improve the existing foreign exchange reserves in the country to stabilise the foreign exchange rate in the market so it s important to have the lines of credit balance of payments support and being able at least to ensure that there are sustainable these once off injections really will not solve the situation because they will just stabilise for a few days what is required is a more reliable and sustainable way of foreign exchange inflows said mr zembe professor ashok chakravati from the university of zimbabwe said what you are asking calls for austerity economist mr richford madzetse said symptoms of a recession were usually spread across the entire economy and normally visible in real gross domestic product gdp employment industrial production and wholesale retail sales during this period businesses will likely close down or cease to expand rate of unemployment rises and housing prices decline he said another economist mr goodwine mureriwa said the problem with a recession was that it tends to cripple demand as consumer spending is reduced and forces business to scale down investment this means there is less money in people s pockets and less demand in almost all business sectors which will lead to investors scaling down a notch he said mr mureriwa also said zimbabwe should intensify austerity measures proposed by the ministry of finance in fighting the recession zimbabwe can be saved from this recession only if people cut down on luxuries as suggested by professor ncube and rather use the few available dollars to invest for the future and not now something called cathedral investments he said

sierra leone telegraph 15 april 2019 african economies are facing a huge challenge after the last global economic crisis hit many african countries quite hard many are still struggling to recover last week the imf held a press conference in many of these countries public investments has helped spur higher growth while also of course translating into an increase in public debt levels so there is a need to strike a better balance between public debt increase on one hand and the continued investments that are needed in public investment says the imf this is a transcript of that press conference which took place in washington on the 12 april 2019 led by abebe aemro selassie director of the imf african department and lucie mboto fouda senior communications officer at the imf this is what they said fouda good morning everyone and welcome to this press conference by mr abebe aemro selassie whom you all know the director of the african department at the imf i m lucie mboto fouda with the communication department we are also launching today the regional economic outlook for sub saharan africa which we posted yesterday under embargo and that has now gone live so i trust you had access to it abebe will offer a few opening remarks and then he will be happy to take your questions abebe selassie thank you lucie a very good morning to you all thank you for joining us this morning we are launching our regional economic outlook i m just coming from a session where we launched that a few remarks from my end before perhaps turning to your questions the sub saharan africa economy continues to recover in terms of economic growth this year we are expecting growth to accelerate to 3 5 percent from 3 percent last year but these regional average numbers mask quite a lot of difference in terms of outcomes across the region specifically some 21 countries are expected to grow at 5 percent or more this year and so you know with per capita income increases that are markedly larger than many countries in the rest of the world and these economies that are growing fast tend to be the more diversified economies still there are in other set of countries around 24 mainly resource dependent economies that are facing sluggish growth in the near term and are seeing slower improvements in standards of livings this group includes some of the larger economies in the region the likes of angola nigeria and south africa which account for more than 50 percent of the region s output external and domestic developments are having a betting on the economic outlook on the external front perhaps the most important factors have been the volatility and global financial conditions as well as the volatility in commodity prices which are posing a challenge for policymakers domestically one pressure point remains rising public debt vulnerabilities these are elevated in some countries and posing a challenge the reason for the increase in debt levels tends to be very country specific for some it is due to addressing the large infrastructure needs in others it s been the effect of the commodity price shock that hit countries between 2014 and 2016 and yet in others it s been procyclical policies which have led to the marked increase in debt levels looking ahead we see basically two broad implications for policies first in the fast growing economies the likes of benin ethiopia ghana senegal there is a need to hand over the reins of growth from the public to the private sector in many of these countries public investments has helped spur higher growth while also of course translating into an increase in public debt levels so there is a need to strike a better balance between public debt increase on one hand and the continued investments that are needed in public investment in the slower growing economies the likes of as i just mentioned angola nigeria south africa there is a need to pursue reforms to facilitate economic diversification and address remaining economic imbalances many of these cases private investments remain weak and a strong focus is needed to address the constraints that are holding such investments back one development that we are very hopeful will facilitate growth is increased trade integration in the region we are very encouraged by the progress that has been made towards the african continental free trade area once completed the trade agreement will establish a market of 1 2 billion people with a combined gdp of 2 5 trillion the benefits could be substantial particularly if countries tackle the non tariff bottlenecks to trade including by investing in infrastructure lowering logistical costs and improving trade facilitation what is interesting we think is that intraregional exports in africa are more diversified and have a higher technology content than africa s exports to much the rest of the world and just to give you a couple of numbers on this 40 percent of intraregional trade is accounted for by manufactured goods whereas the region exports to the world 75 percent of such exports tend to be minerals the likes of crude oil and other commodities still one thing to note of course is that to ensure the benefits of intraregional integration are shared by all policymakers should be mindful of the adjustment costs that integration could entail and move swiftly to address those in addition to these more medium term challenges that i ve been noting we see you know countries of course have been hit by significant shocks two such examples i want to highlight i think the first is the security challenge overall the conflict levels in the region tend to be much lower than in the 90s and even early 2000s but countries in the sahel and lake chad basin are facing considerable security threats and this region inaudible economic outlook we have done some work looking at the recent trends and the economic impact that conflicts are having this is an issue of great concern and we are discussing with country authorities how best we can minimize their diversion of resources away from much needed development spending another example of the kind of shocks that policymakers have to contend with of course are weather related shocks as you know cyclone idai has a devastating impact in southeast africa leading to the significant loss of life and damage we are doing everything we can to support the countries that have been affected just to give an example we have moved very rapidly to support mozambique through a rapid credit facility we expect the executive board to consider this request as soon as next week within a month of the hurricane hitting the cyclone hitting mozambique in zimbabwe yesterday we announced a staff monitored program which will support the government s economic policies and we are having extensive dialogue with authorities and then malawi we are in discussions with authorities to provide additional support through the existing ecf arrangement we have with them before i end i would like to stress that sub saharan africa remains a region of tremendous economic potential and while the global environment is increasingly uncertain there is much that the countries are doing and can do to sustain very high rates of growth which we are certain will translate into continued improvements and development outcomes i will now turn to raising any questions you have and i m going to a copy of the report that we ve just published will be available as you go out outside thank you so much fouda yes let me start here questioner i have two questions related to mozambique you mentioned the credit facility because of the cyclone i wonder if you could tell us how much you are looking at and regarding mozambique some of the civil society organizations have said that mozambique should not pay the debt to credit suisse where some officials were involved in this corrupt dealing for the loans i would like to know what s your opinion about that and also if you can tell us what s your opinion about the battle for the extradition of the former minister of finance manuel chang between the united states and mozambique and on angola if you could tell us what are the main priorities that you would like to see the angolan government implement thank you selassie thank you so the rapid credit facility with mozambique i believe is of the order of 120 million and as i mentioned earlier we are hoping to present this request to the executive board we have sent the request to the executive board and we hope the board will consider it as early as next week with regards to outstanding debt that mozambique has as we have noted sometime back mozambique s debt level had become unsustainable in the wake of the revelation that there was significant borrowing that hadn t been disclosed what we have been calling basically is to find ways for the government to ensure that debt becomes sustainable the government and the dialog they re having with their creditors of course to find ways of ensuring that debt reverts to sustainable levels much in the same way on the question of the judicial inquiry that s going it s beyond my area of competence and cannot comment on angola we have a program with which we are supporting the government s adjustment efforts frankly the program has been off to a very very good start the authorities are making very strong strides towards addressing macroeconomic imbalances that they ve been confronting for the last couple of years we ve been very impressed by the extent and depth of the reforms that they ve been engaged in we think that going forward one of the things that we need to do better we need to strengthen is introducing social protection programs to try and make sure that the adjustment will be progressive and avoid adverse effects on the poor in particular we also are looking forward to completing the reforms that are needed to facilitate much more competition in product markets in angola which inaudible to be closed these kinds of structural reforms we feel will be very important to spur growth so we ll be working on those issues in the coming months fouda yes let me take the one in the middle here and get back to you questioner i have two questions if you look at the report by vera songwe which was the executive secretary of uneca she said for the africa free trade area to succeed african countries should diversify their exports but if you look at the record since 1990 only three countries have succeeded in doing that do you agree that this is a kind of solution that will be working another specific question on ethiopia the imf projected 7 7 percent gdp gross for 2019 but if you look at the country there is internal pollical crisis chaos and growing conflict and uncertainty that erodes business confidence and where do you think the social growth comes from in a situation like this thank you selassie thank you on the afcta so you know one of the striking things as i just noted about intra africa trade is that it tends to be much more in processed goods rather than natural resource exports one reason for this of course is that quite a lot of countries tend to produce similar natural resource exports and you know so they don t need to import them from another african country and will instead export them to the rest of the region but with each other they tend to exchange much more processes goods i think just to give you one example i mean the country i know well uganda you know uganda when it s exporting to rwanda to drc to south sudan tends to export you know building materials bottled water other bottled drinks maize flour that is processed and the like so what the aftca we re very hopeful will do will facilitate avenues for greater diversification more you know wider markets in which countries can produce and export towards so we share the eca s assessment and our report confirms this is one of the dimensions which will be important from the afcta on ethiopia i mean ethiopia has been one of the fastest growing economies in the region over the last many years of course an important driver of this growth has been significant public investment and as i noted earlier you know this investment continues and is spurring growth what we re looking for in economies like ethiopia but also the likes of kenya senegal where public investment and infrastructure has been an important driver to growth is to hand over the reigns of growth from the public investment more towards facilitating private investment and this handover of the reigns of growth is i think the policy priority fouda let me take one question on this side of the room and then i ll get to you guys yes questioner my question is in your climate outlook report you projected that ghana could be the fastest growing economy in africa the concern here is that what s your advice to government to ensure that this growth comes along with creating jobs for the youth and we ve completed the program with the imf what s your advice to government to ensure that we stay on track and maybe in four years or even two years time we don t come back to the fund again for another policy credit inaudible or support or even program thank you selassie so i think the jobs agenda is one not unique to ghana i think all countries in the region but frankly beyond the region also have the challenge of needing to create you know well paying jobs for the job market entrance and of course people wanting to switch jobs so this is a broad agenda what can countries do you know and what can ghana do specifically i think continue to make sure that you invest in human capital i think is very important investing in schools investing in the health of the population i think really continues to be a very important driver you know to have people entering the job markets having the necessary skills the necessary flexibility to be able to do the jobs of the future making sure that you don t have any distortions coming from the public sector in terms of macroeconomic aggregates i think will also be a very important objective again facilitating growth for private investment identifying as i noted earlier tackling the constraints the barriers to private investment will be very important making you know the thousands and thousands of informal companies you know finding ways for those companies to grow and enter into the formal sector removing barriers removing the burdens that they face in growing access to credit all of those kind of micro reforms are going to be very important for the job s agenda in making sure that this growth is labor intensive enough and absorbing enough you know and creating enough jobs on post imf program policies in ghana i mean you know we ve seen a significant improvement you know in narrowing of the macroeconomic imbalances that was confronting the ghanaian economy in 2014 15 i think staying on this course will be what is important making sure that fiscal deficits remain manageable making sure that the resources that are being borrowed continue to be used on projects of the highest rates of return making sure that the calibration of monetary policy remains one that s consistent with keeping inflation at bay the exchange rate at competitive levels you know the kind of things that the government has been pursuing over the last couple of years and staying that course is what is important i think you know you have policy makers that know that very well we like the reforms that have been made to strengthen institutions the new fiscal counsel that s coming into being so making sure that these institutions remain robust effective and policies are continuing in the direction that they ve been in the last couple of years fouda let s go to this side of the room gentleman in the first row please questioner nigeria and i believe several other african countries have had to suffer because of the outflow of illicit funds i want to know what kind of commitment can we have from the imf in the effort to repatriate some of these funds thank you selassie so just to very clear i think the front and center role of course for making sure that economic policies are appropriate limiting and narrowing the scope for such illicit outflows remains the task for policy makers in our countries from the imf side we of course provide a lot of policy advice and more recently we ve also introduced governance and corruption because that s what help improve governments and tackle corruption should the government be interested of course we have advice on how to strengthen public finance management frameworks how to strengthen accountability institutions that we can offer and work with the government overall i would say that you know over the last couple of years this is an area where we ve president buhari s administration placing quite a bit of emphasis and continue to strengthen this because i think the task facing nigeria fouda lady in the middle over there please questioner i just wanted to know your overall assessment of the gambia knowing that the country is trying to recover after a slow down in 2016 and it also went through a political impasse most of you know in that year so a lot of things have changed including the government and so we do know that the government is trying to really re strategize its policy and the imf also advised that we to revisit their fiscal policies just so growth is stable and that is sustainable and so we ve also seen that the government has taken more than half of its revenue to solving debt and we ve also seen a rising taxation especially in certain revenue generating avenues also on the private sector so just wanted to know your overall assessment of the country in the coming years thank you selassie thank you so gambia of course has been going through a fairly difficult political transition it has been a period of quite a bit of uncertainty and you know after a very long period where there was very limited transparency in public accounts we ve moved to a period where there is a bit more transparency there and we re happy to be supporting the government s reform efforts through a staff monitored program we just agreed on a second staff monitored program recently with the government and we hope that this will transition into us being able to provide financing going forward one constraint in our ability to provide financing has indeed been the need to make sure that there is a fiscal path which strikes a healthy balance between continuing to make resources available for investment and health and education and infrastructure that the country needs much versus avoiding an unsustainable debt situation i think very encouraging progress on this front in recent and you know we hope to help the government continue to strike this healthy balance in the coming weeks fouda let me get the lady in white here please questioner i want to ask you about two portuguese speaking countries in africa in the first place angola which has an extended fund facility agreed with the imf how is it going also angola had the visit of imf mission very recently and they were going to continue the works here in washington and the second question is about guinea bissau also overall assessment about this country which is an underdeveloped country and very poor and we will have legislative elections what is your overview for the next coming months for guinea bissau selassie so with respect to angola as i mentioned earlier we ve an extended front facility since last year which there are compressive reforms being pursued angola is at an inflection point in terms of the economic policy environment they have been really hit very very hard by the decline in commodity prices of course and have been adjusting to that over the last couple of years the first set of adjustments the country has been doing really has been more by way of compressing spending rather than a more systematic way of doing their policy reforms so the work of the program under the aff the reform program that the aff is supporting government program is trying to put a more orderly fiscal adjustment in place also facilitate for their reforms in the monetary and exchange rate area and also a lot of inaudible reforms we are pleased with the progress that has been made so far and you know we are encouraged with the progress that has been made so far and we hope that that will continue in the coming months with guinea bissau as you noted this country which we have been supporting with the program its fragile economy faces a lot deeper developmental challenges we continue to have dialogues with the government including improving the health of the financial sector which we think is a very important policy priority at the moment and we will continue to work with them in the coming months also fouda yes let s take first row here questioner the trump administration is one in that the chinese investment in africa while is good for infrastructure is also can turn out to become death trap and a inaudible takeover we have cases in sri lanka especially because the loans from china end up in the hands of very corrupt government unaccountable government how big a threat is the chinese investment and expansion in africa and finally yesterday the new inaudible president the alarming statistic about africa he said by 2030 nine out of ten extremely poor people in the world will be africans which is bit surprising seeing all the poor in asia and in the u s and in europe is the imf seeing the same thing and finally in terms of statistics we see the imf has 3 5 projection this year and the world bank has a different statistics how does it work why do you have different statistics how do you get to it selassie okay a lot of questions there first on the debt issue as i flagged earlier you know in some countries i think it s important to know that you know with many policy challenges and particularly for the region as diverse as inaudible africa it is very important to consider them in a country specific context so the reason why debt has gone up defers from country to country and the sources of financing also tend to be country specific our advice of course always is to make sure that countries are inaudible a healthy balance between on the one hand continue to address their development objectives and second avoiding the sustainability concerns in some cases of course these kind of debt problems can arise from borrowing from bilateral creditors but in other cases it comes from borrowing from commercial banks somebody asked me a question about inaudible not so long ago right the issue with debt sustainability had arisen on the context of borrowing from commercial banks that are hidden in that case so the issue of debt transparency is not unique to china but also to all borrowing that our countries are undertaking and what s important again is making sure that total borrowing levels remain consistent with debt servicing capacity failing to do that of course is very problematic on the outlook for the region in terms of addressing poverty rates you know of course this is exactly why we have this dialogue at these meetings with policymakers you know the brunt of our work is to make sure that the region continues to grow as robustly as possible to create the millions of jobs that our economies need to avoid you know wore outcomes particularly given the demographic challenges that the region faces so this is exactly what policymakers institutions like the imf world bank are all engaged in to make sure that we can facilitate help economies grow as robustly as possible to reduce existing poverty and avoid poverty levels deteriorating any further so your last question was on i m not sure what discrepancy your talking about frankly yeah i mean you know the last numbers i saw from the world bank for inaudible africa was 3 6 ours are 3 5 the composition between the two institutions differ slightly you know one or two countries more there than here so those kind of things or the timing when projections were made often account for any marginal differences that there are fouda let s take the question here please questioner i am going to speak french question on cemac selassie you know in my opening remarks i noted about the impacts that the commodity price decline has had on some of the regions commodity exporters five out of the six cemac countries of course are oil producers and they have been hit very very hard by the decline in oil prices that we saw in 2014 to 16 we are working with the countries to try and avert you know we moved very quickly to help countries avert a crisis and you know we have programs that we are supporting the authorities endeavors with as you noted four out of the six countries we have programs with that is cameroon gabon c a r and chad and the efforts that countries have been making these four countries but also the reforms that the bank has been pursuing and as well as really some efforts that republic of congo and the inaudible of guinea have done what those have done is to stabilize the levels of foreign exchange in the region and strengthen fiscal deficits narrow fiscal deficits this still remains quite a lot to do in terms of reforming the business environment in countries to spur growth and the emphasis of our work and dialogue with authorizes has now shifted a little bit more towards making sure that we have a business environment that is more conducive to private investment so that s where we rare in the dialogue under the programs if authorities want further engagement with imf we are of course always ready to listen and see what we can do fouda any questions on this side of the let s start in the back with the lady please questioner i would like to take just a couple of questions now you talked about creating jobs for the growing population of youth and we have that scenario in nigeria where a lot of people are graduating with no jobs waiting for them so in line with the ergp of the government have you seen that impacting and creating jobs and what is your general assessment of each so far from the annual meetings till now then i would also want to know the position of the imf in terms of regional conflict as it affects development we have seen clashes between the farmers the headers and it s not now not just restricted to nigeria it is moving into neighboring countries we have also had that some of these people move across border so really what is the impact to economic development in these countries having this peculiar crisis thank you selassie okay on economic reforms again i think it is really important to see to first of all like recognize how deep the shock that the nigerian economy was hit by when commodity prices declined you know from or the oil prices declined from 100 or more that was prevailing before 2014 to where there at right now that has been a very severe shock and has had a tremendous impact on the economy there has been adjustment to that shock of course in some cases it is still ongoing but we think that you know the focus now has to shift and this is where i think the ergp was strong in terms of diversifying the economy we welcome the efforts the government has been making to improve you know to tackle corruption to improve governance in the country we very much welcome the emphasis on public investment what remains we think in terms of priorities going forward really is trying to make sure that government regenerates more resources that it can use to invest in health in education in further infrastructure so tackling the revenue side of the equation is really what is really important nigeria has a fairly low level of revenue to gdp ratio i think moving forward in the coming months and years to address that will be very important and i think you know that investment in infrastructure investment in health and education is exactly the kind of investment the government needs to make to facilitate more private sector growth tackling other constraints on private sector to create the millions of jobs that nigeria needs on conflict you know i think it is a very timely question the regional economic outlook that we just put out has a chapter really looking at the impact of conflict on the region on countries on economic outcomes so i urge you to look at that it s to you know suffice it to say that of course in the region the level of conflict remains much much lower in sub saharan africa as a whole the level of conflict remains much lower than it used to be but we have seen an uptick in violence in the sahel region in particular but also in the lake chad basin countries frankly what is needed of course is addressing directly those the conflicts and minimizing the spill overs that they re having on the populations but also it points to the need for our development policies to be much more inclusive to try and address the poorest parts of our countries the development challenges that face the poorest parts of our countries fouda let s take another question here and we will take one last in the back quickly please questioner thank you my question is actually a follow up to the one my brother tibad asked concerning the frightening prediction about poverty indication in africa in the next 10 to 11 years so the question is the addition to the question actually is if the african department of imf is actually doing something to for instance as for debt inaudible for african states in this period and whether there is also reforms in the ways you are create this being giving and inaudible for instance inaudible did not believe in africa that when imf world bank provides a loan they create employment for their people with which the credit is used to finance whereas living challenges and indebtedness for the people at the end of it so the africans are inaudible alone to finance to create employment for developing economies what is the african department of imf really doing to see that there is a change in this so that monies for african countries can really work for them and add to our value thank you selassie so look the imf s contribution to the work of policy makers in the region is not confined just to financing if anything you know by far the most important contribution we make is providing policy advice yes to the region and we of course have policy dialogue with all 45 member countries of you know sub saharan african countries on exactly the points that you made how can governments how can policy makers how can societies quite frankly it s not just governments that are responsible but broader stakeholders including parliaments private sector cso s ngo s what are the challenges and what is the best way to address them the our advice is country specific and revolve around you know for example on effective use of public resources you know what is the best way of having a public finance management framework what is the appropriate level of deficit governments can pursue to strike a healthy balance been on the one hand continuing to address development needs second avoiding debt public investment management is an area where we do quite a lot of work you know how to prioritize how to select the right type of projects so i think you know the contribution we make in countries like nigeria is exactly in that area you know providing the policy advice because we don t have a lending program for example so that s how we help in other countries still you know we come in to support governments with the resources borrowing i think the inaudible example that the gentleman earlier raised as an example in this case the countries were hit very hard by the decline in commodity prices they lost fiscal revenue they lost external revenue so we provided financing to help them continue to spend support investments in health and education again in these countries also we do quite a lot of work on the public finance issues i noted earlier but also helping them strengthen the governance and governor s frameworks tackling corruption making sure there is more transparency in public accounts so this is the contribution that we are making fouda last question in the back please questioner ghana has just completed the financial sector pre nup that we are told that is going to assure a solid financial system now the question is how do you think this will impact one on the financial system of the country two to ensure growth because we are already seeing some job losses in the inaudible thank you selassie okay so you know a healthy financial sector really is paramount in all our economies particularly in an economy like ghana which is a frontier market economy moving toward emerging market status financial sector which is healthy which is vibrant which provides financing for private sector and above all is healthy is really very important you know if you want to think about it the other way you know we have seen the kind of damage that banks failing banks and financial sectors failing can have globally we just have to look back to the global financial crisis and the turmoil it s caused in countries such as the united states and many european countries so it s you know i cannot stress enough how important having a healthy financial sector is you know banks that are robustly capitalized can you know are a source of strength for an economy and so that s been the broad direction in which the financial sector clean up in ghana has been going in where it has entailed some job losses of course finding ways to minimize those will be important but i think that tends to be very bank specific issues for the broader economy at large i think that the work that the government has been doing is very encouraging and it needs to continue going forward thank you fouda thank you so very much mr aemro selassie thank you guys for coming we will see you again in october i guess thank you
the sanctions just keep on coming the reactions were swift when the trump administration designated iran s islamic revolutionary guard corps as a foreign terrorist organization in a move heralded by the white house as the first time that the united states has ever named a part of another government as a fto in tehran leaders from across iran s political spectrum condemned the designation with nearly all members of parliament showing solidarity by attending the next day s session in combat fatigues in washington experts saw the designation as a risky political provocation that would do little to add meaningful pressure to iran a country already targeted by dozens of executive orders and pieces of legislation such as the 2010 comprehensive iran sanctions accountability and divestment act and the 2017 countering america s adversaries through sanctions act the sanctions just keep on coming the reactions were swift when the trump administration designated iran s islamic revolutionary guard corps as a foreign terrorist organization in a move heralded by the white house as the first time that the united states has ever named a part of another government as a fto in tehran leaders from across iran s political spectrum condemned the designation with nearly all members of parliament showing solidarity by attending the next day s session in combat fatigues in washington experts

the 2010 comprehensive iran sanctions accountability and divestment act and the 2017 countering america s adversaries through sanctions act but these objections have largely overlooked the underlying logic of adding designations despite limited gains in economic pressure a vast institutional legal and surveillance infrastructure now exists that is devoted to the maintenance of economic sanctions today sanctions proponents are actively seeking to apply new restrictions in ways that make the eventual lifting of sanctions more difficult in part to preserve the emergent sanctions industrial complex a network of government agencies law firms technology providers and think tanks with a vested interest in the unceasing expansion of sanctions programs the think tank leader mark dubowitz who was among the most vocal proponents of the foreign terrorist organization designation has called for the trump administration to impose sanctions on iran in such a way as to make it politically toxic and legally cumbersome for a potential democratic president to reenter the iran nuclear deal in 2021 in this way america s financial wars now risk becoming the new forever wars for those committed to the use of sanctions as a tool of coercive diplomacy the important question is no longer how sanctions should be targeted it is whether effective relief is possible when changing political circumstances require the lifting of sanctions the term sanctions relief is odd because unlike relief from natural disasters it aims to counteract the outcome of deliberately chosen policies sanctions relief also appears too feeble a response to sanctions programs increasingly conceived as a means to wage financial war when conflicts end and policies shift from coercion to cooperation lifting sanctions in an effective way requires going beyond mere relief as the effects of economic pressure accumulate efforts toward reconstruction and not merely relief must follow the legal lifting of sanctions only by taking active measures to return the targeted economies to sustainable growth and well being can the benefits of sanctions relief become more credible this in turn would give diplomats increased leverage at the negotiating table unfortunately european and u s policymakers currently lack adequate harm reduction tools as recent events in iran and sudan demonstrate iran s trajectory in the last three years illustrates how even avid users of sanctions such as the u s government often lack the means to effectively lift them a shortcoming that can have grave effects on international politics on jan 16 2016 the united states implemented broad sanctions relief in exchange for tighter controls over iran s nuclear program as part of the nuclear deal with tehran the text of the agreement noted that the deal was meant to produce the comprehensive lifting of all un security council sanctions as well as multilateral and national sanctions related to iran s nuclear programme including steps on access in areas of trade technology finance and energy but while the obama administration lifted sanctions as a legal fact the benefits of relief to iran largely failed to materialize in the words of then treasury secretary jack lew the obama administration relied on little more than global outreach to help governments and businesses understand the sanctions relief provided u s officials had no experience in lifting such a broad sanctions program they were blindsided by the discovery that a decade of strict sanctions enforcement had fundamentally altered the risk assessment of major companies and financial institutions expected to resume commercial activity in iran no one wanted to go near the country regardless of what washington said in an infamous london meeting in may 2016 then u s secretary of state john kerry met with bank compliance officers to clarify the status of u s sanctions against tehran and encourage their financial institutions to resume iran related transactions but almost a decade of sanctions enforced with billion dollar fines had made many banks steer completely clear of iran bank compliance officers quickly determined that the marginal revenue potential presented by iran was not worth the increased scrutiny from regulators and shareholders especially given the precarious political commitment that underpinned the lifting of sanctions hsbc s chief legal officer stuart levey formerly an undersecretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence from 2004 to 2011 ridiculed kerry in an op ed noting that no assurances were provided as to how would subsequently be viewed by u s regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the event of a change of administration exactly the situation that transpired when president donald trump took office less than a year later even while former president barack obama remained in office the reluctance of banks and lingering sanctions stigma throttled iran s ability to attract much needed foreign investment in a december 2017 to january 2018 survey conducted by bourse bazaar and commissioned by international crisis group 83 percent of senior managers at multinational companies active in iran indicated that their companies were moving slower than they could to the iranian market attributing the slowdown to concerns regarding u s sanctions and the related difficulty in securing banking services by the time the trump administration was preparing to withdraw from the nuclear deal in early 2018 some opponents of the agreement were even arguing that trump should stay in it and avoid a political spat with european allies on the grounds that iran was receiving little economic benefit from the deal trump finally withdrew in may 2018 and has initiated a new so called maximum pressure campaign against tehran this move forced the european signatories to the nuclear deal to scramble to preserve some economic benefit for iran france germany and the united kingdom established instex a state owned trade intermediary the mechanism aims to coordinate payments so european exporters can get paid for their sales to iranian importers from money already in europe balanced with the payments owed by european importers for purchases made from iranian exporters the instex project is an example of how europe is now grappling with a new challenge of sanctions relief how to ensure economic benefits can be delivered to deserving countries in the face of secondary sanctions from a third party country meanwhile iranian president hassan rouhani has been weakened with domestic rivals pointing to the deteriorating economic situation as evidence of both his mismanagement and the error of engaging in diplomatic negotiations with the west iran s embittering experience with sanctions relief may have poisoned the well for future diplomatic negotiations over the country s nuclear program iran is not the only country where failure to improve sanctions relief has contributed to political crisis in sudan too the heedless way in which sanctions ended has destabilized domestic politics after most of the economic sanctions imposed against khartoum in the late 1990s were lifted in october 2017 there have been few material gains for sudanese society as nesrine malik wrote in foreign policy last year two decades of u s sanctions transformed the structure of the sudanese economy the country s isolation spawned an unofficial banking sector disconnected from global finance ending sanctions amounted to a shock form of globalization for sudan after the reopening of trade a major economic crisis gripped the dollar dependent country as inflation rose to 64 percent imports and government revenues fell and the sudanese pound lost 86 percent of its value in 10 months as in iran the failure of western policymakers to reframe discourse about sudan meant that foreign companies did not return to the country drying up foreign investments without a reorientation of diplomatic efforts the reputational effects of sanctions persisted as malik wrote for sudan the sanctions tail the aggregate result of years of economic pressure is proving to be an insurmountable challenge the sudan specialist alden young has pointed out that over time sanctions made sudan more dependent on u s dollars as access to this hard currency became one of the only ways of accessing world markets after they were lifted khartoum faced a lack of dollar reserves foreign direct investment inflows and export markets the government s decision to cut food and fuel subsidies in early 2018 massively increased existing discontent with president omar al bashir s dictatorship and produced mass protests in december the government embarked on a campaign of repression and deflection imprisoning and abusing thousands of protesters while edging closer to direct military rule ultimately it failed to quash the protests bashir s ousting by the military last week is to be welcomed even if it is unclear what a power transition overseen by the military will mean for the country lifting the u s sanctions on sudan was of course the right thing to do they had not worked for two decades and observers agree that they merely strengthened the sudanese regime but hardly anyone anticipated the consequences of lifting them so rapidly and the way in which the measures were removed harmed sudan s economy and society despite bashir s departure the material legacy of economic sanctions will require attention if sudan is to overcome his 30 year reign the economic chaos in sudan could have been averted if sanctions relief had involved more than just national security and foreign policy elites it was entirely foreseeable that without external support structural adjustment policies would impose further costs on the sudanese population strong external financial support was needed immediately in the form of hard currency loans and swap arrangements between central banks more broadly development specialists have to be involved in assisting with reentry into global markets while humanitarian organizations are needed to ensure a stable food supply similar efforts would have also helped address domestic political and economic pressures in iran after the nuclear deal the cases of iran and sudan clearly demonstrate that more proactive and comprehensive approaches to so called sanctions relief must be devised such approaches must anticipate the international and domestic political effects of lifting restrictions addressing this problem is an acute challenge as the trump administration threatens a more expansive program of sanctions on russia and venezuela and is expanding the targeting of specific companies worldwide even sanctions advocates should reflect on the positive effects of lifting many of the restrictions currently in place for a simple reason the overgrowth of sanctions weighs on the world economy so heavily that it destroys any incentive structure for u s adversaries to comply under the current conditions new economic sanctions serve to antagonize allies and rivals alike reimposing sanctions on iran has strained trans atlantic relations overuse of sanctions accelerates the collapse of u s international authority it also spurs national efforts to escape u s controlled networks of globalization to prevent such outcomes a new reconstruction approach to sanctions relief must be developed with interventions for the short medium and long term the immediate short term benefits of sanctions relief would be stronger with the provision of emergency finance in the form of multilateral loans ideally provided by a dedicated international financial institution special loans would also help investors price risk in the new market and reduce the stigma of reestablishing transactions with target countries lending has the inherent advantage of serving to commit the providing countries to the long term implementation of sanctions relief lest they forfeit the debt an even quicker support mechanism could come from swap lines between central banks such as those established by the u s federal reserve during the 2008 global financial crisis swap lines allow central banks to trade national currencies that they control against prevailing exchange rates through swap arrangements the united states could dole out much needed foreign exchange reserves to offset a post sanctions run on the local currency as happened in sudan the local currency pledged to the fed in exchange would then serve as a form of payment for imports from the united states the creation of international trade intermediaries such as instex can help bilateral trade recover more quickly even as banking channels between new trading partners remain limited such measures would help deliver the tangible economic benefits necessary to foster political support in the targeted country for the continued implementation of diplomatic agreements rouhani has seen his popularity fall dramatically as iranians came to realize that the economic recovery he had promised would not materialize medium term sanctions relief must include the provision of development expertise to help strengthen institutions and increase economic well being economic sanctions degrade government institutions and the business environment and they exacerbate mismanagement corruption and income and wealth inequality technology transfers and technical assistance could counteract these problems and remedy sanctions related achievement gaps development economists and nongovernmental organizations are better equipped than national security elites to analyze the harmful path dependencies caused by sanctions and propose effective remedies finally alleviating the long term negative impact of sanctions should include commitments to help remediate environmental damage a growing body of research has made clear that the environmental costs incurred by economies under sanctions can be debilitating for generations with the exhaustion of groundwater supplies and the depletion of biomass and soil erosion economic isolation has encouraged very harmful forms of land and energy use leaving such biosphere destruction unaddressed is irresponsible in a world increasingly gripped by catastrophic climate change together these interventions over the short medium and long term can be melded into a single cohesive program of sanctions reconstruction the need for expansive relief efforts in the aftermath of military conflict is widely recognized similar efforts should likewise become routine after a financial and economic war by presenting such a package western governments will gain at the negotiating table better relief makes the promise of lifting sanctions more credible and more valuable increasing the potential to obtain concessions and establish durable agreements the current trend toward the ossification and retrenchment of sanctions regimes is inflicting enormous damage on both the countries targeted and on the international community when sanctions end so must their harms there is no better way to do this than to counterbalance the damage of deprivation with the power of provision

washington in the aftermath of last week s world bank s spring meeting liberia s international partners are reportedly expressing private concerns about the deterioration in the liberian economy with blame put on the government for exacerbating already dire economic circumstances the weah administration is continuing its loosened fiscal stance by spending more money than revenues collected tens of millions of dollars have been borrowed from the central bank of liberia cbl with slow or non payment from the government despite warnings from the imf in their last article iv consultation in march the government continues to spend more money than it collects funds from development partners including the world bank and the norwegian government were reportedly used to pay some government s recurrent expenditure sources say problems with the norwegian funds predate the weah administration and delays in implementation of projects with the norwegian support to the forestry sector has been stymied by the slowness in granting of land when liberian officials were confronted according to international sources on use of road construction funding for recurrent expenditure they said paying civil servants salary was more important than development since not paying salaries would impact the country s stability and cause further economic decline the country s economic planners have put most of their efforts into paying the huge monthly wage bill estimated now to reach about 30 million dollars the government still has not found a way to expand the private sector to absorb the horde of young unemployed people international partners are very worried about the large amount of liberian dollars out of the banking system with estimates ranging from 20 25 billion dollars while only 1 2 billion dollars are in the banks despite banks showing capital adequacy with most of their assets in loans to the private sector yet there is operational illiquidity with banks having challenges to pay customers resulting into delays small amounts like 5 000 are split up and customers are routinely told to make two or three trips to fulfil their withdrawals or encashment of checks wage bill expanding the public wage bill has expanded to 72 percent of recurrent expenditure with estimates of at least 25 thousand new employees added by bypassing the normal civil service procedures over the past 15 months since the weah administration was inaugurated liberia lost ranking in the 2019 world bank doing business survey with the country now 174 out of 190 countries liberia was 172 in the 2018 rankings that would make liberia the 16th worst place on the planet to do business the current survey period ends may 1 and liberia so far looks bad with the ranking coming out in october the country could go further down liberia is being obstructed by difficulties in economic governance fiscal stance corruption and burdensome regulations such as payment of the widely unpopular container tracking fee national port authority officials told foreign partners the fee is necessary as shipping companies charge the same without any of the funds coming to government if liberia loses its ranking further it will send a bad signal to investors liberia is reversing the gains it made early on in the ellen johnson sirleaf administration on the ease of doing business while two west african countries togo and la cote d ivoire were among the top ten improvers in 2019 according to the world bank doing survey published in october of 2018 the ranking comes out yearly in october 2020 figures will come out in october of this year representing data from 2019 meanwhile rwanda continues to keep its ranking in the top ten of improvers quite recently the weah administration used heavy handed tactics in dealing with some members and officials of the liberia chamber of commerce who had expressed their dissatisfaction with the imposition of the dreaded container tracking payment marwan eid vice president at city builder son of ezzat eid owner of royal hotel and the city builder chain was reportedly placed on a prisoner bench at nsa for hours and released in the evening liberia declining economy presents serious political problems for the weah administration that situation is increasingly becoming worrisome to development partners who see signs of decay in the body polity with a demonstration planned on june 7 by disaffected citizens and counter protests by supporters of the government on the same day with potentially very dangerous outcomes the protests are reportedly being planned to denounce corruption fiscal irresponsibility and the still outstanding matter of the us 25 million dollar mop up money which was supposedly being audited by the gac whose two week mandate has long expired demonstrators plan to ask president weah to dismiss minister samuel tweah and have him prosecuted for squandering monies that came out of the cbl reserves at the federal reserve bank in new york in a video making the rounds on social media liberian market women decry the hardship they face in the country due to rising prices and joblessness of their husbands one woman on tape was heard that she is wearing the pants in the family as her husband has been unable to find employment a situation that many families face with vulnerable employment portion of the workforce in the informal sector now more than 80 percent according to the 2016 household income and expenditure survey hies over 50 9 percent of liberians are considered poor with liberia now considered the poorest country in the world according to usa today a leading american daily publication gleaning data from the world bank with the country s annual per capita gni at only 710 usd net foreign exchange reserve put at 19m adding to the dilemma multiple sources from the central bank of liberia have confided to frontpageafrica that liberia s net foreign exchange reserve is now 19m united states dollars a steep decline of us 135 8m from december 2017 towards the tail end of the ellen johnson sirleaf administration according to the cbl annual report of 2006 net reserves of the cbl at the end december 2006 was us 21 8 million compared with us 6 5 million at end of december 2005 this means as of january 2006 the sirleaf administration inherited a net reserve position of only 6 5m usd and through a combination of different economic measures built the net reserve to us 154 8m as reported by the central bank in its 2017 annual report that shows balances as of the end of december 2017 like other central banks around the world the central bank of liberia is the custodian and manager of liberia s foreign reserves foreign reserves include foreign currency assets special drawing rights and other assets of governments the benefits associated with high foreign exchange reserves are enormous whilst the reverse is true for the disadvantages first countries use their foreign exchange reserves to keep the value of their currencies at a fixed rate a strong reserve position helps with exchange rate stability something liberia badly needs foreign exchange reserves also help to maintain liquidity in case of an economic crisis foreign reserves can be used by countries to stabilize their currencies especially during financial crisis when foreign fund outflows increase as it is currently in the case of liberia with a solid reserve position the cbl could keep the market steady this of course serves as a reassuring platform for foreign direct investment a good reserve position provides confidence the central bank assures foreign investors that it s ready to take action to protect their investments it will also prevent a sudden flight to safety and loss of capital for the country in that way a strong position in foreign currency reserves can prevent economic crises caused when an event triggers a flight to safety with all these advantages it is clear that liberia needs to adopt strong mechanisms ensuring that our reserve position is strong this news of the country s net reserve placed at19m usd is definitely that a positive news for investment and the current economic woes it can be recalled that it is out of this very reserve the weah government recently utilized when it announced a usd25m stimulus package for the sole purpose of mopping up excess liquidity from the market

modi s saffron democracy modi s saffron democracy india may grant narendra modi another chance to embody its aspirations and fears but his classic populist gambit cannot hide a plain truth the good days he promised have still not arrived prime minister narendra modi at an event promoting a cash subsidy program for small farms in february arijit sen hindustan times via getty images in may 2014 narendra modi became india s fourteenth prime minister since independence storming to power after a charged electoral campaign the strongman from gujarat represented a political earthquake under his leadership the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party bjp was the first party to win a parliamentary majority since 1984 ending a quarter century of national coalition governments in new delhi it also became the only party apart from the indian national congress known simply as the congress which had traditionally ruled the country under the direction of the nehru gandhi dynasty to win a mandate on its own roughly 66 percent of the electorate the highest share ever voted in the 2014 general election voter participation increased in virtually every state and across diverse segments of the population including historically marginalized communities of dalits and adivasis and especially women the stunning triumph of the bjp heralded a new political order in the world s largest democracy before the verdict the vast majority of observers had expected another hung parliament and diverse coalition government controversy had dogged modi a longtime pracharak of the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh rss the parent organization of the family of hindu nationalist groups including the bjp called the sangh parivar in 2002 modi had failed to prevent an anti muslim pogrom that left over 1 000 people dead shortly after becoming chief minister of gujarat the so called laboratory of hindutva hindu cultural nationalism there was sufficient evidence of his administration s involvement for the united states to deny modi a visa in 2005 yet the chief minister while denying responsibility never showed remorse for what happened modi accused critics of insulting gujarati pride a protracted investigation by a supreme court appointed committee eventually cleared him of personal responsibility in 2012 the following year the bjp named modi as their candidate for prime minister in the 2014 elections many within the party and the rss which prized collective decision making remained wary of empowering him but modi ruthlessly sidelined potential rivals and the rapidly aging bjp old guard in public opposition parties decried his candidacy in private many rejoiced that it would prevent the bjp from recapturing national power but the weaknesses of the congress led united progressive alliance upa which governed from 2004 to 2014 provided an opening the upa had achieved the highest rate of economic growth in india since independence the governing coalition liberalized many sectors of the economy and oversaw substantial increases in savings and investment in the public and private sectors as well as rising trade it also introduced landmark welfare legislation granting the right to many socioeconomic entitlements but persistent ideological differences within its leadership neglect of underlying structural problems and a series of events badly damaged the upa during its second term major public scandals involving the allocation of contracts to favored business groups galvanized the india against corruption movement led by the gandhian activist anna hazare yet the congress failed to act decisively against individual ministers accused of corruption opposition parties often led by the bjp obstructed parliament senior bureaucrats stopped taking potentially sensitive decisions a sense of paralysis fueled by aggressive media coverage declining private investment and adverse global conditions induced a rapid economic deceleration modi a charismatic politician with a keen sense of historical opportunity seized the moment embracing his claim to being a humble chaiwala tea seller from a plebian backward caste modi mocked the shazhada prince rahul gandhi the presumptive heir to the congress flaunting his fifty six inch chest he scorned the outgoing prime minister as maun mohan singh promising to eliminate political corruption and to stand up to pakistani cross border aggression as chief minister of gujarat a relatively industrialized state modi also projected the image of a development man tapping into the frustrations and aspirations of millions of people for decent work and social mobility he vowed to turn india into a manufacturing powerhouse and create good jobs for the millions of young people entering the national labor force every year in gujarat modi had hosted a series of conclaves to court big business with tax breaks cheap land and reliable infrastructural facilities during his prime ministerial campaign money flowed into the coffers of the bjp from industrial titans keen to elect an openly pro business government in new delhi reportedly the party spent nearly 1 billion during the campaign recruiting high level it professionals and tens of thousands of volunteers and many paid campaigners harnessing old media advertising companies expertise and new social media platforms they saturated the public sphere with images of modi including simultaneously broadcast holograms of him giving speeches across the country in the end the bjp captured 31 percent of the national vote and 282 seats in the lok sabha the lower house of parliament cementing its leadership of a multi party coalition named the national democratic alliance nda the congress won 19 percent of the vote and 44 seats its worst performance ever the stunning reversal of fortunes reflected the disproportional logic of india s electoral system which like the united states and the united kingdom is first past the post the bjp s vote share was conspicuously low in historical perspective but the party achieved stunning victories in traditional regional strongholds in the north and west where it either dominated or swept the opposition and significant gains in the south and east where it had previously failed to penetrate moreover the bjp had mobilized an unprecedented social coalition the party consolidated its traditional high caste upper class urban base but also won a plurality of votes among other backward castes and rising support from dalits and adivasis especially among middle class sections in semi urban zones constituencies that saw a higher turnout of young voters individuals under twenty five years old constituted an astonishing 50 percent of the population disproportionately voted bjp because of modi triumphant the new prime minister proclaimed victory to india good days are coming concentrating and personalizing power since attaining power modi has assiduously pursued the populist plebiscitary and presidential style of rule that marked his campaign for office while politicians and parties across the spectrum have long tried to constrain the autonomy of state institutions by appointing partisan administrators few displayed the bjp s desire and capacity to capture entire institutional domains after a quarter century of coalition governments which increased the clout of the president parliamentary committees election commissioners comptroller and auditor generals supreme court justices and the media the bjp led government has recentralized political authority modi and a small circle of advisers dictate the tempo and direction of the government they have disciplined the prime minister s offices everyday operations and political messaging while undermining collegial responsibility and cabinet autonomy few ministers have much sway the various parties that comprise the nda which formally rules have even less most observers simply refer to modi sarkar underlining its personalization of power if allies in the nda feel disempowered opposition parties confront a far greater threat the new ruling dispensation views electoral rivals and partisan opponents as permanent enemies to be destroyed modi vowed to usher in a congress mukt free india the bjp rejected the congress s claim to be the official leader of the opposition as the second largest party in the lok sabha on grounds that its forty four seats constituted less than 10 percent of the total the prime minister rarely subjects himself to questioning in parliament this unwillingness to face criticism extends to the media modi grants very few interviews most are highly scripted affairs with carefully selected journalists press conferences a routine affair in previous administrations rarely occur modi often derides journalists as news traders except for channels such as zee tv and republic tv which are essentially mouthpieces for the government bjp party colleagues have stooped lower calling them presstitutes modi prefers direct communication via new digital media with his legions of followers to date more than 22 000 messages have been sent on his twitter handle which boasts more than 45 million subscribers he also gives a monthly radio address mann ki baat and uses the namo narendra modi app to deliver the latest updates directly to his followers phones some traditional newspapers and media houses along with new digital outlets have investigated the government more assiduously yet critical scrutiny has led to behind the scene interventions in some cases including the dismissal of editors that failed to toe the line in other cases bureaucratic harassment and police raids for ostensible lapses in tax payments and other administrative matters have made life difficult a vast swath of private media in india afflicted by paid news scandals in recent years and beholden to corporate houses for advertising revenue has been compromised for some time yet the climate of fear and threat of reprisal today is far more ominous encouraging many to self censor the supreme court has provided some checks on the current government its expansive constitutional remit makes it one of the most powerful judiciaries in the world yet the structure of the court whose thirty one judges sit on benches of various sizes depending on the significance of a case and who must retire by sixty five also creates a fluid polyphony of voices in late 2015 a constitutional bench of the court appointed to interpret fundamental law rebuffed legislation designed to grant the executive far greater power in selecting higher justices it also quashed the government s efforts in 2016 to impose direct rule in two smaller states and in the summer of 2017 another constitutional bench unanimously declared that privacy was a fundamental right a landmark judgment with ramifications for many social questions yet the supreme court has also issued controversial rulings a 2016 order made it mandatory for individuals to stand for the national anthem in cinema halls another bench eventually overruled the order but the incident exposed the court s susceptibility to rising nationalist fervor prospective and active justices who had crossed the bjp found their nominations scuttled or posts transferred intimating behind the scenes interference most explosively in early 2018 the four most senior judges of the supreme court publicly accused the chief justice of fixing the composition of benches in sensitive cases presumably to favor the executive since then the prime minister s office has delayed the appointment of justices and allowed a staggering case backlog in the higher judiciary to worsen the overriding factor enabling executive overreach is the remarkable march of the bjp in state level elections which has transformed the map of india s federal democracy in 2014 the party controlled just seven of the thirty six states and union territories in india by the spring of 2018 either by itself or with its allies the party had won control of twenty one states which comprised roughly 70 percent of india s total population the congress governed just four the sources of the bjp s newfound electoral prowess are twofold first modi remains by far the most charismatic politician in the country the only true mass leader on a national scale he possesses remarkable personal energy and self discipline an ability to rally massive crowds and exploit popular aspirations as well as elite resentment through a mastery of hindi and the courage to address difficult public issues and no indian prime minister not even nehru has visited so many countries in a single parliamentary term second the installation of amit shah an old colleague of modi s from gujarat as president of the bjp has turned the party into an electoral machine party membership has increased dramatically with some estimates at 100 million which would make it the largest party in the world moreover shah has tasked newly recruited members to undergo strict ideological training and acquire fine grained knowledge of potential voters so they can disseminate propaganda down to the level of local voting booths using both old fashioned canvassing as well as social media he has also changed the social composition of the traditionally high caste party by introducing organizational elections for positions within the party the bjp accumulates vast funds by mobilizing these local networks and cajoling sections of business and capital to pay through a mix of coercion and inducement these party organizational assets combined with the traditional ground strength of the cadre based rss and wider sangh parivar have enabled the bjp to become an electoral juggernaut disrupting the economy many progressive critics feared modi would pursue a radical agenda given his past his clear parliamentary majority and the expectations of hindu nationalist ideologues in the sangh parivar the bjp manifesto contained many controversial pledges including the construction of a ram temple on the ruins of the babri mosque in ayodhya whose destruction by hindu nationalists in 1992 unleashed terrible communal violence the establishment of a uniform civil code which would nullify special personal laws for religious minorities and the abrogation of article 370 which gave special rights to the contested muslim majority state jammu kashmir indeed despite electing 282 mps to the lower house the bjp did not have a single muslim in its ranks other commentators noted that the bjp lacked a majority in the rajya sabha upper house of parliament and believed modi would focus instead on governance and development which would require opposition cooperation political tensions and communal violence would unnecessarily jeopardize that agenda shortly after coming to power modi declared my government will function on the mantra of minimum government maximum governance neoliberals rejoiced that new delhi would streamline decision making deregulate land capital and labor and devolve power to the states the appointment of several well known proponents of economic liberalization to key positions seemed to signal modi s commitment to that agenda yet the size of government and quality of governance has failed to change in expected ways the modi administration has announced a plethora of schemes to modernize the economy expand work opportunities and improve social welfare many of which tout personal initiative and commercial entrepreneurship startup india skill india stand up india others stress impressive public commitments most prominently a campaign to eliminate open defecation through universal rural sanitation and public investment in renewable energy but ardent liberalizers bemoan the absence of structural reform to promote its make in india campaign which aimed to raise the share of manufacturing from 16 percent to 25 percent of gdp and create 100 million skilled jobs by 2025 the government has cut red tape and relaxed caps on foreign direct investment in various sectors labor protocols and environmental regulations have been scaled back and businesses have been allowed to self certify their compliance with the remaining rules to end arbitrary harassment by the inspector raj the modi administration passed a national value added tax eliminating a bevy of state level levies that hampered interstate trade and it unveiled a bankruptcy code enabling struggling companies to declare insolvency and state banks to redirect credit to under resourced sectors similarly the government has altered social welfare provisioning using market instruments the national mission on financial inclusion extended bank accounts and debit cards to roughly 150 million poor families seeking to reduce their vulnerability to extortionate money lenders the jam number trinity program has converted many in kind subsidies to cash transfers lowering the scope for bribery by officials and middlemen finally the extension of accident and life insurance and the massive increase in hospital insurance under the ayushman bharat scheme provides greater economic security to informal sector workers but to access these accounts and entitlements beneficiaries must authenticate their identities through biometric identity cards a controversial project initiated by the upa called aadhaar despite widely publicized technical deficiencies the modi administration rapidly expanded their use through parliamentary legerdemain the result is a massive potential expansion of bureaucratic surveillance without adequate safeguards regarding individual privacy and data security the supreme court finally intervened in the fall of 2018 saying that the government could not deny benefits to citizens lacking an id card and private businesses could not demand it but the judiciary upheld the constitutionality of the project and its underlying legislation for welfare entitlements using public funds disappointing activists that wanted it to be struck down completely the modi administration s most dramatic exercise of arbitrary state power came at the end of 2016 when it decided to demonetize all 500 and 1 000 rupee notes the sort of move rarely pursued except in countries facing massive hyperinflation or the aftermath of war modi s government issued a variety of explanations to eliminate illicit wealth most of which is actually held in commodity or property form or is stashed abroad to weaken underground terrorist organizations using counterfeit currency and to accelerate india s transition to a cashless economy the last justification is of a piece with the government s faith in modernizing leapfrog technologies but it made a joke of modi s pledge to reduce arbitrary state intervention in the economy the demonetization was an extraordinary shock affecting roughly 86 percent of all currency bills in circulation in an economy predominantly driven by cash citizens were forced to wait in lines for hours over many days to convert their demonetized notes to new legal tender urban middle classes were able to cope but hundreds of millions of workers merchants and traders without access to credit in the vast informal economy suffered immense hardship losing their businesses and jobs likely driving many into absolute poverty it has been reported that the prime minister neither consulted his chief economic advisers nor the council of ministers and gave the reserve bank of india only a few hours notice before announcing the decision the demonetization exemplifies the decisive image modi has cultivated but it also revealed a lack of preparation and poor implementation modi survived the effects of demonetization in the short run in fact by portraying the decision as necessary for the good of the nation and not backing down in the face of criticism he reaped huge political dividends most observers assumed the bjp would suffer major losses in the subsequent 2017 assembly elections in uttar pradesh instead voters awarded it with an overwhelming 312 seats in the largest state in the country the party now appeared invincible modi s subsequent decision to appoint yogi adityanath a reactionary hindu preacher known for fomenting communal violence as its chief minister deepened his critics worst fears saffron civil society like virtually all cultural nationalists members of the sangh parivar have long pursued the gramscian imperative to reshape ethical norms popular consciousness and social practices in the trenches of civil society their ideological leaders have sought to reinterpret history to valorize purported hindu deeds rulers and customs against the ostensibly alien influences of christianity and islam they promulgate a skewed notion of hindu common sense which includes promoting vegetarianism opposing intercommunal marriage and redefining the public sphere in simplistic hinduized terms their project has advanced furthest in states run by the bjp administrations in northwestern india and to a lesser extent in the gangetic plain across northern india through a mixture of state policy and social mobilization the modi led government declared that the constitution would be its only scripture since attaining national power however it has appointed stalwart ideologues to key leadership positions in many universities research centers and cultural institutes other parties had often pursued a similar partisan approach but the bjp s ousting of perceived opponents often replacing them with individuals with far less experience and more dubious qualifications is more brazen than before modi s promotion of certain hindu nationalist myths such as the claim that ancient indian civilization had mastered genetic science and plastic surgery has invited widespread ridicule in other cases such as the decision to designate christmas as good governance day the motive was clear to render minority communities less visible more systematic efforts to normalize hindu nationalism have occurred in the domain of education in maharashtra rajasthan and gujarat states run presently or in the past by the bjp the party has revised school textbooks to glorify ancient hindu myths denigrate mughal rulers and downgrade the leadership of jawaharlal nehru and mahatma gandhi in the nationalist movement as opposed to key hindutva figures such as vinayak savarkar and m s golwalkar even more troubling the revised textbooks openly praise the strong unifying rule of hitler and mussolini and cast doubt upon the benefits of rights and democracy praising european fascism and distorting indian history is part of a wider political campaign against liberal progressive and secular voices in civil society the government has intensified a crackdown on political opponents and dissent that began in the last years of the upa new delhi has accused many ngos with external funding of violating the foreign contribution regulation act over 10 000 organizations have been compelled to modify or suspend their activities as a result including national chapters of greenpeace oxfam and the ford foundation which had questioned the social economic and ecological costs of recent development policies the government justified its move on grounds of transparency and accountability but it has also labeled these organizations as anti national revealing a cynical exploitation of governance norms to erode civil liberties and political rights students intellectuals and activists expressing political dissent or secular views have been increasingly harassed and intimidated online as well as in the streets some bjp politicians have said that critics of modi should move to pakistan government authorities have charged activists and university students with sedition a colonial era law still on the books for questioning state policy social inequality and human rights violations in jammu kashmir the northeast and the so called red corridor of central india where various states have waged a brutal campaign against maoist guerillas critics of hindu mythological claims such as govind pansare m m kalburgi and gauri lankesh have been murdered for expressing their views as prime minister modi has gradually moderated his rhetoric but his proclamations that every town should have a muslim cemetery as well as a hindu crematorium and every village deserves electricity for ramadan as well as various hindu festivals also represent a cunning ruse to insinuate that muslims had it better under opposition rule state level politicians from the bjp have pursued traditional hindutva goals far more aggressively encouraging campaigns that have spread militant cultural vigilantism into everyday life governments in many states have introduced bans on cow slaughter with draconian penalties a long held demand of the sangh parivar spurred by these polices hindu vigilantes have taken the law into their own hands muslims and dalits rumored to be involved in cow slaughter leather tanning and the cattle trade have been attacked and lynched in many regions since 2014 given the significance of dalits to the new electoral base of the bjp the prime minister eventually denounced attacks upon them tweeting in the summer of 2017 that anti social elements were spreading anarchy yet he left it to state governments to resolve the problem and failed to condemn the violence against muslims taking his cue many state level bjp politicians have shielded the perpetrators of these heinous acts or even praised them leading to acquittals and the withdrawal of many cases upon coming to power in uttar pradesh the bjp sanctioned anti romeo squads in the name of protecting girls and women from harassment and violence a searing public issue again the formation of such groups have emboldened its foot soldiers to impose vigilante justice campaigns by organizations affiliated with the sangh parivar to break relationships between hindu girls and muslim boys who allegedly pursue love jihad and to reconvert dalits and adivasis termed ghar wapsi back to home are more explicit attempts to polarize communal tensions and extend social control the failure of the government to combat these acts of intimidation and violence has encouraged more quotidian forms that differ from previous deadly episodes like the anti sikh pogrom instigated by the congress in revenge for the assassination of indira gandhi in 1984 many intellectuals artists and other public figures have courageously decried these developments including bollywood stars like aamir khan and naseeruddin shah only to incur vitriolic responses from hindu extremists on social media cracks in the road to 2019 given these events and trends many commentators believe the bjp and its hindu nationalist ideology represent a new hegemonic force in modern indian democracy yet the electoral sweep of the party in many northern states and the concentration of power in new delhi create political vulnerabilities too the early veneer of sound governance has been tarnished the modi administration has thus far avoided high level corruption scandals like those that damaged the upa yet questions have arisen over its failure to apprehend high flying businessmen accused of financial misdeeds and its decision to revise the terms of the rafale fighter jet deal with france benefitting the powerful ambani conglomerate the government has also weakened the right to information commission as well as the whistleblowers protection act through administrative delays and parliamentary amendments it has held only two meetings of the lokpal committee charged with appointing national and state level ombudsmen a key demand of the anti corruption movement that helped modi capture national power the government has introduced electoral bonds purportedly to reduce the flow of black money in electoral campaigns but neither the donor nor the party has to disclose the source of these bonds merely the amount leaving the system as non transparent and unaccountable as before india s disappointing economic performance under the government is another serious electoral liability annual economic growth has once again topped 7 percent but the government s decision to revise the figures using a new statistical methodology has even impartial observers asking questions moreover growth remains extremely dependent on high public spending especially on infrastructure the early boom in foreign direct investment has faded private domestic companies and public sector banks are still constrained by very high levels of debt and non performing assets necessitating massive recapitalization the campaign to make in india remains an aspiration the national value added duty brought many companies into the formal tax net improving india s low tax gdp ratio but its five tiers of tax rates and clumsy roll out imposed a high regulatory burden on millions of small and medium sized enterprises it was supposed to help perhaps most damaging formal sector employment has failed to expand last spring the indian railways the country s biggest civilian employer received an astonishing 23 million applications for 90 000 vacancies moreover since 2016 the government has stopped releasing customary job reports saying the underlying measures had to be revamped on august 15 2018 giving his last independence day speech before the general election this spring modi vowed to double farmers incomes by 2022 it was a characteristically extravagant pledge but reckless too prolonged drought lower prices and higher input costs had cut agricultural growth rates in half since his administration took office in 2014 severe rural distress alongside the slow burning ramifications of demonetization and poor employment prospects exposed the tall promises of the bjp in state elections at the end of 2018 opposition parties inflicted a surprising defeat on the bjp in three of its strongholds in the hindi heartland despite heavy political campaigning by the prime minister the outcome rejuvenated the congress bestowing greater leadership credibility to rahul gandhi and encouraging his more charismatic sibling priyanka to finally step off the political sidelines it also galvanized diverse regional parties to explore the prospects of mounting an anti bjp coalition it remains to be seen whether the opposition can mount a united front among its myriad personalities and diverse interests and offer a real programmatic alternative in their respective states and across the country so far apart from pledges to protect minority rights and restore public institutions its main idea is to extend a universal basic income to every poor citizen the modi government has responded with old fashioned populist gestures it had previously disparaged as dole it passed a 10 percent quota for individuals from poor upper caste families in public sector jobs and higher education the government pressured the reserve bank of india the country s central bank to share its excess savings with the finance ministry and it broke convention by announcing new schemes most notably cash handouts tax breaks and monthly pensions to small farmers middle class households and informal workers in the last budget before the 2019 polls the prime minister has also doubled down on old hindutva demands saying the government would explore how to build a ram temple in ayodhya once the supreme court had delivered its impending judgment implying a willingness to bypass judicial review and he has retaliated against pakistan for the recent suicide bombing in kashmir claimed by jaish e mohammad the worst attack against indian forces in the region since 1989 raising nationalist fervor and the prospect of war to galvanize voters only two years ago the bjp claimed it would rule new delhi for at least a decade now the party s desperation is increasingly clear the upcoming general election is a contest the prime minister declared at the start of 2019 of janata versus gathbandhan india s demos may grant modi another chance to embody its aspirations and fears but his classic populist gambit failed to hide a plain truth the good days he promised have still not arrived sanjay ruparelia is the author of

image bank of canada reproduced under cc licensing cad slides as boc survey shows growth falling inflation cooling rbc says bos vindicates interest rate u turn from bank of canada cibc reiterates no more rate hikes from boc forecasts weaker cad the canadian dollar weakened monday after the latest business outlook survey from the bank of canada boc revealed a weakening of inflation pressures in the first quarter and also pointed to slower growth in the months ahead canada s dollar ceded ground to all of its rivals monday after many of the indicators contained in the latest business outlook survey fell to their lowest levels since the third quarter of 2016 the survey vindicates the bank of canada for not having raised its interest rate thus far in 2019 the main headwinds are a more uncertain outlook in the western canadian energy sector continued weakness in housing related activity in some regions and tangible impacts from global trade tensions the boc says the sales growth indicator pointed clearly in the first quarter toward the weakest revenue growth for companies since the july october period of 2016 while investment and hiring intentions both fell too albeit that the latter still remain at elevated levels most importantly respondents to the survey told the bank of canada they anticipate that input and output price growth will stabilize over the coming months due to a combination of increased competition and fading pressure from tariff related cost increases which are offsetting higher commodity prices this means lesser inflation pressures up ahead which is not good for the loonie because it would take a robust outlook for consumer price growth to get the bank of canada to lift its interest rate this year economists are now speculating the boc will sit on hold for at least the foreseeable future the bank of canada has already made a quick move to the sidelines in terms of further interest rate hikes in recent months with global growth concerns benign inflation trends and slower household credit spending growth offsetting persistent capacity pressures the easing in indications of the latter only reinforces that move and increases the odds that the next bank of canada interest rate hike is a lot further away than thought just a few months ago says nathan janzen of rbc capital markets above approximate canadian sales growth on a trailing 12 month basis monday s readings reflect feedback on the economic outlook obtained from 100 of canada s largest companies during a quarter that was marked by volatility in oil markets and rising concerns over the outlook for the global economy with many advanced economies having slowed clearly during recent months in march the boc stopped just short of saying it doesn t expect to raise rates at all this year this was after a december to january u turn on earlier interest rate guidance that had suggested it could lift its cash rate on as many as three occasions in 2019 and potentially taking it from the current 1 75 up to 2 5 however a final quarter 2018 bust in the oil market took place around the same time that fears for the global growth outlook were really beginning to pick up both chinese and eurozone economies slowed sharply in the latter half of 2018 due mainly to president donald trump s trade war with china that bust was enough to throw the bank of canada off its earlier course and ever since then doubts over whether it will even get the opportunity to raise rates again in this cycle have proliferated among analysts and economists the bank makes most use of this survey for its colour on inflation and all of the various measures showed an easing of price and cost pressures vs the prior report look for the upcoming mpr to translate that into a modest opening up in the output gap giving the bank license to keep rates on hold this year says avery shenfeld chief economist at cibc capital markets shenfeld and the cibc team say they never were convinced that either of the north american central banks would lift rates again this year however now the federal reserve has come close to calling off its interest rate hiking cycle they re growing even more confident in their call that the boc won t hike again above usd cad rate shown at daily intervals an increasing number of developed world central banks have moved to the sidelines of the monetary policy field during recent months including the u s fed reserve bank of australia and reserve bank of new zealand and the european central bank kicked the idea of a rate hike out into the long grass of 2020 while the bank of england has been derailed from its rate hike path by the ongoing brexit farce in the uk parliament all of the currencies relevant to the above referenced central banks have already depreciated relative to the canadian dollar this year other than pound sterling so if the bank of canada was to suggest later in 2019 that its own interest rate may already have gone as high as it s likely to there could be a violent response from the loonie even with the boc on hold an expected rebound in q2 for the canadian economy should lend support to the loonie in the near term allowing it to ride the coattails of other currencies gaining on the greenback look for a mid year low for usdcad in the 1 31 range shenfeld writes in cibc s latest monthly fx outlook shenfeld and the cibc team forecast the usd cad rate will reach a low of 1 31 in june before rising to 1 34 in time for year end as the canadian dollar weakens in response to a renewed slowdown in the economy and a boc acknowledgement that its hiking cycle is at an end they project more weakness in 2020 that should spill over into the subsequent year ultimately placing the usd cad rate all the way up at 1 40 in time for the end of 2021 the pound to canadian dollar rate on the other hand is projected to rise in 2019 as the brexit process edges closer toward an end that is expected to result in a broad but gradual recovery of sterling that drives the pound to loonie rate from 1 75 monday to 1 82 by year end above pound to canadian dollar rate shown at daily intervals

egypt and the united states share a long history of mutual interests with the strategic economic political and security partnership between the two countries now stronger than ever few bilateral relationships have deeper roots than those between washington and cairo with spheres of interest across africa the middle east and even beyond egypt has proved an indispensable partner for the u s in the middle east most notably in the global fight against terror and extremism a fact which has not gone unrecognized by the trump administration just last september during the un general assembly u s president donald trump described the role of president el sisi as outstanding in confronting the global menace putting egypt at the forefront in an ongoing battle this came shortly after u s secretary of state mike pompeo authorized the release of military aid to egypt to boost its defense and security capabilities in the region in order to bolster national and regional security calling the u s egypt relationship one of our deepest and broadest partnerships in the region sameh shoukry egypt s foreign minister explains the conflicts that exist in syria yemen libya and the threats and dangers of terrorism are all challenges that we deal with through coordination and cooperation with the united states we share common interests when it comes to maintaining peace and security in the region egypt s strength as a longstanding arbiter of peace in the middle east and beyond has gained further credibility due to its achievements at home it has been just over two years since the country signed a 12 4 billion deal with the international monetary fund imf putting into place initiatives such as the liberalization of the currency restructuring of energy subsidies and austerity measures to rebalance the budget and thus the economy while these reforms have caused hardships they have been at the same time regarded as necessary to the reform of the economy the stability of egypt itself has been demonstrated by what it steadily endured and accomplished in the last few years particularly in terms of regaining the competence of the institutions of government and their responsibility towards the egyptian people says minister shoukry just last january imf managing director christine lagarde heralded the country s progress on the economic front noting that egypt has made substantial progress as evident in the success achieved in macroeconomic stabilization its growth rate is now among the highest in the region the budget deficit is on a declining trajectory and inflation is on track to reach the central bank of egypt s target by the end of 2019 unemployment has declined to around 10 percent which is the lowest since 2011 and social protection measures have been expanded egypt remains a steadfast emerging market its name is no longer synonymous with risk for u s and global investors the annual gallup global law and order poll published in june 2018 ranked the country 16th out of 135 countries in terms of safety making it the safest country in africa and even safer than the u s which ranked 35th our economic relationship with the u s is supported and enhanced by our strong political ties today and the mutual desire is to continue cooperation in the economic sector at higher levels it has been beneficial to both egypt and the united states therefore they continue to explore advantageous avenues clarifies minister shoukry indeed even before the reforms egypt has long been a preferred destination in the region for u s commercial interests american foreign direct investment fdi in the country stood at 22 2 billion as of the financial year 2016 17 equivalent to a staggering 38 6 percent of the u s total fdi in africa meanwhile in the middle east egypt comes only second to the united arab emirates today the government sees attracting as much as 11 billion in fdi in the current financial year up from 7 9 billion last year and a clear sign of growing investor confidence in the recovering egyptian economy major american companies are heavily invested in egypt and have been here over the last 40 or 50 years and in general they have been rewarded quite handsomely by their operations in egypt president el sisi has also always shown a high degree of receptivity in meeting with interested american companies and in highlighting the opportunities that exist in egypt the investment opportunities minister shoukry explains adding that with the current discoveries of huge gas reserves egypt can be an energy hub for the eastern mediterranean europe and beyond commerce is tightly bound into egypt s dna with a trading history that spans over five millennia for american investors the country represents not only a 100 million strong domestic market but also a hub through which they can access major markets without tariffs as a result of a number of preferential trade greements with the arab countries the eu turkey and the comesa sadc and the eac blocks which together comprise 26 african countries the suez canal corridor provides for american companies a base to expand production lines and to take advantage of the free trade arrangements that egypt has with the arab world and also with africa the continental free trade area cfta is another additional element that can be attractive to u s companies to be based in egypt and expand into africa all components of a solid egypt u s relationship are on track to mutually benefit both sides notes minister shoukry this tight regional integration will come into sharper focus this year as the country assumed the leadership of the african union in his keynote speech as he took the helm of the bloc president el sisi underscored the need for greater regional integration economic ties and investment within the continent calling for the cfta to be put to its full use meanwhile the trump administration recently unveiled its africa strategy as yet another opportunity for egypt to shine as both a trusted partner and a core economic and socio political power hub the strategy s aims which include enhancing u s trade and commercial ties with african nations through arrangements that benefit both sides and countering the threat of terrorism play to egypt s strengths while u s companies which already have a base in the country will increasingly be able to use it as a springboard into the rest of the continent we have very special things happening our relationship has never been stronger we are working with egypt on many different fronts including military and trade president trump recently said
by lance roberts last week the federal reserve released their march fomc meeting minutes following the release the markets surged higher as the initial reading by the markets was the fed is done hiking rates as the wall street journal reported in fed minutes officials see little need to change rates this year minutes of the march meeting released wednesday showed officials see little reason to continue raising rates due to greater risks to the u s economy from the global growth slowdown and muted inflation readings that took more officials by surprise a majority of participants expected that the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook would likely warrant leaving the target range unchanged for the remainder of the year the minutes said at the same time the minutes show officials didn t perceive any need to cut their benchmark rate absent a broader deterioration in the economy officials said their view of the appropriate setting for interest rates could shift in either direction based on incoming data and other developments since officials last met president trump has said he would like to see the fed undo its last two rate increases fed officials have said they will base their decisions on the economic outlook and not political pressure see nothing to worry about as there are no recessions predicted by the fed ever as peter bookvar noted wednesday afternoon don t believe for a moment the fed isn t specifically targeting the market i ve said many times to insert s p 500 for financial developments because that is essentially what we re talking about here when its cited so the fed is referring to significant uncertainties with regards to the s p 500 what uncertainties exactly now since the s p 500 is just off all time record highs they also acknowledged that their jawboning which shifted policy to one that is more flexible is what boosted the stock market in their discussion of financial developments s p 500 participants observed that a good deal of the tightening over the latter part of last year in financial conditions s p 500 had since been reversed federal reserve communications since the beginning of this year were seen as an important contributor to the recent improvements in financial conditions s p 500 participants noted that asset valuations had recovered strongly thanks fed high five and the parenthesis and underline are obviously mine but here is the problem with the market s assumption the fed did not say they were done hiking rates while the fed said they would be patient for now there are already indications that economic growth and inflation will pick up over the next couple of quarters no this isn t the revival of the economy but simply a normal seasonal bounce from pent up demand following a cold winter complicating matters for the fed is the strength of the dollar the continued rise oil prices which is already leading to stronger inflationary prints and increases in wages which will lead to concerns about an overheating economy such will put the fed in a box with respect to both being data dependent as well as maintaining some semblance of independence in other words while they may be patient for the moment that doesn t mean their position won t change as noted in their minutes most participants indicated that they did not expect the recent weakness in spending to persist beyond the first quarter several participants noted that their views of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate could shift in either direction based on incoming data and other developments some participants indicated that if the economy evolved as they currently expected with economic growth above its longer run trend rate they would likely judge it appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate modestly later this year furthermore as i noted in this past weekend s missive the fed has already been dropping hints since the march meeting about further rates hikes in 2019 and 2020 cleveland fed president loretta mester could we be done with policy rate increases this cycle it is possible but if the economy performs along the lines i think is the most likely case the fed funds rate may need to move a bit higher than current levels philadelphia fed president patrick harker i continue to be in wait and see mode with expectations of at most one hike for 2019 and one for 2020 those comments don t align with a fed eager to sit on the sidelines reduce rates or begin to inject further stimulus however while markets rallied on the idea the fed will stay pat for now this still doesn t alleviate the problems we noted previously yes the fed isn t hiking rates but they aren t reducing them either yes the fed isn t reducing their balance sheet any more after september but they aren t increasing it either while economic growth outside of china remains weak the year over year credit expansion in china is slowing employment growth is slowing and will continue to weaken there is no massive disaster currently to spur a surge in government spending and reconstruction there isn t another stimulus package like tax cuts to fuel a boost in corporate earnings with the deficit already pushing 1 trillion there will only be an incremental boost from additional deficit spending this year unfortunately it is also just a function of time until a recession occurs most importantly even if the federal reserve does begin to reverse course and inject liquidity the effectiveness of those actions will likely not have the same effect we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us why because the economic backdrop is not what it was a decade ago the table below compares a variety of financial and economic factors from january of 2009 to january 2019 the critical point here is that qe and rate reductions have the most effect when the economy markets and investors have been blown out deviations from the norm are negatively extended confidence is hugely negative in other words there is nowhere to go but up unfortunately the fed is trapped between the data and their need to do something to keep the asset prices inflated to support economic growth but that may not be enough as the bond market is already sniffing out the problems back to peter bookvar the stock market is assuming things will improve in q2 and throughout the second half the bond market has a less optimistic take on that saying that the data is weak and we re going to reflect that right now in lower yields and inversions within the yield curve currently 5 out of 10 yield curves we track 50 are now inverted such is the highest risk of a recessionary onset as we have seen since 2007 for boockvar s part the fixed income market is the indicator to watch the bond market is going to be right we re in a slowdown that s not just temporary and i think that s something that s going to last throughout the year he is right while we are maintaining our equity exposure currently we have also hedged those long positions with gold and gold mining stocks a heavier weighting than normal in cash and have recalibrated the duration and credit risk in our bond holdings to account for the inversion this is simply because the risks continue to outweigh the reward for the markets currently as doug kass recently noted negative or near zero interest rates represent conditions that understandably exist immediately following a deep recession not 10 years after represent conditions that understandably exist immediately following a deep recession not 10 years after fewer tools left in the policy shed as the fed ends the tightening cycle with the absolute and real federal funds rate several hundred basis points lower than any economic cycle in history as the fed ends the tightening cycle with the absolute and real federal funds rate several hundred basis points lower than any economic cycle in history debt is a governor to growth and debt that is not self funding is future consumption brought forward and debt that is not self funding is future consumption brought forward deficit and demographic threats combined with a fed balance sheet which is four times normal and slowing population growth diminish intermediate to longer term economic and profit growth prospects such is not supportive of higher valuations or asset prices combined with a fed balance sheet which is four times normal and slowing population growth diminish intermediate to longer term economic and profit growth prospects such is not supportive of higher valuations or asset prices no country is an economic island and the lack of coordination between the super economic powers in the world will likely exacerbate worldwide economic risks and the lack of coordination between the super economic powers in the world will likely exacerbate worldwide economic risks the misallocation of resources causes bubbles and low interest rates which we have experienced for years have always in every cycle been a source of mischief and a misallocation of resources the only question is when something breaks it will ripple through the financial markets like a tidal wave think about the proliferation of covenant lite loans summary while the fed has successfully jawboned the markets recently to keep asset prices stable and positive there will come a point where verbal liquidity simply isn t enough the fact that economic cycles will eventually complete seems to be lost on the fed as mike shedlock noted the weakness of inflation pressures given a strong job market and accelerating output last year has puzzled fed officials at last month s meeting they discussed reasons that inflation might have been more muted including the prospect that the estimated level of unemployment rate consistent with stable prices is lower than previously thought instead of wondering why inflation is weak they ought to consider the absurdity of their models stocks are priced beyond perfection housing prices are so high no one can afford them and the entire inflation expectations model they use is ridiculous he is right about the fed s models and their reliance on low interest rates charlie mcelligott discussed the three most important points about low interest rates h t zerohedge low interest rates are ultimately deflationary sustaining zombie firms in a liquidity trap which weigh on overall economic performance while also weakening investment low interest rates and qe are deflationary as you incentivize mal investment and blow perpetual speculative asset bubbles which ultimately correct and drive deleveraging thus the balance sheet recession as there is still a lot of debt related scar tissue you can t push credit on a string this then leads to quick muscle memory returns to a defensive posture if there is no return on capital capital should not be deployed here are the most important takeaways from all of this despite an expected uptick in economic growth in q2 look for weaker economic growth through the end of this year and into 2020 employment is set to weaken markedly over the next 12 24 months wage growth gains will also reverse as tightness in the labor force eases inflationary pressures will remain non existent as debt disruption and demographic forces continue to suppress economic growth go back to 1 this is the cycle we are likely locked into currently and will continue to play out over the next several quarters the markets are misreading what the fed is really saying and investors will ultimately pay

best is over for europe but there s no crisis head of bailout fund says klaus regling the managing director of the european stability mechanism said stellar euro zone growth in 2017 could not be sustained and believes it was inevitable that economies would stall as central banks began to normalize policy we will not see in the next two three years the growth rates of 2017 it s quite ok to say that the best is over but it doesn t mean that there is a crisis he told cnbc s joumanna bercetche in washington d c the european stability mechanism or esm is a crisis resolution mechanism set up for euro area countries and generates money by selling bonds in the global financial markets following the euro zone sovereign debt crisis of 2011 it became an integral part of the system as bailouts were dealt out to ailing economies however regling doesn t believe there could be any further crisis in the coming years despite a recent downtick in growth for both the euro zone and the wider world i am not surprised that growth is coming down because in 2017 the growth rate in the euro area was almost twice the potential growth rate that could not continue very long he said adding that the output gap the amount by which the actual output of an economy falls short of its potential output had been closed during this recovery the european central bank ecb pumped trillions of euros into the economy in the past few years to boost inflation and promote growth but despite winding down its bond buying program in december it has shied away from any rate hikes after disappointing economic data regling underlined that temporary factors could be at play for germany s recent weakness economists have highlighted new regulations for its autos sector and a knock on effect from the u s china trade war on tuesday the international monetary fund again reduced its global economic growth forecast for 2019 citing risks like increasing trade tensions and tighter monetary policy by the federal reserve source cnbc
stephen moore may be setting a new standard for engagement on the issues as a nominee to the federal reserve board since his name was floated for the position moore a co founder of the free market club for growth has done interviews with several media outlets candidly setting forth his views on economic issues he has been particularly concerned to get across two ideas about monetary policy that the federal reserve should be accommodative when presidents pursue pro growth policies and that it should aim to hold commodity prices steady moore has shown flexibility on these topics saying he would not be doctrinaire about commodity prices and that he erred in predicting high inflation during the barack obama administration his view on commodity prices seems to be of recent vintage he didn t call for a looser monetary policy to help boost them during their long slide from 2011 through 2016 i hope that moore with whom i have been having friendly discussions and occasional arguments for more than two decades will reconsider both of the views that he has been expressing especially if he gets confirmed to the fed these ideas that the fed should accommodate growth and stabilize commodity prices don t fit together very well commodity prices can rise at the same time that tax rates are being cut as happened during president george w bush s first term in such cases moore s idea about commodities would have the federal reserve raise interest rates but his second aim to make room for the pro growth effects of conservative policies would have it cut them more important than the fact that these ideas can point in different directions though is that neither of them on its own offers a useful guide for monetary policy start with moore s view about economic growth and the fed on bloomberg tv he has argued that central banks should not fear growth as a warning sign of high inflation and he is right about that but on other occasions he has gone further asking why would you want to raise interest rates at a time when the economy is clicking on all cylinders if you re ever going to raise rates an economic boom is exactly when you would usually want to do it the alternative would be for the fed to raise rates when the economy is weak and thus make the business cycle more severe that s the opposite of what a central bank should do if president donald trump s policies have had the strongly positive effects on current and future economic growth that moore believes then interest rates should go up the neutral interest rate the one that has neither a contractionary nor expansionary effect on the economy should rise when expected growth does as for commodity prices fed officials have often looked at them among many other indicators of the state of the economy one might think that because of their rapid movements they can serve as advance signs of whether the economy is weakening or overheating reviewing studies on the subject though monetary economist george selgin does not findevidence that commodity prices do well at predicting trends in the level of prices or spending in the overall economy central bankers generally place more weight on core inflation that is the inflation rate for everything but energy and food and thus excluding a lot of commodities than on overall inflation that s because taking those items out makes the measure less volatile and a better gauge of continuing trends what moore is advocating is very nearly the reverse approach keeping commodities in the price index and dropping everything else critics have pointed out that commodities prices were rising from 2009 through 2011 and therefore counseling monetary tightness during the end of a severe recession and the very start of a recovery moore has replied to that argument by saying that if the fed had paid attention to rising commodity prices during the preceding boom and tightened money then there wouldn t have been a crash and thus a need to reflate in the first place this response sidesteps the key point if commodity prices can point in the opposite direction from what the economy badly needs why tie policy to them if consumers in china and india increase their purchases of gold jewelry it will raise the price of gold under a commodity price rule their shift in buying habits would require deflation in the u s that can t make sense the rule would also perhaps more importantly put monetary policy at the mercy of supply shifts widespread strikes by copper miners in latin america would raise commodity prices and militate in favor of tightening even in the absence of a commodity price rule monetary policy has sometimes been too responsive to changes in supply productivity gains exert downward pressure on prices in the mid 2000s the fed was arguably too loose because it wanted to offset that downward pressure in 2008 it tightened money at the worst possible time because it feared oil prices were rising a central bank driven by commodity prices will make supply induced errors more than one driven by inflation which will in turn make more than one driven by core inflation a central bank that used total dollar spending as its guide would be the least prone to such errors moore should drop his focus on commodities which would make the flaws of current monetary policy worse by the same token though his numerous critics should realize that what s wrong with his commodities idea is what s wrong on a smaller scale with what the fed already does

climbed to a one month high last week as euro rose to its best level against the us dollar since the 26th of march the only times that we see simultaneous strength in pairs like usd jpy and is when risk appetite is strong stocks pulled back at the start of last week but they rebounded strongly on friday to end the week not far from 6 month highs there s been a lot of talk about recessions trade tensions between the eu and us are escalating and there s still no final resolution to us china trade talks or brexit and yet investors are optimistic because bank earnings are strong and they believe that policy accommodation abroad will help to mitigate a deep slowdown in global growth they are also relieved that the federal reserve won t add to the pain by tightening again this year while this may be incredibly optimistic until all signs point to a significant slowdown in the us that will spill over to the rest of the world investors see their glasses as half full easter week is always an interesting one in the fx market we usually see a burst of activity the first three days followed by consolidation this year may be different because there are a number of important economic reports scheduled for release on thursday so volatility could extend until then nonetheless most markets are closed for good friday and easter monday the us is only closed friday so many traders will leave

after a sharp drop in february key levels support 111 00 resistance 114 00 usd jpy 114 or 110 treasury yields rebounded last week squeezing usd jpy higher in the process us economic reports were stronger than expected with consumer and producer prices ticking upwards the rise in price pressures was driven mostly by higher food and energy costs which is not sustainable but when low inflation is one of the main reasons why central bankers are slowing policy normalization it is good news for the greenback jobless claims also fell to a 40 year low this confirms that the labour market the strongest part of the us economy is still very tight more than 190k jobs were created last month and usd jpy s strength reflects the market s hope that job growth will exceed 200k in april retail sales are scheduled for release and with gas prices on the rise and job growth rebounding spending should recover in march after falling in february this report will not be released until thursday but when it comes out it should be positive for usd jpy the big question now is whether the trend has completely shifted for usd jpy making 114 more likely to be hit before 110 we are skeptical of the rally because us growth is slowing not accelerating and central bankers are worried last week vice chair clarida said the labor market is healthy and the economy is in a good place but fed president bullard thinks the march hike marked the end of policy normalization and favors removing the word patient from the policy statement because it suggests a tightening bias fed fund futures are pricing in a 48 chance of a rate cut in january so easing is certainty on their minds fundamentally usd jpy should see 110 before 114 but technically usd jpy hit a 7 week high and the positive momentum is

wasn t much in the way of data and the reports that were released were more negative than positive for the commodity currencies yet none of that mattered as they took their cue from risk appetite aud rose to its strongest level in a month despite reports that the country s biggest lender will be cutting 10k jobs nzd hit a two month low versus the us dollar on friday before rebounding strongly to end the week at its weekly range high despite softer manufacturing activity and a decline in credit card spending better than expected chinese trade numbers and ongoing reports of progress lent support to these currencies but the chance of further gains is lower than the risk of a deeper pullback because layoffs in australia and slowdown in manufacturing harden the case for rate cuts chinese trade data was also distorted by the lunar new year holidays this week s rba statement should remind investors that the central bank is not optimistic australian labour market figures are also scheduled for release along with chinese gdp nzd usd on the other hand should be supported by its cpi report because food and commodity prices rose strongly in the first quarter is at the cusp of a turn as for usdcad it remained confined in a relatively tight range for most of the week no major economic reports were released but we learned that housing market activity is slowing this week s

3300 uk gets six more months one of the biggest stories in the fx market last week was the european union s decision to extend britain s exit from the european union by 6 months to the 31st of october this was longer than the prime minister requested and shorter than the one year option some eu members preferred there will be a formal review in june and if the uk wanted to leave sooner it could as a result the uk will be participating in the european parliamentary elections unless it reaches an agreement internally to leave the eu before june 1st the good news is that this extension averted a no deal brexit last week that would have caused major disruptions in the financial markets it also provides six months of relief for uk businesses who were looking at the loaded end of a gun if the uk would have had to suddenly exit out of eu within days the bad news is that while the agreement brings much needed respite the market reaction was less than stellar as brexit fatigue and lack of clear outcomes have clearly taken their toll on traders the eu refuses to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and the fear is that prime minister may still won t receive the support she needs to pass the current withdrawal agreement in 6 months time after all is said and done uk still faces the same three choices a hard brexit under wto rules a possible 2nd referendum that could overturn article 50 or some sort of a customs union that would leave the issue of the irish border unresolved cable held steady under the 1 3100 figure but showed little sign of life finally the six month delay could prove to be positive for the uk economy as it may provide a boost in spending from a more confident uk consumer regardless of pick up in data the boe is likely to remain stationary erring on the side of caution as the risks of hard brexit remain and this should keep a cap on cable unless some genuine political breakthrough is achieved in the near term this 6 month relief allows investors to turn their focus back to data the latest economic reports were mixed with manufacturing activity slowing and service sector activity accelerating this week s inflation employment and retail sales reports

german trade surplus growing and industrial production falling less but these reports are not enough to be optimistic about the euro trade tensions between the european union and the us are at a boiling point with president trump threatening 11b in tariffs over airbus subsidies in response the eu is preparing its own list of retaliatory tariffs worth over 22b the world trade organization hasn t officially recommended a penalty for the eu but if they do or the us pushes ahead with the tariffs it will be very damaging to the region s economy and the euro this is a risk that the central bank is fully aware of so much that ecb president mario draghi expressed concerns about the slowdown in the economy and teased investors about the possibility of more stimulus during his post ecb meeting presser he said tltro 3 was their first defence to slowing growth and if the weakness deepens they have plenty of instruments at their disposal in june they ll also decide if negative interest rates need mitigating but for now draghi made it clear that there are many things keeping them up at night from tariffs to brexit protectionism low inflation and the possibility of a recession in italy so not only do they feel that rate hikes are unnecessary this year but they could delay them further if needed in june they ll announce the details of tltro and the program could be more extensive if the slowdown deepens the german zew survey and eurozone pmis are scheduled for release this week and if the data softens reinforcing the central bank s concerns eur usd will resume its slide ultimately we

contrary to the government s version of successful negotiations with the international monetary fund imf media reports reveal that agreement on bailout package may hit snags on the condition of sharing all the details of chimes loans obtained under cpec framework and short term exorbitantly high interest bearing commercial loans the conditions of the washington based lending agency include sharing of full details of chinese loans hiking power and gas tariffs flexible exchange rate withdrawal of tax concessions granted under sros by the previous government and imposition of new taxes the issue of chinese loans has been raised on the premise of debt sustainability capacity of pakistan s economy as debt to gdp ratio has gone up to 84 percent as compared with the sustainable limit of 60 percent envisaged in fiscal responsibility and debt limitation act 2005 the international donor agencies have repeatedly advised the previous government to avoid reckless borrowing for the least productive or losses incurring development projects like motorways metro bus and lahore orange train like wise the government was cautioned to reduce the imports of luxury goods for the payment which loans were raised in the european market through euro bond and sukuk bonds these loans were used to pay for imports from china the trade deficit with china stand at 9 billion plus moreover the world bank pegged a loan facility of 400 million in 2016 subject to the condition of removing certain lacunae in the fiscal responsibility and debt limitation act the previous pml n government did not concede the condition and the soft loan was not disbursed in sharp contrast to the opinion of independent economists that the us enjoy the clout of 70 percent voting rights in the imf finance minister asad umer is of the view that washington has 16 5 percent voting rights and he would be able to clinch a deal with the donor agency on the basis of his current negotiations and will get the support of 51 percent vote in the board of directors meeting this argument may not come true if japan and western powers are influenced by the united states last year us president donald trump and secretary of state mike pompeo had categorically said that imf loans contain american taxpayers dollars and cannot be used by pakistan to pay chinese debt the us president had cautioned we would be watching what imf does a few days ago three us congressmen wrote a letter to the treasury secretary steven munchin and secretary of state mike pompeo opposing imf bailout package for pakistan in the prevailing scenario the only ray of hope for agreement with the lending agency for bail out is that the us may soften its attitude in view of pakistan s facilitation role to arrive at a political settlement of afghanistan

global stocks are rising at the fastest pace in decades as growth around the world slows leaving many investors questioning how much longer the market can defy the gravity of the underlying economics indexes from new york and europe to china have soared double digit percentages this year to regain most of their ground after tanking in the fourth quarter supported by signs that central banks are willing to keep holding interest rates at low levels for the foreseeable future the s p 500 has risen 15 vaulting above the level where banks ranging from morgan stanley to barclays expected it to end the year benchmark indexes elsewhere have rallied too with the shanghai composite rising 28 the stoxx europe 600 up 15 and a measure of emerging market stocks up 14 all told global stocks would close out 2019 with their best annual returns ever if they kept rising at their current pace according to a bank of america analysis still investors are trying to square their big returns with the fact that they have arrived while the global economic outlook has grown progressively dimmer fund managers also have increasingly questioned whether the federal reserve s pivot from raising rates to holding them steady reflects economic weakness that will ultimately derail the market s rally the international monetary fund in april cut its outlook for global growth in 2019 to 3 3 from estimates of 3 5 in january and 3 7 in october warning that trade tensions and declining business confidence were weighing on nearly all countries around the world the imf isn t alone the fed and european central bank have also trimmed growth forecasts in recent months and in china officials have ramped up spending and cut taxes to try to boost a slowing economy a pullback would not surprise us at a time like this

fund managers and analysts will see a test of that thesis next week when dozens of u s companies including goldman sachs group inc netflix inc and philip morris international inc report first quarter earnings because of the global growth slowdown and the waning boost from 2017 s u s tax cuts s p 500 companies are expected to post their first year over year decline in earnings since 2016 investors

much of their profits overseas making them bellwethers for the health of the global economy we don t know when china is going to catch fire mr ware said adding that his firm has avoided taking outsize positions in stocks in foreign markets because of high uncertainty about the economic outlook for stocks to keep rising many market watchers believe the world economy must hold at a sweet spot showing signs neither of rolling over nor of unexpectedly heating up the latter point is particularly important since central bankers have signaled their willingness to forbear raising interest rates as long as inflationary pressures continue to look muted i don t have any worries on financial stability right now worries about inflation pressures getting red hot john williams president of the federal reserve bank of new york told reporters after a speech thursday in a separate address ecb president mario draghi said inflationary pressures in the eurozone were likely to decline not increase over coming months some investors are also taking comfort in the fact that the current stock rally bears few apparent similarities to so called melt ups periods when share prices rise rapidly because money managers wary of missing out on further gains decide to pile into the market during a melt up at the start of 2018 stocks around the world flew higher then began careening in a matter of weeks unlike

news national by staff reporter long suffering zimbabweans should brace for even tougher economic times ahead following last week s surprise announcement by finance minister mthuli ncube that the country would have yet another currency within a year a move experts say will drive up the prices of basic goods and also cause shortages the warning comes as most big supermarkets and other retail shops around the country have hiked the prices of basic consumer goods sharply raising the cost of living for ordinary citizens ncube s announcement which one analyst described as a bolt from the blue yesterday was made hardly three months after the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz had introduced the rtgs dollar together with an interbank market which allows the formal trading of foreign currency by banks business leaders and political analysts who spoke to the daily news said ncube s announcement which he made in the united states where he was attending international monetary fund imf meetings undermined the confidence that the government was desperately trying to build a treasury insider also bemoaned what he called ncube s tendency to surprise the markets and create unnecessary confusion undermining confidence has negative implications on inflation prices and the exchange rate talking about a local currency at the moment is premature as we already have an rtgs dollar in this day and age of moving towards a cash lite society concentrating on a physical currency is retrogressive the insider added former finance minister in the short lived but stability inducing government of national unity gnu tendai biti also said ncube s statement had undermined recent rbz measures warning that the prices of basic goods were going to shoot through the roof as a result that is rank madness how does one change currencies like they are changing diapers what is the point of changing the name of the currency if it will suffer the same fate as the bond note the rtgs dollar will now depreciate even more and the black market rates will rise it will have a catastrophic impact on industry which relies mainly on imports biti told the daily news there will inevitably be fuel shortages as well and this will also come with more company closures and increases in prices there will be massive externalisation as people trade offshore and there will also be increased budget deficits he added university of zimbabwe political science lecturer eldred masunungure described ncube s announcement as being based on wishful thinking there is consensus among stakeholders including consumers that economic fundamentals around productivity have not changed much hence it is clear that the announcement is wishful thinking as it is not backed by the situation obtaining on the ground until the so called fundamentals are right there is no end in sight of our problems as a country because the currency will suffer the same fate as the rtgs so ncube s proposal is not prudent and is bound to fail especially if there is no increase in productivity to have reserves that will hedge the currency masunungure said in february the rbz introduced the rtgs dollar when it unveiled its monetary policy statement which sought to breathe new life into the economy however the rtgs dollar which opened trading at 2 5 against the us dollar has since lost nearly 25 percent of its value with the interbank market battling to attract money at the same time the black market continues to give more attractive exchange rates forcing sellers to do business there and in turn leading companies to buy forex for their needs at a high premium following ncube s announcement the forex parallel markets shot to nearly rtgs 5 to the greenback amid indications that the situation could quickly get worse on their part business leaders said the government needed to look at the problems which were pushing up prices and inflation in the country before it started talking of introducing a new currency confederation of zimbabwe industries czi president sifelani jabangwe also said price increases were likely to continue unless there was stability in the economy what is important is that we stabilise now before the new currency is introduced jabangwe said confederation of zimbabwe retailers czr president denford mutashu said it would be futile to bring a new currency without first addressing all the problems afflicting the economy the hope is that government and monetary authorities are taking the necessary steps in terms of getting the fundamentals right before they launch a new currency he said many shops in harare which were visited by a daily news crew at the weekend had sharply increased their prices of most goods such as sugar beans cooking oil flour eggs mazoe orange crush meat rice and soap the rise in the prices of cereals and grains were necessitated by the government s decision to hike grain producer prices last tuesday the government increased the producer price of maize from rtgs 390 a tonne to rtgs 726 while wheat was increased from rtgs 630 to rtgs 1 089 69 resultantly the grain millers association of zimbabwe gmaz at the weekend announced new and higher prices of mealie meal in a letter addressed to industry and commerce minister mangaliso ndlovu the millers said the price increase would come into effect today we welcome the recently announced wheat and maize prices and marvel at the government s effort in balancing viable producer prices and affordable subsidy levels consequently we wish to advise that the following maximum recommended prices of maize meal and bakers flour shall apply effective monday april 15 2019 gmaz chairman tafadzwa musarara said consumers will now have to part with rtgs11 85 for a 10kg bag of roller meal which used to cost rtgs 9 20 a 50kg bag of flour will now be sold at rtgs83 up from the previous rtgs 45 the national bakers association of zimbabwe president ngoni mazango said they would issue a statement on the prices of bread this week zimbabwe is battling a huge economic crisis which saw ugly riots breaking around the country in january this year after the government had sharply hiked the prices of fuel apart from having to contend with recurring fuel shortages the government is also struggling to stock public hospitals with critical medicines and modern equipment

i know these things are complicated i wrote three books about the gold standard the gold trilogy because just one was not enough so i will try to make it simple for nonspecialists 1 the united states embraced the principle of a gold based dollar for nearly two centuries until 1971 2 the united states during that time became the most successful economy in the world perhaps in the history of the world 3 the united states also enjoyed for nearly two centuries a steady rise in the income of the median worker since 1971 this has stagnated for the first time in u s history newworldeconomics com when you do the same thing over and over for nine generations and end up at the pinnacle of global wealth and influence is it because 1 you did something wrong 2 you did something right and when you then blow up the world monetary system setting off a disastrous decade of stagflation when incomes stagnate for decades despite lower tax rates and other advantages when interest rates go on a rampage that has taken forty years to tame when the value of the dollar is less than a thirtieth of its value in 1970 compared to gold and when in short your once great country needs to be made great again is this because 1 you did something right 2 you did something wrong i know these are hard questions they must be hard because nobody can find one single academic economist that gets it steve moore and herman cain get it along with i think donald trump and mike pence the fact of the matter is very few academic economists understand even the rudiments of the monetary principles that formed the foundation of the western world for centuries before 1971 as i detail in my books it was exactly this lack of understanding that led to the breakdown of the world monetary system that year some academics are actually pretty good among them are lawrence white of george mason university michael bordo of rutgers university giulio gallarotti a professor of government who had to step in due to economists inadequacies and surpassed the entire profession at wesleyan university and kevin dowd of durham university u k i am mentioning these people by name by way of contrast so that when i characterize the typical academic as ill informed and mistaken i mean precisely the gulf that separates people like white bordo gallarotti and dowd from the common academic riffraff the l a times article is interesting because it quickly makes a detour into the great depression somewhat odd don t you think for a short item for a general audience supposedly about current affairs this is because the great depression and people s reaction to it still forms much of the framework for monetary policy today every serious discussion soon becomes a discussion about the great depression if you look back on the history of the united states and the world during the gold standard years let s say 1500 to 1971 it is mostly rather good when there was peace a business friendly environment including low taxes and money based on gold the results were excellent time and time again in the u s and in any other country that tried it this is what i call the magic formula and it is the subject of my most recent book the magic formula however there is one major flaw or point of debate in this multi century track record of success the great depression on this and this alone rests all resistance to stable money in general and the gold standard in particular the traditional means of achieving stable money thus i think we should talk about it in the kind of plain language that fits in an op ed during the great depression we find that the environment was not business friendly at all and taxes and tariffs rose dramatically throughout the world in the u s the smoot hawley tariff of 1930 was followed by a series of domestic tax increases that brought the top income tax rate from 25 to 81 many governments around the world pursued a similar path as economies crumbled further socialistic intrusions were introduced such as president franklin roosevelt s national industrial recovery act of 1933 a disaster of socialistic central planning and price controls that was found unconstitutional by the supreme court in 1935 amity shlaes book the forgotten man has an excellent account of the nira and similar policies in the u s in time civil unrest and wars broke out the spanish civil war of 1936 the sino japanese war of 1937 the german annexation of austria in 1938 which as you can imagine is not really so good for business either with all this going on it is no surprise that economies crashed even though governments continued to maintain the gold standard at least at first the economists of the time didn t really understand what was going on they really didn t have any training or understanding of fiscal policy taxes tariffs regulations at all to them economies seemed to collapse for no good reason it seemed that capitalism was inherently unstable they called it a decline in aggregate demand which doesn t really mean much more than there s a recession since they didn t really understand what was going on they also could not propose any meaningful solutions it seemed that they were left with two options do nothing or engage in some kind of currency devaluation which governments had reached for throughout history when they got into trouble governments did leave the gold standard and devalue their currencies many of them by 1931 this did provide some relief there is a reason why devaluation has been popular for centuries but it also came with a basket of nasty consequences and soon became unpopular the u s which devalued in 1933 had an unemployment rate in the mid teens for the remainder of the decade the unemployment rate in france which did not devalue until 1936 never rose above 5 the estimated unemployment rate in germany which did not devalue was 44 in 1932 and 3 8 in 1938 the strongest recovery of any major economy thus when economists today say that the gold standard caused the great depression what they really mean is the gold standard prevented economists from using the one tool that they thought they understood which was currency devaluation in the face of a catastrophic collapse that mystified them in fact governments did devalue many of them at the relatively early date of 1931 and it didn t work very well but if all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail you can understand why these people would screech and wail about having their one tool taken away from them they would be left with do nothing a similar discussion erupted in 2012 certain european governments got into a heap of trouble including greece and spain the reason for this was actually similar to the great depression in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 many of these governments had big tax increases as part of an austerity strategy with predictable economic consequences a group of economists explicitly compared the shared euro currency to the gold standard of the 1930s it prevented greece or spain from dealing with their problems with a big currency devaluation they demanded that greece and spain leave the eurozone introduce their own independent currencies and devalue them but nobody blamed the euro itself for greece and spain s problems they were entirely nonmonetary in a similar way even the keynesian devaluationists barry eichengreen among them do not blame the gold standard for the problems of the 1930s but like the euro in 2012 the gold standard in the 1930s prevented governments from using currency devaluation to deal with their many non monetary problems let me point out that this is actually their interpretation not mine although i also agree with it it is not too hard to imagine that if spain and greece really did leave the eurozone and devalue by perhaps 60 as some suggested this might bring some short term relief and also some very nasty consequences giant losses for foreign investors and consequent bank failures among them provide no lasting solution to the high taxes and other unresolved nonmonetary problems in spain and greece and eventually prove to be unpopular with that we can see that the gold standard s track record over the two centuries before 1971 has no major blemishes it is really a debate about what one should do when non monetary problems of great depression like severity appear the difference between steve moore and herman cain and some other economists today is that moore and cain understand very well that big tax increases a worldwide tariff war socialistic intrusions in the market economy like roosevelt s nira civil unrest and war are bad for business the solutions to these problems are lower taxes a free market free trade international peace and domestic tranquility not a currency devaluation in other words they have many tools in their toolbox this is the kind of perspective that moore and cain can bring to the federal reserve we could use more like them

on it and they want to suppress alternative asset protection and wealth building information that can make people more self reliant like the kind in this letter to prosper in biden s america yes it s

prosperity the u s economy is now in shambles millions of americans have lost their jobs their life savings and soon it will be their homes while the u s military remains the most powerful force in the world the most immediate threats america now faces are closer to home these include companies forced out of business soaring government spending that will lead to hyperinflation runaway taxes

information about hidden inflation how it is ripping you off and what you can do to protect yourself the ultimate hyperinflation defense manual is probably among the most important guides i have ever offered you can t find this information anywhere else and you haven t a moment to lose a dire warning from two past federal reserve board chairs as the editor of the bob livingston letter i pay very close attention to recently resigned or soon to be departed high level u s officials once they are out of office many are remarkably candid even as the mainstream media stop reporting their words in my experience recently retired officials often hint at dangers to come leaving a trail of breadcrumbs in which americans like you and i should pay close attention that s why it s so important to note the departing warning of former federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan a man noted for understatement who flatly told congress serious economic disruptions are in the works due to trillions of dollars in federal obligations that will be visited upon taxpayers and retirees like a gigantic balloon payment and that was well before the trillions in helicopter money started raining down on america now listen to former fed chair paul volker who presided over 70 s era inflation and was even more blunt he warned that the chances of an all out dollar collapse due to runaway spending were greater than 50 50 these former insiders are referring to a level of unfunded liability by the federal government which is so gigantic as to boggle the mind to give you some idea of the scope of this problem the government would have to extract 473 000 from each and every u s household to cover the rapidly approaching national balloon payment on unfunded liabilities obviously something is going to have to give this is why i want to rush you information on how treasury bureaucrats are forming emergency contingency plans to freeze ira and 401 k accounts in the event of a national financial panic

because passive retirement planning is a thing of the past to get the most out of your life over 50 you can no longer listen to only one or two paid experts make your house payments and assume the best it s not enough anymore not by a long shot this is true if you re 10 15 years away from retirement and particularly if you are already in retirement the latter group has even more to lose through inaction how to live through hyperinflation in the past few months prices have been skyrocketing lumber prices have almost tripled real estate is soaring prices for some commodities have shot through the roof and let s not even talk about the grocery store but don t be fooled the current temporary period of inflation will soon be followed by even more massive inflation that s because president biden and his allies in congress have embarked on the biggest government spending spree in history this socialistic expansion of government will inevitably lead to a devaluation of the u s dollar hyperinflation that could wipe out your life savings imagine a world of 20 per gallon of gasoline 50 hamburgers and average housing rentals costing 10 000 a month or more the economic stimulus packages of the last few years alone will amount to 6 trillion nearly 7 times what the troubled assets relief program tarp program spent and the stimulus plan is only the tip of the iceberg when you add in the unfunded liabilities that s trillions the government doesn t have over the next few years whether the government borrows it or prints it an increase that big in the money supply is going to do only one thing send inflation through the roof the last time the u s government tried to spend its way out of a recession in the 1970s the inflation rate increased by 500 the ultimate

today is tax day the due date for americans to file their 2018 taxes it also marks a milestone the country has made it through a full year of president trump s new tax code and the first filing season under the new rules trump and his fellow republicans promised their bill would cut taxes make filing simpler and boost wages business spending and the overall economy trump signed the most sweeping overhaul of the u s tax code in three decades into law on dec 22 2017 with no democratic votes with year one in the books it s fair to say some of those promises came true some did not and for some it s still too early to definitely say here s a rundown of what we know so far 1 promise your taxes will fit on a postcard this didn t happen the main form almost all tax filers fill out the 1040 did shrink but much of the information that used to appear on the 1040 now appears on schedules meaning a lot of taxpayers simply ended up filling out more pages instructions for the main form also grew by 10 pages advertisement a key selling point was that many americans could take advantage of the higher standard deduction 12 000 for single filers and 24 000 for married couples so they would not have to itemize their deductions but experts say people still had to keep track of their various charitable receipts and state and local taxes to figure out whether taking the standard deduction was their best option it s not simpler the only real piece that was removed from the 1040 was the personal exemption and that was just one line said bradley heim an indiana university professor and former economist in treasury s office of tax analysis a lot of what was changed was lines were taken from the 1040 and moved to other schedules but heim says many taxpayers probably won t notice the extra schedules and instructions because most people use some sort of service or computer program to do their taxes for them advertisement 2 promise the middle class will benefit yes the vast majority of americans 65 percent did get a tax cut looking specifically at the middle class the tax policy center predicted that 82 percent of middle class earners households who make 49 000 to 86 000 a year would receive a tax cut averaging about 1 050 the data out so far backs up the estimates h r block said that among the millions of tax returns it processed by the end of march the average tax cut was 1 200 it s also true not everyone is celebrating about 9 percent of middle income families had to pay more and the rest paid about the same in taxes according to the tax policy center 3 promise your wages will rise trump kept claiming the average american would get 4 000 more a year because of the tax bill that hasn t panned out although there is good news on pay advertisement some companies gave employees a one time bonus or raised pay and credited the tax bill but that affected a few million people out of the nearly 157 million employed the white house is now pointing to the rise in average hourly pay as a sign of success for the average worker wages are now growing more than 3 percent a year according to the labor department and they are growing fastest for lower income workers that s the best nominal not adjusted for cost of living gain in about a decade but it s important to point out that wage gains had been slowly trending up for the past several years in 2015 wages rose an average of 2 3 percent in 2017 it was about 2 6 percent economists say the tax bill probably helped push wages above 3 percent but there was some momentum already for a worker making 60 000 a year the faster wage growth added about 240 more than what the person would have received if wages had remained at the 2017 pace advertisement some of the gains from higher wages and lower taxes have been offset by inflation there are several measures of inflation but none of them shows prices rising fast enough to erase workers wage gains right now mainly because gas prices haven t jumped much in the past year 4 promise the tax cut will pay for itself this is not happening the white house stood almost alone on this vow economists and budget experts across the political spectrum predicted the tax bill s 1 5 trillion price tag would have to be funded mostly by debt the early results indicate that is exactly what is happening despite a strong economy tax receipts are down the committee for a responsible federal budget predicts the budget deficit this fiscal year will hit almost 900 billion the tax bill accounts for 230 billion of that deficit or about a quarter of it the crfb calculated advertisement 5 promise there will be a capex boom there was a bounce but it might be short lived capex stands for capital expenditures a wall street term for the investments that businesses make in equipment technology new buildings and research these kinds of investments tend to make workers more productive which boosts wages and economic growth the white house argued this is what the tax bill was all about and why it would cause much faster growth for years to come here s what capex looks like in recent quarters according to the commerce department there s a noticeable jump in the first and second quarters of 2018 just after the tax bill is enacted but that momentum appears to be fading back to more normal levels i m not buying the thesis that the tax cuts gave the biggest boost to capex said rajeev dhawan director of the economic forecasting center at georgia state university if tax cuts cause capex boom then why did it fizzle in the second half of the year advertisement some argue that businesses need more time to digest the tax code changes before they make these big investment decisions so there could be another surge but dhawan points out that surveys like morgan stanley s capex plans index aren t predicting that for this year 6 promise money will come flooding back from abroad so far it has been a trickle trump kept talking about 4 trillion to 5 trillion that big companies had stashed overseas because they didn t want to bring the money back to the united states and get socked by a high tax rate trump cut the tax rate on repatriated money and said it would unleash a flood of cash coming home according to government data 665 billion has come back so far a fraction of the roughly 3 trillion many analysts believe is overseas but experts say there are many reasons companies might be waiting including that the lower tax rate will be in place for several years advertisement it s really too early to tell fortune 500 company tax directors are still figuring out the law and how to do their taxes said victor fleischer a tax law professor at the university of california at irvine they haven t really gotten to the step of changing the way they make investments going forward 7 promise more companies will want to do business in the united states business sentiment jumped after the largest corporate tax cut in u s history executives of big companies gave trump a warm welcome at the world economic forum just after the bill passed and firms like jpmorgan chase reported billions in tax savings last year which helped boost profits and stock prices but it remains to be seen whether businesses will use the extra cash on hand to invest here a few companies have made a big show of opening a new plant in the united states but the hard data show the 500 largest public companies have used their tax savings to buy back stock far more than they have on capital spending 8 promise gdp will be 3 percent or higher yes trump basically achieved this in the first year after the tax cuts the official statistic is 2 9 percent but the way many economists prefer to calculate gross domestic product growth showed 3 percent advertisement trump has predicted similar growth every year for the next decade but almost no one else agrees with that forecast most experts say growth this year will be closer to 2 percent even a white house report released last month asserted it would take additional tax cuts and a big infrastructure bill to keep growth as high as trump wants for years to come 9 promise americans will love this bill more people give the bill a thumbs down than a thumbs up according to the realclearpolitics tracker a trend that has been pretty consistent since it passed republicans didn t even campaign on it much during the midterm election but kevin hassett head of trump s council of economic advisers points out that trump s approval rating on the economy overall is pretty good right now in a cnn poll last month for example 71 percent of americans said the economy is in good shape the highest reading since 2001 in that poll in short polling on the tax bill splits mostly along partisan lines but americans seem pretty happy with the economy overall right now and some of that is due to tax cuts a key reason many disapprove of the tax cuts is because while most americans did receive a lower tax bill the biggest benefits went to the wealthy according to independent analyses 10 refunds there was no promise on refunds but fewer people received one this year and they are not happy about it according to irs data through the first week in april about 800 000 fewer tax filers received refunds a number that s likely to grow by the end of the tax season tax refunds tell you nothing about how much someone paid in taxes most americans did pay less in federal taxes in 2018 but they received that savings via fatter paychecks last year instead of in a one time payment getting a refund means someone overpaid taxes to the government during the year and thus gets that extra money back many people paid less in taxes at all income levels said john petosa an accountant and professor of practice at the martin j whitman school of management at syracuse university but i had a number of clients that had to write a check at the end of the year because even though they paid less overall in taxes they didn t have enough tax withheld from their paycheck they weren t used to that and they felt the tax cut promise hadn t been delivered upon most tax experts advise people not to get a refund but republicans learned just how much americans love their refunds as outrage grew about smaller or disappearing refunds

ana garcia socialist project the rise of the far right is a worldwide phenomenon rooted in the nefarious effects of neoliberal globalization which have pushed the world into mass unemployment and enormous inequalities i consider it to be a late political effect of the global financial crisis that hit the world at the beginning of the twenty first century it is not an easy task to explain the phenomenon of jair bolsonaro in brazil and to understand the groups that support him both within and outside government it s difficult for anyone to draw a truly complete and sober analysis of what we have experienced this essay is not based on in depth research but on collective reflections and debates i intend to pose some key questions and try to identify some clues to answer them despite its innumerable concessions to the bourgeoisie why was the workers party pt attacked by the right wing forces creating space for the emergence of bolsonarism first of all the effects of the 2008 economic crises were felt quite late but they were profound in brazil low commodity prices and economic slowdown had a perverse effect on employment levels the gdp dropped 7 2 per cent between 2015 2016 and unemployment reached 12 during the 2018 election year the economic crisis also generated a political crisis which led to massive street demonstrations in june 2013 and it recently turned into an ideological crisis on the bourgeois side the crisis revealed its deeply anti social and truculent character the modest gains that the poor had made in terms of social rights during the pt governments yearly increases in the minimum salary access to higher education racial and social quotas labour rights for domestic workers income transfer programs resources for the poor north and northeast regions etc were forcefully repudiated by upper classes in large urban centers and by the rural bourgeoisie linked to agribusiness it was not acceptable in their view that afro descendants indigenous or northeastern working class individuals and families could sit side by side with white southern upper middle class students in a university classroom or travelers on an airplane the difference between us and them had gotten blurred in social spaces even though the material economic differences were still very deep the ideological crisis is not limited to the upper social classes it is even more evident among the middle and lower middle classes these classes had enjoyed high levels of consumption access to university and formal employment during the best moments of the pt era 2002 2016 however with the economic crisis these social strata lost their material gains and today they make up a mass of unemployed and precarious workers who suffer from low quality public services this mass of workers without rights typified by uber drivers or informal cosmetics saleswomen channeled their feelings of anger and rancor toward the pt anti petismo among this precarious working class conservative values anti feminist anti lgbtq and anti communist were strengthened and reinforced by the proselytism of evangelical pentecostal churches and the diffusion of fake news in addition to all this traditional political parties even right wing parties are experiencing a crisis of representation the first signs of this crisis became evident during the protests of june 2013 which along with claims for basic rights to transportation health and education brought out anti political party sentiments or in a more general way an anti politics stance the diffuse notion that politics implies corruption has become very widespread the inefficiencies of politics were to be solved through merit and personal efforts the idea of meritocracy this crisis of representation deepened after the 2014 general elections and it penetrated the impeachment process of dilma rousseff in 2016 precarious workers do not identify themselves as working class let alone identify with the workers party eventually these workers without rights identified themselves ideologically with jair bolsonaro who has managed to occupy the empty space of politics the anti politics feelings disseminated among the popular masses were then filled with an over politicization based on hatred bolsonaro presented himself as a charismatic leader who would liberate them from all ills and resolve the nation s problems as the leader who came from the people a simple person who shared their language tastes and culture by communicating through social media bolsonaro generates a sense of closeness to his supporters a second aspect that the bolsonaro phenomenon reveals to us are the limitations of class conciliation in different parts of the world the moderate left and social democratic parties in government on many occasions have shared this illusion of the possibility of class conciliation in the case of the pt it was possible to respond to the interests of the different social classes up to a certain point and under particular economic conditions that allowed for the expansion of public spending but in the long run and with the impact of the economic crisis class conciliation did not hold up historically the balance will always weigh to one side and in brazil it turned against the pt itself without being able to maintain a conciliation of interests neither could the brazilian state during the last pt years sustain cohesion between the different factions of the ruling class this is a third aspect of the current situation that has to be considered the creation of large national monopolies that benefitted certain sectors to the detriment of others for example credit from the national development bank bndes was given to some construction conglomerates the government s attempts to artificially stabilize energy and gas prices the regulation of oil and gas exploitation at the pre sal coast etc were among the policies that showed excessive from a market perspective state intervention in the economy leading to contradictions between different factions of the bourgeoisie these contradictions are the central challenge for the sustainability of bolsonaro s government does it or does it not have the capacity to organize the interests of different factions of capital and represent them as the interests of the entire nation all this points to the one who is in charge of this task the minister of the economy paulo guedes discussed below proposed pension reform and labour reform would be cohesive bourgeois projects against the interests of the workers who makes up bolsonaro s social base the election of bolsonaro and many parliamentarians linked to religious groups reveals the growth in the political power of evangelical pentecostal churches this growth had been evident in municipal and regional elections for decades but it reached its highest level in the last election the churches provide a solid social base for conservatism in the urban peripheries where they did grassroots work during the campaign there are reports of cults where a pastor promoted bolsonaro and his allies directly distributing campaign pamphlets together with church pamphlets against abortion etc on the day that he won the election bolsonaro began his speech with a prayer led by an evangelical pastor live on national television for the left the question now is how to rebuild the work at the grassroots and re establish a dialogue with the poor in the favelas and in the peripheries and in the churches to counter reactionary groups another fundamental support base for bolsonaro is provided by the petty bourgeoisie including the commercial and the retail sector as well as liberal professionals such as lawyers doctors engineers etc these are sectors that are directly affected by high taxes and the costs of labour and social security rights there are some significant examples like the mobilization and protests of brazilian doctors against the pt social program more doctors which had been bringing cuban doctors to work in remote under served areas of brazil and the 2018 truckers strike against rising fuel prices which had the effect of stopping deliveries and crating supply shortages throughout the country there have also been several demonstrations calling for military intervention in addition there were some grotesque episodes that involved different segments of the petty bourgeoisie during the electoral campaign luciano hang owner of havan department stores called a meeting with his employees during which he tried to coerce them into voting for bolsonaro with the threat of closing stores a businessman promised free lunch at a churrascaria for employees if bolsonaro won the owner of a house of prostitution offered a free beer on the day after the election if the results were positive for his candidate in the countryside bolsonaro had broad support from large agricultural producers and the agribusiness sector in addition to their economic and ideological affinity support for the liberalization of weapons and the criminalization of peasant movements this sector also has a cultural affinity with bolsonaro exemplified by the support of national country music stars for bolsonaro in this regard there was also a regional division with the south and central west agricultural provinces leading in the votes for bolsonaro while provinces in the northeast and partially in the north voted mostly for pt in urban areas and big cities the middle classes and precarious workers as already mentioned formed a mass base that had improved its consumption power during the pt years but lost employment and purchasing power in the crisis and was forced to migrate to the informal market they became a strong base of support for bolsonaro driven by anti pt ideology the financial sector and large corporations expressed support for bolsonaro only at the end of his campaign other outsider names for the presidency had been tested but didn t succeed bolsonaro s frightening method of doing politics with inflamed speeches of hatred and violence was countered by his sponsorship of an ultra liberal economist paulo guedes guedes had graduated from the university of chicago and as he presented incisive arguments for privatization cutting public expenditure and shrinking state bureaucracy he gained support in the upper bourgeoisie as a newspaper article pointed out wall street would have preferred psdb candidate geraldo alckmin but paulo guedes would guarantee in the eyes of international financial markets the necessary reforms and privatization of the last state owned companies such as petrobras in this sense a bolsonaro government would be the first truly and contradictorily liberal government in brazil bolsonaro and his group managed to combine in a peculiar way ultra conservatism in political and social values with ultra liberalism in economic terms it is certain that this combination was present for example in the bush administration since 2001 in the usa in latin america pinochet pursued economic ultra liberalism in the 1970s in brazil however it is unprecedented especially in light of the participation of the military in bolsonaro s coalition which has been traditionally nationalistic with regard to the economy how did bolsorano succeed despite the irrationality of his discourse and all the international pressure what were the principal means for his victory first the mobilization of fear was fundamental fear of communism fear of feminism fear of weakening traditional family values fear of urban violence fear of land invasions fear of losing jobs all fueled by class race and gender resentments the alleged threats were operationalized by non traditional ways of doing politics and campaigning the same ones used for brexit and in the election of donald trump but adapted to brazilian conditions central to the strategy was the diffusion of fake news via whatsapp which has become the most capillary form of communication in brazilian society today the spread of fake news did not create but it increased exponentially the more conservative values to be found in the bosom of brazilian society during the past year we have experienced extreme levels of stigmatization and demonization of feminists fueled by conservative values regarding the traditional family an environment of violence and murder of lgbtqs 445 murders with homophobic motivation in 2017 and a vague and confused idea that brazil was heading toward communism generating a strong anti communist ideology it has reached the point of glorifying the torturers within the brazilian civil military dictatorship 1964 1982 88 and creating a present threat of communist dictatorship emanating from the pt for us on the left the question remains how did we not see all this coming to react in a timely manner and confront the massive dissemination of fake news in whatsapp groups among our families and friends second bolsonaro and his groups have succeeded in channeling the anti corruption ethos and the demand for change to their advantage the so called car wash operation scandal revealed corruption schemes among construction companies and the state oil company petrobras public officials and the pt were directly implicated the judiciary assumed a mediating and political role that is unprecedented in the country s political history less known are the international linkages of the scandal especially to u s interests whose role still needs to be clarified specifically the interests of oil multinationals to end petrobras special rights over the exploitation of the oil reserves of the pre sal region these were all openly discussed issues that led to jailing of national pt figures and to a moral defeat of the entire left the arrest of lula da silva marks the culmination of that defeat lula s imprisonment is eminently political given the speed with which his condemnation and imprisonment were carried out moreover there is a lack of solid evidence against him since his trial was based on allegations of other politicians and businessmen already in jail with lula leading the polls there was a slimmer chance for bolsonaro to actually win once lula was prohibited from running election results in favor of bolsonaro were almost a given it is in this context that bolsonaro sought to convince the brazilian electorate that he would be a new kind of political leader who would build a government with people of proven technical merit in their companies and in public institutions he claimed he would end the practice of appointments based on political ideological affinities obviously this has not happened instead one ideology has been replaced by another again bolsonaro has managed to occupy the empty space in politics how is the bolsonaro government formed under what pillars and groups the restructuring of the brazilian state began with substantive changes in its institutional and bureaucratic structure a super ministry of the economy was created resulting from the merger of the ministries of finance planning industry and trade and labour all are now under the command of an ultra liberal figure paulo guedes within this super ministry a number of new councils committees and secretariats have been set up following the new economic line these include the secretariat of de bureaucratization and the secretariat of de nationalization and de investment their agenda includes plans for privatization of state owned enterprises pension reform deepening of labour reform greater trade liberalization and access to indigenous land for mining corporations at the same time many of the state institutions created by the pt government and linked to social and labour sectors have been dismantled these include the labour ministry ministry of the cities and urban planning the national council of food and nutrition security ministry of culture the agency for indigenous issues funai and the ministry of agrarian development these changes in the institutional materiality of the state were accompanied by many new appointments to public offices far from following electoral promises of appointment based on technical merit the new appointees were chosen on political and ideological grounds two main groups are central to the occupation of state posts first representatives of the military were spread in all ministries occupying one third of the high ranking positions either as ministers or in other key posts among the ministries headed by military appointees are defense mines and energy science and technology and infrastructure and institutional security as well as the vice presidency the other main group in apparent dispute with the military sector is made up of representatives of the ultra conservative ideology linked to olavo de carvalho a proto philosopher who resides in the u s carvalho gives courses online is linked to steve bannon and is highly influential among bolsonoro supporters bolsonaro s son eduardo is playing the role of articulator for this group as he was designated by bannon as the principal leader of the movement of the far right in latin america the strong influence of bannon and olavo de carvalho became evident after bolsonaro s visit to the usa two of carvalho s former students were named as heads of two key ministries education and foreign affairs in education ultra conservative followers of carvalho and representatives of pentecostal churches aim to combat gender ideology and marxist indoctrination in schools and universities the minister of education has recently declared that school history textbooks will be revised to tell the truth about the 1964 coup e tat and the subsequent 21 years of military dictatorship arguing that it was supported by a broad social movement and succeeded in freeing brazil from communism in foreign affairs they defend patriotism against multilateral negotiations as in the case of climate change or migration but the limit of this patriotism is in direct alignment with trump and israel ideologically they intend to combat what they call cultural marxism and globalism despite the apparent dispute of military vs olavistas both groups within the government are united in the ultra liberal economic agenda despite the military s past nationalism evidence is provided by the concession of the alcântara base for u s military use the sale of embraer to boeing and the support for the pension reform what are the government s main projects as presented to date the first major agenda item is the pension reform its pillars are the higher minimum age for retirement and increases in social security contributions the big argument has been the end of privileges with reference to the benefits of public versus private sector employees what is really involved is a reduction in the role of the state as the guarantor of pensions an increase in overexploitation of the labour force 40 years of contributions to social security as prerequisite for receiving a full pension and the introduction of capitalization which means insurance company participation even for the poorest according to the head of the congress everyone can work until they re 80 years old this shows total insensitivity and class blindness since the average life expectancy in brazil is 70 years two other projects in the economic area will also have a devastating impact one is the possibility of untying the budget from the constitutional spending clauses on education and health currently the brazilian constitution stipulates that 18 of the national budget be spent on education and 13 on health if the government succeeds in eliminating these clauses brazil s congress will decide how the budget is allocated without any obligation to these sectors another economic project with potentially devastating effects is the new labour regime it would allow workers and employers to negotiate bilaterally without considering collective bargaining workers would lose collective rights to negotiate working conditions in addition to undermining the bargaining power of unions this project perversely poses the choice between maintaining guaranteed rights or having one s own job the so called green and yellow labour card would be an alternative to the formal blue labour card with collectively bargained constitutional rights another major project is the public security program a change in legislation has already taken place to permit the carrying of weapons and the security program aims to target organized crime groups the project signals a growing criminalization of social movements and heightened anti terrorism measures in the countryside violence against activists and militants of social movements led to the murder of 57 activists in 2017 on the other hand the project also mentions the fight against paramilitary forces called militias in urban centers yet one of bolsonaro s sons flavio when he was a deputy in the state of rio de janeiro hired for his office two members of the militia group accused of being involved in the murder of marielle franco beyond this one of the two men arrested for murdering marielle was found in his house in the same condominium where bolsonaro lives in rio the relationship of bolsonaro and his family to the paramilitary groups needs to be investigated but there is no sign of this being done by former judge moro and his team in the ministry of justice the ultra conservative agenda on gender feminism and lgbt rights is being implemented by the ministry of women family and human rights formerly human rights secretariat this ministry is led by a representative of a pentecostal church and will have strong impact on education health and social rights finally it is worth mentioning an exponential increase in the use of agrochemicals in brazilian agriculture this impacts directly on food quality and the health of the population there is a reinforcement of rural settlements policies that changes land that facilitates private property titling and further attacks on indigenous peoples and quilombolas historic afro brazilian settlements with the termination of indigenous land demarcations and titling what are the contradictions among these different groups what contradictory effects might their different agendas have although the above mentioned projects make up an ultra conservative field they often do not fit well together there is no cohesion among the groups in the state structure under bolsonaro different projects are not organized into one single front and bolsonaro may well prove himself incapable of organizing the interests of the different class factions that are now disputing his government on the external front groups linked to olavo de carvalho want to align brazil closely with the u s and trump this was confirmed during the recent visit to washington the alcantara base in the state of maranhão in the amazon region was opened to the u s military americans and canadians will be exempt from visas to enter the country brazil wants to integrate into the oecd to the detriment of alliances with countries of the south together with other conservative governments bolsonaro has dissolved the union of south american nations unasur this leading foreign policy group stands side by side with the u s in containing china s economic expansion in latin america and the world however china is brazil s main trade partner accounting for 25 of brazil s total international trade sales to china became deeply concentrated in exports of agricultural and mineral commodities during the pt era and in the last months 90 of brazil s soy exports went to china due to restrictions on u s soy in the chinese market in this sense ideological impulses clash with economic ones and brazil stands in the middle of the u s china trade war with regard to the venezuelan crisis the ultra conservative wing was restrained from direct intervention by the military groups within the government which resisted the impulses of the ultras out of concerns for regional destabilization the evangelical pentecostal groups are demanding that brazil move its embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem with strong support by groups linked to olavo de carvalho arab countries however are the main importers of chicken meat produced by brazilian agribusiness the announcement about moving the embassy generated reactions in the arab world including threats to cut imports and the move did not go ahead instead bolsonaro announced the opening of a commercial office in jerusalem additionally agribusiness corporate interests and their protectionist bias against the entry of foreign competitors and against changes in import tariffs clashed with the liberal bias of the ministry of economy which sought to eliminate milk import tariffs the ministry had to retreat under agribusiness pressure finally the package of public security measures was sent to the national congress but its president has resisted a vote on them prioritizing the pension reform instead this has created tensions between the legislative and executive branches in the figure of the minister of justice who was head of the car wash operation thus implying tensions also with the judiciary branch the financial sector which had high expectations of rapid action on pension reform was disappointed as the reform was given less priority in comparison to other issues such as bolsonaro s foreign agenda the stock market has dropped as journalists comment on how market agents cannot understand the direction of the government the election of jair bolsonaro in brazil impacts on all of the latin american region just as lula s election in 2002 influenced the start of the pink tide period at the beginning of the century today the far right in chile uruguay and venezuela to name a few becomes stronger because of the political turn that brazil has taken since the impeachment of rousseff in 2016 to be sure the sustainability of the bolsonaro government will depend on its capacity to organize the interests of different factions of the bourgeoisie and to present these as representative of the interests of the entire nation he has not been capable of doing this so far the international crisis scenario and popular struggles could destabilize his government even more bolsonaro and his allies were united in their determination to overthrow the pt but lost or never had control over the boat s direction ana garcia is professor of international relations at the federal rural university of rio de janeiro and a researcher at pacs more stories republish this story

washington dc youssef boutros ghali former egyptian finance minister said egypt is not in need of another loan from the international monetary fund imf but the country s government though it is not weak needs competencies and experienced people which is much more important than financial resources ghali elaborated the imf s procedures are difficult but necessary and the egyptians absorbed the shock but we have to concentrate on other important issues now daily news egypt interviewed ghali to discuss his perspective regarding the assessment of egypt s economic reform programme the transcript for which is below lightly edited for clarity how do you view the imf programme and to what extent did it succeed the imf programme in egypt has produced positive results but at the expense of the poor it is necessary to deal with the fund from an egyptian point of view and the recipe cannot be taken as it is to ensure that the poor do not suffer however the imf is not tasked with verifying the adherence of the poor but it is tasked with re establishing the financial balance of countries that are in trouble most governments that are in trouble resort to borrowing from the imf the fund recommends some measures for these countries and they have the right to approve or reject them do you think that egypt needs a new imf loan or extend the current one egypt has the ability to discipline itself and adhere to the economic reforms without the need for another loan from the fund president al sisi has the firmness and ability to do what he wants and he does not fear reform but he needs help from the government and his ministers egypt is not in need of another loan from the imf because egypt s government is not weak but it needs competencies and experienced people which is much more important than the presence of financial resources the fund s procedures are difficult but necessary and we absorbed the shock but we have to concentrate on other important issues now the imf expected in its world economic outlook weo in april 2019 that the egyptian economy will grow by 5 5 this year and by 5 9 in 2020 how do you see the performance of the administrative body in egypt the administrative body in egypt are still suffering from some bureaucracy that may affect the smooth inflow of foreign direct investments fdis on the application of the one stop shop recently in egypt i think that the country needs some time to implement it but it is not presently effective which may have a significant impact on fdis the idea is not to create a single window for all competent authorities but rather to facilitate the procedures for investors through a single authority or agency and not a single window and since many agencies do not want the withdrawal of any authority from them this is the main cause of the problem of multiple procedures and bureaucracy do you think that there will be an imminent devaluation of the pound i do not think there is a future depreciation in the exchange rate so there is no need to move prices as i believe it will be stable i see that our problem in egypt is not how we lower prices but how we provide incomes to face the high prices and inflation how would the receding global economy affect egypt s growth the problem facing economists today is that all indicators in all countries which lead world growth are negative therefore there is nothing to prevent the global economy from deteriorating hence there is fear that global growth rates will continue to decline which will have a significant impact on the egyptian economy because it is a member of the global economy and the country s fdis will be lower the imf s weo which was released early last week projects a slowdown in growth in 2019 for 70 of the global economy global growth softened to 3 6 in 2018 and is projected to decline further to 3 3 in 2019 the downward revision in growth of 0 2 percentage points for 2019 from the january projection is also broad based it reflects negative revisions for several major economies including the euro area latin america the united states the united kingdom canada and australia what is the solution the solution is to activate economic recovery policies at the level of countries and complement each other in different countries china for example has a declining growth rate thus it has not depended on export development to revive its economy because its export development will reflect on another country therefore the external sector will pressure the domestic economy but it has to encourage its domestic consumption germany too has a surplus in its public budget and it has to turn it into deficit to encourage consumption which would stimulate other european and developing countries the current discussion is to follow policies to restore growth rates so as to become homogenous among different countries which requires coordination between these countries decision makers these policies success depends on the knowledge of the problems and the procedures required to resolve them second is knowing other decision makers and the convergence of state policies what are the promising economic sectors in egypt tourism sector is one of the egyptian sectors that has started to recover recently but it is taking some time to reach 2010 levels i expect the egyptian real estate market will witness a significant deceleration in the coming period but the demand will continue because it is a safe haven for investment in light of the deterioration of individual investments in some other sectors with regard to the new oil discoveries i think that the energy sector is the most promising in terms of attracting fdis and applying the mechanism of one stop shop how do you see the performance of the egyptian economic ministerial group some egyptian ministers are consulting me on a few economic issues nevertheless the ministers in egypt must work together the economic group under mubarak s era was homogeneous and cohesive i had an insight into the period of my ministry through moving to take precautions before facing several economic problems in the presence of the political will rejecting any change or movement in prices at the time how do you deal with the cases filed against you i m working on these problems and i hope to return to the country by the way i did not exploit the printers of the ministry of finance in the service of my election propaganda in 2010 prosecutors investigations said that ghali took advantage as a finance minister to exploit the printing centre of the ministry of finance to print large quantities of electoral advertising materials for his candidacy for parliament in 2010 in february the cairo criminal court sentenced him to 15 years in prison in absentia

15 04 2019 9768 zeichen eurozone down to potential growth or lower central and eastern europe resilient though not immune financial markets monetary policy normalization is coming to an end the global economy is expected to keep expanding in 2019 20 although at a slower pace than previously global output is forecast to grow by 3 3 3 5 and 3 6 in 2019 and 2020 after 3 6 3 7 in 2018 oecd imf hence growth expectations neither imply a dramatic slowdown nor the onset of a global recession both developed and emerging economies exhibit a business cycle slowdown as well as all major regions around the globe except for latin america figure 1 however a lot of imponderability surrounds the current economic outlook including the evolution of the brexit and the trade war we do not know how and even if the uk will leave the eu during the next weeks or months brexit is a process not an event the uncertainty is affecting business sentiment and financial markets in the short run and there is substantive literature on the long run effects central estimates of academic forecasts indicate a loss of 2 3 of uk gdp compared to remaining in the eu while subject to the type of the exit shock estimates incorporating dynamic effects increase to a 5 8 loss of gdp in the long run after a long period of ultra loose monetary policy and a very slow abandonment the normalization of the interest rate environment is ending in the united states monetary policy of the fed is about to reach a stance which is neither supportive nor restrictive for the real economy on the other side the european central bank s exit from ultra loose monetary policy has been postponed amid the growth slow down and muted inflation expectations basically our main scenario for both economies is that growth is converging towards its potential growth usa 2 0 ea 1 5 central and eastern europe has strong trade linkages with the euro area most notably with germany and slower euro area growth will ultimately spill over to many cee countries thus far the region has shunned an abrupt cooling due to healthy domestic demand we expect to observe negative spill over effects lagging around one year while our cee

ameco 0 3 in q4 2018 supply side constraints force economic growth towards a sustainable potential growth rate 1 5 however there is significant uncertainty about the aggregate demand sentiment indicators have been sliding figure 3 uncertainty about brexit and the trade war can further dampen economic sentiment and hence consumption and investment sliding export has second round effects on investment and employment on the other side monetary policy remains accommodative and fiscal policy turns more supportive in 2019 and cushion negative shocks central and eastern europe resilient

at lot of labor markets are very tight in central europe ce economic conditions remain favorable see table 1 for key figures and forecasts gdp growth surprised to the upside in 2018 in 2019 growth is expected to move closer its long run potential as capacity constraints are intensifying due to strong trade linkages the continued growth slow down in germany remains a risk ultimately slower euro

federal reserve ends its interest rate hiking cycle based on business cycle uncertainty signs of a cooling and stable though muted inflation a business cycle slow down since h2 2018 and muted

outlook are tilted to the downside in march the ecb loosened monetary policy and announced additional targeted long term refinancing operations tltros for banks and a change of the forward guidance the key ecb interest rates are now anticipated to remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019 previously the ecb had signaled that key interest rates remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 the change in the forward guidance shifts changes in the key interest rates backward based on the outlook a very slow rise in the main policy rates starting in 2020 would be an option nevertheless the low interest rate environment is here to stay in january the fed changed its monetary policy stance there are no more increases in the federal funds rate indicated

news national by staff reporter get latest news by email subscribe powered by long suffering zimbabweans should brace for even tougher economic times ahead following last week s surprise announcement by finance minister mthuli ncube that the country would have yet another currency within a year a move experts say will drive up the prices of basic goods and also cause shortages the warning comes as most big supermarkets and other retail shops around the country have hiked the prices of basic consumer goods sharply raising the cost of living for ordinary citizens ncube s announcement which one analyst described as a bolt from the blue yesterday was made hardly three months after the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz had introduced the rtgs dollar together with an interbank market which allows the formal trading of foreign currency by banks business leaders and political analysts who spoke to the daily news said ncube s announcement which he made in the united states where he was attending international monetary fund imf meetings undermined the confidence that the government was desperately trying to build a treasury insider also bemoaned what he called ncube s tendency to surprise the markets and create unnecessary confusion undermining confidence has negative implications on inflation prices and the exchange rate talking about a local currency at the moment is premature as we already have an rtgs dollar in this day and age of moving towards a cash lite society concentrating on a physical currency is retrogressive the insider added former finance minister in the short lived but stability inducing government of national unity gnu tendai biti also said ncube s statement had undermined recent rbz measures warning that the prices of basic goods were going to shoot through the roof as a result that is rank madness how does one change currencies like they are changing diapers what is the point of changing the name of the currency if it will suffer the same fate as the bond note the rtgs dollar will now depreciate even more and the black market rates will rise it will have a catastrophic impact on industry which relies mainly on imports biti told the daily news there will inevitably be fuel shortages as well and this will also come with more company closures and increases in prices there will be massive externalisation as people trade offshore and there will also be increased budget deficits he added university of zimbabwe political science lecturer eldred masunungure described ncube s announcement as being based on wishful thinking there is consensus among stakeholders including consumers that economic fundamentals around productivity have not changed much hence it is clear that the announcement is wishful thinking as it is not backed by the situation obtaining on the ground until the so called fundamentals are right there is no end in sight of our problems as a country because the currency will suffer the same fate as the rtgs so ncube s proposal is not prudent and is bound to fail especially if there is no increase in productivity to have reserves that will hedge the currency masunungure said in february the rbz introduced the rtgs dollar when it unveiled its monetary policy statement which sought to breathe new life into the economy however the rtgs dollar which opened trading at 2 5 against the us dollar has since lost nearly 25 percent of its value with the interbank market battling to attract money at the same time the black market continues to give more attractive exchange rates forcing sellers to do business there and in turn leading companies to buy forex for their needs at a high premium following ncube s announcement the forex parallel markets shot to nearly rtgs 5 to the greenback amid indications that the situation could quickly get worse on their part business leaders said the government needed to look at the problems which were pushing up prices and inflation in the country before it started talking of introducing a new currency confederation of zimbabwe industries czi president sifelani jabangwe also said price increases were likely to continue unless there was stability in the economy what is important is that we stabilise now before the new currency is introduced jabangwe said confederation of zimbabwe retailers czr president denford mutashu said it would be futile to bring a new currency without first addressing all the problems afflicting the economy the hope is that government and monetary authorities are taking the necessary steps in terms of getting the fundamentals right before they launch a new currency he said many shops in harare which were visited by a daily news crew at the weekend had sharply increased their prices of most goods such as sugar beans cooking oil flour eggs mazoe orange crush meat rice and soap the rise in the prices of cereals and grains were necessitated by the government s decision to hike grain producer prices last tuesday the government increased the producer price of maize from rtgs 390 a tonne to rtgs 726 while wheat was increased from rtgs 630 to rtgs 1 089 69 resultantly the grain millers association of zimbabwe gmaz at the weekend announced new and higher prices of mealie meal in a letter addressed to industry and commerce minister mangaliso ndlovu the millers said the price increase would come into effect today we welcome the recently announced wheat and maize prices and marvel at the government s effort in balancing viable producer prices and affordable subsidy levels consequently we wish to advise that the following maximum recommended prices of maize meal and bakers flour shall apply effective monday april 15 2019 gmaz chairman tafadzwa musarara said consumers will now have to part with rtgs11 85 for a 10kg bag of roller meal which used to cost rtgs 9 20 a 50kg bag of flour will now be sold at rtgs83 up from the previous rtgs 45 the national bakers association of zimbabwe president ngoni mazango said they would issue a statement on the prices of bread this week zimbabwe is battling a huge economic crisis which saw ugly riots breaking around the country in january this year after the government had sharply hiked the prices of fuel apart from having to contend with recurring fuel shortages the government is also struggling to stock public hospitals with critical medicines and modern equipment
