jack rasmus invasion of venezuela by us and its proxies is just around the corner this past week vice president pence flew to colombia once again for the fifth time in recent weeks to provide final instructions to us local forces and proxy allies there for the next step in the us regime change plan evidence that the green light for regime change and invasion is now flashing are supportive public statement by former president and several high level us democratic party politicians and candidates directly attacking the maduro regime they are signaling democrat party support for invasion and regime change events will now accelerate just in time perhaps to coincide with the release of mueller report on trump behind the scenes it is clear as it has been for months that us neocons are once again back in charge of us foreign policy driving the us toward yet another war and attempt at regime change of a foreign government the us neocon led strategy is increasingly clear establish a beach head on the colombian venezuelan and venezuelan brazilian border under the guise of providing humanitarian aid use the aid to get venezuelans on the border to welcome the us proxy forces to cross over set up political and military structures thereafter just inside the venezuelan borders with colombia and brazil from which to launch further similar efforts deeper into venezuela repeat this province by province step by step penetrating venezuela space until enough local units of the venezuelan military change sides and convince one or more of the venezuelan military hierarchy to join them establish a dual state and government within and along the border of the venezuelan state this way a breakaway state and dual power within the country make it appear by manipulating the media that the venezuelan people are rising up against the maduro government when in fact it is us proxy forces invading and using opportunist local politicians military and others in the conquered zones as the media covers for their invasion the main ideological justification being used for the invasion and regime change is that the maduro government has grossly mismanaged the venezuelan economy and driven its people into poverty with democrats now joining trump and republicans in support of invasion the liberal mainstream us media as well as the rightwing alternative media are both pushing the same line to blunt us opposition to invasion and yet another war before the final military assault is launched somehow the democratic elections less than a year ago which returned the maduro government to power did not represent the will of the people explanations how they did not are thin and unconvincing moreover nor is any explanation given how us policies and actions have played the central role in destroying venezuela s currency and economy and the financial measures used to destabilize the economy are especially opaque venezuela today is a classic case how us imperialism in the 21st century employs financial measures to crush a state and country that dares to break away from the us global economic empire and pursue an independent course outside the us empire s web of entangling economic and financial relations here s how us financial imperialism has worked and continues to work with the intent of assisting regime change in the case of venezuela in a world where us capitalism is the dominant hegemon the us currency the dollar is the centerpiece of the us global economic empire the dollar serves as the global trading currency as well as the global banking reserves currency more than 85 of all global trade export and import is done in dollars certain commodities like global oil and oil futures contracts are traded virtually only in dollars recently more countries have begun to peg their own currency to the dollar allowing it to move in tandem with the dollar some have even eliminated their currency altogether and now use only the us dollar as their domestic currency increasingly as well more countries are issuing their domestic bonds in dollars i e dollar denominated bonds and their central banks follow the us central bank the federal reserve s policy as it raises or lowers us interest rates that in turn cause the us dollar to rise and fall they do so even if rising us interest rates mean rising rates in their own economies that precipitate recessions and mass unemployment these are all examples of the growing financial integration with the us imperial state and economy but even those economies that maintain their own currency are at the mercy of the us dollar since the dollar is the global trading and reserves currency whenever the dollar rises in value due to us monetary policy changes or us inflationary pressures or just changes in supply or demand for the dollar the currencies of other countries fall in value as the dollar rises in value other currencies fall that s how global exchange rates work in the 21st century global us empire where the dollar is the trading reserves currency other currencies the british pound euro and even less so the japanese yen or china yuan are still largely insignificant as reserves or trading currencies and it appears very unlikely they will soon replace the dollar one of the key pillars of the us empire the us has the power to engineer a collapse in a country s currency a collapse in its currency means the price of imported goods rises rapidly especially those goods it can only be obtained by imports i e medicines critical food commodities intermediate business goods necessary for domestic manufacturing etc accelerating import inflation in turn leads to domestic businesses cutting back production due to lack of affordable resources commodities or parts mass layoffs follow production cutbacks rising inflation brought on by currency collapse is thus accompanied by rising unemployment wage income and consumption in turn collapse and thereafter the economy in general widespread shortages of key imports inflation and domestic production decline and unemployment brought on by the shortages and inflation simultaneously lead to social discontent and loss of support for the government opposition groups and parties proclaim these problems are due to the mismanagement of the economy by the government or corruption by its leaders or just socialist policies in general but in fact the economic crisis i e shortages inflation production unemployment is traceable directly to the root cause of the collapse of the currency engineered by us imperialist policies intent on crashing the economy as a prelude to regime change and economic reintegration to the us global economic empire there are many ways the us can and does cause a collapse of a country s currency one set of measures are designed to cause a severe shortage of dollars in the target country s economy a shortage of dollars drives up the value of the us dollar in the target economy which in turn drives down the value of the country s own currency the us has been engineering a collapse of venezuela s currency the bolivar now for years first by causing dollars in venezuela to flow out of the country and secondly by measures preventing venezuela from obtaining dollars from abroad us policy over the last several years at least has been to force us companies doing business in venezuela to repatriate their dollars back to the us or else divert them elsewhere globally among subsidiaries or just to leave venezuela and take their dollars with them us policy has also been to publicize and promote wealthier venezuelans with dollars to take them out of the country and invest them in colombia where the us has arranged an online investment firm with the assistance of its colombian government ally rich venezuelans have been encouraged as well to send their money to miami banks and to move there in large numbers which they have taking their dollars with them or dumping their bolivars in exchange for dollars the outflow of dollars from venezuela has raised the value of dollars that remain in venezuela on the black market there thereby helping to depress the value of the bolivar in venezuela even further these measures pale however to us imperial efforts to prevent venezuela from obtaining dollars in global markets in an effort to try to offset the outflow of dollars from the economy for example the us has taken action to prevent us and global banks from lending dollars to venezuela or from participating in underwriting and insuring venezuelan bond issues which would also raise dollars for venezuela if allowed bank loans and bond funding thus dry up depriving the government of alternative sources of dollars more dollar shortage more bolivar domestic currency collapse i e more expensive imports more inflation more shortages declining production rising unemployment more discontent the main effort by which the us is attempting to deprive venezuela of dollars is to impose sanctions on other countries that try to buy venezuelan oil oil sales are the number one source of the country s dollar acquisitions since all oil trade is done in dollars and venezuela depends on 95 of all its government revenues from selling its oil the us imposes sanctions on would be buyers and thus cuts off access to dollars as it simultaneously through other policies works to encourage dollar flight out of venezuela and cut off bank loans and bond issuance by the country and if the prior bonds and loans were dollar denominated then the lack of dollars to pay the interest and principal coming due leads directly to defaults and in turn to business collapse and even more unemployment venezuela has turned to selling its oil to china and russia and a few other countries it has been forced to resort to paying its interest and principal on past loans from these governments with shipments of oil instead of payments in dollars as the us turns to sanctions as an economic weapon to enforce its will on other countries which it has been doing in recent years more countries are become aware of the tactic and are taking countermeasures they are dumping dollars or reducing their purchases of dollars in world markets and buying gold china and russia are leading this way while experimenting with non currency dependent trade another recent move by the us to deny venezuela dollars and collapse its currency has been to seize the venezuelan oil distribution company citgo in the us its remittances back to venezuela have been in dollars by seizing citgo the us deprives the country of yet another source of dollars with which venezuela might otherwise have been able to purchase imports of food medicines and other economically critical goods so venezuelans in this case are clearly forced to forego these critical imports due to us policy not due to economic mismanagement by its government moreover adding insult to injury the dollar funds from citgo seized by the us are being delivered to the venezuelan government s opponents and its hand picked ally of the us guido the opposition now gets to finance its counter revolution with the money formerly remitted to venezuela the counter revolution is financed at the expense of critical goods and services that otherwise might have been made available to the venezuelan people seizure of the citgo asset is not the only such example of dollar deprivation other assets in the form of inventories investments cash in us banks etc are also being impounded and not just from the venezuelan government individual venezuelan companies and individual citizens have been having their assets in the us impounded as well and the us is increasing its pressure on foreign governments to impound and seize assets as well of the government businesses and citizens the impoundment and seizure has recently been extended as well to venezuelan gold stocks held offshore in other countries in direct violation of international law recently the us company and mega bank citigroup has been forced to withhold venezuelan gold in violation of its contracts with the country the bank of england has also been asked and is complying with the us demand to freeze venezuelan gold deposited in the uk and countries like abu dhabi where gold is traded globally have been asked to stop trading in venezuelan gold gold is a substitute money for the us dollar so preventing gold access to venezuela is like preventing dollar access as well with its gold venezuela could more easily buy dollars or trade for goods directly than with using bolivars that are falling in value and sellers are less likely to take as payment countries with economies whose currency is seriously declining in value are able to get a loan to stabilize its currency from the international monetary fund the imf recent examples are argentina turkey south africa and even pakistan but the imf is an institution set up by the us in 1944 the us maintains with its close european allies a majority vote on imf decisions the imf does nothing the us does not approve its mission is to lend to countries in need of stabilizing their currencies the imf however as an appendage of the us global empire has refused to lend venezuela anything to help stabilize its currency this is in contrast for example to the record loan of more than 50 billion recently provided to argentina once that country put in its current business and us friendly macri government the record imf loan by the way was so that argentina could pay off debts owed to us and other speculators in the early 2000s so argentina saw little of that 50b what the payoff did enable however was for macri and other argentinian bankers to go to new york to get new loans from us banks once it repaid the speculators from which macri and friends no doubt personally benefitted immensely as the venezuelan currency collapses due to us arranged dollar shortages venezuela must print even more bolivars to enable it to purchase what goods from abroad it might still be able to buy a collapsed currency means the price of imported goods rises proportionately so more bolivars are needed to buy the goods that are continually rising in price printing more bolivars adds to the supply of bolivars in the economy which raises domestic price inflation even further but the excess printing is in response to the currency collapse which is engineered by the dollar shortage and the falling exchange rate in the first place the over supply of bolivars is not due to mismanagement it is due to the shortage of dollars and the desperate effort by the venezuelan government to somehow pay for inflating import goods the falling price of crude oil in 2017 18 added further pressure on the bolivar the collapse of oil prices globally appears unrelated to us policy but it wasn t the oil venezuela has been able to continue to sell mostly to china or russia declined by 40 in price in 2018 the global oil deflation of 2018 thus generated less oil revenue for the country and thus fewer dollars but that too was due indirectly to us policy and economic conditions the collapsing price of oil in 2018 is directly attributed to us shale oil producers raising their output by more than a million barrels a day which increased the world oil supply and depressed world oil prices the us then attempted to manipulate world oil output with saudi arabia but that exacerbated the over production and deflation problem still further here s how the us attempted to impose sanctions on iranian oil in 2018 saudi arabia believed it would capture the customers that iran would lose and therefore it saudi arabia also raised its output of crude as us shale producers raised theirs but iran was able to continue to sell its oil as us sanctions broke down the result of the us shale overproduction plus saudi overproduction was a 40 collapse in world oil prices in 2018 that further deprived venezuela of much needed government revenue apart from us sanctions on venezuela oil sales us monetary policy in 2018 further exacerbated the currency crisis in venezuela as it did elsewhere in latin america and emerging markets in general in 2017 18 the us central bank launched a policy of raising interest rates since other world central banks respond to the us central bank world rates began to rise as well rising us interest rates caused a rise in the us dollar and as the dollar rose in 2017 18 emerging market currencies fell they fell for venezuela in part due to this effect as well as due to other causes mentioned falling currencies precipitate what is called capital flight out of the country less money capital means less available for investment and thus lower production output and more unemployment so currency collapse precipitates not only inflation but recession as well to prevent the capital fight emerging market economies raise their own domestic interest rates this led to recession for example throughout latin america in 2017 18 capital flight out of venezuela has been significant since 2016 as wealthy venezuelans sent more of their dollars out of the country to miami thus exacerbating dollar shortages in venezuela and further driving down the value of the bolivar left behind us sanctions on other countries banks and companies offshore are designed not only to prevent venezuela access to dollars and money capital offshore sanctions also target real goods trade like oil and other key commodities but there s another means by which the us shuts down the flow of real goods into and from a country causing shortages of critical goods it s the us controlled international payments exchange system called swift this is where us banks arrange the exchange and transfer of payments for goods and services by converting from one currency to the other and transferring the funds from one bank to another across countries the us has been preventing venezuela from normally using the swift system so even if another country is willing to buy venezuela goods including oil and exchange bolivars for its own currency it is prevented from doing so by the us bank controlled swift system financial imperialism has been waged against venezuela for decades but the attack on venezuela employing financial measures has recently intensified as the us neocons and imperialists have accelerated their plans to launch a more direct attack by political means including military to force regime change in venezuela at the center of the on going and now intensifying financial warfare against the country by the us are measures designed to destroy venezuela s currency imperialism is often thought of as military conquest and colonialism that s 19th century british and european imperialism but the american empire in the 21st century does not need colonialism it has a more efficient system for forcing the integration of other economies and for extracting value and wealth from the rest of the world the us empire is increasingly knitted together in the 21st century by a deep web of financial relationships that afford it multiple levers of economic power it can pull if and when it desires and when those economic and financial levers prove insufficient to overthrow domestic forces and governments that remain intent on pursuing a more independent path outside the empire s economic and political relations then the breakaway state is attacked more directly once the economy is sufficiently wrecked such is the case of venezuela today financial imperialism has paved the way for more direct political and military action
the economic outlook of post independence zimbabwe resembles a fading cloth with each wash it has lost its lustre and as time goes on it threatens to disintegrate into a rag after inheriting a sound economy albeit one with deep socio economic disparities on gaining independence in 1980 the government of zimbabwe has instituted decades of economic decline and ever widening inequality by prioritising political and economic capital over everything else in the 1980s there was confidence amongst ordinary citizens who generally did not understand the underlying economic structural functionalities but this changed in the 1990s with the introduction of the economic structural adjustment programme esap supported by the world bank which introduced harsh austerity measures and economic liberalisation thereby exposing workers to the harsh realities of neo liberalism the trend worsened as zimbabwe trudged into late 1990s when large scale retrenchments bit workers and destroyed the social fabric of the country the chaotic land redistribution programme which started in 2000 forced zimbabwe s agrarian economy to its knees between 2000 and 2009 we witnessed a slump in agricultural production caused by the flight of experienced farmers and successive droughts this in turn weighed heavily on the manufacturing sector which relies on agricultural produce for raw materials the economy briefly recovered from 2009 to 2014 following the introduction of a multi currency system with the united states dollar as the base currency following the formation of a coalition government after the disputed 2008 election but since 2015 the economy has been in recession all key socio economic indicators have declined with inflation cash liquidity the budget deficit and public debt all taking a turn for the worse persistent shortages of foreign currency have spawned shortages of basic commodities and has driven the cost of everyday goods to record levels the official year on year inflation rose from 2 97 per cent in november 2017 to 3 56 per cent in january 2018 by november 2018 it officially reached an all time high of 31 per cent the highest since inception of the multi currency regime although noted economists have put that figure at a staggering 186 per cent making zimbabwe s rate of inflation second only to venezuela s 1 4 million per cent rising inflation has had a devastating impact on ordinary citizens incomes for those luckily enough to be in work or to have a pension have been massively eroded their predicament is worsened by the fact that most people do not have access to foreign exchange while service providers are demanding payment in hard currency there are also tens of thousands of workers who are victims of wage theft all of this leaves most people unable to pay for their basic needs be it food housing education healthcare or transport as if things couldn t get any worse in january 2019 the government increased the price of fuel by 158 per cent sending the economy into a tailspin that is likely to result in hyperinflation workers called for a stay away and citizens joined in workers face a wall of silence and an iron fist prospects of an economic recovery this year remain remote as the country is unlikely to meet neither its economic growth projections nor its inflation targets current circumstances have forced finance minister mthuli ncube to revise the projected economic growth rate for 2019 from 9 0 per cent to about 3 1 per cent and even this is unlikely to be achieved thanks to ever declining confidence from the international community and the high cost of living unless the government and its social partners namely business and labour quickly and sincerely revive the social contract labour unrest is likely to be a recurring feature of the months ahead faced with an economic implosion and an agitated populace instead of addressing economic fundamentals and engaging in dialogue the government has sought to silence all of its critics for years zimbabweans have been calling for economic stability electoral reforms rule of law institutional reforms and decent jobs but they have met a wall of silence and an iron fist damaging economic measures forced the zimbabwe congress of trade unions zctu to call for demonstrations in october 2018 which were quashed by the police in january 2019 the zctu called for a stay away and the state responded with brutal force unleashing the military which left about 17 people dead with reports of beatings rape and other atrocities the zctu leadership has been in the firing line with zctu president peter mutasa and me not only facing trial for public order offenses following the october protests but more recently we have been charged with the grave offense of trying to subvert the government if convicted we face 20 years in prison over the past 12 months teachers have also been under fire for going on strike to demand payment in us dollars as the value of all other forms of money bond notes electronic money has plummeted members of the amalgamated rural teachers union of zimbabwe have been hauled before the courts while doctors and nurses have been arbitrarily dismissed for calling for better pay and working conditions the government is trying to intimidate organised labour so that it can pursue its austerity agenda undisturbed as a result the situation for trade unions is more precarious now than it was during the mugabe era the government is unilaterally imposing its decisions on civil service collective bargaining processes trade union leaders are being targeted for arrest and detention the courts appear to be captured and no longer sensitive to labour collective power despite the state s attempts to break it is the only hope left for zimbabwe s workers 11 ways zimbabwe can move forward despite the seemingly hopeless nature of the situation facing labour in zimbabwe there are a number of ways that we can move forward cutting government expenditure the people have lost confidence in the government owing to fiscal indiscipline the reality of government spending stands in stark contrast to its rhetoric senior officials must cut their expenditure and the foreign trips that have consumed millions of the country s scarcely available forex informal sector zimbabwe has the second largest informal economy in the world after bolivia these workers need access to capital and to be supported towards formality rather than criminalised and attacked additionally the government urgently needs to open credit lines for small and medium enterprises to recapitalise the economy end corruption there is hardly a sector in zimbabwe that hasn t been blighted by corruption the guilty need to be held accountable and the business community needs to be assured of the safety of its investments encourage responsible foreign direct investment printing more money will not solve zimbabwe s current economic crisis responsible foreign direct investment is the key to economic growth and the government needs to create a conducive and sustainable environment for such investments policy consistency this remains a major challenge zimbabwe has various excellent blueprints for the positive transformation of the country but these policies are never implemented government ministers must also refrain from issuing conflicting policy statements as this tarnishes zimbabwe s already battered image create decent jobs zimbabwe has an abundance of natural resources from agriculture to minerals and a huge skilled labour force what is now needed is the political will and the right economic policies to create decent work for all drop the dollar although the introduction of the us dollar was necessary after the demonetisation of the zimbabwe dollar in 2009 in the long term zimbabwe needs to reintroduce its own currency rejuvenate production production must be recapitalised starting with the agricultural manufacturing and mining sectors the land reform programme which started in 2000 destroyed an agricultural sector that was once described as the bread basket of africa with regards to manufacturing there are cheap and affordable products that should be produced locally matches candles and mineral water for example but currently they are all being imported meanwhile the mining sector lacks product value addition how can zimbabwe be the second largest platinum producer in the world but the majority of its people live in absolute poverty curb illicit financial flows serious levels of illicit financial flows have been recorded in the mining sector while our unfortunate economic circumstances have led the government to mortgage our mineral wealth to bogus investors hellbent on looting our minerals the government must come up with strict laws to curb these losses zimbabwe s diamonds are said to be worth us 60 billion but who benefits from the proceeds certainly not ordinary zimbabweans instead us 15 billion from the nation s diamond sales are unaccounted for and have likely been siphoned out of the country this needs to stop real reforms the country s image is severely dented owing to its poor human rights record the absence of the rule of law and the recent military clampdown on civilians protesting against widespread hardships zimbabwe s government needs to engage in practical and meaningful reforms on every level despite the crushing national debt no credit lines will be open to zimbabwe until this takes place social dialogue an all stakeholders dialogue platform needs to be put in place urgently the inclusion of opposition parties trade unions religious institutions academia students and other parts of civil society is crucial the command style of governance favoured by the current administration has proved to be incredibly ineffective key government policies are repeatedly announced without effective stakeholder engagement and the result has been resistance respecting the social contract will build the trust transparency and accountability zimbabwe needs to prosper

of operations our operating revenues increased by 9 from 5 963 million for the year ended december 31 2017 to 6 478 million for the year ended december 31 2018 networks business revenues increased due to the impact of higher customer rates and an increase in degree days renewables had an increase in revenue mainly due to an increase in wind generation along with higher average prices in the period net income attributable to avangrid increased by 56 from 381 million for the year ended december 31 2017 to 595 million for the year ended december 31 2018 which is driven primarily by loss from measurement of assets held for sale in connection with the sale of the gas trading and storage businesses recorded in 2017 networks net income slightly decreased primarily due to higher non deferrable storm costs and the associated impacts including lower capitalized labor in the period lower net income of renewables is primarily driven by an impact from remeasurment due to tax act implications in 2017 adjusted net income a non gaap financial measure increased by less than 1 from 682 million for the year ended december 31 2017 to 684 million for the year ended december 31 2018 the increase is primarily due to a 65 million increase in renewables due to increased wind generation in the period offset by a 21 million decrease in networks driven by higher non deferrable storm costs and the associated impacts including lower capitalized labor in the period 42 million decrease in corporate mainly driven by lower interest income on intercompany loans due to the sale of the gas business in

vulnerable customers that are offset in the tariff process pursuant to agreements with or decisions of the nypsc and the mpuc networks maine and new york regulated utilities are each subject to a minimum equity ratio requirement that is tied to the capital structure assumed in establishing revenue requirements pursuant to these requirements each of nyseg rg e cmp and mng must maintain a minimum equity ratio equal to the ratio in its currently effective rate plan or decision measured using a trailing 13 month average on a monthly basis each utility must maintain a minimum equity ratio of no less than 300 basis points below the equity ratio used to set rates the minimum equity ratio requirement has the effect of limiting the amount of dividends that can be paid if the minimum equity ratio is not maintained and can under certain circumstances require that avangrid contribute equity capital for cmp and mng equity distributions that would result in equity falling below the minimum level are prohibited for nyseg and rg e equity distributions that would result in a 13 month average common equity less than maximum equity ratio utilized for the earnings sharing mechanism or esm are prohibited if the credit rating of nyseg rg e avangrid or iberdrola are downgraded by a nationally recognized rating agency to the lowest investment grade with a negative watch or downgraded to noninvestment grade ui scg cng and bgc may not pay dividends if paying such dividend would result in a common equity ratio lower than 300 basis points below the equity percentage used to set rates in the most recent distribution rate proceeding as measured using a trailing 13 month average calculated as of the most recent quarter end in addition ui scg cng and bgc are prohibited from paying dividends to their parent if the utility s credit rating as rated by any of the three major credit rating agencies falls below investment grade or if the utility s credit rating as determined by two of the three major credit rating agencies falls to the lowest investment grade and there is a negative watch or review downgrade notice we believe that these minimum equity ratio requirements do not present any material risk with respect to our performance cash flow or ability to pay quarterly dividends in the ordinary course networks utilities manage their capital structures to allow the maximum level of returns consistent with the levels of equity authorized to set rates and accordingly compliance with these requirements does not alter ordinary equity level management additionally the lower monthly minimum equity ratio requirement a cushion of 300 basis points provides flexibility to have short term fluctuations that result in temporary shortfalls of the maximum equity ratio in any given month the regulated utility subsidiaries are also prohibited by regulation from lending to unregulated affiliates rates in december 2016 pura approved distribution rate schedules for ui for three

adopted in the ferc order on complaint i vacated by the court the new proposed roe methodology uses three financial analyses i e dcf the capital asset pricing model and the expected earnings analysis to produce a range of returns to narrow the zone of reasonableness when assessing whether a complainant has met its initial burden of demonstrating that the utility s existing roe is unjust and unreasonable the new proposed roe methodology establishes a range of just and reasonable roes of 9 60 to 10 99 and proposes a just and reasonable base roe of 10 41 with a new roe cap of 13 08 pursuant

electric system efficiency and reliability encourage renewable energy resources support distributed energy resources or der and empower customer choice in this proceeding the nypsc is examining the establishment of a distributed system platform or dsp to manage and coordinate der and provide customers with market data and tools to manage their energy use the nypsc is also examining how its regulatory practices should be modified to incentivize utility practices to promote rev objectives rev has been divided into two tracks track 1 for market design and technology and track 2 for regulatory reform rev proposes regulatory changes that are intended to promote more efficient use of energy deeper penetration of renewable energy resources such as wind and solar 52 and wider deployment of der such as micro grids on site power supplies and storage the nypsc order on track 1 affirmed that utilities would serve as the dsp and required utilities to file implementation plans before the end of 2015 track 2 is undertaken in parallel with the track 1 and examines changes in current regulatory tariff market design and incentive structures to better align utility interests with achieving nypsc s policy objectives new york utilities will also be addressing related regulatory issues in their individual rate cases a track 2 order was issued in may 2016 and includes guidance related to the potential for earnings adjustment mechanisms or eams platform service revenues innovative rate designs and data utilization and security the companies in december 2016 filed a proposal for the implementation of eams in the areas of system efficiency energy efficiency interconnections and clean air a collaborative process to review the companies petition was suspended in

dsip by june 30 2016 an initial dsip was filed by nyseg and rg e and included information regarding the potential deployment of automated metering infrastructure or ami a separate petition for the cost recovery associated with full deployment of ami was filed by nyseg and rg e in december 2016 in march 2017 the nypsc issued three separate rev related orders these orders created a series of filing requirements for nyseg and rg e beginning in march 2017 and extending through the end of 2018 the three orders involve 1 modifications to the electric utilities proposed interconnection earnings adjustment mechanism framework 2 further dsip requirements including filing of an updated dsip plan by mid 2018 and implementing two energy storage projects at each company by the end of 2018 and 3 net energy metering transition including implementation of phase one of the value of der in september 2017 the nypsc issued another order related to the value of der requiring tariff filings changes to standard interconnection requirements and planning for the implementation of automated consolidated billing in july 2018 nyseg and rg e submitted an updated dsip plan consistent with guidance received from the ny department of public service as of the end of 2018 both nyseg and rg e had deployed two energy storage projects each consistent with the march 2017 nypsc order requirements in december 2018 the nypsc staff submitted whitepapers on standby and buyback service rate design future value stack compensation and capacity value compensation it is expected that the nypsc will rule on the proposals set forth in the whitepapers in 2019 an additional staff whitepaper on rate design for mass market on site der projects interconnected after january 1 2020 is

instituting proceeding and to show cause the order requiring the companies to address whether the nypsc should mandate reject or modify in whole or in part the recommendations made in the staff report the order also required the companies to show cause why the nypsc should not commence an administrative penalty proceeding on may 18 2018 nyseg and rg e filed a settlement joint proposal and investment joint proposal before the nypsc to settle potential penalties and avoid litigation related to the march 2017 windstorm pursuant to which among other things nyseg and rg e agreed to make 3 9 million in investments in 2018 designed to increase resiliency and improve emergency response in the areas impacted by the storm the investments will not be reflected in rate base or operating expenses in establishing future delivery rates the joint proposals were subject to public comment and await nypsc approval we cannot predict the final outcome of this matter mpuc investigation into

2017 was unprecedented in the number of customers impacted and the magnitude of the damage across the entire cmp service territory during the event thousands of trees were broken or uprooted and many caused damage to the electrical delivery system the vast majority of tree related damage was from trees that were located outside of the maintenance clearance zone damage occurred on nearly every cmp distribution circuit resulting in more than 1 400 broken poles on january 18 2018 cmp submitted a filing in compliance with the mpuc s notice the mpuc investigation into restoration efforts is ongoing cmp incurred total incremental costs of approximately 68 6 million of which approximately 24 7 million are capital costs associated with the replacement of damaged infrastructure including poles cross arms transformers and related equipment and after applying the agreed upon capitalization method contained in the approved stipulation accordingly the net incremental operating and maintenance costs for restoration of the distribution system were approximately 43 9 million on june 29 2018 the mpuc approved a stipulation agreement which provides for the recovery of incremental storm restoration costs through cmp s distribution rates the stipulation agreement included a revised storm capitalization amount and the value of recovery was reduced by approximately 531 000 of cumulative underspent funds on non cycle vegetation management activities 53 on october 4 2018 the mpuc issued an order stating that based on the weather forecast information and the availability of storm restoration crew resources that both cmp and emera maine acted reasonably in their preparation for and response to a major wind and rain storm in october 2017 and that no further investigation of this aspect of the utilities response is warranted the mpuc also stated that there are potential improvements for future storm performance of the utilities their systems and with respect to coordination and communication with other involved entities on december 1 2018 cmp filed a report required by the mpuc that details its improvement plans new york state department of public service investigation of the preparation for and response to the march 2018 winter storms in march 2018 following two severe winter storms that impacted over more than a million electric utility customers in new york including 520 000 nyseg and rg e customers the nypsc initiated a comprehensive investigation of all the new york electric utilities preparation and response to those events the investigation has been expanded to include other 2018 new york spring storm events we cannot predict the final outcome of this matter cmp customer billing system investigation and class action on march 1 2018 the mpuc issued a notice of investigation initiating a summary investigation into cmp s metering billing and customer communications practices due to the highly technical nature of cmp s customer billing system on march 22 2018 the mpuc issued an order initiating audit commencing a forensic audit of cmp s customer billing system to identify any errors that have or continue to be resulting in billing inaccuracies on july 10 2018 the mpuc issued an order modifying scope of audit which expanded the scope of the audit to include cmp s customer communication practices on december 20 2018 the mpuc released the findings of the forensic audit of cmp s customer billing system and customer communication practices on january 14 2019 the mpuc issued an order and notice of investigation initiating an investigation of cmp s metering and billing practices and initiating a separate investigation of the audit of cmp s customer service and communication practices and incorporating such investigation into cmp s general rate case we cannot predict the outcome of these matters on august 16 2018 an amended class action lawsuit was filed against cmp and the company in the cumberland county superior court on behalf of all cmp customers alleging that cmp s new billing software and metering system improperly overcharged customers the plaintiff asserts this claim under the common law of unjust enrichment breach of contract and fraudulent and intentional misrepresentation and seeks damages punitive damages attorney fees and costs on september 21 2018 we filed a motion to dismiss all of the claims that was opposed by the plaintiffs on november 14 2018 the plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining cmp from sending putative class members disconnection notices and or disconnecting their power until this litigation is resolved a hearing on all pending motions was held on january 29 2019 on february 22 2019 the cumberland county superior court ordered that the proceedings be stayed until november 1 2019 to allow resolution of the mpuc s formal investigation of cmp s billing practices and denied the plaintiff s motion for a temporary restraining order we cannot predict the outcome of this class action lawsuit tax act proceedings the tax act significantly changed the federal taxation of business entities including among other things implementing a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 reductions in accumulated deferred income tax balances due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rates will result in amounts previously and currently collected from utility customers for these deferred taxes to be refundable to such customers generally through reductions in future rates the nypsc mpuc pura dpu and the ferc have instituted separate proceedings in new york maine connecticut massachusetts and the ferc respectively to review and address the implications of the tax act on the utilities in new york the nypsc staff issued a proposal on march 29 2018 whereby the staff recommended that tax act benefits be returned to customers beginning october 1 2018 comments on this staff proposal were submitted by the joint utilities of new york with a separate appendix by each respective major utility on june 27 2018 including our new york utility companies nyseg and rg e have stated that they believe tax act benefits should be utilized for utility programs for the benefit of customers including for new projects such as automated metering infrastructure or ami other future resiliency investments and to recover deferred regulatory assets on august 9 2018 the nypsc issued an order requiring sur credits effective october 1 2018 the sur credits for nyseg and rg e reflected the lower effective tax rate of 21 for nyseg gas rg e electric and rg e gas the nypsc also required the sur credit to include the return to customers of the january september 2018 tax act savings over three years the nypsc allowed nyseg electric to continue to defer the january september 2018 tax act savings as well as to continue to preserve the protected and unprotected tax act savings until the companies next rate cases in connecticut ui and scg expect tax act savings to be deferred until they are reflected in tariffs in a future rate case unless pura determines otherwise cng and bgc included tax act savings in rate cases that were filed with pura and the dpu respectively in the second quarter of 2018 in maine cmp adjusted rates beginning july 1 2018 to pass back to customers the tax act savings after offsetting for recovery of deferred 2017 storm costs and in the general rate case filing with the mpuc is proposing to use savings 54 arising out of the tax act to keep its distribution prices stable while making its electric system more reliable at the ferc cmp transmission and ui transmission adjusted their tariffs in june 2018 to reflect the income statement value of tax act savings power tax audits in 2015 we implemented power tax software to track and measure deferred tax amounts for cmp nyseg and rg e in connection with this change we identified historical updates needed with deferred taxes recognized by cmp nyseg and rg e we increased our deferred tax liabilities in 2015 with a corresponding increase to regulatory assets to reflect the updated amounts calculated by the power tax software since 2015 the nypsc and mpuc accepted certain adjustments to deferred taxes and associated regulatory assets for this item in recent distribution rate cases resulting in a regulatory asset balance of approximately 157 million and 160 million for this item at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively in 2017 audits of the power tax regulatory assets were commenced by the nypsc and mpuc on january 11 2018 the nypsc issued an order opening an operations audit on nyseg and rg e and certain other new york utilities regarding tax accounting the audit report is expected to be completed in 2019 in january 2018 the mpuc published the power tax audit report with respect to cmp which indicated that the auditor was unable to verify the acquisition value of the power tax regulatory assets the audit report requires that cmp must provide support for the beginning balance of the regulatory assets or will be unable to recover the value of the assets which is approximately 10 million cmp responded in to the audit report in its rate case filing and noted that it could reconcile 99 of the tax values and therefore requested full recovery of the power tax regulatory asset we cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding ginna reliability support service agreement ginna nuclear power plant llc or gnpp which is a subsidiary of constellation energy nuclear group llc or ceng owns and operates the r e ginna nuclear power plant or ginna facility and together with gnpp ginna a 581 mw single unit pressurized water reactor located in ontario new york in may 2014 the nyiso and then the nypsc ruled that the ginna facility was required to maintain system reliability and ordered rg e and gnpp to negotiate a reliability support service agreement or rssa on october 21 2015 rg e gnpp new york department of public service utility intervention unit and multiple intervenors filed a joint proposal with the nypsc for approval of the rssa as modified on february 23 2016 the nypsc unanimously adopted the joint proposal which provided for a term of the rssa from april 1 2015 through march 31 2017 and rg e monthly payments to ginna in the amount of 15 4 million in addition rg e was entitled to 70 of revenues from ginna s sales into the nyiso energy and capacity markets while ginna was entitled to 30 of such revenues the nypsc also authorized rg e to implement a rate surcharge effective january 1 2016 to recover amounts paid to ginna pursuant to the rssa the ferc issued an order authorizing the ferc settlement agreement in the settlement docket on march 1 2016 at which point the rate surcharge went into effect rg e used deferred rate credit amounts regulatory liabilities to offset the full amount of the deferred collection amount including carrying costs plus credit amounts to offset all rssa costs that exceed 2 3 million per month not to exceed a total use of credits in the amount of 110 million applicable through june 30 2017 the available credits were insufficient to satisfy the final payment amount from rg e to ginna and consistent with the agreement with the nypsc the rssa surcharge continues past march 31 2017 to recover up to 2 3 million per month until the final payment amount has been recovered by rg e from customers new york transco networks holds an approximate 20 ownership interest in new york transco llc new york transco was established by the new york transmission utilities to develop own and operate electric transmission in new york in december 2014 new york transco filed for regulatory approval of its rates terms and conditions with the ferc on april 2 2015 the ferc issued an order granting inter alia new york transco s owners request for a 50 basis point adder for new york transco s membership in the nyiso rto subject to the adder being capped within the zone of reasonableness after a determination of where within that zone its base level roe should be set the ferc also set the formula rate and base roe issue for hearing and settlement judge procedures in addition the ferc rejected new york transco s owners cost allocation method for the transmission owner transmission solutions or tots projects because it would allocate costs to power supply long island and new york power authority that they did not voluntarily agree to pay on november 5 2015 new york transco s owners filed the settlement with the ferc to resolve all outstanding issues associated with the tots projects including issues related to the tots projects that were set for hearing and

roe adder an equity ratio in the capital structure of up to 53 risk sharing for project cost overruns and the cost allocation under the nyiso oatt for the ac project on november 16 2017 the ferc approved the settlement weather impact the demand for electric power and natural gas is affected by seasonal differences in the weather statewide demand for electricity in new york connecticut and maine tends to increase during the summer months to meet cooling load or in winter months for heating load while statewide demand for natural gas tends to increase during the winter to meet heating load market prices for both electricity and natural gas reflect the demand for these products and their availability at that time overall operating results of networks do not fluctuate due to commodity costs as the regulated utilities generally recover those costs coincident with their expense or defer any differences for future recovery networks has historically sold less power when weather conditions are milder and may also be affected by severe weather such as ice and snow storms hurricanes and other natural disasters which may result in additional cost or loss of revenues that may not be recoverable from customers however networks regulated utilities other than mng and bgc have approved rdms as part of the nypsc pura and mpuc rate plans in place for the period ended december 31 2018 effective february 1 2019 new tariffs became effective for bgc which include an approved rdm the rdm allows the regulated utilities to defer for future recovery and shortfall from

part upon government policies that support utility scale renewable energy and enhance the economic feasibility of development and operating wind energy projects in regions in which renewables operates or plans to develop and operate renewable energy facilities in support of this on december 18 2015 congress passed and president obama signed into law the consolidated appropriations act public law 114 113 this law extends the qualifying dates for the production tax credit available to wind energy generating facilities internal revenue code section 45 and the investment tax credit available to commercial solar generating facilities internal revenue code section 48 the law also extends an option for wind generation facilities to elect to receive an investment tax credit in lieu of the production tax credit in general both provisions allow new wind and solar facilities to qualify for the respective credits at full value over the next several years with reductions in the value of the authorized tax credits for facilities phased in during subsequent periods production tax credits were reduced to 80 for facilities commenced construction in 2017 reduced to 60 for facilities commencing construction in 2018 and will be reduced to 40 for facilities commencing construction in 2019 investment tax credits will be 30 for projects commencing construction through 2019 then reduce to 26 22 and 10 for projects commencing construction in 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively the internal revenue service or irs updated its guidance related to which projects will qualify for the production tax credits including criteria for the beginning of construction for a project and the continuous program of construction or the continuous efforts to advance the project to completion multi year extension of these credits provides opportunities for renewables to develop construct and market new renewable generating facilities and partially repower existing renewable generating facilities in several u s markets additionally the federal government and many states and local jurisdictions have policies or other mechanisms such as tax incentives or rps that support the sale of energy from utility scale renewable energy facilities such as wind and solar energy facilities as a result of budgetary constraints political factors or otherwise u s state or local governments from time to time may review their policies and other mechanisms that support renewable energy and consider actions that would make them less conducive to the development and operation of renewable energy facilities any reductions to or the elimination of governmental policies or other mechanisms that support renewable energy or the imposition of additional taxes or other assessments on renewable energy could result in among other items the lack of a satisfactory market for the development of new renewable energy projects renewables abandoning the development of new renewable energy projects a loss of renewables investments in the projects and reduced project returns any of which could have a material adverse effect on renewables business financial condition results of operations and prospects renewable energy demand since the transmission and distribution of electricity is highly concentrated in most jurisdictions there are a limited number of possible purchasers for utility scale quantities of electricity in a given geographic location including transmission grid operators state and investor owned power companies public utility districts cooperatives and large commercial and industrial customers as a result there is a concentrated pool of potential buyers for electricity generated by renewables business which may restrict their ability to negotiate favorable terms under new ppas and could impact their ability to find new customers for the electricity generated by their generation facilities should this become necessary furthermore if the financial condition of these utilities and or power purchasers deteriorated or the rps programs climate change programs or other regulations to which they are currently subject and that compel them to source renewable energy supplies change demand for electricity produced by renewables businesses could be negatively impacted 57 energy prices renewables has exposure to commodity price movements through its natural long positions in electricity from its generation renewables manages the exposure to risks of commodity price movements through internal risk management policies enforcement of established risk limits and risk management procedures a portion of renewables fuel and energy output arrangements qualify as derivative contracts such derivative contracts are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized to earnings as the changes occur in 2015 renewables began designating certain qualifying derivatives contracts as hedges these hedge designations result in deferral of changes in fair value to the extent the hedge is effective to accumulated other comprehensive income until the contract settles at which point the deferred amount is recognized to earnings wind conditions if wind conditions are unfavorable or if renewables wind turbines are not available for operation renewables electricity generation and related revenue may be substantially below our expectations renewables wind projects are sited developed and operated to maximize wind performance prior to siting a wind facility detailed studies are conducted to measure the wind resource in order to estimate future production however wind patterns or wind resource in the future might deviate from historical patterns these events could also degrade equipment or components and the interconnection and transmission facilities lives or maintenance costs historically renewables wind production is greater in the first second and fourth quarters wind turbine supply replacement and spare parts for wind turbines and key pieces of electrical equipment may be difficult or costly to acquire or may be unavailable although renewables has expanded and diversified its supplier base the loss of any of these suppliers or service providers or inability to find replacement suppliers or service providers or to purchase turbines at rates currently offered by renewables existing suppliers or a change in the terms of renewables supply or operations and maintenance agreements such as increased prices for maintenance services or for spare parts could have a material adverse effect on renewables ability to construct and maintain wind farms or the profitability of wind farm development and operation results of operations the following table sets forth financial information by segment for each of the periods

increased by 349 million or 7 from 4 961 million for the year ended december 31 2017 to 5 310 million electricity and gas revenues increased by 82 million and 27 million primarily due to the impact respectively of increased electric and gas customer rates in the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 electricity and gas revenues for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 increased by 87 million and 94 million due to increased commodity prices and higher volumes largely driven by an increase in degree days wholesale electricity and capacity revenues increased by 59 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the same period of 2017 due to an increase in average prices revenue related regulatory activities in the period increased primarily due to 65 million increase in pass through components and 31 million increase in appliance revenue both offset in operations and maintenance increase of 13 million in earnings sharing which is primarily offset by an adjustment of 14 million to unfunded future income tax to reflect the change from a flow through to normalization method which was recorded in 2017 as an increase to revenue with an offsetting and equal increase to income tax expense a decrease of 78 million from deferrals of excess deferred income taxes due to changes in federal tax rates as a result of the tax act and 16 million in non bypassable charges in the period purchased power natural gas and fuel used for the year ended december 31 2018 increased by 270 million or 23 from 1 153 million for the year ended december 31 2017 to 1 423 million the increase is primarily driven by 175 million and 60 86 million increases in average commodity prices and overall increase in the units of electricity and gas respectively procured due to an increase in degree days combined with an 8 million increase in other power supply purchases operations and maintenance during the year ended december 31 2018 increased by 159 million or 9 from 1 721 million for the year ended december 31 2017 to 1 880 million the increase is primarily due to a 65 million increase in operations pass through costs and 31 million of costs related to appliance revenue both offset in revenue a 20 million increase due to non deferrable storm costs a 13 million increase in uncollectible expenses and lower capitalized labor costs of 37 million in the period offset by a 6 million decrease in personnel costs driven by lower termination settlements compared to the same period of 2017 renewables operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2018 increased by 92 million or 9 from 1 047 million for the year ended december 31 2017 to 1 139 million the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase of 88 million with wind generation output increasing 1 730 gwh an increase in thermal revenue of 12 million driven by higher prices an increase of 25 million resulting from the sale of a claim from a bankruptcy proceeding with a customer an increase of 6 million resulting from the settlement of a lawsuit in the period offset by 8 million decrease driven by cancellation of first energy ppas combined with unfavorable mark to market or mtm changes of 32 million on energy derivative transactions entered into for economic hedging purposes purchased power natural gas and fuel used for the year ended december 31 2018 increased by 3 million or 1 from 225 million for the year ended december 31 2017 to 228 million the increase is primarily driven by an increase of 25 million in power purchases and transmission costs due to the addition of new capacity offset by mtm changes on derivatives of 22 million that were favorable due to market price changes in the current period operations and maintenance for the year ended december 31 2018 increased by 12 million or 3 from 354 million for the year ended december 31 2017 to 366 million which is primarily due to a 9 million increase in wind farm operations costs driven by new capacity with the remaining increase attributable to higher intercompany charges in 2018 depreciation amortization and impairment depreciation amortization and impairment expenses for the year ended december 31 2018 decreased by 595 million or 41 from 1 466 million for the year ended december 31 2017 to 871 million the decrease is driven by

mainland a shares in its indices it confirmed its intentions yesterday to the surprise of no one and will boost china s inclusion factor from the current 5 inclusion factor to 20 this is not the same as weighting though it confuses many observers the inclusion factor reflects the percentage of the local shares that are included the actual weighting in the msci flagship emerging markets equity index will rise from 0 71 to about 3 3 over the next nine months however rather than do it two steps it will take three this is part of the larger integration of china into the world capital markets

edged up to 51 5 from the 51 4 flash reading and 51 2 in january it is the second consecutive monthly increase the fact that french exports are a smaller part of world exports than germany and its

january so far the weakening economy has had little impact on the popularity of the government the five star movement ostensibly the senior partner in the coalition has not done well in the local

in the country the bilateral swap arrangement bsa was negotiated between india and japan during the visit of prime minister narendra modi to tokyo on october 29 2018 this bsa provides for india to access 75 billion in us dollars whereas the earlier bsa had provided for 50 billion the agreement for the bsa has become effective from today i e february 28 2019 the finance ministry said in a statement dollar near 10 week high vs yen on upbeat us gdp the dollar hovered near a 10 week high against the yen on friday thanks to a surge in treasury yields after us gross domestic product data topped expectations the greenback was a touch higher at 111 445 yen and within striking distance of 111 495 its strongest level since dec 20 brushed overnight the dollar index against a basket of six

record highs in the quarter as a result of diversified natural gas sales along with the performance of recent horizontal wells continuing to exceed expectations at both nig and umbach production increased to a record of 22 432 boe per day which represents growth of 25 on a per share basis from the prior year and also exceeded guidance of 19 000 to 21 000 boe per day production was rapidly increased in mid november in response to a strengthening natural gas price at chicago liquids production field condensate plus gas plant ngl grew by 24 year over year with liquids representing 19 of total production and 25 of production revenue at the end of the quarter there was an inventory of seven montney horizontal wells 6 5 net that had not started producing which included four completed wells 3 5 net during the quarter three wells 3 0 net started production at the nig land block the three wells completed in early 2018 have been producing for eight to eleven months with no decline to date and averaged 8 2 mmcf per day raw gas in february which is approximately 1 520 boe per day sales 20 liquids including liquids recovered at the gas plant diversified natural gas sales resulted in the realized price averaging 5 56 per mcf which was significantly higher than western canadian pricing aeco 1 48 per gj and station 2 0 64 per gj firm pipeline commitments required to diversify sales also result in a higher natural gas transportation cost which was 1 02 per mcf only 18 of the realized price hedging loss totaled 17 9 million with 69 or 12 3 million from sumas price hedges this was the result of a failure on the enbridge t south pipeline system on october 9 th which materially reduced flows and increased the sumas price to cdn 14 67 per mmbtu in the quarter versus the average hedged price of cdn 2 92 per mmbtu which materially reduced flows and increased the sumas price to cdn 14 67 per mmbtu in the quarter versus the average hedged price of cdn 2 92 per mmbtu production costs general and administrative and interest and finance costs averaged 6 46 per boe a decrease of 11 year over year funds flow was a record 30 9 million or 0 25 per share a 39 increase on a per share basis from last year which was largely from a higher natural gas price and higher production volumes capital investment was 37 1 million which included drilling four horizontal wells 4 0 net completing three horizontal wells 2 5 net and initial equipment deposits of 8 9 million for the gas plant at nig the balance sheet remains strong with debt including working capital deficiency being 91 million which represents 0 7 times annualized quarterly funds flow and 50 of the bank credit facility of 180 million commodity price hedges currently protect approximately 43 of forecast production for 2019 2018 year end highlights financial and operational results were consistent with or better than guidance for production funds flow operating costs per boe and capital investment notably year over year production growth per share of 28 was achieved while reducing debt including the working capital deficiency by 15 million production averaged 20 538 boe per day which was consistent with guidance and represents growth of 28 on a per share basis from last year this was the eighth consecutive year that production per share has grown with growth averaging 28 per year over the last five years liquids production grew by 26 condensate by 27 with liquids representing 18 of total production and 35 of production revenue due to diversified natural gas sales the realized natural gas price was 3 98 per mcf which was materially higher than western canadian pricing aeco 1 42 per gj and station 2 1 19 per gj the corporate decline rate in 2018 was approximately 26 december 2017 corporate production was 19 220 boe per day with the same wells producing 14 160 boe per day in december 2018 based on field estimates this is a reduction from the 32 decline rate in 2017 cost structure continues to decrease with production general and administrative and interest and finance expense averaging 6 89 per boe a decline of 11 from the previous year funds flow was a record 100 1 million 0 82 per share a year over year increase of 56 on a per share basis with the improvement coming from production growth 28 and a higher funds flow netback 22 which resulted from higher commodity prices and a decrease in costs on a per boe basis return on capital employed was 10 and cash return on capital employed was 21 cash return on capital employed is based on funds flow which is a more meaningful measure of profitability given that return on capital employed is based on net income which can be significantly affected by non cash mark to market gains and losses on hedging for example 2018 was a non cash hedging loss of 5 8 million while 2017 was a non cash hedging gain of 24 6 million capital investment totaled 85 million and included 14 million of investment into longer term

northeast british columbia storm s land position is prospective for liquids rich natural gas from the montney formation and currently totals 121 000 net acres 172 net sections during the fourth quarter seven sections of land were acquired most of the land position is delineated with existing vertical wells the 75 horizontal wells 70 9 net drilled to date by storm and multiple producing horizontal wells on adjacent lands the majority of the producing horizontal wells have been drilled in the upper part of the montney formation storm s future drilling will also test the mid and lower montney in certain areas where higher field condensate gas ratios are expected based on offsetting well control fourth quarter 2018 field activity included drilling four horizontal wells 4 0 net and completing three horizontal wells 2 5 net all at umbach three horizontal wells 3 0 net started production in october and november and there remains an inventory of seven horizontal wells 6 5 net that had not started producing at the end of the quarter which includes four completed wells 3 5 net first quarter 2019 field activity is expected to include drilling five horizontal wells 5 0 net four wells will be drilled from a single pad at nig licensed for a total of eight wells with two wells in the upper montney one in the mid and one in the lower higher field condensate gas ratios are expected from the wells in the mid and lower montney at umbach 100 working interest investment of approximately 18 million is planned in 2019 with activity including the drilling of one well 1 0 net the tie in of a two well pad 2 0 net and the completion of a three well pad 3 0 net current field compression capacity totals 150 mmcf per day raw gas and throughput in the fourth quarter averaged 124

sour gas plant pipelines drilling and completing an acid gas injection well 1 0 net and drilling completing and equipping four horizontal wells 4 0 net the license application for the planned 50 mmcf per day sour gas plant was submitted in september 2018 and depending on when approvals are received construction is expected to start in mid 2019 with start up anticipated in late 2019 or early 2020 produced raw natural gas contains approximately 0 2 h 2 s total cost for the sour gas plant is estimated to be 81 million 11 4 million invested in 2018 remainder in 2019 which includes 73 million for the gas plant 4 million for an acid gas injection well and 4 million for a sales pipeline the gas plant has a forecast operating cost of 2 00 per boe which will reduce corporate operating costs to approximately 4 25 per boe and is expected to add incremental production of approximately 1 500 boe per day which primarily comes from improved liquids recovery adds 1 100 barrels per day with 90 ngl while reducing process shrinkage by 5 the first three horizontal wells producing at nig were completed in early 2018 and to date natural gas rates plus field condensate gas ratios have been materially higher than at umbach calendar day rates over the first 180 days have averaged 8 2 mmcf per day raw gas plus 205 barrels per day of field condensate approximately 1 570 boe per day with 23 liquids including liquids recovered at the gas plant the condensate gas ratio during this period was approximately 50 higher than the average well at umbach there has been very little decline to date with rates in february averaging 8 2 mmcf per day raw gas plus 150 barrels per day of field condensate based on field estimates at fireweed 50 working interest approximately 15 million net will be invested in 2019 to drill and complete three horizontal wells 1 5 net and for deposits to order longer lead time equipment for a field compression facility the license application for the 50 mmcf per day field compression facility was submitted in january 2019 and depending on when approvals are received construction is expected to begin between late 2019 and early 2020 with start up in the second half of 2020 total costs associated with the facility are 34 million gross and it is designed to be expandable to 100 mmcf per day preliminary planning for 2020 includes net investment of approximately 50 million to drill nine horizontal wells 4 5 net complete six horizontal wells 3 0 net and construct the field compression facility development at fireweed is expected to increase condensate as a proportion of total production based on production history from several offsetting horizontal wells where first year average field condensate gas ratios were 30 to 70 barrels per mmcf raw which is 100 to 400 higher than at umbach the first horizontal well 0 5 net at fireweed was completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 with encouraging results the c 74 g 94 a 13 well has a completed length of 1 520

final flowing casing pressure of 4 800 kpa the well is expected to remain shut in until the field compression facility is completed the licensing process was recently changed july 2018 and applications for wells facilities roads and pipelines at nig umbach and fireweed are subject to the bc oil and gas commission s new interim measures applied to oil and gas applications storm s lands are within area 2 where the objective is restricted new surface disturbance some of storm s license applications will result in new disturbance and have been referred for additional review which is extending the time required to obtain licenses this would include pipelines and the gas plant at nig plus pipelines the facility and drilling at fireweed the additional time required for review is not

increased relatively quickly if supported by the station 2 natural gas price given existing unused field compression capacity growth has been accomplished while improving the cash return on average capital employed to 21 in 2018 from 10 in 2015 generating a strong return on invested capital will continue to be a focus of storm s business plan the company s near term growth plan is expected to increase the proportion of liquids and decrease per boe operating costs which reduces exposure to current low western canadian natural gas prices production is expected to grow to approximately 25 000

during the three months ended december 31 2018 strad reported a net loss of 5 4 million compared to a net loss of 3 4 million in 2017 the higher net loss in 2018 was due to the recognition of a 10 9

increase in revenue and ebitda of 48 and 93 as compared to the same period in 2017 earnings before interest and taxes ebit from industrial matting increased from 0 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 4 8 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase in revenue ebitda and ebit was a result of a significant matting project in canada that occurred throughout the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as an 83 increase in u s revenue year over year the increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was also impacted by improved customer pricing as compared to the same period in 2017 strad s equipment rentals segment reported a decrease in revenue and an increase in ebitda of 8 and 78 respectively during the three months ended december 31 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 the decrease in revenue was a result of lower revenue in canada due to the discontinuance of the drill cuttings management service line which was mostly offset by an increase in pricing and utilization in the u s during the fourth quarter of 2018 capital expenditures were 12 0 million in industrial matting 0 1 million in equipment rentals and 0 1 million in corporate the majority of the capital spending related to wood matting additions which were acquired to prepare for and to support industrial matting projects for the upcoming 2019 year as of december 31 2018 the industrial matting fleet was 111 710 as compared to 101 210 at september 30 2018 outlook we continued to execute on our industrial matting strategy announced in 2018 with company ebitda for the year totaling 27 2 million compared to 25 0 million in the prior year industrial matting ebitda totaled 21 5 million compared to 21 2 million in the prior year while equipment rentals contributed 8 7 million compared to 7 8 million in the prior year despite a challenging macro economic environment the fourth quarter of 2018 was our strongest quarter since 2014 financial results for the quarter were attributed primarily to the strong margins in the industrial matting segment posting 8 3 million of ebitda compared to 4 3 million for the same period in 2017 results for the quarter were propelled by a large matting project related to the north montney mainline we believe strongly in the opportunities presented in both canada and the u s for our industrial matting segment formal approval of the lng canada project and associated coastal gaslink pipeline will provide significant opportunity for the industrial matting segment in 2019 the trans mountain expansion project will similarly provide opportunities for strad however any delay in construction could impact timing of potential matting projects in 2019 we will look to employ our expertise in deploying large scale matting projects in the u s market with increasing environmental responsibility and regulation throughout north america we expect the overall matting market to increase as we also look to increase our market share our internal estimates place the current market size for matting in north america at over 2 0 billion annually and growing consistent with our strategy to grow our matting fleet we deployed 31 3 million of capital to maintain and increase our fleet in 2018 the remainder of our 33 8 million capital program was comprised of maintenance capital and technology enhancements our board has approved a 2019 capital program of 18 0 million with the expectation that total capital spend in 2019 will be approximately 30 0 million of which 29 0 million will be allocated to maintaining and growing the industrial matting fleet the equipment rentals market in canada saw a dramatic shift in macro economic conditions in the fourth quarter market access restrictions in canada culminated in average western canadian select wcs pricing of under six us dollars per barrel in december 2018 a decline of over 85 from the prior year these conditions have led to initial reductions in 2019 capital budgets by major canadian producers which have impacted first quarter 2019 rig counts and expected activity levels in the equipment rentals segment throughout the first half of 2019 in the u s the outlook for equipment rentals remains consistent with 2018 as west texas intermediate wti pricing has remained relatively consistent drilling activity is expected to be stable throughout 2019 in the u s on november 26 2018 we announced the approval from the toronto stock exchange to renew our normal course issuer bid ncib allowing us to buy back a maximum of 4 067 205 common shares the ncib commenced on november 28 2018 and will terminate november 27 2019 subsequent to year end the company purchased 471 408 common shares under the ncib under our previous ncib which expired september 13 2018 we purchased and canceled 2 768 320 or 5 of the outstanding common shares in 2018 our funds from operations allowed us to increase our capital program repurchase shares under our ncib while carrying a minimal amount of debt we expect this trend to continue in 2019 as our funds from operations and strong balance sheet provide the flexibility to evaluate various alternatives to create shareholder value including without limitation

during the fourth quarter of 2018 ebit increased to 4 8 million compared to 0 7 million during the same period of 2017 the primary driver for the increase in ebit were the same factors that led to the

period of 2017 the primary increase in revenue year over year was due to the 119 increase in u s industrial matting revenue as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 this was offset by the 12 revenue decrease in canada to 43 6 million compared to 49 8 million during the same period in 2017 due to the delay of matting projects until the fourth quarter of 2018 which led to a decrease in

the decrease in depreciation expense is due to the accelerated depreciation of mats with no remaining useful life during 2017 that did not occur in 2018 operating expenses for the three months and

in canada was the result of a 6 decline in average rig counts and the discontinuance of the drill cuttings management service line the decrease in canadian revenue was offset by the 31 increase in u s

nor should they be construed as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with ifrs non ifrs measures include adjusted net income adjusted net earnings per share on a basic and diluted basis adjusted operating income and adjusted ebitda overview pat d eramo president and chief executive officer stated 2018 was a terrific year for martinrea and our people we had a strong end

business for the future fred di tosto chief financial officer stated sales for the fourth quarter excluding tooling sales of 85 million were 841 million in the mid range of our previously announced

excluding tooling sales to be in the range of 910 million to 950 million and adjusted net earnings per share in the range of 0 65 to 0 69 per share rob wildeboer executive chairman stated in 2018 not only did we have a record year in terms of financial performance but we did so in an automotive environment that was fairly flat in terms of production in our key markets while experiencing some real challenges in terms of trade negotiations and tariffs the signing of the usmca and its ratification in some form is positive for our industry and we believe for suppliers such as us the impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs placed by the u s and canada is not helpful to the industry but we believe the tariffs will be removed sometime this year what was very special for us in the year was the progress we made in developing our culture our new vision making lives better by being the best we can be in the products we make and the services we provide has been embraced by our people as witnessed in day to day activity and employee feedback our culture of lean thinking entrepreneurialism and treating people the way they want to be treated is we believe helping to drive our financial performance and making us a go to employer and supplier on this basis we expect 2019 to be a record year for us in terms of financial performance with adjusted operating income margins above 8 and we anticipate continued operating income margin improvement to above 9 in 2020 and revenues next year to exceed 4 billion results of operations all amounts in this press release are in canadian dollars

s consolidated sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased by 47 6 million or 5 4 to 926 2 million as compared to 878 6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 the total increase in sales was driven by year over year increases in the north america and europe operating segments partially offset by a decrease in the rest of the world sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 in the company s north america operating segment increased by 61 0 million or 9 0 to 735 9 million from 674 9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase was due to the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2017 including the next generation gm silverado sierra and ram pick up trucks and the new chevrolet blazer the impact of foreign exchange on the translation of u s denominated production sales which had a positive impact on overall sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 of approximately 23 4 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase in tooling sales of 18 0 million which are typically dependant on the timing of tooling construction and final acceptance by the customer these positive factors were partially offset by lower year over year production volumes on certain light vehicle platforms including the chevrolet malibu ford escape and chrysler 300 challenger charger and programs that ended production during or subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2017 sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 in the company s europe operating segment increased by 3 6 million or 2 2 to 167 5 million from 164 0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase

unless congress and the president reach a new budget agreement both non defense and defense discretionary program areas will face deep cuts in 2020 and 2021 forced by tight funding limits and additional cuts known as sequestration mandated by the 2011 budget control act bca the most recent bipartisan budget agreement which covered fiscal years 2018 and 2019 provides a model for a new agreement it eliminated the sequestration cuts on discretionary programs and provided additional resources for new investments in key priority areas without an agreement ndd programs on average would have to be cut 11 percent in 2020 after adjusting for inflation without an agreement overall funding would revert to the bca levels under the bca fiscal year 2020 funding for non defense discretionary ndd programs which include a wide variety of areas such as education scientific research infrastructure national parks and forests environmental protection law enforcement public health veterans health care and homeland security would be 55 billion below the 2019 level before adjusting for inflation ndd programs on average would have to be cut 11 percent in 2020 after adjusting for inflation defense would be cut deeply as well 71 billion below the 2019 level which after accounting for inflation would mean a 13 percent cut on average for defense programs since 2013 congress and the president have enacted a series of temporary bipartisan budget agreements generally covering two years at a time that ameliorated the bca s sequestration cuts the agreements reached prior to the most recent deal scaled back but did not eliminate the sequestration cuts partly as a result funding for ndd programs for 2011 2017 was cut substantially below 2010 levels adjusted for inflation over that seven year period ndd funding was cut by roughly 400 billion compared with what these programs would have received over that period if funding had maintained its 2010 inflation adjusted level the budget agreement that congress and the president reached for 2018 and 2019 both fully eliminated the bca s sequestration cuts to defense and non defense discretionary programs and provided new resources for defense and ndd a step toward reversing the disinvestment of the prior seven years this agreement paved the way for a significant increase for child care new resources to address the opioid epidemic key infrastructure needs ranging from public housing and national park modernization to clean water projects and resources for other needs in setting funding levels for the next two years policymakers should build on the progress in addressing underfunded areas they made under the most recent budget agreement and provide adequate resources for several areas that face pressing new or unique funding needs in 2020 this includes implementing the 2018 mission act which expands health services provided outside of veterans affairs va health facilities and requires increased resources and funding the 2020 decennial census new budget agreement needed to avert deep cuts in discretionary programs the 2011 budget control act set caps on both non defense and defense discretionary funding for each year through 2021 it also mandated that the already austere caps set in the statute be lowered substantially if congress did not enact more than 1 2 trillion in deficit reduction later in 2011 the additional cuts that are required by the reduction in the caps known as sequestration were triggered because congress didn t pass such legislation since 2013 lawmakers of both parties have broadly agreed that the bca mandated caps are too low to meet national priorities in both defense and non defense areas to address this shortfall congress has enacted a series of temporary budget deals generally lasting two years that have increased funding above the sequestration levels each deal increased both the defense and non defense discretionary caps by roughly equal amounts recognizing that the bca s sequestration provision cut defense and non defense programs by equal amounts the most recent deal covered fiscal years 2018 and 2019 unlike prior agreements it fully reversed the harmful discretionary sequestration cuts and provided additional resources for new investments see the appendix for more details on how the bca caps sequestration and prior deals affected funding levels if congress and the president fail to reach a new agreement and funding levels revert to the sequestration levels in 2020 the cuts to both non defense and defense programs would be severe non defense funding for non defense discretionary programs in fiscal year 2020 would be 55 billion below the 2019 level or a 9 percent cut before adjusting for inflation see figure 1 inflation raises the costs of services and benefits provided through ndd programs for example the wages of workers providing services and the costs of materials when adjusting for inflation funding under the bca in 2020 would be 70 billion below the 2019 level this would mean that ndd funded services would have to be cut by an average of 11 percent if funding fell to the bca post sequestration level in 2020 some areas would have to be cut more deeply than the average funding cut to accommodate other areas that policymakers will want to protect from cuts in fiscal year 2020 there are also several areas that need significant additional resources in 2020 such as the 2020 decennial census a constitutional obligation the recently enacted mission act which expands health care outside of va medical centers for veterans who need it and the increased costs in the regular veterans health care program that result from rising health care costs and other pressures these three areas alone require an estimated 14 billion in new funding above 2019 levels without adjusting for inflation in the coming fiscal year defense if funding reverts to the sequestration levels overall defense funding would fall below 2019 levels by 71 billion see figure 2 or an 11 percent cut before adjusting for inflation after adjusting for inflation the result would be a 13 percent 87 billion cut from 2019 ndd cut significantly prior to last budget deal cuts to ndd started in 2011 and while the full sequestration cuts called for in the bca were partially reversed over the 2013 2017 period there were nevertheless significant cuts in non defense discretionary funding as a result of the combination of the bca s funding caps and the partial sequestration cuts that were implemented as noted it was not until the most recent budget agreement for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 that the discretionary sequestration cuts were fully reversed and additional resources for new investments provided following a seven year period of disinvestment between 2011 and 2017 we conservatively estimate that non defense discretionary programs received about 400 billion less in funding than would have been the case if ndd funding had maintained its 2010 funding adjusted for inflation see figure 3 in some cases this period of disinvestment has led to higher funding needs today for example underfunding over this period meant that basic maintenance repairs and capital improvements in national parks and public housing developments were deferred these agencies need to catch up on this work and in some cases deferred projects can be more expensive than they otherwise would have been because facilities may have deteriorated to a greater degree for instance delays in fixing a leaky roof in a public housing development can lead to more severe structural damage that costs more to repair in other cases the disinvestment meant that the public received fewer or lower quality services than would have been provided if funding had just kept pace with inflation for example compared to the total cumulative funding that programs would have received over the 2011 2017 period if funding had been maintained at the 2010 level adjusted for inflation job training was cut by 4 4 billion funding in 2017 was 19 percent below 2010 funding adjusted for inflation the funds that were cut from 2011

programs the brownfields program designed to help clean up contaminated property and ensure it can be re used and enforcement efforts among other essential environmental protection and public health programs while these figures reflect cuts since 2010 a number of areas were underfunded in 2010 the nation faced significant child care education job training infrastructure and environmental needs that were not being met in 2010 ndd funding levels in 2010 provide a useful benchmark for measuring cuts that occurred in the years after 2010 but should not be considered the target for the appropriate level of ndd funding funding in 2010 was not high by historic standards funding for non defense discretionary programs is much lower today than in the mid 1970s and early 1980s when measured as a percent of the economy over the 1976 2019 period ndd funding a averaged 3 6 percent of gdp just a bit below the 2010 level of 3 7 percent b ndd funding as a percent of gdp was significantly higher in the 1976 1984 period and then fluctuated roughly between 3 0 and 3 8 percent of gdp in subsequent years with periods of cuts followed by periods of re investment ndd funding in 2019 stands at just 3 0 percent of gdp it was higher in 2018 largely because of high emergency costs some have pointed out that ndd funding in 2010 was higher than in prior years when measured in inflation adjusted dollars over time however in a country with population growth and a growing economy investments in education housing public health law enforcement and environmental protection need to grow to reflect the larger population that the programs serve as well as the increased need for and the economy s increased ability to finance certain kinds of public goods such as higher education which has become more crucial in the 21st century economy and efforts to protect the environment from the consequences of economic growth and climate change that is why looking only at ndd funding without considering the size of the population and the nation s economy is an inadequate way to measure ndd funding over long periods of time share chart on facebook share chart on twitter chart a these figures reflect budget authority except in the case of certain housing programs for these programs the figures reflect outlays because of changes over the time period in the degree to which housing assistance was funded on a multi year rather than single year basis b this figure excludes funding provided under the american reinvestment and recovery act but includes funding for emergencies emergency funding such as disaster aid following a hurricane cannot easily be separated from this historical funding data series other funding figures elsewhere in this analysis exclude emergency funding this data series on ndd funding goes back to 1976 most recent budget deal began to reverse disinvestment the most recent budget deal fully reversed the sequestration cuts in discretionary programs and provided resources for new investment setting 2018 ndd funding 60 5 billion above the 2017 level without adjusting for inflation in inflation adjusted terms this funding remained below the 2010 level and well below the 2010 level adjusted both for inflation and population growth but was 9 percent higher than in 2017 this increased funding allowed policymakers to begin to dig out of the hole created by the substantial ndd cuts from 2011 to 2017 as a result of the budget agreement and subsequent appropriations legislation the following received increased investments child care and head start funding for the nation s main child care program the child care and development block grant increased by 2 4 billion in 2018 while funding for head start increased by 600 million this child care funding increase was the largest one year increase ever enacted in 2019 funding for these areas increased modestly above the 2018 levels these new resources will allow states to increase the number of children receiving child care assistance and improve the quality of care while providing head start programs with additional funding to expand the number of students attending programs that are a full school day and full school year but as discussed below even with these resources it remains the case that only a small share of children eligible for child care assistance can receive it because of a lack of funding funding for the nation s main child care program the child care and development block grant increased by 2 4 billion in 2018 while funding for head start increased by 600 million this child care funding increase was the largest one year increase ever enacted in 2019 funding for these areas increased modestly above the 2018 levels these new

for child care assistance can receive it because of a lack of funding infrastructure the 2018 appropriations legislation increased funding for infrastructure projects across agencies including new investments in water sanitation and transportation projects in the departments of commerce and transportation and the epa for example funding for capital investment grants used to build or expand commuter rail light rail and subway transit systems increased by over 230 million in addition the national infrastructure investments build grants program which supports initiatives such as rural broadband infrastructure increased by 1 billion the 2018 appropriations legislation increased funding for infrastructure projects across agencies including new investments in water sanitation and transportation projects in the departments of commerce and transportation and the epa for example funding for capital investment grants used to build or expand commuter rail light rail and subway transit systems increased by over 230 million in addition the national infrastructure investments build grants program which supports initiatives such as rural broadband infrastructure increased by 1 billion opioids and substance use disorder prevention and treatment the agreement resulted in new resources across several agencies to address the opioid crisis including research treatment prevention and law enforcement for example funding for the substance abuse and mental health services administration received 1 billion for new opioid response grants to states the national institutes of health received increased research funding to study opioid addiction and funding was made available to increase the number of substance use disorder health care professionals in underserved communities the agreement also increased funding for the department of justice s efforts not only to combat the illegal distribution of heroin fentanyl and prescription opioids but also to help communities fund

of justice s efforts not only to combat the illegal distribution of heroin fentanyl and prescription opioids but also to help communities fund treatment housing the department of housing and urban development hud received increased resources to provide more than 50 000 additional people with disabilities veterans experiencing homelessness and others with housing choice vouchers which help low income individuals and families afford modest private apartments even with these added vouchers the program will continue to serve only about 1 in 4 eligible households because of inadequate funding hud also received increased resources to enable housing agencies to make needed repairs and upgrades in public housing developments and to bolster rental aid for individuals and families experiencing homelessness the department of housing and urban development hud received increased resources to provide more than 50 000 additional people with disabilities veterans experiencing homelessness and

rental aid for individuals and families experiencing homelessness environmental protection overall funding for the epa increased in 2018 by 763 million or 9 5 percent compared to its 2017 level before adjusting for inflation with most of the increase coming in state and tribal assistance grants which provide resources to help communities pay for sewage and wastewater treatment watershed management other water clean up projects and drinking water treatment facility upgrades overall funding for the epa increased in 2018 by 763 million or 9 5 percent compared to its 2017 level before adjusting for inflation with most of the increase coming in state and tribal assistance grants which provide resources to help communities pay for sewage and wastewater treatment watershed management other water clean up projects and drinking water treatment facility upgrades veterans health care funding for va medical care and research increased by 5 1 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 before adjusting for inflation the 2018 appropriations legislation also increased funding for deferred veterans affairs health infrastructure improvements by 2 billion 1 billion for medical facility improvements 575 million for the construction of state extended care facilities and 425 million to fund minor construction projects in some areas such as child care efforts to address the opioid crisis and new investments in va facilities negotiators agreed to increase funding as part of the budget agreement discussions before the appropriations committees crafted the actual funding legislation this pre negotiation was done to ensure that key priority areas received additional funding as part of an overall agreement to raise funding levels but many areas remain underfunded despite these and other new investments significant areas of unmet non defense needs remain a budget agreement that provides resources for new investments can help close some gaps for example as noted even with the large increase in child care funding provided in 2018 inadequate funding still means that only roughly 1 in 6 low income children eligible for child care assistance receives it leaving millions of low income working families struggling to afford quality child care while parents work as also noted because of inadequate funding only about 1 in 4 eligible low income households receive rental assistance either through subsidies that help them afford modest private housing or through public housing programs the combination of inadequate housing assistance a lack of affordable rental units and rising rents in many areas and high poverty the number of households facing worst case housing needs that is the number of households who pay more than half their incomes for rent or live in very substandard housing increased by 66 percent over the 2001 2015 period and while recent appropriations have enabled public housing agencies to meet more of their facility upgrade and maintenance needs a backlog of more than 26 billion in capital repairs must still be addressed to preserve this important stock of affordable housing while funding for the national park service in 2018 was 270 million above the 2017 level before adjusting for inflation as of the end of fiscal year 2017 deferred maintenance totaled 11 6 billion by the park service s own accounting the main job training grants through the workforce investment and opportunity act received an additional 80 million in 2018 compared to the 2017 level before adjusting for inflation but this left funding for job training 18 percent below the level in 2010 after adjusting for inflation pell grants which help low and moderate income students pay for college received modest increases for academic years 2018 and 2019 however the maximum pell grant in 2019 covers just 28 percent of the cost of an in state public four year college compared to 79 percent in 1975 congress and the president enacted the support for patients and communities act in october 2018 to address the continuing opioid epidemic congress funded some of the new efforts in 2019 but the legislation called for approximately 285 million in new annual investments that need to be funded starting in 2020 this funding would be directed to activities such as employment training for people with substance use disorders new opioid specific recovery centers trauma support services for children and youth and services to improve family recovery and reunification next deal should fund continued investment address pressing needs following the seven years of disinvestment in key non defense areas more resources are needed to continue the progress that s being made in addressing important unmet needs as a result of the last budget deal moreover a new deal for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 must account for several areas that require significant additional resources in 2020 including the 2020 decennial census and veterans health care so congress isn t faced with failing to meet these obligations or meeting them by cutting other areas 2020 census the constitution requires the federal government to conduct an enumeration every decade funding for the census bureau is significantly higher in the year that the enumeration takes place and 2020 is such a year in 2020 the census bureau will likely need at least 8 billion for both the decennial census and the other annual surveys it conducts about 4 billion more than it received in 2019 this large increase comes from the cost of implementing the decennial census which requires hiring and training 300 000 enumerators and supervisors opening field offices conducting a vigorous outreach campaign to improve response rates going door to door to elicit information from unresponsive households and processing responses veterans health care and the mission act in june 2018 congress enacted the mission act which expands access to community provided health services that is health services provided outside the va delivery system for veterans the act consolidates several programs and funds the health care with discretionary resources even though some of these services were previously funded with mandatory funds which don t count against the discretionary funding caps in addition the cost of the standard va health care programs rises each year based on medical inflation as well as changes in service demand in each of the past 13 years funding for the va health programs has increased by between 1 5 billion and 7 4 billion per year the va will need an additional 10 billion in 2020 compared to the 2019 funding level to meet the needs of the new mission act as well as rising costs in the base veterans health care programs in 2021 va funding will need to be an estimated 17 billion above the 2019 level agreement should include an irs program integrity cap adjustment when congress negotiates a new budget agreement it should include a trump administration proposal to improve the enforcement of the nation s tax laws by adding irs enforcement funding that doesn t count against the annual cap on overall funding for non defense appropriations there is a lengthy bipartisan history of exempting from the cap certain types of program integrity funding to reduce errors overpayments and fraud in government programs and taxes that the office of management and budget omb estimates will produce net savings a that approach to irs enforcement funding is especially timely now given the irs enforcement division s depleted personnel and its coming workload increase under the tax law enacted at the end of 2017 the president s 2019 budget proposed an increase for irs enforcement of 362 million in 2019 and roughly 15 billion over ten years that wouldn t count against the caps the congressional budget office s cbo recent report on deficit reduction options includes a similar though somewhat more robust option of providing 500 million the first year and 20 billion over ten years in new enforcement funds which cbo estimates would produce significant net savings this administration proposal recognizes that because tax enforcement raises significantly more money than it costs it makes sense to exempt some enforcement funding from the caps cbo estimates that once staff training and computer upgrades are completed each 1 of additional enforcement funding would generate 5 20 in additional revenue moreover the treasury department notes that this return on investment likely is understated because it includes only the amounts directly recovered it does not reflect the effect that enhanced enforcement has on deterring non compliance omb has written that this deterrence could triple the rate of return on each additional dollar invested in irs enforcement the precedent for this approach to irs enforcement funding dates to the 1990 budget enforcement act enacted under president george h w bush which included an increase in the cap for certain irs compliance activities which has the same effect as exempting the increase from the cap and there is a longstanding cap adjustment in place for funding certain program integrity activities in the social security administration and the department of health and human services to reduce overpayments in social security and medicare such a mechanism is urgently needed for irs activities to reduce tax non compliance overall irs enforcement funding has been cut by 25 percent since 2010 after adjusting for inflation and the enforcement division has lost roughly 30 percent of its workforce over that period the cuts have driven a more than 40 percent decline in the rate of audits especially for high income individuals and large corporations moreover enforcement needs have grown as a result of the 2017 tax law the new tax law s design will invite taxpayers particularly affluent ones and corporations with means to hire high priced accountants and lawyers to re characterize their financial affairs for tax purposes for example to qualify for the 2017 law s new pass through income deduction aggressively pushing against the boundaries of the new law irs enforcement must be able to identify those who step over the boundaries the irs needs enough well trained personnel to maintain the tax system s integrity congress should provide the agency with the funds it needs to do its job and a cap adjustment is a good way to bolster resources for the irs while recognizing the budgetary savings that improved enforcement brings a for omb s calculation of net savings derived from the proposed irs cap adjustment see office of management and budget fy17 analytical perspectives table 10 2 p 110 deal needed even if it can t be fully offset congress and the president will negotiate in coming months over the discretionary funding levels for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 the last years for which the bca established funding caps on discretionary programs if the deal doesn t set new caps on discretionary funding for years after 2021 then cbo will project that the negotiated 2021 level will continue adjusted for inflation over the rest of the coming decade future congresses and presidents however will determine the levels of discretionary funding in the years after 2021 accordingly it would be prudent for congress and the president to focus on the cost of boosting discretionary funding over the next two years as was the case for the previous two year deals ideally these costs would be offset largely with responsible revenue increases as well as some selected mandatory savings but our discretionary investment needs shouldn t be shortchanged if congressional republicans and the president continue to refuse to consider raising revenues there is virtually no chance of fully offsetting an adequate budget deal without a revenue contribution some 85 percent of mandatory spending is in social security medicare medicaid the children s health insurance program and the affordable care act s premium tax credits while there surely are reasonable savings to be secured in the health arena those savings will be needed to help expand access to health coverage for the 30 million americans who still lack insurance outside of social security and health much of the rest of mandatory spending is for basic assistance to low income individuals and households such as snap formerly known as food stamps and the earned income tax credit where cuts would lead to increases in poverty and hardship policymakers should be discussing the appropriate levels of both spending and revenues we face predictable cost pressures due to the aging of the population and rising health care costs though the aca s cost containment measures have helped slow that increase despite these cost pressures congress cut taxes in 2017 rather than responsibly raising revenues as a result revenues are now at historic lows as a percent of gdp for this point in an economic expansion 16 5 percent of gdp compared to the 18 4 percent historical average when the economy is performing at or near its potential typically when the economy is strong and unemployment is low revenues as a share of gdp are higher than during down economies this allows deficits to fall during good economic times and provides opportunities for targeted tax cuts during recessions as a form of fiscal stimulus some prominent mainstream economists have recently refined their thinking on the impact of debt on the u s economy in recognition of the continued low interest rates and hence in the cost of borrowing that the nation faces a consequence of which is that the risk of an economic or financial crisis due to higher deficits and debt is considerably lower than when interest rates were higher that does not mean there are no downsides to higher levels of debt especially debt levels that rise steadily and substantially for decades to come but as economists jason furman and larry summers recently wrote the risk of a debt crisis is often exaggerated some commentators worry that rising deficits don t just slowly eat away at economic growth as the textbooks warn they could lead to a fiscal crisis in which the united states loses access to credit markets sparking an economic meltdown there is precious little economic theory or historical evidence to justify this fear given the need for adequate ndd resources and the lack of significant economic risk from modestly as opposed to dramatically higher levels of debt a two year deal should be struck even if it cannot be fully paid for then in the near future when more balanced fiscal discussions are possible responsible discussions about appropriate levels of revenues and spending and how to achieve them should take place appendix the budget control act of 2011 caps sequestration and subsequent bipartisan deals the budget control act of 2011 bca established fixed dollar limits caps on funding for discretionary programs

select committee of congress known at the time as the supercommittee and charged it with drafting legislation in the fall of 2011 to reduce the deficit by 1 2 trillion over ten years and to push committee members to compromise the bca further provided that if the committee failed to reach an agreement that shortfall would be covered by sequestration sequestration would among other things automatically cut equal dollar amounts from defense and non defense programs in 2014 2021 those cuts would be achieved by reducing the defense and ndd caps and also by directly cutting all mandatory programs that were not exempted from those cuts because congress did not pass legislation achieving the required level of deficit reduction the sequestration provisions of the bca were triggered the top panel in the table above shows the pre sequestration defense and ndd caps the next panel shows the total amount of sequestration cuts called for under the bca and how much of those sequestration cuts would be achieved through mandatory cuts and how much through reductions in the discretionary caps as the table shows sequestration would reduce defense and non defense programs each by 54 7 billion per year the size of the mandatory defense cuts is quite small while the mandatory non defense cuts are much larger that s because almost all non exempt mandatory programs are domestic to achieve equal overall savings from the defense and non defense sequestrations the discretionary cuts in the defense caps must therefore be correspondingly larger than the cuts in the ndd caps the third fourth and fifth panels show the amounts that the three most recent bipartisan deals restored to defense and ndd funding relative to the post sequestration caps those three deals covered 2014 2015 then 2016 2017 and most recently 2018 2019 the blue highlighting shows that the dollar additions to defense and ndd caps were equal under the first two deals some use the term parity to refer to this fact the yellow highlighting shows that as part of the deal for 2018 and 2019 the defense and ndd discretionary sequestrations were cancelled entirely the orange highlighting shows that the 2018 2019 deal also provided equal amounts of funding above the pre sequestration caps to defense and non defense discretionary programs note however that while the discretionary sequestration cuts were cancelled entirely for both defense and non defense programs the mandatory sequestration cuts which fall disproportionately on non defense programs remained in place over this period and have been extended through 2027 the final panel shows the resulting caps as they have actually applied in each year since 2014 the current caps for 2020 and 2021 are far below the actual appropriations for 2019 and absent another deal the scheduled cuts in 2020 and 2021 will be even larger when inflation and population growth are taken into account further as discussed in the main body of this report there are special needs for 2020 funding such as for the 2020 census and the mission act governing veterans health care

q a following our prepared remarks we will open the call for questions with that i d like to turn the call over to tom thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you ian and welcome everyone 2018 was another exceptional year for park and its shareholders as we successfully achieved the strategic goals we outlined 12 months ago for our internal growth efforts we focused on operational excellence by improving profitability across our portfolio through a combination of revpar growth grouping up strategies and margin expansion as a result our operational results came in above expectations with the portfolio generating solid revpar growth of 2 9 while our initiatives to aggressively asset manage the portfolio contributed to the 60 basis point increase in our margins materially outperforming our peer set on average with respect to capital allocation we successfully recycled 13 non core assets the gross proceeds of 519 million greatly enhancing the overall quality of our portfolio while lowering our exposure to international markets to just 1 of total ebitda finally in 2018 we returned over 900 million of capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and the hna stock buyback taking our total return on capital figure to nearly 1 9 billion since spinning out from hilton a little over two years ago overall these efforts have allowed park to generate superior shareholder returns outperforming our hotel reit peers by nearly 1 400 basis points and the broader reit index by nearly 400 basis points while significantly narrowing the valuation gap with our peers overall i couldn t be prouder of our success and in particular the hard work and dedication put forth by the entire team at park as i look ahead to 2019 i remain confident in our ability to continue achieving our objectives while we recognize there is heightened concern about slower economic growth and ongoing cost pressures we believe park is well positioned relative to our peers as we have prepared ourselves to reap the benefits of strong group demand across several of our key markets as we have noted in the past grouping up will be a key focus for park for the next couple of years and should help to support above industry average revpar growth through 2020 additionally fueled in large part by the success of our grouping up efforts we expect to continue narrowing the margin gap with our peers forecasting another 30 basis points of absolute margin growth at the midpoint of our guidance range in 2019 turning to our portfolio s performance i am pleased with our overall results for both the quarter and full year 2018 comparable revpar growth was 2 9 for the year which was at the top end of our guidance range with the fourth quarter revpar growth topping 3 6 or nearly 100 basis points ahead of consensus our comparable hotel adjusted ebitda margin increased 40 basis points during the fourth quarter and improved by nearly 60 basis points for the year helping to continue closing the margin gap with our peers our asset management team has done a terrific job partnering with hilton and sourcing both revenue and cost saving opportunities across several of our key properties as witnessed by our growth throughout the quarter and the year these initiatives continue to remain a key driver for our internal growth story within our revenue segments group was up 3 8 for the quarter and 5 for the year at this time last year we had expected pace to be up approximately 3 in 2018 and we are very pleased with the increase in group pace throughout the year on the transient side comparable revenue increased 1 7 for the quarter and it was down just 0 1 for the year the fourth quarter was boosted by a healthy increase in the business transient segment which was up 4 2 and was partially offset by 0 4 decrease in leisure revenue overall 2019 is off to a very strong start with january revpar up approximately 6 or 3 when stripping out san francisco february is also trending above 7 and we expect the first quarter to realize about 4 to 5 revpar growth looking more closely at our quarterly performance across our core markets standouts include key west with revpar up nearly 32 or 290 basis points better than we had forecasted driven by strong transient demand we remind listeners that the hotels were closed for 12 days in the fourth quarter of 2017 following hurricane irma which hit the island in september of that year san francisco also surprised to the upside with the hilton union square and parc 55 reporting revpar growth of 13 6 during the fourth quarter both increasing share within the comps set hilton chicago was also strong with revpar growth exceeding 6 for the quarter due to strong group production which helped to drive higher transient rates offsetting these gains were softer results at our hilton hawaiian village hotel with the property reporting a 2 3 decrease in revpar during the quarter driven by slightly weaker group and continued fallout from softer international wholesale demand our hotels still grew share during the quarter to 107 or by 500 basis points continuing a trend we ve seen all year also our bonnet creek hotels in orlando reported a 0 2 revpar gain for the quarter as the complex faced tough year over year comps due to strong demand related to displaced residents from hurricane irma in the fourth quarter of 2017 looking ahead in 2019 i remain very optimistic on the fundamentals of our business and particularly our strong group pace group pace for 2019 is up over 10 with hawaii and san francisco both clear standouts with group pace up 23 and 17 respectively while momentum is expected to continue into 2020 with our portfolio s overall group pace up just over 9 next year additionally while convention room nights are down in chicago new york new orleans and orlando this year our group pace across each one of these markets remains positive turning to san francisco with the moscone center renovation complete and convention room nights up 78 to 1 2 million we expect the city to be among our top performers in 2019 with revpar growth forecasted to be in the mid to upper single digits in hawaii we expect our two hotels to collectively generate revpar growth above the top end of our 2019 revpar guidance specifically at our hilton waikoloa village hotel group pace is up nearly 80 with the hotel benefiting from two separate group buyouts while facing easier year over year comps following disruption related to last year s volcanic activity which negatively impacted income by approximately 5 million in 2018 at the hilton hawaiian village results are expected to be driven in part by forecasted increase in group pace of roughly 8 coupled with favorable booking trends in asian wholesale business a reversal of the trend we experienced last year a testament to the team s effort to proactively group up is in an otherwise soft citywide year is best illustrated by both chicago and new york two markets which are expected to witness a 30 plus drop in citywide room nights in 2019 despite these challenges our group pace in chicago was up nearly 8 while in new york we are expecting group pace to be up north of 6 with the hotel also expected to benefit from solid increases in transient demand led by contract and business transient our orlando portfolio should generate positive growth in spite of some of the anticipated renovation displacement during the fourth quarter as we expect to break ground on the meeting space expansion at our bonnet creek complex that will be delivered during the second half of 2021 collectively hawaii san francisco new york chicago and orlando account for over 60 of our comparable hotel adjusted ebitda lending support to our positive view in 2019 fundamentals another standout in our portfolio is the hilton santa barbara resort which continues to gain additional momentum and should post very strong results following last year s brand conversion moving on to our capital allocation initiatives building on last year s success phase 2 of our non core asset sale program is well under way having recently reported the sale of the hilton squaw peak resort for 51 million with net proceeds of approximately 48 million to be used for general corporate purposes which could include funding future roi projects as it relates to additional sales we remain committed to our capital recycling efforts with the potential for another five to eight non core hotels in various stages of the marketing process turning toward 2019 guidance while the u s economy remains on firm footing supported by a strong job market healthy corporate profits and a sturdy consumer it is hard to ignore the potential headwinds our industry faces in the wake of slower global growth wage pressures and a risk of an ongoing trade war with china that said lodging fundamentals remain sound especially for those companies with the right geographic footprint we believe park is uniquely positioned to benefit from proactively grouping up across many of our core markets including generating strong in house group demand thereby offsetting the impact of weaker citywide calendars across much of the u s with 80 of our group business on the books for this year we remain cautiously optimistic on 2019 accordingly we are establishing comparable revpar guidance of plus 2 to plus 4 for the full year 2019 with a comparable hotel adjusted ebitda margin range of zero to plus 60 basis points our cost containment and ancillary income will remain an important driver of the margin story results will now be more heavily weighted to our grouping up efforts for the full year 2019 despite losing approximately 20 million as a result of the expired ground lease at chicago o hare in addition to residual income from the 14 assets we sold over the prior 12 months we anticipate adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 745 million and 775 million we expect adjusted ffo per share to be in the range of 2 91 to 3 05 sean will provide further details in his remarks on some of the other key assumptions driving our earnings guidance and with that i d like to turn the call over to him sean m dell orto executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks tom and welcome everyone looking at our results for the fourth quarter we reported total revenues of 686 million and adjusted ebitda of 184 million while our adjusted ffo was 147 million or 0 73 per diluted share on a full year basis we reported total revenues of approximately 2 7 billion adjusted ebitda of 754 million and adjusted ffo of 603 million or 2 96 per diluted share turning to our core operating metrics for the fourth quarter we reported comparable revpar of 171 or an increase of 3 6 versus the prior year our occupancy for the quarter was 79 7 or 60 basis points higher our average daily rate ended the quarter at 214 or an increase of 2 8 year over year these top line results produced comparable hotel adjusted ebitda of 176 million while our margins increased 40 basis points to 28 2 for full year 2018 our comparable portfolio produced a revpar of 174 or an increase of 2 9 our occupancy for the year was 82 up 50 basis points while our average daily rate was 212 or an increase of 2 4 versus the prior year these top line results produced hotel adjusted ebitda of 716 million for our comparable portfolio with margins improving nearly 60 basis points year over year to 28 8 moving to our balance sheet we remain in great shape with no major maturities until 2021 and net debt to adjusted ebitda at just 3 7 times we have over 1 2 billion between our untapped revolver and cash on hand giving us ample liquidity to execute on the right opportunities turning to the dividend with q4 earnings coming in at the high end of our expectations we paid a q4 dividend of 1 per share which included a 0 30 per share component related to excess gains from assets sold during 2018 our board recently declared our first quarter dividend of 0 45 per share to be paid on april 15th to stockholders of record as of march 29th representing a 4 6 increase in our quarterly regular weight dividend similar to last year we are targeting a full year payout ratio of 65 to 70 of adjusted ffo and a potential top up dividend to be paid in the fourth quarter with respect to capex excluding the amount related to caribe hilton we invested 41 million in our hotels during the fourth quarter about half of which was for desk facing areas taking our full year capex spend to 147 million or the roughly 6 of hotel revenues that we targeted at the beginning of the year for 2019 we continue to target 6 maintenance capex spend while our roi pipeline is expected to add an additional 25 million to total capital expenditures for the year given the increased capex spend we expect renovation displacement to negatively impact revpar performance by approximately 70 basis points in 2019 but note that this displacement is already factored into our guidance we are very excited about the renovation projects at both the bonnet creek complex in orlando and norwegian key west with targeted returns in the high teens for both as a reminder total roi spent at bonnet will be approximately 70 million to 80 million over the next 24 months at the reach the scope of the project includes rebranding the hotel from a waldorf astoria to curio in addition to a comprehensive rooms renovation and a restaurant reconcept total roi spend for this project is estimated at 10 million and we expect construction to occur during the slower months of q3 and q4 of this year we hope you are available to join us for our key west property tour we and several of our peers are hosting in april in early april where we expect to have a model room to showcase turning to 2019 earnings guidance i d like to provide a few more details on some of the key assumptions driving our 2019 adjusted ebitda and ffo guidance we would like to point out that there will be some seasonality in our quarterly performance but q1 is expected to be among our strongest quarters given easier year over year comps coupled with very strong group pace during the quarter on the flip side q2 will likely work out to be one of our weaker quarters as several of our major markets faced tough year over year comps including san francisco chicago and new york recall that group revenues during the second quarter of 2018 were up over 17 and therefore group pace is likely to be flat to down slightly during the second quarter we feel very good about the back half of the year though with strong group pace overall and with exceptionally soft performance expected in hawaii san francisco and new york on the margin front while expense growth in 2019 will likely be 50 to 100 basis points higher than the 2 5 increase we witnessed last year we are forecasting margin growth of 30 basis points at the midpoint this year due in large part to healthy increases in f b and catering revenues one of the benefits of a strong group base coupled with high single digit increases in ancillary income including parking revenues from a cost perspective our asset management team working in partnership with hilton continues to focus on all available areas in order to reduce controllable expenses just a couple of housekeeping issues to make sure you ve taken note first as we ve disclosed previously the ground lease at our hilton chicago o hare property expired at the end of 2018 and as expected the city has taken back the 860 room property the hotel accounted for roughly 13 5 million of ebitda contribution last year on a positive note revpar margins at the property ran conservatively lower in our consolidated portfolio average so the net effect of removing the hotel from the comparable portfolio is an approximate 1 10 increase in average revpar for 2018 while comparable hotel adjusted ebitda margin is positively impacted by approximately 20 basis points additionally we are adding the hilton waikoloa village hotel back into our comp set for 2019 since the plan to give back the remaining 466 rooms in the ocean tower does not incur until the end of this year recall that the initial transfer of rooms incurred in 2017 so there is a clean year over year comparison of the hotel s performance in 2019 versus 2018 finally i wanted to provide you with the latest on our redevelopment efforts at the caribe hilton in puerto rico the property currently remains closed with the reopening of the resort expected to occur in may 2019 which will include most of the guestrooms and f b outlets and all the meeting space common areas and amenities regarding the insurance claim during the fourth quarter we received 10 million of insurance proceeds related to business interruption taking full year ebitda for the property up to 11 million after netting out carrying costs and other expenses this also includes a portion of bi related to the impacted months in 2017 total insurance proceeds received to date including the property damage side of the claim are 115 million with the property remaining closed for the next few months we expect to receive additional bi proceeds this year as a reminder the hotel generated approximately 8 million of ebitda on an annual basis prior to the hurricane that concludes our prepared remarks we will now open the line for q a to address each of your questions we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up operator may we have the first question please questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of bill crow from raymond james please proceed with your question bill crow raymond james analyst hey good morning guys thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hey bill how are you bill crow raymond james analyst i m good thank you for asking what is the downside of grouping up what are you giving up and is that a strategy that s only really effective later in the cycle thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer it s a great question bill we don t one think they re say they re mutually inclusive we think by grouping up particularly with our top 10 assets or really even our top 25 assets to really play to our natural strength it s a real competitive advantage for us long term now if you think about 2018 as an example so we were up grouped it was up about 5 for the year transient essentially for us was a little better than flat but our contract business is up obviously it s about another 5 of our business north of 21 so effectively what we re doing is we re shrinking the hotel we re anchoring our business with really high quality group business coupled with the fact that we re layering in contract business and then we can more efficiently manage transient and price it accordingly plus all of the other ancillary revenue income that we get by taking advantage of really these large group houses so we actually think it s the prudent business model in the past a lot of hotels were really more focused on transient we think this is really our core strategy moving forward and candidly i think we re proving it out the strength that we expect in 2019 and we don t think this is a one hit wonder we think that this continues into 2020 and also when you look out and seeing both in 2019 and in 2020 where they re not great citywide years across many of the major markets we were proactive and got in front of this a couple of years ago identifying that and fielding partnering with our partners at hilton and just being laser focused on grouping up our business so we see this as a competitive advantage and again playing to the natural strength that we have at park bill crow raymond james analyst yes thanks and speaking of hilton can you maybe frame the risk reward involved in taking the hilton bonnet creek and putting a brand new brand on that property and what are you getting from hilton in order to do that thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer it s a fair question bill i would say look we love that resort and we think we ve got huge upside there over 400 acres championship golf course 1 500 rooms orlando as you know is a bit of an arms race so adding more meeting space here is going to be critical to our long term success so we re going to commence obviously with the rooms redo redo the lobby at the hilton clearly add more additional meeting space both at the hilton and at the waldorf and then again we ve got a great confidence in our partners at hilton and as you think about the need for sort of a hilton plus brand assuming it does that the meeting planners have said that they want that sort of upgraded experience we think bonnet creek is a great example of that and we are confident in its long term success there s always a risk but i think hilton has got a demonstrated track record of being able to launch new brands and really this is sort of a brand extension and a brand upgrade of hilton so you re not really taking away from the core benefit of hilton bill crow raymond james analyst okay thank you for your time i appreciate it thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from the line of rich hightower from evercore isi please proceed with your question rich hightower evercore isi analyst hey morning guys thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer morning rich how are you rich hightower evercore isi analyst good thank you tom so a question here with respect to the 2 to 4 revpar guidance can you just help us understand the key variables between the low end and the high end and are those asset specific catalysts in either direction or it s something more broad than that thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer as you think about the year and again as i mentioned in our prepared remarks we benefit obviously from a strong group pace hawaii again going to be up north of 23 and group pace we expect that clearly waikoloa is going to be up almost 80 includes there hilton hawaiian village will be up about 80 so clearly that ll be a very strong performance for us probably mid slightly above probably mid above that in revpar growth san francisco has got obviously have a very strong year as you know citywides being up certainly north of 1 2 million and out of the 78 plus or minus we expect there and we re probably going to do probably 7 to 9 range see how the year unfolds it s off to a great start so far clearly we think chicago is going to have a strong year group pace there and new york city so overall it s pretty well diversified it s not just dependent on those two markets so we feel comfortable where we are and if any indication again we re coming on the heels of the first quarter becoming against sort of a 1 1 1 i think growth in 2017 excuse me 2018 there so as we think about this year we re going to have a very strong first quarter as we mentioned kind of 4 to 5 revpar we are and expect the third quarter to be strong while second quarter you ve got tough comps there due to such strong improvements there last year we feel comfortable with it rich there are things that can happen in geopolitical but when you think about the group base that we have obviously the layering in the contract business also continues to be strong and we are cautiously optimistic and are very comfortable with the guidance that we provided rich hightower evercore isi analyst okay so the low end of the range then just to kind of characterize that is more of a macro cushion it sounds like kind of up against all the other positive indicators you mentioned thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer that s a very fair statement but remember we re up 10 plus or minus here on below that 30 of our business so we feel we ve got a solid anchoring there that low line for sure rich hightower evercore isi analyst okay got it and then my second question here as you ve seen the company is trading multiple rerate progressively since the company was spun out from hilton a couple of years back are you noticing more acquisition opportunities i m sorry past the initial screen as you think about external growth this year thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes for sure rich i mean listen this is all part of a master plan for us if you think about the way we thought very carefully about our plan in the first two years and again the internal growth story we were anchored and obviously recycling capital we sold 14 assets for 570 million obviously we used 348 million of that to buy back 14 million shares as part of the hna trade if you look at the stock performance since the hna trade including dividends we ve got to be up north of 40 outperformed our peers 1 400 basis points both look in 2018 if you look two years it will be greater than that i m very proud of the work that we ve done made great progress on obviously the roi projects that we ve talked about regarding the fess parker double tree to a hilton the bonnet creek work that s going to begin we obviously are going to be converting the reach this year and starting the urgent process on double tree san jose converting that to a hilton and we ve made great progress on a number of initiatives on the margin front as we demonstrated there were a fair number of naysayers out there and we said we d grow margin 75 basis points in 2018 where and we delivered certainly 60 basis points on an absolute side and continue to close that gap and that grouping up which as we just talked about from maybe it s a question we continue to make great progress there so all of that provides us with the optionality as we reshape the portfolio to begin to going off it and we re going to be very thoughtful about it and disciplined about it we ll continue to look whether that s single assets whether that s portfolios or whether that s other transactions we re clearly not going to be selling stock where we re trading we re not going to issue stock at i would say at a discount to nav i think you know me you know the discipline that i bring to the process and the team certainly shares that i think we ve demonstrated that we re very prudent capital allocators so we re excited about the growth prospects and candidly it s important for us to also show both that brand in offering diversification so we d love to be able to fold in on marriott brand in our hyatt brand and impress other brands at the appropriate time and at the appropriate pricing so we love our positioning and we love the great opportunity that we have as we move forward rich hightower evercore isi analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of smedes rose from citi please proceed with your question smedes rose citi analyst hi thanks i just wanted to make sure in your guidance for margin growth in 2019 does that include the 20 basis points lift from the exclusion of the chicago o hare airport hotel sean m dell orto executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer hi smedes it s sean it is not it s obviously a comparable set year over year so o hare would not be another year looking at smedes rose citi analyst okay and then i wanted to just talk a little bit more about the group the pace is so strong compared to peers for 2019 i m just wondering is there any way you could maybe talk about it with san francisco and then for the rest of the portfolio and normally wouldn t break that out but it seems like san francisco is so strong this year and next year that it would be helpful to kind of know how much of that is driving the growth thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes specifically smedes to make sure i understand your question getting a sense of group pace in terms of our other key markets is that your question smedes rose citi analyst yes thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer so again as we mentioned hawaii up 23 san francisco up 17 2 chicago up nearly 8 new york again up 6 4 keep in mind both chicago and new york as we said in the prepared remarks is sitting down both well north of 30 so again in that soft market we were proactive rerouting funds and again we were grouping up so again showing the proactive teamwork leadership focus from men and women in part coupled with our operating partners at hilton so we ve got a long lead time here so we were looking at this two and three years ago it wasn t just six months ago in this process so really proud of the discipline and how hard the team has worked here hence the reason that we re getting the results and we continue to outperform our peers on the on these matters and with that again new orleans up 3 new orleans is also down about 20 this year we re up in 3 orlando was down 5 citywide we re up about 2 2 d c is down and we are also down we are not down as far as many of our peers are vis a vis there so again a concerted effort proactive into group up and we played though the internal growth strategies that we have been talking about non stop for the last two years we re bearing the fruit of that hard work smedes rose citi analyst okay yeah thanks for the color operator our next question comes from the line of david katz from jefferies please proceed with your question thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hi david david katz jefferies analyst hi good morning everyone i just wanted to go back to the opportunity for acquisitions in that landscape has pricing gotten stiffer what kind of term landscape are you seeing and what would you say are kind of the two biggest obstacles for getting something done this year is it finding the right thing is it finding the right price how should we think about that thank you thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer that s a great question david look we re open for business clearly the first two years and the safe harbor and some of the other tax issues that we had to be really sensitive to but even more important than that we thought obviously as a new public company we had to earn our stripes we need to make sure that we have the operational discipline and then through all those initiatives that i have outlined really i think are on much better footing we ve actually got a much stronger multiple today than we had certainly two years ago and that certainly gives us optionality we will continue to look opportunistically for single asset deals that meet our criteria and brand and operating diversification are a big part of that we ll continue to look at portfolios that make sense and we re not opposed to m a we have said that and one of the big attractions to this opportunity for me the park is we think that this industry and our sector is really right for consolidation and at the appropriate time we certainly want to be a participant in that process what we re not interested in we note there are some other large portfolios that are out there and their pricing and forecasts and sub forecasts we re not a buyer of that kind of real estate in this pricing cycle we don t think it s prudent we don t think that s disciplined we certainly aren t looking to lever up we certainly want to stay north of five times net debt to ebitda and as we ve said we were well south of four times today so we do have the flexibility whether it s single asset or a small portfolio or m a in the right situation could make sense we re not planning to issue equity unless we see the stock trading at or above any day it s certainly something that we will be more open to david katz jefferies analyst can we just go back to the size issue for one second if that s all right it is are there circumstances where something that s in the 5 billion 6 billion category a possibility for you thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yeah yeah again you re asking a hypothetical it s structured in an appropriate way and it makes economic sense and it s a premium yeah it s hard to imagine a 5 billion deal talking about a potential large portfolio that we all know is being marketed i don t see that being fit for us there s certainly could be other stock or stock deals that could make sense and be of scale david katz jefferies analyst got it i just wanted to understand the boundaries thanks for your answers thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from the line of anthony powell from barclays please proceed with your question anthony powell barclays analyst hi hello everyone thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good morning anthony how are you anthony powell barclays analyst good good there seem to be differences of demand growth in the corporate transient and corporate group segments with group doing well to your benefit have you diverged in price cycles and how long did it last do you think thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yeah it s a great question i think look if you think about the economic climate obviously we re getting late in the national business cycle getting 10 years lodging plus or minus we think historically trough to trough is about 11 years trough to peak it s about seven years look we ve had anemic growth early in the cycle and they re still running them they re still laying i know there s some who believe that a recession is likely in 2020 we certainly don t share that view and you look at the economic data i think which came out today obviously our gnp about 2 6 i think non residential fixed investment spending is up about 6 2 in the fourth quarter and still expected to be up 4 so that clearly continues to provide a backdrop what we re also finding is that it s the companies with low employment is they are looking to continue to train by the appropriate incentives to continue to motivate their workforces that we are still seeing that corporations are still spending money on their group needs and again given our natural competitive footprint plus from geographic standpoint and from an access standpoint i think park is really positioned to take advantage of that these transient has been choppy and we re excited as we look back to 2018 and for us relatively flat slightly up in total but our group business was up 5 our contract business again has grown 21 so we think that s just appropriate we re playing to our strength and using the appropriate levers but as the cycle continues to lengthen they are it will be pockets that weren t choppy but we really like our positioning certainly in 2019 and on in 2020 anthony powell barclays analyst thanks and moving on to acquisitions looking at the peer group most of the deal actually is focused on smaller hotels resorts and increasingly independent hotels what s your type i mean type of hotels in your portfolio i know you ve preferred brand historically but could you see adding some large independent or boutique hotels for the future thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer no secret anthony i am a strong believer in brands have made that and obviously having worked for the marriott companies and having worked for hilton i ve got a strong understanding i would say that they ve got a long term competitive advantage given the brand segmentation given their loyalty program i think hilton has got now 85 million members in their loyalty program plus or minus and i know marriott is somewhere in the 120 million range and more than 50 if not 60 of their occupancy coming through those are powerful of historical systems so i m a brand guy and we believe here at park in the strength of brands so and we embrace the soft brands which is another lay out i see the timing in those portals in a very distinctive way so we as you think about our strategy it s really upper upscale and luxury hotels top 25 markets in dream destinations we really have a bias toward those bigger group houses for all the reasons that we ve been talking about on the phone we re not opposed to an independent opportunities and probably look to partner or have those tied into one of our preferred brands and certainly have marriott and hilton on the top of that list but we look forward to expanding our relationship with higher and leverage as well anthony powell barclays analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of chris woronka from deutsche bank please proceed with your question chris woronka deutsche bank analyst hey good morning guys thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good morning chris chris woronka deutsche bank analyst good morning i want to ask on the margins how did 2018 unfold relative to your expectations on kind of a core inflation on the core expenses you guys obviously beat your guidance so i m trying to figure out how much of that was due to expense pressures not being as bad and how much of it was due to maybe your initiatives thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer rob is going to take that question for you robert d tanenbaum executive vice president asset management chris overall in 2018 our operating expenses were up 2 5 and really it was a combination of controlling our expenses throughout we spent a great deal of time driving revenues and looking at our premium room category we ve had great success throughout our portfolio to give you a quick example in san francisco 85 rooms we categorized from standard rooms to a new room category and have generated over 700 000 of revenue alone have similar success in boston logan converted 148 rooms to a new category and we re actually looking at other hotels as well including embassy suites in austin to be forthcoming so the other part that we are looking at here is our pricing not only in between categories but also within the categories as we see how do we further drive revenues to help further reduce our cost control there and our pricing within the various booking windows when we look at pricing going on 30 days 60 days 90 days we really believe there s opportunity to further drive our rent there and then from the cost side we ve been renegotiating our contracts throughout great opportunity our team in honolulu are doing an amazing job with a elevator contract saving over 1 5 million over the life of the contract over four years so really working with our teams we think differently as we look forward there we re also combining our management position reducing our food costs and also taking operations in house a great example of that is that in key west we took our beach and pool operation in house we saw an increase in our guest service satisfaction but more importantly and additionally excuse me we had the availability of having a run rate of 200 000 coming down to ebitda so we re really thinking throughout our process here how do we work together to further drive our revenues and the bottom line chris woronka deutsche bank analyst great that s great color rob thanks just i ll try to sneak in one more acquisition question if i can and it s really how do you how important is it to you guys that if we re talking a single asset that you have kind of a story to the hotel and i guess the real question is are you willing to do transformative things at this point in the cycle or do you think you re looking more for yield that s already there thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes i that s a fair question chris i would say that an asset was in place the cash flow forming an embedded story whether that s through the asset management initiative some of which rob just outlined whether it s a property needing capital infusion so you are doing something transformative taking a deep turn at this point in the cycle is not something we re likely to do it s something that you take on sort of earlier in the cycle or later in the cycle those also tend to be better plays for many private equity platforms in sort of what i would call traditional reit food so you will see us continue to be as we demonstrated i ll remind listeners that discipline and the track record and how prudent we ve been on capital allocation we re going to be very thoughtful we re going to be disciplined remain compliant with our guiding principles operational excellence capital allocation a low levered balance sheet and never going to deviate from that discipline and that discipline as we demonstrated has delivered outperformance significant outperformance vis a vis our peers chris woronka deutsche bank analyst okay very good thanks guys operator our next question comes from the line of gregory miller from suntrust robinson humphrey please proceed with your question patrick scholes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst i m on the line for patrick scholes good morning first question have a related question on your margin plan could you provide some color as to how much further you still have to go on margins to get to a relatively stabilized level similar to your peers thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer listen i that s an ongoing i mean keep in mind we continue to reshape the portfolio right so when you think about it we ve got now 52 hotels really the top 25 hotels and they account for about 90 of the value you can expect that we re going to continue to sell non core assets and recycle that capital either in the higher growth markets or alternatively into buying back stock if it made sense and when it s opportunistic for us so a credit and rob didn t breakout or walk you through our half dozen initiatives we need to say on behalf of rob and the great marketer we re doing in our asset management team we ve probably got 20 initiatives and we continue to work that depending on the hotel situation and we continue to have success but that disciplined focus and making sure that we re taking advantage of it there is a gap and closed it we believe about 110 basis points vis a vis our peers and that s still probably just south of 300 basis points obviously given our portfolio 60 of them being our cost structure is different we think that s really embedded into the dna of our culture continuing to seek ways to improvise as we said another 100 basis points this year cost structure s obviously rising but we re confident that we can that we re positive margin growth at least 30 basis points certainly given that backdrop patrick scholes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst great thanks for that and on another topic could you remind us about your demand for the u k and thoughts about potential impact from brexit especially to the gateway market that you re in and particularly the potential impact to transient demand thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer now when you think about it the dollar is down about 10 vis a vis the euro if anything you can take out hawaii we see we saw a slight increase in international demand and so from that standpoint we re encouraged obviously hawaii is so dependent on what s happening project s coming out of asia so a little bit of a wholesale concerning the reduction last year and we expect that s going to rebound this year so we re cautiously optimistic and we don t see any real fall off at this point as we look out and what we saw in 2018 look out we saw growth in chicago we saw the growth in new york so we are cautiously optimistic as we move forward patrick scholes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst all right great thanks appreciate it tom operator our next question comes from the line of stephen grambling from goldman sachs please proceed with your question stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst good morning thanks i guess my follow up on the thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good morning stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst good morning the brand diversification topic i guess how do you quantify the benefits from diversifying away from hilton while balancing the unique benefits from your relationship that have helped support the playbook since the split thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes so it s a great question i would just say that if you look at long term having a diversified platform and by diversified i mean that in terms of brand family in terms of operator terribly important and for us long term when you think about sort of the evolution of all those to where they are that brand diversification i think is very important also being able to look at different best practices that you re seeing from the brands and you re also seeing from other operators so we look forward to that now we do have a unique relationship today we are partnering on a daily basis we ve got a dedicated team within hilton that we re working with and clearly that s bearing significant fruit to us but long term our vision is to be the preeminent lodging reit to able to do that we clearly want to have a diversified platform for the brand operator and look forward to getting our first deal done with marriott with hyatt and with others over time stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst so would anything change then with the relationship with hilton thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer nothing will change in my past life stephen we had that was a large hilton area and hyatt franchisee and we had 16 17 management companies i don t see us getting to that level of management companies it makes the closing process a little more difficult it makes the asset management a little more challenging but i would tell you that the men and women in park are really looking forward to that and excited about really continuing to strengthen this relationships beyond hilton i love our partnerships with hilton and obviously as we ve continued to demonstrate it is going very very well stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst that s helpful color and maybe one other quick follow up on consolidation it seems that bigger consolidation across the space tends to come under a life event for management teams or differing view by one management team versus another on either the cycle or the willingness to navigate the next leg of the cycle do you feel like there has been a change in either of these factors across the space that may be creating opportunities there thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes well listen i ve been talking about it for probably north of a decade now as many of the listeners know and still a passionate believer i think it s inevitable we are the most fragmented in a sector that is right for consolidation it will happen at the appropriate time we saw last year with couple working with lasalle we saw it the year before with rlj and bell corp and i think others will begin to look for dance partners at the appropriate time social issues tend to be the biggest impediment at the end of the day capital is going to be the most efficient manager it s just not efficient to have 16 or 17 whatever the number of lodging reits that we have today and over time that value is its going to change in my view stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst helpful thanks best of luck this year thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yeah thanks so much operator our next question comes from the line of brandt montour from jpmorgan please proceed with your question brandt montour jpmorgan analyst hey good morning everyone thanks for taking for question so you talked about the group a lot and you ve been proactive over the last two to three years giving professional tours going out and getting that group business i was just wondering are you seeing the market getting more competitive maybe running into some of your peers out there putting more resources in this business and really going out and getting that in house group business thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer it s a great question i would say every situation is different in our portfolio we saw immediately it s a competitive advantage and there was a gap there so we set out on that journey it takes time to do that so obviously perhaps all of the day it will take them some time to catch up in our view obviously lyman ph and inaudible leading his very talented team are being in the right i think they are are front of this that s really the nature of the business but we re not seeing them any more today than normally i think we suspect that both hilton area and hyatt and other really big platforms that are managing that better in normal business case certainly fighting for share on that side of the business but that business is so large there s enough growth and capacity for all of us here brandt montour jpmorgan analyst got it that s helpful and then to extend that same topic if you extent that the convention calendar they reverse in 2020 how aggressively are you booking up 2020 group room occupancies or at least what s the philosophy on booking that far out and potentially forgoing like compression like pricing later on thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yeah again as i said earlier it s really a fundamental challenge for us if you think about 2020 as an example of yet another year where citywides are going do not as certainly not as strong as what we ve seen in other periods so there s hawaii and we re up 34 new york we re up 31 san francisco we re up 7 9 and i think in the bonnet creek our resort there in orlando up another 5 5 so again for us it is the thesis is anchor our business with the group they are in some contract businesses and which allow us to most efficiently price transient grow the ancillary revenue think about san francisco we ve got a full city block we ve got 3 000 rooms so having that anchored group business for us is a really prudent move coupled with having a certain amount of transient of contract business think about obviously our hilton hawaiian village campus there we ve got 2 900 rooms so again just for us it s just a prudent business decision to continue to grow business appropriately and then layer in that transient brandt montour jpmorgan analyst great helpful thanks good luck on great results thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of robin farley from ubs please proceed with your question thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hey robin robin farley ubs analyst great thank you hi how are you you commented the group up 10 for 2019 and i think last quarter you had talked about being up 12 so i m just wondering if bookings slowed in the fourth quarter or if there was just something about the timing of that up 12 in q3 that compared to the 10 now thanks thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer nothing that visible robyn we ve continued strong anchored again of 10 we feel good very good about our positioning part of that s just the year over year evolving and again just look out to 2020 as we mentioned we re up north of 9 so noting no deceleration we re not seeing cancellations increase they re very good and we ve got 80 of our business on the books for this year so feel very good about our position for 2019 robin farley ubs analyst okay great i don t know if you d give like bookings that came in q4 versus the prior year for group and then just my other follow up i also wanted to ask on you mentioned leisure down 0 4 and i m just wondering is that because group took up inventory that would have gone to that or is there something else going on there with leisure in your view thanks thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer i don t the reality is that i think that the transient has been choppy leisure really has been stronger if you think about this cycling and business in transient has somewhat lagged so a little bit of a reverse effect right we were up business in transient about 4 2 in the fourth quarter and it s really down again i don t there s nothing as we look out and see the transient pace the transient pace continues to be strong across most of the segments so we ve been having a diversified portfolio we re comfortable with the guidance and the direction of the business in 2019 robin farley ubs analyst okay great thank you operator we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i would now like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well it s great to be with all of you today and look forward to seeing many of you at the citi conference and in the weeks and

united states is second with 470 000 according to data from the vda industry association u s president donald trump pursuing an america first agenda has repeatedly criticized germany s bumper trade surplus and warned that washington will impose tariffs on european cars if it is unable to reach a trade deal with the european union a confidential report by the u s commerce department sent to trump in mid february is widely expected to pave the way to impose duties on imported autos and auto parts by designating them a threat to american national security trump had 90 days to decide whether to act upon the recommendations until mid may a no deal brexit meanwhile would see britain falling back to the status of a third country under the rules of the world trade organisation wto this would push up british import tariffs for german cars to roughly 10 percent for trucks and pick ups tariffs of up to 22 percent would apply customs inspections at ports and borders are likely to disrupt just in time delivery chains a no deal scenario would be serious and entail significant risks for companies and employees in the eu 27 a vda spokesman said massive impairments in logistics and high customs costs would be the result vicious cycle if both scenarios become reality the combined impact could chop off up to 0 7 percentage points from germany s gross domestic product gdp growth in the long term separate estimates from commerzbank and the ifo institute show the german government already expects gdp growth to slow to 1 percent this year from 1 4 percent in 2018 but this forecast is built on the assumption that an escalation of the u s trade dispute and a no deal brexit can be avoided in case of a disorderly brexit there will be short term negative effects such as increased uncertainty and adjustment processes though these are hard to quantify an economy ministry spokesman said however studies estimate that a no deal brexit would cost germany 0 2 percentage points of growth a year in the long term the spokesman added he declined to quantify the expected damage of higher u s tariffs for german cars the goal of the eu and the german government is to seal a trade deal with the u s that lowers tariffs for industrial goods on both sides the spokesman said volkswagen s chief executive herbert diess said in a financial times interview last week that higher u s tariffs could cost the automaker up to 2 5 billion euros a year this would be roughly 13 percent of vw s expected earnings in 2019 german car exports to the united states could fall by almost 50 percent in the long term if trump was to impose car tariffs of 25 percent the ifo institute has estimated this would reduce german gdp growth by roughly 0 5 percentage points commerzbank economist joerg kraemer said for the german economy as a whole higher u s tariffs and a no deal brexit together would also hit business sentiment and consumer morale which could throw the economy into a vicious cycle economists say household spending the most important pillar of the domestic economy could falter if uncertainty about the economy spilled over onto the labor market rolf buerkl from the gfk research group warned if employees get the impression during the course of the year that their jobs are no longer secure this would have a direct negative effect on the consumer mood buerkl said less growth also means less

by michael nienaber berlin reuters germany faces the risk of steep u s tariffs on cars and a no deal brexit a double whammy which could bring a golden decade of growth in europe s powerhouse economy to an end chancellor angela merkel and her ministers are working behind the scenes to mitigate the impact should the worst case scenario come to pass a stagnating german economy or even a recession would hold back the euro zone as a whole and cast uncertainty over the european central bank s planned exit from its loose monetary policy the berlin government is already facing a budget shortfall of up to 25 billion euros by 2023 as the economic slowdown means tax revenues will come in below previous estimates according to a finance ministry document nonetheless faced with the threat of a recession finance minister olaf scholz is prepared to bend germany s strict debt rules a senior government official told reuters on condition of anonymity if the double whammy should materialize we want to pull something out of the hat the official said suggesting that the government is working on a fiscal stimulus package this will be a test to our policy of no new debt and germany s debt brake the official added the finance ministry declined to comment on this germany which barely avoided a recession last year is especially vulnerable to both the risks of u s tariffs of up to 25 percent on

conference call covering our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results i am delighted to report that the fourth quarter was another strong quarter for pra which produced solid revenue growth and double digit adjusted net income growth we also continue to see strong growth in our new business awards and our backlog net new business increased approximately 3 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 we had 667 million of net new business awards representing a net book to bill of 1 3 times revenue continuing our consecutive quarter run of net book to bill equal to or greater than 1 2 times revenue for full year 2018 we had a record level of 2 6 billion of net new business awards representing growth of 10 and a net book to bill of 1 29 ph times as we have previously discussed our new business awards and calculation of net book to bill ratio excludes the revenue impact of adopting asc 606 excludes reimbursement revenue and excludes revenue from our data solutions segment the addition of our new awards has resulted in our backlog increasing approximately 4 on a sequential basis and 20 year over year finishing at approximately 4 2 billion as we previously disclosed our backlog does not include our data solutions segment and in addition we exclude pass through and investigator revenue from backlog the diversity of our new business awards continues to be consistent with previous quarters with approximately 58 of our new awards coming from the pharmaceutical sector and approximately 42 coming from the biotech sector revenue for the fourth quarter was approximately 730 million which represents an increase of approximately 11 year over year at actual foreign exchange rates and 12 on a constant currency basis revenue growth excluding the impact of the adoption of asc 606 and reimbursement revenue was approximately 4 year over year at actual foreign exchange rates adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was approximately 87 million an increase of approximately 26 over the same period last year adjusted net income per diluted share was 1 31 a 26 increase versus the fourth quarter of 2017 our client base continues to be well diversified with our top five clients representing approximately 36 of total revenue for the quarter and our largest client representing approximately 9 of total revenue both metrics exclude the impact of adopting asc 606 our full year 2018 financial results continue to trend of consistent and strong growth we reported solid revenue growth and improved our overall operating margins we delivered full year revenue of approximately 2 9 billion representing growth of approximately 27 at actual foreign currency exchange rates and 26 on a constant currency basis organic revenue growth which excludes impact of the adoption of asc 606 reimbursement revenue and our 2017 acquisitions was approximately 10 year over year at both actual foreign exchange rates and on a constant currency basis during 2018 we made significant investments in our business and enhanced our service offerings we believe that we ve established a foundation that will allow us to provide long term and sustainable growth and believe we are well positioned to offer a wide variety of services to our clients due to our solid performance in 2018 we are anticipating 2019 adjusted earnings per diluted share between 4 93 per share and 5 08 per share mike will provide additional details about our 2019 guidance later in the call during 2018 many of you raised questions about the status of studies that were cancelled heading into 2018 the impact of the pharma industry m a activity on our business and the integration of our symphony business i would like to take a moment just to provide a brief update on each of these items regarding the canceled studies as i ve mentioned in the past these were replaced and have been up and running since the later half of that 2018 and as we ve mentioned previously our client had prioritized their pipeline and as a result canceled and then subsequently replaced their studies the replacement studies were of a similar value but have a longer duration than the general studies as you are aware the takeda and inaudible transaction closed in january 2019 we don t anticipate the closing of this transaction to have an impact on studies that are currently running for takeda and we are optimistic about the impact of transaction will have on our new business in the future we look forward to continuing our partnership with takeda as it heads into s4 ph of our relationship regarding our data solutions segment i am pleased that we have finalized the inaudible and we are now in a position to complete our integration plans and expand on our service offerings as anticipated we saw the unusual sorry the usual seasonality in this business and we are able to meet our forecast for the year in closing i would like to thank our entire staff and our clients for their continued commitment to pra health sciences we are delighted with our strong financial results and believe we are well positioned for 2019 i would now like to hand over the call to mike bonello our chief financial officer who will go through our quarterly and full year financial results in more detail michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you colin good morning everyone for the fourth quarter of 2018 our consolidated revenue grew 11 2 at actual foreign exchange rates and 12 on a constant currency basis we reported revenue of 729 6 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 655 9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 when comparing recorded revenue to our third quarter guidance fourth quarter reported revenues negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations of approximately 3 million and lower than forecasted reimbursement revenue of 8 million our guidance assumed reimbursement revenue of approximately 28 5 of asc 605 revenue while actuals came in at 27 revenue excluding the impact of the adoption of asc 606 and reimbursement revenue increased 3 6 at actual foreign exchange rates and 4 2 on a constant currency basis revenue by segment for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 655 6 million for the clinical research segment and 74 million for the data solutions segment regarding revenue concentration for the fourth quarter of 2018 we derived 54 of our service revenue from large pharmaceutical companies 11 from small to mid sized pharmaceutical companies 16 from large biotechnology companies and 19 from all other biotechnology companies these concentration metrics exclude our data solutions segment the adoption of asc 606 and reimbursement revenue and are in line with what we ve seen in previous quarters total direct costs were 365 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 368 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease in direct costs was primarily related to a favorable impact of 8 6 million from foreign currency exchange rates which was offset by an increase in labor related costs in our clinical research segment as we continue to ensure appropriate staffing levels and an increase of 1 6 million in our data solutions segment excluding the impact of the adoption of asc 606 and reimbursement revenue direct costs were 62 1 of service revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 64 9 in the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease in direct costs as a percentage of service revenue is primarily due to favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations discussed earlier and an increase in utilization of our staff sg a expenses were 96 4 million or 16 4 of revenue excluding the impact of the adoption of asc 606 and reimbursement revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 16 2 for the fourth quarter of 2017 the slight increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of service revenue is primarily related to an increase in stock based compensation during the current year the increase in stock based compensation expense is primarily related to the initiation of our annual grant program and the adoption of our employee stock purchase plan and is consistent with the trend we saw in the third quarter of 2018 during the fourth quarter of 2018 we incurred transaction related expenses of 3 1 million compared to 75 9 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 both amounts were primarily related to changes in the fair value of earn out liabilities associated with our acquisitions adjusted net income which excludes certain items whose fluctuation from period to period does not necessarily correspond to changes in our operating results increased 26 4 year over year to 86 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 adjusted net income per diluted share grew 26 to 1 31 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 1 04 per share in the same quarter last year for the 12 months ended december 31 2018 our consolidated revenues grew approximately 27 at actual foreign exchange rates and 26 on a constant currency basis revenue excluding the impact of the adoption of asc 606 and reimbursement revenue increased 18 at actual foreign exchange rates and 17 on a constant currency basis we finished the year with approximately 2 3 billion of revenue excluding the impact of the adoption of asc 606 and reimbursement revenue compared to 1 9 million ph in the comparable prior year cash provided by operations was 131 2 million for the three months ended december 31 2018 compared to cash provided by operations of 102 6 million for the three months ended december 31 2017 for the 12 months ended december 31 2018 cash provided by operations was 329 8 million compared to 220 4 million for the 12 months ended december 31 2017 the increase in operating cash flow was the result of an increase in operational performance and optimization of our working capital our net days sales outstanding were 16 days at december 31 2018 compared to 20 days at december 31 2017 capital expenditures were 15 8 million for the three months ended december 31 2018 compared to 22 million for the three months ended december 31 2017 capital expenditures were 55 9 million for the 12 months ended december 31 2018 compared to 61 3 million for the 12 months ended december 31 2017 our capital expenditures continue to reflect our investment in information technology and the expansion of our infrastructure to support our growth our cash balance was 144 2 million at the end of the fourth quarter of which 63 2 million was held by our foreign subs net debt outstanding defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2018 was 942 3 million compared to 1 16 billion at december 31 2017 during the fourth quarter of 2018 we made additional voluntary principal payments of 110 million during 2018 total principal payments on long term debt were 224 million regarding currency concentration at december 31 2018 excluding the impact of the adoption of asc 606 and reimbursement revenue 84 of our revenue were denominated in us dollars and 62 of our total expenses were denominated in us dollars which is consistent with prior quarters and consistent with 2017 levels our euro exposure continues to be naturally hedged as we ve of discussed in prior quarters we have exposure to movements in the gbp as less than 1 of our revenue was denominated in gbp of 5 of our expenses are denominated in gbp we continue to look at ways to reduce this exposure turning to our net guidance for 2019 we are estimating revenues between 3 09 billion and 3 2 billion representing as reported in constant currency growth of 8 to 11 on an asc 605 basis we re estimating revenues between 2 475 billion and 2 57 billion representing as reported in constant currency growth of 8 to 12 we are anticipating gaap earnings per diluted share between 3 65 and 3 80 per share and adjusted earnings per diluted share of between 4 93 and 5 08 per share we anticipate that our annual effective income tax rate will be approximately 24 which incorporates the expected changes from the us tax cuts and jobs act our effective rate may differ from this estimate with the geographical distribution of our pre tax earnings changes from what we have estimated or if there are changes in the interpretation analysis or if additional guidance is issued related to the us tax cuts and jobs act regarding q1 2019 guidance we are estimating revenues between 720 million and 740 million representing as reported growth of 3 to 5 and constant currency growth of 4 to 7 on an asc 605 basis we re estimating revenues between 575 million and 595 million representing as reported growth of 3 to 6 and constant currency growth of 4 to 7 as a reminder we reported organic revenue growth excluding asc 606 and reimbursement revenue in the data solutions segment of 17 8 on an as reported basis and 15 2 on a constant currency basis in the first quarter of 2018 we are anticipating gaap earnings per share between 0 74 and 0 79 per share and adjusted earnings per diluted share of between 1 05 and 1 10 per share like our full year guidance we expect our effective income tax rate to be 24 consistent with prior years we are including q1 guidance to ensure the expectations around sequential quarter earnings growth are in line with our expectations this guidance includes the impact of the seasonality in our data solutions segment and the impact of first quarter recurring expenses such as payroll taxes and employee benefits and expenses incurred related to internal organizational meetings finally our guidance assumes a euro exchange rate of 1 15 and a british pound exchange rate of 1 35 all other foreign currency exchange rates are as of january 31 2019 our process for determining exchange rates was consistent with prior years where we use several bank resources to evaluate expected rate movements for the next 12 months that concludes our prepared remarks and now we d be happy to take your questions please provide your name and affiliation when asking a question operator you may now open the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from david windley with jefferies david windley jefferies analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my questions i wanted to focus on revenue first colin i think you had talked about the replace the canceled and then replace studies from your one of your key clients as having had or expected to have an impact in 2018 particularly in the second half and we see that in the growth rates and then in your guidance for the first quarter it looks like that growth rate is beginning to improve but still somewhat depressed and so i wanted to get a perspective on how your conversion rate how the backlog is flowing into revenue and what will drive the acceleration of your revenue growth through 2019 colin shannon president chief executive officer and director thanks dave with that mentioned obviously the cancellations had an impact there was some studies as well during the summer that we said was seeming to start a little bit slower than we anticipated but the teams have been doing a phenomenal job watching costs but then as we re approaching q4 we needed to completely change our goals and start getting into the hiring very very rapid hiring mode our company had to hire over 300 net new people a month and it was hard to switch that back on again after such conservative cost constraints and we managed to hit over 300 net new hires per month which is great stuff but we could have done more and it s been taken us a little while to really get back in drive again and it s only really now we re starting to hit on all cylinders so we re moving pretty much rapidly again so we ll start to see that improve as the year goes on everything starting to go nice again we are smoothing everything out so we remain optimistic obviously we are setting ourselves up nicely with see the q1 was still getting a little bit of after effect as we ramp up so we are pleased to see that it starts to improve as we get down later on in the year david windley jefferies analyst okay thank you second question might be for mike so my follow up is around 606 and 605 and you guys as it appears are choosing to continue to give guidance on both which i m sure we all find interesting i guess the two part would be if you could help us to understand how your systems allow you to continue to provide guidance on both and kind of as a read through do you i guess do you feel comfortable that you re going to be able to file your 10 k cleanly given some headlines lately michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sure dave so from a revenue perspective we were on an input based methodology prior to the adoption of 606 so we ve always been able to forecast the service component of our revenue unlike some of our competitors what we ve been able to do is we ve been able to separate out how we phase service and how we phase investigator and pass through so we re watching those separately and that s what allows us to be able to give you guidance on a 606 and 605 basis david windley jefferies analyst yes go ahead michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer regarding the 10 k we re planning on filing as soon as the call is over david windley jefferies analyst okay great thanks and no internal control weaknesses that we should be anticipating michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer no david windley jefferies analyst great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from john kreger with william blair john kreger william blair company analyst hi thanks very much colin can you just expand a little bit about your comments around data solutions as the earnout period ends just sort of refresh our memory what kind of synergies do you see across the two businesses and maybe if you could give us a preview on sort of product expansions that you mentioned as we move through 19 thanks colin shannon president chief executive officer and director that s great thanks john there s a few things in that question because some of them are not quite related to the data solutions by then on the data solutions the first thing that we are we moved the location the philadelphia location into our blue bell office so the team is better integrated with our main team is one of our largest offices that we have the largest office we have in the company is our blue bell and so that s helped with the integration and we ve made some adjustments to leadership just to help with the integration and culture shift because the way we re seeing with synergies it was not about cost savings it s raising new opportunities and working in collaboration together we see great opportunities and we ve had to make sure that we had the right fit to make sure that we enabled all these connections to work within the organization these things have been put in place the beginning of the year as i said i would do and we re looking forward to building on that basis for the rest of the year i mean regarding our service offerings we ve been continuing to enhance what we re doing on the inaudible as you know vested in parallel 6 and the c6 platform and is taking a lot of traction we re seeing a lot of interest from clients who are really want to be more innovative and do things differently except the same old ways of getting things done so we re excited to be where that is taking off and it is helping us with bringing new offerings to clients with new solutions we still utilize updates a very definitely from our competitors that again is giving us new insights and ways of working with them we see great opportunities on the more on the commercial side where we can start linking things together and we take advantage of some of our symphony data assets and the acquisition of that company we continue to pursue some opportunities in that direction all in all we feel very nicely positioned that we re helping to shift the mindset and even look definitely and actually offer differ solutions to our clients john kreger william blair company analyst great thank you and maybe just a quick follow up how are strategic solutions doing and are you seeing the mix of your awards shifted out toward either full services or the staffing business thanks colin shannon president chief executive officer and director that s a very good question interestingly we are much we re seeing much more solid growth on the old traditional product registration part of the business and you know as part of our build out for our guidance i do admit for being slightly more conservative on our strategic solutions part of the business i mean part of that as you re well aware with that you know the pricing discussions going on with the same with the capitol hill ph and with that biopharma s testifying that always seems to cause a little bit of an issue with expenditure within the biopharma companies we ve been generally a little bit cautious knowing that there might be squeezing the budgets and things like that so we wanted to make sure that we conserve that as we re preparing our guidance john kreger william blair company analyst thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from eric coldwell with baird eric coldwell robert w baird co analyst hey thanks very much the two smart guys asked a couple of my questions but i ll just i ll follow up with maybe a couple of easier ones hopefully good answer on data solutions i m just curious if you can tell us what your growth outlook is for this year is it 5 is it 10 and then second one i m curious if a couple of your peers have thrown out provocative terms or said hey maybe there was a little bit of softness in the market at a certain point in the third or fourth quarter i m just curious did you see any of those air pockets maybe with a certain client cohort or in a certain geography or was your pipeline in rfi activity pretty similar as the year concluded colin shannon president chief executive officer and director okay well on the data solutions side i ll have to come back to you on where we re seeing the growth we re just in the process of planning we just finished our business development meeting with the new leadership team and so i d really like to give them a little bit more time to really look at how we can build that plan together we ll set some pretty tough objectives and so think it was a little bit going through the first few weeks of the year but i expected to make up and more because we re going to be utilizing the whole organization behind them so if you don t mind i ll get back to you on that aspect as we finalize some plans i will just completed the and what s our visibility and really looking at opportunities where we want to see what we can do that regarding rfp flow and you know i didn t notice anything that was majorly different you know i say going into the beginning of the call a little bit soft in one of the months and started recoveries the trend wise it s still kind of upwards and strong we are seeing new opportunities which are always more difficult for us to win because you re always got to displace an incumbent you know but that s always gets us exciting opportunities we like to have these discussions to offer our new approaches and we like that challenge we ve been excited about the flow we are seeing new progress you know all in all i think that things are holding up nicely i mean i would obviously have competitors we re seeing a little bit of weakness on the biotech and maybe they are looking at different level of the maturities of the biotech or whatever i don t know the answer but we are seeing regular decent size opportunities and we know that there is still a lot of fun sitting within biotech that they need to spend on later stage development eric coldwell robert w baird co analyst yes colin that s really helpful just one quick one that came to mind i did hear recently that maybe there was a little bit of softness in asia pac specifically china due to some of the deal well let s say between our two governments are you seeing any change in growth in asia pac any change in client interest in china in particular and if so how is that impacting you how are you responding colin shannon president chief executive officer and director we ve always mentioned that as one of the areas that we feel like we have been a little bit behind in our growth levels there so it s really not impacting us because we are still growing and we still have a lot of vacancies so we kind of a little bit sheltered from that at the moment because we have been we are still building our infrastructure we have really solid operations guy we have got good leadership there and we re growing it very nicely we chose to continue the organic growth and so far we are still continuing to hire quite rapidly and that will that area eric coldwell robert w baird co analyst that s super helpful thanks so much i ll cede the floor here operator thank you our next question comes from donald hooker with keybanc donald hooker keybanc capital markets analyst great good morning curious with symphony health we ll wait to hear back from you on some of the growth outlook objectives there but are you needing to put more capital into that business to kind of to grow at overseas or add in new solutions how should we think about maybe capital in 2019 colin shannon president chief executive officer and director yeah we certainly are considering now we ve got a couple of initiatives ongoing just now one of them we re looking how to expand within canada the other and some overseas opportunities and we certainly are looking to make sure that we did that in a discipline format but yes we see a lot of opportunities a lot of enhancements and you know we are excited about the growth potential within that area so we continued to evolve and look at that as an opportunity donald hooker keybanc capital markets analyst and then my follow up question similar to that is is it fair to think that there could be maybe some upside in gross margins as you can integrate some of those data assets and tools and as you get more aggressive synergizing that acquisition is how should we think about that impacting gross margins over certainly next 12 or 36 months colin shannon president chief executive officer and director we re kind of sort of guided to where we feel things are going to be we ve typically mentioned some improvement every year and we don t see any dramatic change this year you are absolutely correct that as part of that in the lighting we do see that there is opportunities we re still in the investment phase just now and building out and there s lots of opportunity we want to add and get the growth back and track the way that we d like to see it going so that takes a little bit of investment so at this point we re going to be making sure that while we adding appropriate staffing getting the right ingredients from the country mix and various other things that we re looking at so this year we re really concentrating really on expansion donald hooker keybanc capital markets analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from sandy draper with suntrust alexander draper suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks very much a lot of my questions actually just got asked by four smarter people than i am so my question i guess colin would really be around the hiring and the cost as you said you re putting your foot on the pedal for hiring 300 people a month is a lot are you seeing any wage inflation and when you hire to speed it up does that mean you re going to have to spend more or what do you exactly to hire faster and are there sort of hiring marketing cost that you have to undertake colin shannon president chief executive officer and director we ve actually got a really good machine and it s not just our talent acquisition group it takes the whole organization because a lot of interviews and a lot of time and effort and that s 300 net new employees so it s way over 400 that we re hiring in a month so there s a lot of work to do that and so it s a good question you re asking because when the inflation part is mainly can be geographical it depends on which country you re looking at you might see a little bit of spike in certain areas i think the only area within the u s we saw some problems was highly qualified oncology specialists and we had to actually in january make a decision to use an agency to speed up some of the hirings to augment what we re doing because we were real pinched to get quite a number of well qualified people on board very quickly to meet our client needs so yes so sometimes it can cost a little bit more to bring them on board but overall it s within plan and we have the engine now a lot of it was just getting it going again and getting back into the right cadence alexander draper suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay that s helpful and i guess maybe just a follow up to that when you re in the hiring process and then it is get down into the leads how often are these people sort of playing you versus icon versus iqvia the multiple cros and just trying to pick the highest pay versus maybe different way to think about it how do you sell pra is the place you want to work besides just hey we re going to pay a little bit more money colin shannon president chief executive officer and director well that s a big question if you got a day to spare off you know if you want me to watch a little about pra you probably be long time obviously call it acquisition people are very well up to speed on all the things and differences that we bring to a potential candidate we just focus very much on bring the right people on board people willing to understand that we are very patient focused than driving signs and result was to ensure that the well being of patients is the goal and they ll find a good warm reception within our organization and we obviously at the rate we are growing continually gets opportunities so people can see that as a good place to join because out of expansion has a lot of people to be promoted and continue to grow within the organization so we do have a lot of offerings in some of the regions we are in we are still relatively small in comparison to others which again gives rapid growth and opportunities for these people as well joining us so i think we ve got a really good story and we continue to and focus on innovation and doing things in a different way people are excited with that prospect it helped particularly where you got more senior people here and don t wanted the same old same old and they see that as an opportunity to help as we define and help transform the industry so that s kind of where we are driving and the type of messaging that we re bringing to the organization alexander draper suntrust robinson humphrey analyst that s really helpful thanks operator thank you our next question comes from jack meehan with barclays mitchell petersen barclays analyst thanks this is actually mitch petersen for jack this morning so maybe one for mike guidance assumes some pretty nice operating leverage in 2019 i was hoping obviously the color has been really helpful on the hirings side but i was hoping we could put some numbers behind that just your expectations between leverage on the gross margin line and the sg a line in 2019 i would imagine just given the commentary it s more going to be on sg a line but i wanted to get your thoughts michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer well there s going to be some gross margin improvement as we have communicated previously we re looking for 50 basis points of overall improvement the majority of that is going to come from gross margin colin s point will start to leverage those people as the revenue ramps toward the back end of the year from an sg a prospective this probably maybe 20 bps or 30 bps coming from that as we continue to leverage our sg a team so we re looking at kind of 50 bps to 60 bps of total mitchell petersen barclays analyst got it and then maybe just as a follow up could you expand on your capital deployment expectations for 2019 and absent any m a should we assume to have repayment or is share repurchase going to be on the table in 2019 michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer we ve obviously we were looking for any interesting opportunities to help augment our data solutions which we alluded to earlier and that is some exciting things out there that we would like to see how that would take us nothing is eminent for sure but we certainly are having that active discussions with some really nice opportunities and absent that we have been paying down debt yes you re correct at some point we ll have to rethink about what should be our rate leverage ratio and s a problem to have and we ll certainly consider that with the board and shift some of these other things we re looking at not be fruitful mitchell petersen barclays analyst great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from erin wright with credit suisse erin wright credit suisse analyst great thanks i m curious to what you re seeing in terms of the mix of business coming in i think you ve commented a little bit on the full service versus asset ffp ph but as it relates to therapeutic class or any abnormally disproportionate demand dynamics around large versus small pharma biotech and an overall success in when we win rates there on thanks michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah there hasn t been that a big shift i think as we talked about kind of concentration from a large pharma versus biotech that revenue coming in is relatively the same and i think colin commented on the mix of nva and that s been consistent quarter over quarter we are seeing from an awards perspective a concentration or around oncology and immunology if you compare 2018 to 2017 so that mix has changed slightly and that also references colin s point earlier about the elongation of some of those studies because of the types that we re getting erin wright credit suisse analyst okay got it and then a random question here but how is the early development business performing what percent of that is your business now as a percentage of revenue thanks michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer it s performed very well in 2018 it s still roughly it s probably less than 10 of our business right now but it has performed very well erin wright credit suisse analyst okay great thanks operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from juan avendano with bank of america merrill lynch juan avendano bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi thank you regarding your gross wins they did decline 6 year over year despite a very strong cro industry backdrop can you tell us what drove the decline was it just prior difficult year comp and then talk to us about your ability to actually book business on an incremental basis from now on michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer well we did have quite large comps as you say and that s a pretty fair point and you know as we re looking into the year there was a number of typical larger clients that we knew that would be have a much stronger 2019 that they were coming to the end of some of the cycles of the current work last year and that we d be doing new updates this year we ve mentioned that we had at one in your prefer our partnership and q2 last year and we had anticipated what is coming in and on that toward the end of the year and that s actually didn t get all finalized until the end of the year but just recently we got our first decent sized work from that new clients so we re starting to see all the things that we put in place starting to come through the inaudible way exactly the timing is going to happen we always hope that when things will take we were very pleased with the way things progressed it gave us time to consolidate things within our organization and what s the cost bringing new systems and tools help with things that we were having to in the back burner while we re focusing on bringing in all the people and training and getting them working on the study so and it helped us really solidify our foundation again and get ready for growth which i feel really good about juan avendano bank of america merrill lynch analyst good thank you appreciate the color the other data point i guess regarding bookings was that of the cancellation rate was the lowest that you ve had over since your ipo at 1 7 that did help the net book to bill and so did you take less proactive write offs on your backlog this quarter or if that was not that and can you maybe talk about the quality of your backlog and what drove the super low cancellation rate this quarter michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer i actually think the low cancellation really drives home the quality of our backlog we have been careful about what we take into backlog and you know anything that has been and looking access there s any risk we ve been plus of the prop measuring that very carefully and watching it very closely so it s nice yes we are more in the pudding side and i m sure you can realize that we could probably at some point have taken in larger amounts of new business but we probably more prudent and we want to build up a sustainable growth business and we want to make sure that what we are reflecting to our investors is things that we feel confident and we could achieve and we don t at this swings and roundabouts where we ve got high gross nva followed by large cancellations juan avendano bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and just one quick one can you reassure us that the net book to bill is not necessarily going to decline throughout 2019 as perhaps you know according to my model unless you do over a 100 million in gross wins and about 750 ph on average on a quarterly basis that net book to bill would be declining michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer well when we did our ipo we modeled that and said these are great really long term view would be some uplift to somewhere between 1 1 and 1 15 which would actually provide very decent growth what we ve been seeing just not as quite exceptional time so no i can t guarantee anything i mean i think that we had a nice position with good offerings that we can continue to win a good opportunities and we set lay our goals that are very strong and we are optimistic that what we are putting together that is going allow us to continue this type of high book to bills and a lot depends on the marketplace and what s going on there but we feel that we ve got good product offering we have got nicely positioned for growth and we ve got a lot of the good dynamics and and we re certainly setting targets are very aggressive juan avendano bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from dan brennan with ubs daniel brennan ubs investment bank analyst great thanks thanks for taking the questions mike so i just wanted to go back if you will back to one of the earlier questions just on our conversion rates throughout the year so colin i just want to make sure i understand is it basically you talked about the aggressive hiring that you had to do and it sounds like kind of maybe being a little bit behind on that now that you re ramping that that effectively is what s going to enable you to kind of see this conversion rate go up having the right people in place at the right kind of at the right time michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer well there s a couple of things there yes that certainly will help you know as we ve been watching the trends evolve part of the issue is that as you know our strategic solutions division we are very prudent on the way we recognize our new business we only take 12 months of any new contract and as that proportion of our revenue is starting to i always think with the other pieces it s more active it s not growing quite as fast as the traditional project work you re getting that 12 month period that s in backlog reducing and therefore causing a market adjacent to the conversion rate coupled with the more complex studies i have to remind that everybody seeing giving work bidding longer term more like more complex oncology trials etcetera so that s having an effect as well and we are being modeling it through and we obviously our conversion rate as a good metric but we are looking at in much more detail by study our planning is all about the resources we need to perform everything and the growth is actually much more predetermined the conversion rates are good proxy for you guys and i mean at time we continue to manage and look at it and it throws and even more issues when we re looking at 606 the issues there because we know that 606 is roughly adding an extra 28 but in q4 only added 27 so we still getting to grips with the true flow of that and how that works and how we can make sure that we get really good at forecasting that i think that what we ve done with our systems and processes has helped us really understand a lot quicker than most but even we still trying fine tuning and understanding the complexity there but overall as we start to see the trends as stabilize at least we ll certainly give an indication at this moment there is still lot of the erratic and looking forward there is no real pattern that we re seeing this is the reason why our conversion is changing and that it s just a mixture of mix both between strategic solutions and product registration and complexity of trials the hiring of people getting in top of things would certainly be helpful as well daniel brennan ubs investment bank analyst great thank you and then maybe just as a follow up just on the i think back there was a question on data solution so we ll wait obviously as the team and yourself come out with more details about the plan but could you at least just maybe speak to the opportunity or how you ve characterized it in the past to incorporate what symphony offers back in your core clinical cro offering is that something that we should be shouldn t be surprised to see a more forceful push in 2019 or is that something you think that evolves over the course of the next couple of years in terms of integrating that data into how you re delivering your cro business thank you colin shannon president chief executive officer and director we absolutely have the data part with our symphony that we utilized within our seattle piece has been fundamental for the last 10 years if you recall part of the reason that we acquired symphony was to secure that data because we became so dependent upon it for our core service delivery it was important that we capture the sources and that we could actually have that data available the nice thing is that by owning symphony we get all that data to use and expand upon and it gets this new looks and new ways of actually and helping our clients regarding the push we also made sure that symphony would be able to stand alone and at least meet all our goals of trying to get double digit growth and we feel that there s a strong potential even organically so adding on any potential future acquisitions that may help support the data from international offerings et cetera we just see some more upside as i ve mentioned a lot of the planning is still got to be put in place but back to our original remit which is what we ve got we see a nice runway of good double digit growth for the next few years there s a lot of work to get that done but we do see opportunities and we do see other new opportunities that we can expand within what of dividends and others which helps us get and going to markets that we ve never really been present before daniel brennan ubs investment bank analyst great thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in the

your time and attention at this early hour this morning i will provide some high level comments related to our operations in the fourth quarter and then varun will dig into the segments the related financial details and then discuss our 2019 guidance before i come back with a few closing remarks taken as a whole we made good progress in the fourth quarter with the various operational initiatives we implemented throughout 2018 we did however experience some challenges in achieving the expectations we set forth in our previous guidance primarily related to our european operations make no mistake these challenges have not changed our focus on the four key things we outlined in our last call our continued pursuit of profitable revenue growth progress on our margin improvement plans excellent cash conversion and the optimization of our capital allocation strategy now on to the quarter as noted on slide 5 revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 3 billion an increase of 22 over the 2 5 billion recorded in the comparable period of 2017 parts and services organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 2 5 net income from continuing operations attributable to lkq stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 40 million a decrease of 68 year over year diluted earnings per share attributable to lkq stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0 13 a share as compared to 0 41 for the same period of 2017 a decrease of 68 the fourth quarter 2018 results include noncash impairment charges net of tax of 48 million related to the company s equity investment in mekonomen and 26 million related to goodwill recorded on our 2017 acquisition of an aviation parts recycler these impairment charges reduced diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 by 0 23 varun will address both these items in his commentary on an adjusted basis net income from continuing operations attributable to lkq stockholders was 151 million an increase of 19 7 as compared to the 126 million for the same period of last year as noted on slide 6 adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to lkq stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0 48 an increase of 17 1 as compared to the 0 41 per the same period of 2017 with respect to capital allocation during the fourth quarter of 2018 the company repurchased approximately 2 3 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of 26 41 reflecting a 60 million return of capital to our shareholders as stated during our last earnings call our strong capital position and healthy cash flow affords us the opportunity to continue investing in our strategic growth drivers while simultaneously utilizing a share repurchase program to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy let s turn to the quarterly segment highlights as you will note from slide 7 organic revenue growth for parts and services in our north american segment was 3 7 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the top fourth quarter of 2017 excluding the impact of the battery contract with fca which just started on january 1 2018 organic growth for the rest of the north american segment was 2 4 still we continue to perform well in north america especially when you consider that according to ccc collision and liability related auto claims were down 0 9 in the fourth quarter and up only 0 1 for the full year 2018 we believe this outperformance in our growth relative to the ccc data is due to the continued increase in the number of vehicles in our collision sweet spot that being model years three to 10 years old and an 18 increase in the number of alternative parts utilized on a per claim basis over the past five years also according to the u s department of transportation our performance in q4 was achieved while miles driven in the united states were down 0 5 from october and up just 0 3 on a nationwide basis in november during q4 the salvage line of business launched the implementation of a software platform that uses predictive analytics and multiple data input feeds to refine the analysis in calculating the most accurate part prices which in turn will be used to determine the value of total lost vehicles to lkq and provide more accurate pricing determination at the auctions we believe the early stages of this price optimization effort played a key role in the organic growth for recycled parts outpacing that of aftermarket parts in the fourth quarter and for the first time in 2018 related to our recycling business i am proud of our north american team s environmental efforts in 2018 between our full service salvage and self service businesses in 2018 we processed over 872 000 vehicles resulting in among other things the recycling of 1 4 million catalytic converters 2 2 million tires 560 000 batteries 2 4 million gallons of waste oil and over four million gallons of fuel this effort is a key pillar in our mission of being a responsible steward of the environment and a true partner with the communities in which we operate we also continued to grow our parts offerings with aftermarket collision sku offerings and the total number of certified parts available each growing 5 2 and 11 5 respectively in 2018 our north american team continued to make solid progress with respect to the margin recovery efforts despite facing ongoing cost pressures primarily from wage fuel and freight inflation these efforts include being disciplined in terms of pricing and discounts and realizing continued improvements with our telematics and roadnet platforms during the fourth quarter 96 of the 326 000 manifests in north america were created through roadnet with better routing and efficient trucks fuel consumption and miles driven were reduced by 1 7 moving to the other side of the atlantic our european segment achieved total parts and services revenue growth of 47 primarily driven by the acquisition of stahlgruber organic revenue growth for parts and services was 0 3 reflecting a pullback from q3 levels and well below our expectations the european demand was soft across many of our key markets including the u k benelux and italy during the fourth quarter and full year our rhiag business witnessed negative growth in italy in q4 2018 the italian economy shrank by 0 2 following a 0 1 decline in q3 with that italy s economy officially tripped into recession and the economic contraction is expected to continue for some time which could create a difficult market for our operations as well euro car parts posted organic growth in q4 and full year 2018 but the quarterly results were well below our expectations the u k continues to struggle with the brexit negotiations and the economic uncertainty appeared to have a negative impact on overall demand with most market participants reporting low single digit organic growth stahlgruber performed in line with expectations but we are closely monitoring the economic conditions in germany which has shown signs of a slowdown when looking at europe as a whole the soft economic outlook has shaped our expectations for our 2019 organic revenue guidance regarding brexit the whole world was waiting to see what comes of the ever changing discussions both within the u k and between the u k and the eu a couple of key risks evolve around the fact that most of what is consumed in the u k including automotive parts originates outside of the u k indeed a majority of the inventory purchased by ecp and andrew page comes from eu countries accordingly a further beginning of the sterling relative to other currencies could inflate the cost of procurement and any trade disruptions in terms of getting inventory into the country could create issues in servicing customer demand with respect to the currencies we do hedge a portion of our expected inventory purchases a few months forward using fx contracts on the product front all of our u k based businesses have been working to ensure we have a minimum number of months coverage on all types of inventory including fast movers mid movers and even certain slow moving skus this is about the variety of activities including placing advanced orders increasing stock holdings at ecp facilities and working with key suppliers to have them create buffer stock at their facilities within the u k prior to the end of march the interest of ecp and our suppliers are directly aligned and we have a been working proactively with these partners several of which have extended payable terms to offset the cash impact of building inventories while there are many unknowns related to how brexit will impact the u k and europe we believe we have the broadest and deepest inventory in the market and are confident that we will be able to meet our customers needs while we are also actively addressing the company specific operating challenges we ve experienced to assure we can continue to maintain our market leading positions and capture the opportunities that we believe our long term european strategy presents for our company and our stockholders some of the changes relate to new productivity programs while others involve changes in leadership i will cover a few of our key initiatives in my closing remarks as i mentioned in our may 2018 investor day talent acquisition is a key initiative for our european segment and in q4 we made solid progress on this front on december 20 the company announced that arnd franz will join lkq europe as chief operating officer on april 1 arnd is currently corporate executive vice president and member of the management board of the mahle group where he has been responsible for the company s global automotive sales and application engineering including their aftermarket business unit from 2006 to 2013 he was executive vice president and general manager for mahle aftermarket arnd will report directly to john quinn ceo of lkq europe arnd brings nearly 20 years of experience with tier 1 automotive suppliers across europe and has a strong record of successful integration efforts he will be a great addition to the lkq europe leadership team specific to euro car parts on january 2 of this year the company announced that andy hamilton was appointed ecp s chief executive officer andy joined ecp in 2010 where he held several executive roles the last of which was chief operating officer during that period ecp saw unprecedented growth as the network grew from 89 to over 220 branches prior to ecp andy held a variety of management roles for halfords group the u k s leading automotive and leisure retailer with over 500 locations additionally at ecp we recently added two key people to the leadership team including a chief administrative officer and a chief supply chain officer the chief administrative officer and varun actually worked together during their respective times at both cbre and johnson controls the primary task for this position is to focus on ecp support and governance functions with overall responsibility for legal finance and human resources thereby quinn and andy to focus on customer facing and operating matters the chief supply chain officer worked at ecp from 2014 to 2016 and we are excited to have him back on the team the main responsibilities for this role are ecp s logistics and supply chain activities including the leadership of the t2 facility finally during q4 we opened up a total of five new branches in eastern europe since acquiring rhiag in 2016 we have opened 94 branches in eastern europe and as we entered 2019 we are now focused on maximizing the productivity of our existing branches with just a handful of new openings planned for this year now let s move on to our specialty segment during organic revenue growth for parts and services of 5 8 and acquisition growth of more than 3 specialty continues to deliver strong results with ebitda margins in the fourth quarter and full year 2018 both achieving their highest levels since we entered this segment in 2014 during the 2018 sema show the specialty team launched a new mobile app that s capable of putting the power of their industry best e keystone business to business system into any device this app harnesses mobile device technology including voice to text capability to allow users to search for products simply by saying a category or brand and utilizes the mobile device camera to scan qr upc and vehicle vin numbers and vin barcodes the e keystone apps includes all the proprietary data in keystone s b2b system thereby providing subscribers access to approximately 800 000 catalogued skus 400 000 images 20 000 videos and 40 000 installation instructions and more we are pleased with the early adoption rates of the app which thus far have generated close to 4 000 downloads from our keystone automotive operations customers this was a tremendous initiative and i credit our specialty team s efforts to think outside the box and deliver solutions that enhance customer service and drive incremental sales moving on to corporate development during the fourth quarter we acquired three wholesale businesses in north america and two wholesale businesses in europe for a total net consideration of approximately 14 million and finally i would like to highlight that our board has approved management suggested changes to the structure of our compensation programs whereby the incentives are directly in line with our companywide objectives for our key leaders across the globe the 2019 annual bonus program will incentivize ebitda both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue as well as improvements in free cash flow generation for the long term cash incentive plan the incentives will be based on return on invested capital organic revenue growth and eps growth over a three year period in addition we are creating a new long term performance share program tied to the achievement of the same target metrics and i will now turn the discussion over to varun who will run you through the details of the segment results and discuss our 2019 guidance varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks nick and good morning to everyone joining us on the call i will take you through our consolidated and segment results for the quarter cover our current liquidity position and provide 2019 guidance before turning it back to nick for closing remarks the fourth quarter results featured several solid accomplishments and some further opportunities for us to realize on the positive side three key points to highlight number one we continued to integrate stahlgruber and i m happy to report that the business is performing in line with expectations and that we are achieving the synergies projected at this stage two our specialty segment which historically had degenerated its lowest segment ebitda margin in the fourth quarter saw an 80 basis point year over year improvement in this metric largely due to effective margin management initiatives and finally three operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was 190 million which in total produced the highest annual operating cash flow in the company s history at 711 million and free cash flow of 461 million i am very proud of the team s dedication to working capital management which i am confident will carry through into 2019 and beyond on the other side of the ledger as nick described we experienced some softness in revenue growth in the quarter in both north america and europe as previously noted the north america segment was able to withstand the revenue softness relatively well while in europe the softness in revenue growth created pressure on a segment ebitda margin i will provide further color on this when we discuss segment performance there is a larger spread between our gaap and adjusted figures this quarter than we are typically accustomed to reporting the variance is attributable to the underperformance of two specific investments which resulted in an impairment charge in the fourth quarter totaling 75 million on an aftertax basis or about 0 23 per share firstly we recorded a 33 million goodwill impairment charge related to our aviation recycling business in north america that we acquired in early 2017 the change in market conditions have dampened our outlook for this business prompting the charge which was recognized as part of our annual test for goodwill impairment and second in the equity earnings line which is where we report our share of the results of mekonomen we recorded a loss of a 46 million in the quarter this loss is attributable to a 48 million noncash impairment charge on our mekonomen investment we recorded a 23 million charge in the third quarter and unfortunately the stock price declined further through december 31 necessitating another writedown since year end mekonomen has announced its fourth quarter and full year 2018 results and revised its dividend policy that has resulted in yet another drop in its stock price unless there is a turnaround in the stock price in the coming weeks we will need to record a further impairment charge in the first quarter we re clearly disappointed in the performance of our investment in mekonomen and are hopeful that the worst is behind us now i ll turn to slides 13 and 14 of the presentation for a few points on the consolidated results the consolidated gross margin percentage increased 30 basis points quarter over quarter to 38 7 as positive improvements in both europe and specialty segments more than offset a negative mix impacting impact related to europe specifically the lower gross margin europe segment now makes up a larger percentage of the consolidated results following the stahlgruber acquisition but again as i mentioned we could more than offset this impact our operating expenses increased by 50 basis points quarter over quarter primarily attributable to the negative leverage effect in europe due to revenue softness that i mentioned earlier interest expense was up 10 million or 37 compared to the fourth quarter of 17 due to higher average debt balances primarily related to the stahlgruber financing moving to income taxes our effective tax rate was 28 3 for the quarter the annual base tax rate was roughly 27 2 which is consistent with our third quarter estimate the higher rate for the fourth quarter reflects a roughly 1 million negative net negative impact from discrete items we completed our analysis of the impact from u s tax reform and i m happy to report that there were no adjustments to the provisional amount in q4 diluted eps from continuing operations attributable to lkq stockholders for the fourth quarter was 0 13 down 0 28 relative to the comparable quarter a year ago adjusted eps was 0 48 reflecting a 17 improvement year over year moving to the segments with north america on slide 17 gross margins during the fourth quarter were 43 5 or flat compared to the prior year our pricing initiatives in the aftermarket line have been successful in realizing gross margin benefits though we experienced an offsetting decrease in our salvage operations as car costs have moved higher with the mix shifting toward newer model year purchases similar to our aftermarket line we are implementing pricing tools for our salvage products to enhance the gross margin generated on each car our self service operations gross margins were roughly flat on a year over year basis with a nonrecurring insurance recovery offsetting the negative impact of declining scrap steel prices shifting to operating expenses for north america we saw an increase of 10 basis points both compared to last year and sequentially there were few factors working in opposite directions this quarter facility expenses increased 50 basis points due to higher rent and utilities expenses and a nonrecurring lease termination charge consistent with the first three quarters we faced headwinds related to freight and vehicle expenses and these costs drove a 30 basis point increase over the prior year we re actively working to address these headwinds as well as wage inflation and rising benefit costs through the margin initiatives noted previously and also through cost controls throughout the organization going the other direction we had a nonrecurring gain on an asset sale in the fourth quarter of 18 that had a favorable 30 basis point impact the remaining 40 basis points improvement primarily related to a reduction in bad debt expense reflecting our strong emphasis on receivable collections and finally we saw a 40 basis point unfavorable movement in segment ebitda related to the noncontrolling interest line while the operating results of our whole of our non wholly owned subsidiaries impact the reported gross margin and operating expense figures the allocation of the profit or loss from these businesses falls below operating profit last year we located a loss from our non wholly owned subsidiaries in north america to the minority shareholders but reported income in these businesses in 2018 thereby creating the unfavorable year over year comparison in total segment ebitda for north america for the fourth quarter of 18 was 153 million roughly flat compared to the prior year looking at slide 19 scrap prices were flat versus the comparable quarter a year ago but down relative to the third quarter of 2018 by 3 as we previously mentioned the impact from scrap reflects the sequential movement in pricing as car costs will generally follow scrap prices higher or lower over time changes in scrap steel prices had a negative effect of approximately 5 million on segment ebitda or a little over 0 01 on adjusted diluted eps the management team remained intently focused on market realization and the cost mitigation initiatives launched last year moving on to our european segment on slide 20 gross margin in europe was 36 7 in the fourth quarter a 100 basis point increase over the comparable period of 2017 our sator business in the benelux region continued to show margin expansion contributing a 30 basis point improvement to the segment with specific strength in private label sales and the ongoing move from a 3 step to a 2 step model in that market our centralized procurement unit a 40 basis point improvement from supplier rebate programs with respect to operating expenses we experienced a 120 basis point increase on a consolidated european basis versus the comparable quarter from a year ago the lower sales growth had a negative impact on operating leverage stahlgruber results as i previously mentioned were consistent with the previously disclosed projection for the year european segment ebitda totaled 107 million a 38 increase over last year as shown on slide 22 relative to the fourth quarter of 17 both the pound sterling and the euro both weakened by 3 against the dollar causing about a 0 01 negative effect from translation on adjusted eps in the quarter segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue was 7 5 for the fourth quarter of 18 down 50 basis points from the same period last year owing to revenue softness and lower than expected results both in the united kingdom and italy the management team has implemented cost controls over all geographies including reviews of discretionary spending and stringent additional approvals for headcount the european team has reiterated its commitment to the previously stated objective to deliver double digit segment ebitda margins by the end of the three year period that started in january 2018 turning over to our specialty segment on slide 23 this business continues to deliver solid results the gross margin percentage improved by 230 basis points in the fourth quarter relative to the comparable period of 2017 of this amount 120 basis points related to a nonrecurring amortization impact in 2017 related to one purchase accounting an additional 30 basis points increase is attributable to mix operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in specialty were flat relative to the prior year higher vehicle and fuel expenses and fx losses were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense following on from the previously mentioned focus on collections segment ebitda for specialty was 28 million up 20 from the fourth quarter of 17 and as a percentage of revenue segment ebitda was up 70 basis points to 8 5 let s move on to capital allocation and the balance sheet as presented on slide 25 you will note that our operating cash flows for 2018 were 711 million or up 192 million a 37 increase versus 2017 operating cash flows for the quarter were strong at 190 million following the momentum in the third quarter owing to an emphasis on receivables collections and moderate inventory growth capex for the quarter was 78 million and 250 million for the full year in the fourth quarter we made further paydowns on our credit facility borrowings while repurchasing 60 million of lkq stock under the repurchase program launched late last october for the full year of 2018 we paid out 206 million on our credit facility borrowings all of this was funded by strong operating cash flows trade working capital as defined as receivables and inventory offset by payables as a percentage of revenue improved by 250 basis points reflecting our commitment toward delivering strong cash flow i am very heartened by the scale of improvement we could deliver as this has come ahead of the structural change to the incentive compensation program in 2019 and more broad based working capital efficiency programs moving to slide 27 we amended and extended our credit facility in the fourth quarter the changes increased the capacity of our revolving credit facility to 3 15 billion offset by a lower term loan extended the maturity through to january 2024 simplified the pricing tiers and immediately reduced our borrowing margin by 25 basis points as of the 31st of december we had 332 million of unrestricted cash resulting in net debt of about 4 billion or 2 9x last 12 months ebitda breaking through the less than 3x benchmark that s a crucial threshold as it further lowers the cost of our credit facility borrowings based on the revised pricing tiers as part of the credit facility amend and extend we executed in the fourth quarter on slide 28 we ve added the key metrics that we track though please note that we are excluding the impact of stahlgruber in the calculations to eliminate short term movements caused by large investments we will add stahlgruber into the calculations once we ve annualized the transaction now i d like to detail our annual guidance for 2019 please note that the guidance assumes that scrap prices and fx rates hold at current levels and the annual tax rate is dialed in at 27 additionally the guidance assumes no material disruptions associated with the united kingdom s potential exit from the european union we have set organic parts and services revenue growth at 2 to 4 given our fourth quarter revenue growth the economic uncertainty in europe and our continuing emphasis on profitable revenue growth we are moderating our growth assumption for 2019 diluted eps on a gaap basis is a range of 2 05 to 2 17 while adjusted diluted eps is a range of 2 34 to 2 46 we are projecting solid business growth from our margin improvement efforts and an incremental 0 09 from a full year of stahlgruber on the negative side lower scrap prices and a stronger u s dollar reduced the year over year expectations by 0 07 cash flows from operations reflect a range of 775 million to 850 million we believe our focus on working capital management and increased profitability will drive higher cash flows in 2019 capital spending is set at a range of 250 million to 300 million a modest increase from the current year level though flat to slightly down on a year over year basis when we normalize the expected increase owing to a full year of stahlgruber capex and various european projects most notably the erp implementation taking the lower and the top ends of the both ocf and capex we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of 500 million in 2019 in summary we remain encouraged by the strength of our market leading businesses though acknowledge that we still have further work to do related to fully realizing the benefits of our initiatives to offset the ongoing cost pressures and to continue to improve profitability now i ll turn the call back to nick for his closing remarks nick zarcone president and chief executive officer thank you varun for that financial overview i believe that we are taking the necessary steps to position the company for continued long term success looking back on 2018 we crossed some major milestones that our team of over 50 000 employees across the globe should be proud of including achieving the highest annual top line revenue in the company s history up 22 over 2017 generating the highest annual cash flow figures in the company s history with operating cash flow and free cash flow up 37 and 36 respectively over 2017 levels closing the stahlgruber acquisition the largest acquisition in the company s history completing the largest capital raise in the company s history through notes with 8 and 10 year maturities at attractively low fixed interest rates and amending our credit facility to provide more flexibility and better pricing with that let me summarize a few of the key initiatives for 2019 first we have built strong businesses with leading companies in our core geographies our focus will now shift toward operational excellence through the integration and simplification of our operating model the management team will concentrate on leveraging the strength of their business units for profitable revenue growth margin improvement and cash conversion second all of our businesses will be closely monitoring costs to drive out duplicative expenses tighten controls over discretionary spending and react quicker to changing market conditions third we will invest in our future through long term projects like the erp s implementation in europe a centralized european catalog system and the multiyear development of a new ndc in the netherlands while these projects often don t produce an immediate benefit they are essential for positioning the business for future growth and profitability finally the revamped compensation programs will help ensure the management incentives are in even tighter alignment with the key priorities of the company and the expectations of our stockholders in closing i am proud of how our team of over 50 000 employees performed during 2018 in the midst of various operating challenges in both north america and europe our team never took their eye off the ball and continue to work tirelessly to create and evolve what we all believe is a unique company our extensive distribution networks the breadth and depth of our inventory and our industry leading fulfillment rates position us well to deliver consistent profitable growth and drive higher levels of operating efficiencies across all segments this focus on operational excellence should translate into continued long term value for our shareholders and with that operator we are now ready to open the call for questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of daniel imbro of stephens please go ahead your line is open daniel imbro stephens analyst yes good morning guys thanks for taking my questions nick zarcone president and chief executive officer good morning dan varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning daniel daniel imbro stephens analyst i wanted to start on the european business and kind of the outlook for expenses one to clarify and then a question varun did i hear you right were there any onetime expenses that drove that deleverage or was it just the lower sales growth of the business that drove the year over year decline varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so if you look at the european margins daniel it was specifically the revenue softness which caused a loss of operating leverage out there there weren t any specific onetimers there were some of the smaller ones not that material but that was really associated with some management departures that have been undertaken but other than that nothing that would come to mind beyond that operator your next question comes from the line of stephanie benjamin of suntrust please go ahead your line is open stephanie benjamin suntrust robinson humphrey analyst yes hi thanks for the question good morning my question really just goes with expectations and i know we reiterated the expectations in europe to really see that margin improvement and double digit ebitda growth in reiteration of that i m just wondering as i look to the guidance for 2019 i think expectations are for a softer top line growth to kind of similar to the fourth quarter so i m just kind of wanting to hear the puts and takes for you to for your expectations for margin improvement in europe in 2019 if you don t see kind of that continued operating deleverage we saw in fourth quarter so just kind of wanting to hear the offset there would be great varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer yes absolutely stephanie it s varun laroyia a great question i think if you kind of look back into 2018 with regards to our european segment going back to q1 you ll recall we had some challenges in the u k operations with our tamworth facility coming out of that obviously there was a capitalized cost to recover that central distribution center and then thereon there was also some price discounting that was taking place so that was kind of one piece that we don t really expect to continue into the future as we think about 2019 the other piece is as you think about the broader european landscape italy we know has been soft actually there was a deleverage that ended up taking place out there and then obviously some other elements we got the full year benefit of some of the distribution centers that we had shut down in anticipation of tamworth coming through and the same thing with andrew page also so as you think of some of those kind of puts and takes clearly there are certain elements that impacted our 2018 operational results in the european landscape and as you think about 2019 we do believe that those elements would have stabilized and despite the lower economic activity expected across the european segment we believe that with the active cost containment programs that are in place we do believe that we will get better operating leverage from that segment nick zarcone president and chief executive officer stephanie this is nick as we go through the planning process each year and a very detailed budgeting process clearly the expectations for everyone of our businesses around the globe is not only to generate good organic growth but also to improve their margins and that is true in europe it s true actually in the north american and specialty businesses as well and i think you ll find the underpinning really of the consensus that varun walked through is an assumption and pretty detailed plans by our operating businesses to improve margins across the board with one exception and that s the self serve business here in the united states which has to deal with scrap prices and there s only so much they can do to offset the negative impact from scrap as it relates to operating margins but again there it s important to understand that the expectation internally is that are all our businesses on an annual basis have plans to find positive operating leverage in their business operator your next question comes from the line of bret jordan of jefferies please go ahead your line is open bret jordan jefferies analyst hey good morning guys varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning bret nick zarcone president and chief executive officer good morning bret bret jordan jefferies analyst varun can you give us an update on where we are from a working capital standpoint or your thoughts on leveraging working capital and maybe what you could do with payables in europe or the u s varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer yes absolutely i think if i take your question bret in terms of what s driving or what drove free cash flow higher in 18 and actually what gives us the confidence going into 2019 for the free cash flow guidance two key pieces really to think through one 18 to 19 there clearly is a higher profitability from the 4 profitable revenue the margin realization initiative that we launched last year and also the cost containment programs that are currently in place so that s kind of just a starting point for free cash flow the second point is just active working capital management and if you think about the momentum that we saw in the third quarter which we continued into the fourth quarter really the focus has been on some very simple elements in the balance sheet within our cash flow statement you can actually see this come through the focus with collections in 2017 it was a 56 million outflow and in 2018 it was basically flat so we didn t invest despite the fact the business grew significantly we didn t really invest that much more in receivables because we were actually growing and collecting the cash that was due to us the second point really if you look at inventory inventory did grow also on a year over year basis with the larger scale of business but it was about 77 million lower than what it was in 17 right and then a final piece quite frankly is the opportunity that s still out there for us to go get the single biggest piece which kind of held us back i d say is on a year over year basis there was a 122 million swing on accounts payable it was a significant outflow right and so as you think about each of these key elements and as we work we continue to focus on simplistically there is further opportunity in any case i think the final piece which actually is a wrap up across the entire working capital and free cash flow piece is the incentive compensation plans and these obviously had been aligned with the goals in 2019 we don t specifically call out the weightings of each of those elements but i will share with you it is not a token measure it is a substantial chunk of people s incentive compensation to generate free cash flow operator your next question comes from chris bottiglieri from wolfe research please go ahead your line is open nick zarcone president and chief executive officer good morning chris varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning chris chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst good morning i wanted to ask about so with revenue growth slowing a little bit also recognizing that you re going through a plenty number of projects to fix margins can you help frame for us opex growth next year what s kind of like your run rate assumption for sg a for organic rate of inflation and what s the net impact of cost saving initiatives versus investments to cut costs just how you re thinking about that next year varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so chris it s varun out here with regards to cost containment efforts and also opex a few things to kind of think through firstly here in north america a bunch of our wage inflation or the freight elements essentially get annualized so and again what we have seen i d say for last four to five months has been not a de acceleration or a downward trend but basically being a flattening out of some of those expenses that are kind of coming through so that s point number one and clearly from the second half of the fourth quarter we saw fuel come down also some not enough to offset the various elements given the fact that wage pressures have kind of flown into the freight costs also and as you think about going into 2019 the cost containment efforts specifically with headcount adds were essentially trying to make the business more resilient with the revised projections from a growth perspective which i believe actually very pragmatic and quite frankly the cost structure will follow this level of pragmatism rather than building up a cost infrastructure which was geared for far higher growth level as such right and then finally if you think about it as nick mentioned in his opening comments also the overall expectation for each of our businesses is to secure a positive operating leverage and again with the change in the incentive compensation plans there is margin growth both in absolute dollars but also on a margin percentage that we expect so again there are only so much that one can do in terms of being able to realize that margin benefit but clearly the cost containment and the opex productivity is the key lever in being able to deliver higher year over year margins operator your next question comes from craig kennison from baird your line is open varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning craig nick zarcone president and chief executive officer good morning craig craig kennison baird analyst good morning thanks for taking my question on the new compensation plan what are the thresholds for your key performance indicators that you would need to reach in order to generate the incentive nick zarcone president and chief executive officer yes craig we don t disclose the absolute thresholds but you can be assured that they are tied exactly into the 2019 budget which is tied exactly into the guidance that varun gave just a bit ago operator your next question is from brian butler from stifel your line is open brian butler stifel financial corp analyst good morning thank you for taking my question could you provide a little bit more color maybe on the parts and service business down at the geographic level in europe and u s kind of thoughts on how we should think about growth rates and margins ebitda margins for the for each part of that nick zarcone president and chief executive officer sure we don t officially provide guidance on a segment basis but again 2 to 4 overall i think you could probably assume that north america we think north america on an annual basis will be somewhere in the middle of that range we think europe is going to be toward the lower end and specialty toward the upper end so we re really spread across the three businesses i think it s also important to recognize that this will vary as we roll through the four quarters of the year it s not a nice flat set of growth in q1 and q2 2018 had monster comps that we re working against if you recall that the organic growth in north america in q1 and 2 of 18 was around the 7 range so that is creating a pretty big hurdle if you will there are a couple of things that we anticipate in q1 that will kind of run against organic growth first we annualized the battery contract with fca just to refresh everyone s memory that added about 1 to our organic growth as to what we reported in 2018 so that positive increment will come off the boards if you will it has also become apparent that as fca was ramping their activities with us that there were some kind of onetime benefits if you will that we got in getting the program up and running and that will not return in 2019 we re really at a steady state now with the fca battery shipments and so we re anticipating batteries will actually be down year over year in the first quarter also aerovision clearly not meeting our expectations that s the business where we took the impairment charge here in q4 our expectation is the business is underperforming and it will also be down in the first quarter on a year over year basis from a margin perspective again we re anticipating upticks in margins in each of our businesses with north america being muted a little bit by the significant downdraft on the scrap prices which as noted in the deck is at 0 04 better part of 0 04 a share or so for the year and that will be particularly pronounced kind of in the first quarter assuming scrap prices hang in where they are today operator your next question comes from ryan merkel from william blair your line is open nick zarcone president and chief executive officer good morning ryan varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning ryan ryan merkel william blair analyst good morning everyone so free cash flow conversion guidance in 19 implies a little bit of improvement to about 70 if my math is right and i m wondering what is your long term target and then more importantly how long is it going to take to get there varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer yes ryan so i think as we kind of spoke last may at our investor conference i kind of laid out a chart for our investors and obviously a number of you from a sell side perspective also just in terms of the way the business had been trending and really what i use is i try and keep it as simple as possible and take out all the noise and very specifically focus on three key elements of working capital so receivables plus the inventory offset by accounts payable and there s a slide in the deck that you ll see really which i kind of highlight with regards to where we were in 17 versus the kind of progress we made in 2018 in 2018 the denominator is actually trailing 12 months pro forma revenue which include the full year of the transactions namely stahlgruber so we don t think in reported numbers we actually think in pro forma numbers so if you can kind of work the calc it actually works against us but really that s where the focus has been and quite frankly i think with the incentive compensation piece also being tied into free cash flow generation i am quietly confident that our businesses will continue to deliver again step back and look at the history of the company which has been very growth oriented and at this stage of our maturity as a company north of 12 billion is what we re kind of forecasting for total revenues in 2019 there are elements that it s not growth at all cost as it is management of the piece but there s an embedded culture and as you know cultures take time before they kind of change so again we ve put our guidance which i think is above where the market was expecting us to be but again we have plans in place to be able to go deliver on it i don t want to get ahead of ourselves in terms of what s kind of for 2021 22 i d say it s one step at a time and i m really happy to report two successive quarters of improvement on that side we ve clearly put our money where our mouth is with regards to 2019 also in raising overall free cash flow guidance and one step at a time but i m confident in terms of the plans we ve put in place and as to how those are currently tracking operator your next question comes from daniel imbro from stephens your line is open daniel imbro stephens analyst thanks for letting me hop back on the queue for a follow up guys last quarter varun you updated us on your intention to unlock cash flow to increase factoring in the european business specifically at stahlgruber can you provide some more color on that market or an update and can you remind us on how you guys think about the longer term opportunity from increasing your factoring in that market with regards to the parts and services varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer yes yes so daniel i think that you re kind of referring to the unwind of the factoring program that we had through one of our stahlgruber subsidiaries so it wasn t the case of starting up our factoring program it was actually unwind of a factoring program which would result in those receivables coming back to us so that s what it was we don t really have an active factoring program we don t want to go down that path really where the opportunity is as we ve talked about from a european perspective a number of the same supplier community does provide product into the north american folks out here so again they are well tuned in terms of what the expectations are and we do have a tremendous opportunity from a european perspective to be able to unlock that piece whether it be through a vendor financing program or through an extension of payables the end goal is the same to be able to have our payables essentially match the days inventory on hand to a point right and that s how the conversion would work and then obviously active management on our dso with regards to receivables so you are right about the fact that there is an opportunity for our european business and again it has been contemplated in the plans we ve put together with that business and it also reflects the targets that they are being tasked with for 2019 but again just to confirm there was no start up of a factoring program it was actually unwind of a factoring program for one of the stahlgruber subsidiaries in the fourth quarter operator your next question comes from the line of chris bottiglieri from wolfe your line is open chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst thanks for taking the second question just a question on north america so i know you guys are getting a lot tougher on discounting and trying to contain pricing wanted to see how you re thinking about the caliber abra merger how do you guys manage through that and then kind of to what extent you ve articulated something in your guidance from this will be helpful nick zarcone president and chief executive officer great question obviously both caliber and abra are excellent organizations they ve been incredibly good customers of ours for years and years no surprise that they re a couple of our largest customers just due to the total number of shops that they operate on a combined basis they re going to be at about 1 050 shops across the country if you will and they ve got hosted finance to grow that to north of 1 500 shops i think over the next three years or so we ve got a great relationship with both organizations and we look forward to being a great partner with them as they continue to move forward in their business plans again we believe that we provide an excellent level of service to these organizations that s why they are big customers of ours we can get them the parts they need when they need them there s no doubt about it they already get our largest discounts if you will because they re already among our top three or four customers so we don t anticipate any major changes there to the extent that they have market overlap because you ve got to remember this is very much a local business and what happens to go on say in dallas doesn t have anything to do what goes on now say up in boston or in portland oregon right it s a local business and to the extent in any given market local market they have overlap where we can find ways to be more efficient in servicing the combined organization we re actually going to have discussions with them to see how we can make their business better and our business better so again it s we have tremendous relationships at the very senior levels of both organizations we re not anticipating any major shifts in our business as a result of the merger operator i now turn the call back over to nick zarcone nick zarcone president and chief executive officer so that completes our 2018 full year earnings call we absolutely appreciate the time and attention you ve given us here this morning we look forward to chatting with everyone in about 60 days at the end of april when we announce our first quarter results so again we think we ended the year strong some real progress on a couple of key factors particularly the working capital and the cash flow which as varun indicated will carry us into the future and we re look forward to chatting with you again in 60 days thank you operator duration 67 minutes call participants joe boutross investor

hour this morning i will provide some high level comments related to our operations in the fourth quarter and then varun will dig into the segments the related financial details and then discuss our 2019 guidance before i come back with a few closing remarks taken as a whole we made good progress in the fourth quarter with the various operational initiatives we implemented throughout 2018 we did however experience some challenges in achieving the expectations we set forth in our previous guidance primarily related to our european operations make no mistake these challenges have not changed our focus on the four key things we outlined in our last call our continued pursuit of profitable revenue growth progress on our margin improvement plans excellent cash conversion and the optimization of our capital allocation strategy now on to the quarter as noted on slide 5 revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 3 billion an increase of 22 over the 2 5 billion recorded in the comparable period of 2017 parts and services organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 2 5 net income from continuing operations attributable to lkq stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 40 million a decrease of 68 year over year diluted earnings per share attributable to lkq stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0 13 a share as compared to 0 41 for the same period of 2017 a decrease of 68 the fourth quarter 2018 results include noncash impairment charges net of tax of 48 million related to the company s equity investment in mekonomen and 26 million related to goodwill recorded on our 2017 acquisition of an aviation parts recycler advertisement advertisement these impairment charges reduced diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 by 0 23 varun will address both these items in his commentary on an adjusted basis net income from continuing operations attributable to lkq stockholders was 151 million an increase of 19 7 as compared to the 126 million for the same period of last year as noted on slide 6 adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to lkq stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0 48 an increase of 17 1 as compared to the 0 41 per the same period of 2017 with respect to capital allocation during the fourth quarter of 2018 the company repurchased approximately 2 3 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of 26 41 reflecting a 60 million return of capital to our shareholders as stated during our last earnings call our strong capital position and healthy cash flow affords us the opportunity to continue investing in our strategic growth drivers while simultaneously utilizing a share repurchase program to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy let s turn to the quarterly segment highlights as you will note from slide 7 organic revenue growth for parts and services in our north american segment was 3 7 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the top fourth quarter of 2017 excluding the impact of the battery contract with fca which just started on january 1 2018 organic growth for the rest of the north american segment was 2 4 still we continue to perform well in north america especially when you consider that according to ccc collision and liability related auto claims were down 0 9 in the fourth quarter and up only 0 1 for the full year 2018 we believe this outperformance in our growth relative to the ccc data is due to the continued increase in the number of vehicles in our collision sweet spot that being model years three to 10 years old and an 18 increase in the number of alternative parts utilized on a per claim basis over the past five years also according to the u s department of transportation our performance in q4 was achieved while miles driven in the united states were down 0 5 from october and up just 0 3 on a nationwide basis in november during q4 the salvage line of business launched the implementation of a software platform that uses predictive analytics and multiple data input feeds to refine the analysis in calculating the most accurate part prices which in turn will be used to determine the value of total lost vehicles to lkq and provide more accurate pricing determination at the auctions we believe the early stages of this price optimization effort played a key role in the organic growth for recycled parts outpacing that of aftermarket parts in the fourth quarter and for the first time in 2018 related to our recycling business i am proud of our north american team s environmental efforts in 2018 advertisement advertisement between our full service salvage and self service businesses in 2018 we processed over 872 000 vehicles resulting in among other things the recycling of 1 4 million catalytic converters 2 2 million tires 560 000 batteries 2 4 million gallons of waste oil and over four million gallons of fuel this effort is a key pillar in our mission of being a responsible steward of the environment and a true partner with the communities in which we operate we also continued to grow our parts offerings with aftermarket collision sku offerings and the total number of certified parts available each growing 5 2 and 11 5 respectively in 2018 our north american team continued to make solid progress with respect to the margin recovery efforts despite facing ongoing cost pressures primarily from wage fuel and freight inflation these efforts include being disciplined in terms of pricing and discounts and realizing continued improvements with our telematics and roadnet platforms during the fourth quarter 96 of the 326 000 manifests in north america were created through roadnet with better routing and efficient trucks fuel consumption and miles driven were reduced by 1 7 moving to the other side of the atlantic our european segment achieved total parts and services revenue growth of 47 primarily driven by the acquisition of stahlgruber organic revenue growth for parts and services was 0 3 reflecting a pullback from q3 levels and well below our expectations the european demand was soft across many of our key markets including the u k benelux and italy during the fourth quarter and full year our rhiag business witnessed negative growth in italy in q4 2018 the italian economy shrank by 0 2 following a 0 1 decline in q3 with that italy s economy officially tripped into recession and the economic contraction is expected to continue for some time which could create a difficult market for our operations as well euro car parts posted organic growth in q4 and full year 2018 but the quarterly results were well below our expectations the u k continues to struggle with the brexit negotiations and the economic uncertainty appeared to have a negative impact on overall demand with most market participants reporting low single digit organic growth advertisement advertisement stahlgruber performed in line with expectations but we are closely monitoring the economic conditions in germany which has shown signs of a slowdown when looking at europe as a whole the soft economic outlook has shaped our expectations for our 2019 organic revenue guidance regarding brexit the whole world was waiting to see what comes of the ever changing discussions both within the u k and between the u k and the eu a couple of key risks evolve around the fact that most of what is consumed in the u k including automotive parts originates outside of the u k indeed a majority of the inventory purchased by ecp and andrew page comes from eu countries accordingly a further beginning of the sterling relative to other currencies could inflate the cost of procurement and any trade disruptions in terms of getting inventory into the country could create issues in servicing customer demand with respect to the currencies we do hedge a portion of our expected inventory purchases a few months forward using fx contracts on the product front all of our u k based businesses have been working to ensure we have a minimum number of months coverage on all types of inventory including fast movers mid movers and even certain slow moving skus this is about the variety of activities including placing advanced orders increasing stock holdings at ecp facilities and working with key suppliers to have them create buffer stock at their facilities within the u k prior to the end of march the interest of ecp and our suppliers are directly aligned and we have a been working proactively with these partners several of which have extended payable terms to offset the cash impact of building inventories while there are many unknowns related to how brexit will impact the u k and europe we believe we have the broadest and deepest inventory in the market and are confident that we will be able to meet our customers needs advertisement advertisement while we are also actively addressing the company specific operating challenges we ve experienced to assure we can continue to maintain our market leading positions and capture the opportunities that we believe our long term european strategy presents for our company and our stockholders some of the changes relate to new productivity programs while others involve changes in leadership i will cover a few of our key initiatives in my closing remarks as i mentioned in our may 2018 investor day talent acquisition is a key initiative for our european segment and in q4 we made solid progress on this front on december 20 the company announced that arnd franz will join lkq europe as chief operating officer on april 1 arnd is currently corporate executive vice president and member of the management board of the mahle group where he has been responsible for the company s global automotive sales

responsibilities for this role are ecp s logistics and supply chain activities including the leadership of the t2 facility finally during q4 we opened up a total of five new branches in eastern europe since acquiring rhiag in 2016 we have opened 94 branches in eastern europe and as we entered 2019 we are now focused on maximizing the productivity of our existing branches with just a handful of new openings planned for this year now let s move on to our specialty segment during organic revenue growth for parts and services of 5 8 and acquisition growth of more than 3 specialty continues to deliver strong results with ebitda margins in the fourth quarter and full year 2018 both achieving their highest levels since we entered this segment in 2014 during the 2018 sema show the specialty team launched a new mobile app that s capable of putting the power of their industry best e keystone business to business system into any device this app harnesses mobile device technology including voice to text capability to allow users to search for products simply by saying a category or brand and utilizes the mobile device camera to scan qr upc and vehicle vin numbers and vin barcodes the e keystone apps includes all the proprietary data in keystone s b2b system thereby providing subscribers access to approximately 800 000 catalogued skus 400 000 images 20 000 videos and 40 000 installation instructions and more we are pleased with the early adoption rates of the app which thus far have generated close to 4 000 downloads from our keystone automotive operations customers this was a tremendous initiative and i credit our specialty team s efforts to think outside the box and deliver solutions that enhance customer service and drive incremental sales moving on to corporate development during the fourth quarter we acquired three wholesale businesses in north america and two wholesale businesses in europe for a total net consideration of approximately 14 million and finally i would like to highlight that our board has approved management suggested changes to the structure of our compensation programs whereby the incentives are directly in line with our companywide objectives advertisement advertisement for our key leaders across the globe the 2019 annual bonus program will incentivize ebitda both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue as well as improvements in free cash flow generation for the long term cash incentive plan the incentives will be based on return on invested capital organic revenue growth and eps growth over a three year period in addition we are creating a new long term performance share program tied to the achievement of the same target metrics and i will now turn the discussion over to varun who will run you through the details of the segment results and discuss our 2019 guidance varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks nick and good morning to everyone joining us on the call i will take you through our consolidated and segment results for the quarter cover our current liquidity position and provide 2019 guidance before turning it back to nick for closing remarks the fourth quarter results featured several solid accomplishments and some further opportunities for us to realize on the positive side three key points to highlight number one we continued to integrate stahlgruber and i m happy to report that the business is performing in line with expectations and that we are achieving the synergies projected at this stage two our specialty segment which historically had degenerated its lowest segment ebitda margin in the fourth quarter saw an 80 basis point year over year improvement in this metric largely due to effective margin management initiatives and finally three operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was 190 million which in total produced the highest annual operating cash flow in the company s history at 711 million and free cash flow of 461 million i am very proud of the team s dedication to working capital management which i am confident will carry through into 2019 and beyond on the other side of the ledger as nick described we experienced some softness in revenue growth in the quarter in both north america and europe as previously noted the north america segment was able to withstand the revenue softness relatively well while in europe the softness in revenue growth created pressure on a segment ebitda margin i will provide further color on this when we discuss segment performance there is a larger spread between our gaap and adjusted figures this quarter than we are typically accustomed to reporting the variance is attributable to the underperformance of two specific investments which resulted in an impairment charge in the fourth quarter totaling 75 million on an aftertax basis or about 0 23 per share firstly we recorded a 33 million goodwill impairment charge related to our aviation recycling business in north america that we acquired in early 2017 the change in market conditions have dampened our outlook for this business prompting the charge which was recognized as part of our annual test for goodwill impairment and second in the equity earnings line which is where we report our share of the results of mekonomen we recorded a loss of a 46 million in the quarter this loss is attributable to a 48 million noncash impairment charge on our mekonomen investment we recorded a 23 million charge in the third quarter and unfortunately the stock price declined further through december 31 necessitating another writedown since year end mekonomen has announced its fourth quarter and full year 2018 results and revised its dividend policy that has resulted in yet another drop in its stock price unless there is a turnaround in the stock price in the coming weeks we will need to record a further impairment charge in the first quarter we re clearly disappointed in the performance of our investment in mekonomen and are hopeful that the worst is behind us now i ll turn to slides 13 and 14 of the presentation for a few points on the consolidated results the consolidated gross margin percentage increased 30 basis points quarter over quarter to 38 7 as positive improvements in both europe and specialty segments more than offset a negative mix impacting impact related to europe specifically the lower gross margin europe segment now makes up a larger percentage of the consolidated results following the stahlgruber acquisition but again as i mentioned we could more than offset this impact our operating expenses increased by 50 basis points quarter over quarter primarily attributable to the negative leverage effect in europe due to revenue softness that i mentioned earlier interest expense was up 10 million or 37 compared to the fourth quarter of 17 due to higher average debt balances primarily related to the stahlgruber financing moving to income taxes our effective tax rate was 28 3 for the quarter the annual base tax rate was roughly 27 2 which is consistent with our third quarter estimate the higher rate for the fourth quarter reflects a roughly 1 million negative net negative impact from discrete items we completed our analysis of the impact from u s tax reform and i m happy to report that there were no adjustments to the provisional amount in q4 diluted eps from continuing operations attributable to lkq stockholders for the fourth quarter was 0 13 down 0 28 relative to the comparable quarter a year ago adjusted eps was 0 48 reflecting a 17 improvement year over year moving to the segments with north america on slide 17 gross margins during the fourth quarter were 43 5 or flat compared to the prior year our pricing initiatives in the aftermarket line have been successful in realizing gross margin benefits though we experienced an offsetting decrease in our salvage operations as car costs have moved higher with the mix shifting toward newer model year purchases similar to our aftermarket line we are implementing pricing tools for our salvage products to enhance the gross margin generated on each car our self service operations gross margins were roughly flat on a year over year basis with a nonrecurring insurance recovery offsetting the negative impact of declining scrap steel prices shifting to operating expenses for north america we saw an increase of 10 basis points both compared to last year and sequentially there were few factors working in opposite directions this quarter facility expenses increased 50 basis points due to higher rent and utilities expenses and a nonrecurring lease termination charge consistent with the first three quarters we faced headwinds related to freight and vehicle expenses and these costs drove a 30 basis point increase over the prior year we re actively working to address these headwinds as well as wage inflation and rising benefit costs through the margin initiatives noted previously and also through cost controls throughout the organization going the other direction we had a nonrecurring gain on an asset sale in the fourth quarter of 18 that had a favorable 30 basis point impact the remaining 40 basis points improvement primarily related to a reduction in bad debt expense reflecting our strong emphasis on receivable collections and finally we saw a 40 basis point unfavorable movement in segment ebitda related to the noncontrolling interest line while the operating results of our whole of our non wholly owned subsidiaries impact the reported gross margin and operating expense figures the allocation of the profit or loss from these businesses falls below operating profit last year we located a loss from our non wholly owned subsidiaries in north america to the minority shareholders but reported income in these businesses in 2018 thereby creating the unfavorable year over year comparison in total segment ebitda for north america for the fourth quarter of 18 was 153 million roughly flat compared to the prior year looking at slide 19 scrap prices were flat versus the comparable quarter a year ago but down relative to the third quarter of 2018 by 3 as we previously mentioned the impact from scrap reflects the sequential movement in pricing as car costs will generally follow scrap prices higher or lower over time changes in scrap steel prices had a negative effect of approximately 5 million on segment ebitda or a little over 0 01 on adjusted diluted eps the management team remained intently focused on market realization and the cost mitigation initiatives launched last year moving on to our european segment on slide 20 gross margin in europe was 36 7 in the fourth quarter a 100 basis point increase over the comparable period of 2017 our sator business in the benelux region continued to show margin expansion contributing a 30 basis point improvement to the segment with specific strength in private label sales and the ongoing move from a 3 step to a 2 step model in that market our centralized procurement unit a 40 basis point improvement from supplier rebate programs with respect to operating expenses we experienced a 120 basis point increase on a consolidated european basis versus the comparable quarter from a year ago the lower sales growth had a negative impact on operating leverage stahlgruber results as i previously mentioned were consistent with the previously disclosed projection for the year european segment ebitda totaled 107 million a 38 increase over last year as shown on slide 22 relative to the fourth quarter of 17 both the pound sterling and the euro both weakened by 3 against the dollar causing about a 0 01 negative effect from translation on adjusted eps in the quarter segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue was 7 5 for the fourth quarter of 18 down 50 basis points from the same period last year owing to revenue softness and lower than expected results both in the united kingdom and italy the management team has implemented cost controls over all geographies including reviews of discretionary spending and stringent additional approvals for headcount the european team has reiterated its commitment to the previously stated objective to deliver double digit segment ebitda margins by the end of the three year period that started in january 2018 turning over to our specialty segment on slide 23 this business continues to deliver solid results the gross margin percentage improved by 230 basis points in the fourth quarter relative to the comparable period of 2017 of this amount 120 basis points related to a nonrecurring amortization impact in 2017 related to one purchase accounting an additional 30 basis points increase is attributable to mix operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in specialty were flat relative to the prior year higher vehicle and fuel expenses and fx losses were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense following on from the previously mentioned focus on collections segment ebitda for specialty was 28 million up 20 from the fourth quarter of 17 and as a percentage of revenue segment ebitda was up 70 basis points to 8 5 let s move on to capital allocation and the balance sheet as presented on slide 25 you will note that our operating cash flows for 2018 were 711 million or up 192 million a 37 increase versus 2017 operating cash flows for the quarter were strong at 190 million following the momentum in the third quarter owing to an emphasis on receivables collections and moderate inventory growth capex for the quarter was 78 million and 250 million for the full year in the fourth quarter we made further paydowns on our credit facility borrowings while repurchasing 60 million of lkq stock under the repurchase program launched late last october for the full year of 2018 we paid out 206 million on our credit facility borrowings all of this was funded by strong operating cash flows trade working capital as defined as receivables and inventory offset by payables as a percentage of revenue improved by 250 basis points reflecting our commitment toward delivering strong cash flow i am very heartened by the scale of improvement we could deliver as this has come ahead of the structural change to the incentive compensation program in 2019 and more broad based working capital efficiency programs moving to slide 27 we amended and extended our credit facility in the fourth quarter the changes increased the capacity of our revolving credit facility to 3 15 billion offset by a lower term loan extended the maturity through to january 2024 simplified the pricing tiers and immediately reduced our borrowing margin by 25 basis points as of the 31st of december we had 332 million of unrestricted cash resulting in net debt of about 4 billion or 2 9x last 12 months ebitda breaking through the less than 3x benchmark that s a crucial threshold as it further lowers the cost of our credit facility borrowings based on the revised pricing tiers as part of the credit facility amend and extend we executed in the fourth quarter on slide 28 we ve added the key metrics that we track though please note that we are excluding the impact of stahlgruber in the calculations to eliminate short term movements caused by large investments we will add stahlgruber into the calculations once we ve annualized the transaction now i d like to detail our annual guidance for 2019 please note that the guidance assumes that scrap prices and fx rates hold at current levels and the annual tax rate is dialed in at 27 additionally the guidance assumes no material disruptions associated with the united kingdom s potential exit from the european union we have set organic parts and services revenue growth at 2 to 4 given our fourth quarter revenue growth the economic uncertainty in europe and our continuing emphasis on profitable revenue growth we are moderating our growth assumption for 2019 diluted eps on a gaap basis is a range of 2 05 to 2 17 while adjusted diluted eps is a range of 2 34 to 2 46 we are projecting solid business growth from our margin improvement efforts and an incremental 0 09 from a full year of stahlgruber on the negative side lower scrap prices and a stronger u s dollar reduced the year over year expectations by 0 07 cash flows from operations reflect a range of 775 million to 850 million we believe our focus on working capital management and increased profitability will drive higher cash flows in 2019 capital spending is set at a range of 250 million to 300 million a modest increase from the current year level though flat to slightly down on a year over year basis when we normalize the expected increase owing to a full year of stahlgruber capex and various european projects most notably the erp implementation taking the lower and the top ends of the both ocf and capex we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of 500 million in 2019 in summary we remain encouraged by the strength of our market leading businesses though acknowledge that we still have further work to do related to fully realizing the benefits of our initiatives to offset the ongoing cost pressures and to continue to improve profitability now i ll turn the call back to nick for his closing remarks nick zarcone president and chief executive officer thank you varun for that financial overview i believe that we are taking the necessary steps to position the company for continued long term success looking back on 2018 we crossed some major milestones that our team of over 50 000 employees across the globe should be proud of including achieving the highest annual top line revenue in the company s history up 22 over 2017 generating the highest annual cash flow figures in the company s history with operating cash flow and free cash flow up 37 and 36 respectively over 2017 levels closing the stahlgruber acquisition the largest acquisition in the company s history completing the largest capital raise in the company s history through notes with 8 and 10 year maturities at attractively low fixed interest rates and amending our credit facility to provide more flexibility and better pricing with that let me summarize a few of the key initiatives for 2019 first we have built strong businesses with leading companies in our core geographies our focus will now shift toward operational excellence through the integration and simplification of our operating model the management team will concentrate on leveraging the strength of their business units for profitable revenue growth margin improvement and cash conversion second all of our businesses will be closely monitoring costs to drive out duplicative expenses tighten controls over discretionary spending and react quicker to changing market conditions third we will invest in our future through long term projects like the erp s implementation in europe a centralized european catalog system and the multiyear development of a new ndc in the netherlands while these projects often don t produce an immediate benefit they are essential for positioning the business for future growth and profitability finally the revamped compensation programs will help ensure the management incentives are in even tighter alignment with the key priorities of the company and the expectations of our stockholders in closing i am proud of how our team of over 50 000 employees performed during 2018 in the midst of various operating challenges in both north america and europe our team never took their eye off the ball and continue to work tirelessly to create and evolve what we all believe is a unique company our extensive distribution networks the breadth and depth of our inventory and our industry leading fulfillment rates position us well to deliver consistent profitable growth and drive higher levels of operating efficiencies across all segments this focus on operational excellence should translate into continued long term value for our shareholders and with that operator we are now ready to open the call for questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of daniel imbro of stephens please go ahead your line is open daniel imbro stephens analyst yes good morning guys thanks for taking my questions nick zarcone president and chief executive officer good morning dan varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning daniel daniel imbro stephens analyst i wanted to start on the european business and kind of the outlook for expenses one to clarify and then a question varun did i hear you right were there any onetime expenses that drove that deleverage or was it just the lower sales growth of the business that drove the year over year decline varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so if you look at the european margins daniel it was specifically the revenue softness which caused a loss of operating leverage out there there weren t any specific onetimers there were some of the smaller ones not that material but that was really associated with some management departures that have been undertaken but other than that nothing that would come to mind beyond that operator your next question comes from the line of stephanie benjamin of suntrust please go ahead your line is open stephanie benjamin suntrust robinson humphrey analyst yes hi thanks for the question good morning my question really just goes with expectations and i know we reiterated the expectations in europe to really see that margin improvement and double digit ebitda growth in reiteration of that i m just wondering as i look to the guidance for 2019 i think expectations are for a softer top line growth to kind of similar to the fourth quarter so i m just kind of wanting to hear the puts and takes for you to for your expectations for margin improvement in europe in 2019 if you don t see kind of that continued operating deleverage we saw in fourth quarter so just kind of wanting to hear the offset there would be great varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer yes absolutely stephanie it s varun laroyia a great question i think if you kind of look back into 2018 with regards to our european segment going back to q1 you ll recall we had some challenges in the u k operations with our tamworth facility coming out of that obviously there was a capitalized cost to recover that central distribution center and then thereon there was also some price discounting that was taking place so that was kind of one piece that we don t really expect to continue into the future as we think about 2019 the other piece is as you think about the broader european landscape italy we know has been soft actually there was a deleverage that ended up taking place out there and then obviously some other elements we got the full year benefit of some of the distribution centers that we had shut down in anticipation of tamworth coming through and the same thing with andrew page also so as you think of some of those kind of puts and takes clearly there are certain elements that impacted our 2018 operational results in the european landscape and as you think about 2019 we do believe that those elements would have stabilized and despite the lower economic activity expected across the european segment we believe that with the active cost containment programs that are in place we do believe that we will get better operating leverage from that segment nick zarcone president and chief executive officer stephanie this is nick as we go through the planning process each year and a very detailed budgeting process clearly the expectations for everyone of our businesses around the globe is not only to generate good organic growth but also to improve their margins and that is true in europe it s true actually in the north american and specialty businesses as well and i think you ll find the underpinning really of the consensus that varun walked through is an assumption and pretty detailed plans by our operating businesses to improve margins across the board with one exception and that s the self serve business here in the united states which has to deal with scrap prices and there s only so much they can do to offset the negative impact from scrap as it relates to operating margins but again there it s important to understand that the expectation internally is that are all our businesses on an annual basis have plans to find positive operating leverage in their business operator your next question comes from the line of bret jordan of jefferies please go ahead your line is open bret jordan jefferies analyst hey good morning guys varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning bret nick zarcone president and chief executive officer good morning bret bret jordan jefferies analyst varun can you give us an update on where we are from a working capital standpoint or your thoughts on leveraging working capital and maybe what you could do with payables in europe or the u s varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer yes absolutely i think if i take your question bret in terms of what s driving or what drove free cash flow higher in 18 and actually what gives us the confidence going into 2019 for the free cash flow guidance two key pieces really to think through one 18 to 19 there clearly is a higher profitability from the 4 profitable revenue the margin realization initiative that we launched last year and also the cost containment programs that are currently in place so that s kind of just a starting point for free cash flow the second point is just active working capital management and if you think about the momentum that we saw in the third quarter which we continued into the fourth quarter really the focus has been on some very simple elements in the balance sheet within our cash flow statement you can actually see this come through the focus with collections in 2017 it was a 56 million outflow and in 2018 it was basically flat so we didn t invest despite the fact the business grew significantly we didn t really invest that much more in receivables because we were actually growing and collecting the cash that was due to us the second point really if you look at inventory inventory did grow also on a year over year basis with the larger scale of business but it was about 77 million lower than what it was in 17 right and then a final piece quite frankly is the opportunity that s still out there for us to go get the single biggest piece which kind of held us back i d say is on a year over year basis there was a 122 million swing on accounts payable it was a significant outflow right and so as you think about each of these key elements and as we work we continue to focus on simplistically there is further opportunity in any case i think the final piece which actually is a wrap up across the entire working capital and free cash flow piece is the incentive compensation plans and these obviously had been aligned with the goals in 2019 we don t specifically call out the weightings of each of those elements but i will share with you it is not a token measure it is a substantial chunk of people s incentive compensation to generate free cash flow operator your next question comes from chris bottiglieri from wolfe research please go ahead your line is open nick zarcone president and chief executive officer good morning chris varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning chris chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst good morning i wanted to ask about so with revenue growth slowing a little bit also recognizing that you re going through a plenty number of projects to fix margins can you help frame for us opex growth next year what s kind of like your run rate assumption for sg a for organic rate of inflation and what s the net impact of cost saving initiatives versus investments to cut costs just how you re thinking about that next year varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so chris it s varun out here with regards to cost containment efforts and also opex a few things to kind of think through firstly here in north america a bunch of our wage inflation or the freight elements essentially get annualized so and again what we have seen i d say for last four to five months has been not a de acceleration or a downward trend but basically being a flattening out of some of those expenses that are kind of coming through so that s point number one and clearly from the second half of the fourth quarter we saw fuel come down also some not enough to offset the various elements given the fact that wage pressures have kind of flown into the freight costs also and as you think about going into 2019 the cost containment efforts specifically with headcount adds were essentially trying to make the business more resilient with the revised projections from a growth perspective which i believe actually very pragmatic and quite frankly the cost structure will follow this level of pragmatism rather than building up a cost infrastructure which was geared for far higher growth level as such right and then finally if you think about it as nick mentioned in his opening comments also the overall expectation for each of our businesses is to secure a positive operating leverage and again with the change in the incentive compensation plans there is margin growth both in absolute dollars but also on a margin percentage that we expect so again there are only so much that one can do in terms of being able to realize that margin benefit but clearly the cost containment and the opex productivity is the key lever in being able to deliver higher year over year margins operator your next question comes from craig kennison from baird your line is open varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning craig nick zarcone president and chief executive officer good morning craig craig kennison baird analyst good morning thanks for taking my question on the new compensation plan what are the thresholds for your key performance indicators that you would need to reach in order to generate the incentive nick zarcone president and chief executive officer yes craig we don t disclose the absolute thresholds but you can be assured that they are tied exactly into the 2019 budget which is tied exactly into the guidance that varun gave just a bit ago operator your next question is from brian butler from stifel your line is open brian butler stifel financial corp analyst good morning thank you for taking my question could you provide a little bit more color maybe on the parts and service business down at the geographic level in europe and u s kind of thoughts on how we should think about growth rates and margins ebitda margins for the for each part of that nick zarcone president and chief executive officer sure we don t officially provide guidance on a segment basis but again 2 to 4 overall i think you could probably assume that north america we think north america on an annual basis will be somewhere in the middle of that range we think europe is going to be toward the lower end and specialty toward the upper end so we re really spread across the three businesses i think it s also important to recognize that this will vary as we roll through the four quarters of the year it s not a nice flat set of growth in q1 and q2 2018 had monster comps that we re working against if you recall that the organic growth in north america in q1 and 2 of 18 was around the 7 range so that is creating a pretty big hurdle if you will there are a couple of things that we anticipate in q1 that will kind of run against organic growth first we annualized the battery contract with fca just to refresh everyone s memory that added about 1 to our organic growth as to what we reported in 2018 so that positive increment will come off the boards if you will it has also become apparent that as fca was ramping their activities with us that there were some kind of onetime benefits if you will that we got in getting the program up and running and that will not return in 2019 we re really at a steady state now with the fca battery shipments and so we re anticipating batteries will actually be down year over year in the first quarter also aerovision clearly not meeting our expectations that s the business where we took the impairment charge here in q4 our expectation is the business is underperforming and it will also be down in the first quarter on a year over year basis from a margin perspective again we re anticipating upticks in margins in each of our businesses with north america being muted a little bit by the significant downdraft on the scrap prices which as noted in the deck is at 0 04 better part of 0 04 a share or so for the year and that will be particularly pronounced kind of in the first quarter assuming scrap prices hang in where they are today operator your next question comes from ryan merkel from william blair your line is open nick zarcone president and chief executive officer good morning ryan varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning ryan ryan merkel william blair analyst good morning everyone so free cash flow conversion guidance in 19 implies a little bit of improvement to about 70 if my math is right and i m wondering what is your long term target and then more importantly how long is it going to take to get there varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer yes ryan so i think as we kind of spoke last may at our investor conference i kind of laid out a chart for our investors and obviously a number of you from a sell side perspective also just in terms of the way the business had been trending and really what i use is i try and keep it as simple as possible and take out all the noise and very specifically focus on three key elements of working capital so receivables plus the inventory offset by accounts payable and there s a slide in the deck that you ll see really which i kind of highlight with regards to where we were in 17 versus the kind of progress we made in 2018 in 2018 the denominator is actually trailing 12 months pro forma revenue which include the full year of the transactions namely stahlgruber so we don t think in reported numbers we actually think in pro forma numbers so if you can kind of work the calc it actually works against us but really that s where the focus has been and quite frankly i think with the incentive compensation piece also being tied into free cash flow generation i am quietly confident that our businesses will continue to deliver again step back and look at the history of the company which has been very growth oriented and at this stage of our maturity as a company north of 12 billion is what we re kind of forecasting for total revenues in 2019 there are elements that it s not growth at all cost as it is management of the piece but there s an embedded culture and as you know cultures take time before they kind of change so again we ve put our guidance which i think is above where the market was expecting us to be but again we have plans in place to be able to go deliver on it i don t want to get ahead of ourselves in terms of what s kind of for 2021 22 i d say it s one step at a time and i m really happy to report two successive quarters of improvement on that side we ve clearly put our money where our mouth is with regards to 2019 also in raising overall free cash flow guidance and one step at a time but i m confident in terms of the plans we ve put in place and as to how those are currently tracking operator your next question comes from daniel imbro from stephens your line is open daniel imbro stephens analyst thanks for letting me hop back on the queue for a follow up guys last quarter varun you updated us on your intention to unlock cash flow to increase factoring in the european business specifically at stahlgruber can you provide some more color on that market or an update and can you remind us on how you guys think about the longer term opportunity from increasing your factoring in that market with regards to the parts and services varun laroyia executive vice president and chief financial officer yes yes so daniel i think that you re kind of referring to the unwind of the factoring program that we had through one of our stahlgruber subsidiaries so it wasn t the case of starting up our factoring program it was actually unwind of a factoring program which would result in those receivables coming back to us so that s what it was we don t really have an active factoring program we don t want to go down that path really where the opportunity is as we ve talked about from a european perspective a number of the same supplier community does provide product into the north american folks out here so again they are well tuned in terms of what the expectations are and we do have a tremendous opportunity from a european perspective to be able to unlock that piece whether it be through a vendor financing program or through an extension of payables the end goal is the same to be able to have our payables essentially match the days inventory on hand to a point right and that s how the conversion would work and then obviously active management on our dso with regards to receivables so you are right about the fact that there is an opportunity for our european business and again it has been contemplated in the plans we ve put together with that business and it also reflects the targets that they are being tasked with for 2019 but again just to confirm there was no start up of a factoring program it was actually unwind of a factoring program for one of the stahlgruber subsidiaries in the fourth quarter operator your next question comes from the line of chris bottiglieri from wolfe your line is open chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst thanks for taking the second question just a question on north america so i know you guys are getting a lot tougher on discounting and trying to contain pricing wanted to see how you re thinking about the caliber abra merger how do you guys manage through that and then kind of to what extent you ve articulated something in your guidance from this will be helpful nick zarcone president and chief executive officer great question obviously both caliber and abra are excellent organizations they ve been incredibly good customers of ours for years and years no surprise that they re a couple of our largest customers just due to the total number of shops that they operate on a combined basis they re going to be at about 1 050 shops across the country if you will and they ve got hosted finance to grow that to north of 1 500 shops i think over the next three years or so we ve got a great relationship with both organizations and we look forward to being a great partner with them as they continue to move forward in their business plans again we believe that we provide an excellent level of service to these organizations that s why they are big customers of ours we can get them the parts they need when they need them there s no doubt about it they already get our largest discounts if you will because they re already among our top three or four customers so we don t anticipate any major changes there to the extent that they have market overlap because you ve got to remember this is very much a local business and what happens to go on say in dallas doesn t have anything to do what goes on now say up in boston or in portland oregon right it s a local business and to the extent in any given market local market they have overlap where we can find ways to be more efficient in servicing the combined organization we re actually going to have discussions with them to see how we can make their business better and our business better so again it s we have tremendous relationships at the very senior levels of both organizations we re not anticipating any major shifts in our business as a result of the merger operator i now turn the call back over to nick zarcone nick zarcone president and chief executive officer so that completes our 2018 full year earnings call we absolutely appreciate the time and attention you ve given us here this morning we look forward to chatting with everyone in about 60 days at the end of april when we announce our first quarter results so again we think we ended the year strong some real progress on a couple of key factors particularly the working capital and the cash flow which as varun indicated will carry us into the future and we re look forward to chatting with you again in 60 days thank you operator duration 67 minutes call participants joe boutross investor

highlights of the two year wisconsin budget proposal released thursday by gov tony evers roads the state s 32 9 cent gas tax would go up 8 cents but the state s minimum mark up law on fuel that results in a roughly 9 percent increase in the price of gas would be eliminated gas taxes would automatically increase with inflation evers said the net effect could be a par gallon decrease of as much as 14 cents heavy truck registration and new car titling fees would increase but the 75 vehicle registration fee most car owners pay would not change borrowing for roads would be the lowest level in 20 years while 320 million in new money would go toward highway repair and expansion lame duck most of the law changes approved by republicans during a december lame duck legislative session that weakened powers of the governor and attorney general would be repealed that includes changes that required legislative approval to withdraw from lawsuits or settle lawsuits the governor s powers to make rule changes and restrictions on his influence over the state s economic development agency undo walker wisconsin s right to work law would be repealed and prevailing wage requirements would be reinstated both changes were fought by unions when enacted under former republican gov scott walker the budget would also undo work and drug testing requirements walker instituted to qualify for food stamps qualify for medicaid and other public aid programs marijuana medical marijuana would be legalized and possessing up to 25 grams of recreational pot would be de criminalized the plan appears to be a non starter among republicans automatic voter registration state elections officials are required to work with the department of transportation to implement automatic voter registration as soon as possible sixteen states have automatic voter registration as people apply for or renew a driver s license they re either automatically registered to vote or asked whether they would be automatically registered k 12 schools funding for k 12 schools would increase by 10 percent or 1 4 billion and the complex state aid formula would be rewritten the state would pay at least two thirds of school costs through aid and a ban on how many times a district could ask voters to exceed local property tax limits would be repealed voucher schools enrollment in voucher schools would be frozen starting in 2021 a move republicans oppose evers would also do away with an income tax deduction for private school tuition which would raise about 12 million a year higher education a tuition freeze at the university of wisconsin would continue for at least two years with overall funding increased by 150 million residents of other countries who have graduated from a wisconsin high school spent at least three years attending a wisconsin high school and are pursuing u s citizenship could pay in state tuition at uw schools and state technical colleges republicans oppose the in state tuition plan a version of which they stripped from state law in 2011 driver s licenses the budget would make people who are living in the country illegally eligible for driver s licenses and identification cards taxes income taxes for the middle class would be cut 10 percent he would also limit a 30 percent capital gains exclusion to single people earning less than 100 000 and couples earning less than 150 000 that would bring in 500 million over two years a new child care tax credit equal to 50 percent of the same federal credit would be created first time homebuyers could subtract up to 5 000 a year 10 000 for married couples in accounts to pay for home purchases that would grow tax free e cigarettes the budget would impose a tax on all e cigarettes and vaping products equal to 71 percent of the product s list price the tax rate mirrors the existing rate on traditional cigarettes and other tobacco products property taxes property taxes would increase on average 50 in each of the next two years on the median valued home that s a 1 7 percent increase the median valued home is 173 646 health care evers would accept federal medicaid expansion a move that would add about 82 000 low income people to medicaid and save the state about 320 million over the next two years thanks to an infusion of federal dollars but republicans have been outspoken against it saying putting more people on medicaid will shift costs to the private sector and ultimately cost the state more in later years corrections the budget doesn t set aside any money for building a new prison to deal with overcrowding but it does call for building an additional barracks at two prisons to house more than 400 inmates the budget also would establish a new pay progression for guards and bump starting pay from about 16 an hour to 18 evers has said he wants to reduce the overall population but the budget doesn t include any early release initiatives that would accomplish that youth prison evers calls for indefinitely delaying closure of the troubled lincoln hills juvenile prison while spending nearly 200 million more on smaller replacement facilities he also called for raising from 17 to 18 the age that offenders are considered adults for most crimes natural resources evers wants to borrow nearly 70 million more over the next two years to combat water pollution and replace lead pipes he also proposed adding five scientists at the state department of natural resources to research water pollution and five positions to regulate factory farms dark stores evers calls for closing the dark stores loophole that allows big box retailers to save millions of dollars in property taxes by assessing the value of their active stores as if they were vacant planned parenthood nearly 28 million would be spent to support women s health care issues including restoring funding available to planned parenthood that was blocked by walker redistricting evers proposed a nonpartisan redistricting process that would take away the legislature s power to draw political boundary maps a move he said would stop partisan gerrymandering republicans support the current process the next round of redistricting will occur after the 2020 census economic development evers campaigned on defunding the state s job creation agency the wisconsin economic development corp but since winning election evers backed off on eliminating wedc and instead will propose tightening restrictions on tax breaks it gives companies minimum wage evers campaigned on raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour his budget would increase the minimum wage by 1 to 8 25 beginning in 2020 and raise it to 9 an hour in 2021 it would then go up 75 cents per year in each of the next two years and then it would go up according to inflation every year after that clean energy the budget calls for eliminating coal from all electricity production in wisconsin by 2050 crime analysts the budget gives attorney general josh kaul money to create 17 more crime lab analyst positions and sets up a pay progression for lab workers the labs have been plagued for years by slow turnaround times for evidence test results state workers state employees would see a 2 percent across the board raise in each year of the budget total budget spending under the 83 4 billion two year budget would increase 5 4 percent the first year and 4 9 percent the second the state s 616 million budget surplus would be just 20 million by mid 2021 under the evers plan
china stocks are selling off in some profit taking on tuesday following monday s mega rally one thing the market seems to be discounting however is the level of stimulus beijing can pull off this time for now part of the euphoria in china s outperforming stock market is due to president trump s extension of the 90 day trade truce that extension comes with a pause in planned tariff increases to 25 on 200 billion worth of chinese imports trump also appeared to soften trade related actions this week by holding off on an executive order that would ban huawei from the u s telecom market he also opted to pause on auto tariffs something the department of commerce recommended this should be viewed as temporary the 60 day reprieve ends in may tariffs are not going away the u s china trade dispute has been a drag on the global economy and world trade for over a year and asian export growth has slumped now a key negative for both the global economy and global markets looks as though it is being removed says neil mackinnon an economist for vtb capital in london jerome powell s senate testimony today also didn t add any stresses to the market at this time though most investors are still digesting what the fed chairman said a pause in the hiking cycle is good for emerging markets china has been a runaway train it is beating the msci emerging markets index it s beating its bric counterparts it s beating the s p 500 and the ftse europe on tuesday northbound connect trade between hong kong and mainland china stock exchanges witnessed another day of high volumes matching monday s levels foreign investors were net buyers monday and tuesday northbound connect volumes were 50 higher than they were during msci s 2018 inclusion trading days msci s decision on their china a shares index comes out thursday all of this has led to this here china is massively overbought the 1 correction in the deutsche x trackers china a shares ashr etf is a drop in the bucket chinese equity market sentiment was in the gutter at the end of 2018 today it has gone from optimism to euphoric investors believe that the trade war will not escalate and if it does then the people s bank of china and other market movers in beijing s government will support the economy any way they can the problem is no one really thinks china will overstimulate its economy in fact the consensus is that beijing has very little runway to stimulate more in the eventual case of an escalation in the trade dispute as the chinese like to call it markets are too optimistic about the speed scale scope and efficiency of beijing s stimulus measures this time and they may be unprepared for a significantly worse growth slowdown in the first half of 2019 says ting lu a top china analyst for nomura securities in hong kong this is especially true of those investors that have recently converted to the belief that beijing has talented technocrats with quick decision making perfect execution and deep pockets and will deliver stable growth whenever the economy is in trouble like those that were overly bearish on china several years ago we would caution those who are overly bullish compared with the last three major stimulus programs room for monetary easing and fiscal stimulus is much smaller due to surging debt at the provincial level that has xi jinping cracking down on shadow banking a smaller current account surplus and falling forex reserves the decision making process is longer now because there is no consensus on direction and strategy within communist party leadership china is a hybrid capitalist communist system they ve hit a crossroads beijing s last stimulus came in 2015 following a steep market decline after msci rejected a shares inclusion in the msci emerging markets index something everyone in china was banking on and changes to the yuan trading band in order to propel china s currency into the imf s special drawing rights currency basket the people s bank of china was unable to prop up the market and likely has little appetite to do as much as they did three years ago nomura s china analysts think the economy will get worse before getting better that s because conventional easing measures may not be able to resolve many of the problems resulting from non market based policy measures and interventions imposed on the economy in the past few years in a report published tuesday morning ting lu and his team said that freeing up the economy via market oriented reforms is still key to growth but more market access for foreigners will take time and things will get worse before beijing strengthens its resolve to free up the economy the report authors wrote moreover beijing s room for stimulating demand appears much more limited the trade war talks have resulted in china agreeing to keep the renminbi stable to stronger rather than let it weaken against the dollar as it should if extra tariffs were ordered it is hard to believe that china will agree to maintain a stronger currency in the event washington hikes tariffs from 10 to 25 china is equally unlikely to introduce new subsidies especially for agriculture after promising to import more u s commodities instead they are likely to ramp up existing subsidies for tech sectors the exact sectors the u s fears will run them out of asia someday xi jinping is not totally sold on subsidies as they tend to lead to overcapacity and oversupply beijing has mentioned several times that it will stimulate the purchase of cars and home appliances this could be a boon for consumers primarily in the discretionary consumer segments blackrock strategist richard turnill says investors will have to pick their spots the trade war is not over and the stimulus packages won t be what the market had before the chinese stock market has rallied sharply this year after finishing 2018 near the bottom he says is there still opportunity left we have a positive view on china s stock market but see rising risks and reason for greater selectivity source forbes

the global savings glut is drying up the long era of seductively abundant capital is drawing to a close to be replaced by a ferocious battle for scarce funding this is going to be painful for those countries with public debt ratios hitting 100 per cent of gdp that rely on constant flows of imported capital even savvy investors like warren buffett say concern over government budget deficits is overblown credit bloomberg japan has been able to defy gravity for two decades with debt ratios rising to 240 per cent of gdp because it is the world s top external creditor commanding us3 trillion 4 2 trillion of net assets america enjoys no such luxury nor does britain in their infinite wisdom america s opinion elites and both political parties have chosen this moment to embrace the beguiling notion that public debt does not matter after all so long as you can print your own currency warren buffett has joined the chorus confessing hard money errors in the past and ridiculing those who regularly preach doom because of government budget deficits

you for joining us today with me this morning are terry ronan our cfo dan rorabaugh our svp of operations joe cofelice our evp commercial development and several other members of the atlantic power management team the numbers for the fourth quarter and full year are provided in the press release the presentation and the prepared remarks which were posted to the website last evening please review those materials instead of reading off those results this morning i would like to talk about the state of the business and a bit of a year end review format following my remarks weâ ll take your questions on people this week we announced that irving gerstein will retire from the board at the conclusion of the annual meeting this june in toronto irving has served atlantic power with professionalism and grace for nearly 15 years i have really enjoyed working with him i will miss his presence on the board we also announced that kevin howell will become chairman assuming he s reelected to the board kevin has extensive power industry experience as an executive board member and board chair kevin shares our passion for a culture of safety frugality and servant leadership in other people news we ve added two new vp commercial development hires bringing that group to four including evp joe cofelice this group has been focused on extending and restructuring our ppas the oefc settlement last year was an idea that originated from this group and it led to a good economic result more recently this group has led the effort on asset m a with the south carolina biomass acquisition and they are continuing to work on other opportunities given our stronger balance sheet we are now a credible buyer of assets into the hundreds of millions of dollars finding adequate returns is the key on the balance sheet as noted in the financial results release we paid 100 million of debt we repaid 100 million of debt in 2018 and plan to pay off another 86 million in 2019 we continue to strengthen the balance sheet to provide downside protection and to enhance our ability to play offence on capital allocation on capital allocation we have slightly more than 190 million of liquidity we have had lots of good uses for excess cash on and off the balance sheet over the past three years we have bought 36 million worth of common shares at an average price of 2 27 a share 23 million of preferred shares at a 38 discount to par and committed nearly 26 million to the koma kulshan in south carolina acquisitions we will continue to rank order the risk reward from the various uses of capital available to us and then try to do the most rational thing in capital allocation we are price to value driven so we don t have any set targets on how much capital to deploy in each bucket on company position we think we re well positioned now for various economic or industry scenarios if we have deflation or a market crash our ppa revenue will allow us to continue paying down debt we would also be able to allocate our capital to assets that would very likely have higher returns than those generally available in today s low rate high asset price market environment it would be wrong to cheer for severe market dislocation but we would be well positioned and driving the work in the mornings with alacrity in that scenario if we get a breakout of inflation at some point then interest rates and discount rates might rise that might lower the value of existing assets however that might be partially offset by higher power prices should they move up along with inflation higher power prices would improve the re contracting outlook in addition over time we will have more generation available to sell out the markets if there is a pickup in prices lastly we have very little interest rate exposure on our debt if we get neither deflation nor inflation but rather a continuation in the current environment we plan to move forward on our path of grinding on cost and debt operating safely and efficiently and looking opportunistically for cigar butt investments turning from the macro environment to the power sector specifically if we continue to see aggressive additions of wind and solar to the grid we are likely to see grid prices rise due to integration costs resulting in higher prices for end use customers and negative implications for electricity demand our belief is that the observers and market participants may be underestimated the integration costs of renewables and the cost of battery storage the retirement of nuclear and coal capacity helps the overall supply and demand picture the lack of strong capacity markets however is not good for natural gas plants at some point however flexible and clean cctt plants might see a pickup in value if intermittent power and battery economics disappoint conversely any carbon regimes would be helpful to the value of our non carbon emitting hydro facilities higher gas prices would likely benefit our hydro facilities as well if we see a move to a more balanced approach our cctts would likely benefit our biomass fleet has an attractive remaining ppa life on average seven years or more than nine years excluding williams lake so theyâ re a good source of cash flow to continue in the present environment with our debt reduction and growth efforts we like our position in the near term having ample ppa coverage and in the longer term being a potential hedge against inflation and was a fairly balanced portfolio of power technologies on growth after years of internal focus we re now in approved position with regard to cost and debt and can look more credibly at asset m a our koma kulshan biomass acquisitions are one result of that positioning we are considering other potential acquisitions of various types we have nothing to report today but our deal flow and acquisition activities are picking up nicely we ve done a good job of restructuring our business there may be opportunities to merge where those skills would be useful in a combined entity we also have a strong operations expertise and that core competency has made it some more confident biomass plants as one example we are small enough that we can look at bilateral deals and not chase auctions we can also look at deals that are too small to move the needle at bigger public companies all in all we are confident but not complacent about our financial operational and strategic positioning in this market and in scenarios where we see dramatic economic market or regulatory breaks in one direction or another we re ready to take questions now operator question and answer session operator our first question comes from nelson ng of rbc capital markets nelson ng my first question relates to m a you mentioned that you re looking more actively at acquisition opportunities and also biomass what is your like what s your sweet spot in terms of acquisition size and what s the range of project size you think you can do jim moore well on the smaller end weâ ve got koma kulshan and south carolina deals and then at the higher end we ve got a couple of hundred million dollars of liquidity and then obviously we can look at financing acquisitions but we re going to be very opportunistic i think one of our competitive advantages is we re small enough that we can be a bit idiosyncratic and be disciplined and just look for the best deals available so whether it s biomass or some other technology whatever the contract length is we can get in here and be pretty nimble and i think we ll get some bilateral deals done over the years but we don t have any set targets that we re looking at nelson nelson ng and in terms of characteristics of your targets is there a minimum contract length youâ re looking at jim moore no no minimum contract length no maximum no specific technology we re just we re deal guys so we re looking for the best deals we can find and internally we always think of our hurdle rate as the press which we bought it 11 and again a little bit more even and that s a cash return so when we look at a 30 year pro forma irr that we consider that to kind of be a hurdle rate we re not very enthusiastic about merchant in this environment i think down the road merchant may actually be a good place to be and gas may end up having some values in areas that have over integrated intermittent power and underestimated the storage costs but we re creating merchant as our ppas run off the gas fleet so we don t really have to go out and buy anybody else s merchant we ve got our own nelson ng okay and then just i guess taking the other side of the argument in terms of potentially buying assets have you considered potentially selling assets especially assets that are such high valuations in this market particularly hydro jim moore yeah we look at those things all the time since i ve been here we ve continually looked at selling individual assets and fleets of assets and doing tax free spin offs and joint ventures and we ve looked at selling the company and merging the company and buying assets and we re just disciplined value investors so we re at the right price everything s for sale and at the right price we re going to be very enthusiastic buyers weâ re just focused on price to value and i think we don t want to be overly tied down to particular themes the old charlie munger says they never did strategic plans because you end up handcuffing yourself and missing opportunities and what he said is their big competitive advantage has been every day they come to work and they rank order the returns available to them and then they try to do the most intelligent thing they can with their capital and that s all we re trying to do we re trying to be as rational as possible for the shareholders nelson ng okay and then just switching gears to williams lake i think in the 2019 bridge you are expecting a reduction in the ebitda of about 11 million so that implies an overall negative 3 million contribution from williams lake i thought the short term ppa is a positive margin contributor so could you just provide a bit more color as to why it would be negative for the year i m just wondering whether post ppa expiration are you expecting just like i guess cost to maintain that asset terry ronan sure nelson it is terry i ll take that one so last year 2018 the ebitda was about 8 million and if you recall the ppa expired at the end of march so we have the higher price ppa in there for three months and the short term extension was modestly positive so as we look at projections for 2019 we still feel that the short term extension is modestly positive it expires in june it could be extended till september or even longer at bc hydroâ s request but right now the reason you see that negative is because we assume on a conservative basis that short term extension ends in june and then we d have shut down expenses including some severance and inventory adjustments that would lead you to that negative 3 million number that you mentioned now we re hopeful that that s not going to happen we ve gotten some positive news on williams lake recently but right now that s what the budget has nelson ng are you able to give any more clarity on the timing like obviously you re in discussions with the government right now i presume and you re hoping to get something finalized sometime this year but are you able to give a bit more clarification in terms of timing joe cofelice this is joe really we can t the report was issued and we expect to engage with bc hydro in the next couple of months and we re pretty confident that that will occur based on the communications that have taken place how long the negotiation will take letâ s see but the bottom line there is that the report by the government is it s good news it s a positive step we ve been struggling over the last couple of years to create a path for the negotiation of a long term extension and discuss that for us but having said that we don t know what terms we are further until we get something done it s not done nelson ng just one last question in terms of the ontario facilities obviously you have a 15 year contract at tunis but you don t have a contract for kapuskasing and north bay is there something that makes the tunis facility more attractive than kapuskasing and north bay in terms of maybe its location like is there a reason why tunis has a 15 year contract whereas i guess itâ s more difficult to get a contract for the other terry ronan when the tunis contract expired we were able to go out and get possibly the last contract that was done before they shut down contracting with ipps in ontario and of course the capital will say contract expired later and when it came time to negotiate those the contracts we no longer are at them so it s about timing operator our next question comes from rupert merer of national bank rupert merer so with your growth in biomass in the southern us wondering if you could talk us through the potential of that market and maybe talk about the availability of fiber and the ability to contract fiber jim moore sure i ll start on the market itself and may ask dan to help on the fiber question if you compare the biomass opportunities to say natural gas opportunities or wind opportunities there s a limited universe of projects available and that universe becomes even more limited when you will find a minimum dda term tool because unlike other assets biomass plants are generally not plants that you want to take into a merchant market you want contract cover on them and so what we do is we basically look at the market we prioritize the targets by ppa cover and in the global market to those people i think that it s right now there are some opportunities out there that we were engaged and discussions with people we will see where those discussions go and basically what we do is we make sure that these parties that own these assets are aware that we re a buyer of these assets and we benefit from the fact that there s a limited number of interested parties generally in these assets when they do become available and we have the ability to move quickly when these companies are seeking quick monetization so that s that then iâ ll just make one point on wood supply i mean when you look at markets like georgia and south carolina it s pretty considerable towards the fiber there i think georgian may be the largest market in the us as a source of fiber so weâ re looking at targets we do spend a lot of time evaluating fiber and that s also important from the standpoint of ppa extensions we have target projects like the locations like williams lake where you have strong community support for the plant because the plant is so important to the local ministry and if youâ ve read any of the recent press in williams lake you ll see how beneficial that can be rupert merer are you seeing any risk from the on the fiber supply from the pellet producers and growing demand for wood pellets that are shipped internationally dan rorabaugh there certainly is competition from them but what they tend not to use is sort of the bulk and the other parts of the elastic variable and what we re finding is there s just a lot of urban wood waste supply whether it s because they re doing development and sort of clearing loss or whether we re getting further residual from sawmills and even from these pellet plants so we re just we don t look for the big contracts our philosophy is we don t want anybody to have more than say 10 of our supply at any plant so we go with a large variety of smaller suppliers and as that s been consistent throughout our fleet rupert merer and can you remind me of your south carolina facility how you re managing fiber there and of course the facilities are looking to acquire do you have long term contracts on supply of fiber jim moore it s almost all purchase orders with smaller suppliers operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to jim moore for any closing remarks jim moore okay thanks everybody we appreciate your ownership and interest in the company we look forward to updating you as progress unfolds as always we remain focused on building and protecting intrinsic value per share and your company as best we can with a long term ownership orientation thank you for your interest and participation and weâ ll update you on our progress in the next quarterly call operator the conference has not concluded thank you for attending today s presentation you may now disconnect

morning thank you for joining us today with me this morning are terry ronan our cfo dan rorabaugh our svp of operations joe cofelice our evp commercial development and several other members of the atlantic power management team the numbers for the fourth quarter and full year are provided in the press release the presentation and the prepared remarks which were posted to the website last evening please review those materials instead of reading off those results this morning i would like to talk about the state of the business in a bit of a year end review format following my remarks we ll take your questions at appel this week we announced that irving gerstein will retire from the board at the conclusion of the annual meeting this june in toronto irving has served atlantic power with professionalism and grace for nearly 15 years i have really enjoyed working with them i will miss his presence on the board we also announced that kevin howell will become chairman assuming he is reelected to the board kevin has extensive power and industry experience as an executive board member and board chair kevin shares our passion for a culture of safety frugality and service leadership in other people news we ve added two new vp commercial development hires bringing that group to four including evp joe cofelice this group has been focused on extending in restructuring our ppas the oefc settlement last year was an idea that originated this group and it led to a good economic result more recently this group has led the effort on asset m a with the south carolina biomass acquisition and they are continuing to work on other opportunities given our stronger balance sheet we are now a credible buyer of assets into the hundreds of millions of dollars finding adequate returns is the key on the balance sheet as noted in the financial results release we paid a 100 million of debt we repaid 100 million of debt in 2018 and plan to payoff another 86 million in 2019 we continue to strengthen the balance sheet to provide downside protection and to enhance our ability to play offence on capital allocation on capital allocation we have slightly more than 190 million of liquidity we ve had lots of good uses for our excess cash on and off the balance sheet over the past three years we have bought 36 million worth of common shares at an average price of 2 27 a share 23 million of preferred shares at a 38 discount to par and committed nearly 26 million for the koma kulshan in south carolina acquisition we will continue to rank order the risk reward from the various uses of capital available to us and then try to do the most rationale thing in capital allocation we are price to value driven so we don t have any set targets on how much capital to deploy in each bucket on company position we think we re well positioned now for various economic or industry scenarios if we have deflation or a market crash our ppa revenue will allow us to continue you paying down debt we would also be able to allocate our capital to assets that would very likely have higher returns in those generally available in today s low rate high asset price market environment it would be wrong to cheer for severe market dislocation but we would be well positioned and driving the work in the mornings with a alacrity in that scenario if we get a breakout of inflation at some point then interest rates and discount rates might rise that might lower the value of existing asset however that might be partially offset by higher power prices should they move up along with inflation higher power prices would improve the recontracting outlook in addition over time we will have more merchant generation available to sell out the markets if there is a pickup in prices lastly we have very little interest rate exposure on our debt if we get neither deflation nor inflation but rather a continuation of the current environment we plan to move forward on our path of grinding on cost and debt operating safely and efficiently and looking opportunistically for cigar butt investments turning from the macro environment to the power sector specifically if we continue to see aggressive additions of wind and solar to the grid we are likely to see great prices rise due to integration cost resulting in higher prices for end use customers and negative implications for electricity demand our belief is that the observers and market participants may be underestimating the integration cost of renewables and the cost of battery storage the retirement of nuclear and coal capacity helps the overall supply and demand picture the lack of strong capacity markets however is not good for natural gas plants at some point however flexible and please ccgt plants might see a pickup in value if their intermittent power and battery economics disappoint conversely any carbon regimes would be helpful to the value of our non carbon emitting hydro facilities higher gas prices would likely benefit our hydro facilities as well if we see a move to a more balanced approach our ccgts would likely benefit our biomass fleet has an attractive remaining ppa life on average seven years or more than nine years excluding williams lake so they re a good source of cash flow to continue in the present environment with our debt reduction and growth efforts we like our position in the near term having ample ppa coverage and in longer term being a potential hedge against inflation and was a fairly balanced portfolio of power technologies on growth after years of internal focus we re now in approved position with regard to cost and debt and can look more credibly at asset m a our koma kulshan and biomass acquisitions are one result of that positioning we are considering other potential acquisitions of various types we have nothing to report today but our deal flow and acquisition activities are picking up nicely we ve done a good job of restructuring our business there may be opportunities to merge where those skills would be useful in a combined entity we also have a strong operations expertise and that core competency has made us a more confident buyer of biomass plants as one example we re small enough that we can look at bilateral deals and not chase auctions we can also look at deals that are too small to move the needle at bigger public companies all in all we are confident but not complacent about our financial operational and strategic positioning in this market and in scenarios where we see dramatic economic market or regulatory breaks in one direction or another we are ready to take questions now operator questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from nelson ng of rbc capital markets please go ahead nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst great thanks good morning everyone james j moore jr president and chief executive officer good morning nelson nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst my first question relates to m a you mentioned that you re looking more actively at acquisition opportunities and also biomass what is your like what s your sweet spot in terms of acquisition size and what s the range of project size you think you can do james j moore jr president and chief executive officer well we on the smaller end we got the koma kulshan in south carolina deals and then at the higher end we ve got a couple of hundred million dollars of liquidity and then obviously we can look at financing acquisitions but we are going to be very opportunistic i think one of our competitive advantages is we re small enough that we can be a bit idiosyncratic and be disciplined and just look for the best deals available so whether it s biomass or some other technology whatever the contract length is we can get in here and be pretty nimble and i think we ll get some bilateral deals done over the years but we don t have any set targets that we re looking at nelson nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst and in terms of characteristics of your targets is there a minimum contract length you re looking at james j moore jr president and chief executive officer no no minimum contract length no maximum no specific technology we re just we re deal guys so we re looking for the best deals we can find and internally we always think of our hurdle rate as the press which we bought it 11 and again a little bit more even and that s a cash return so when we look at a 30 year pro forma irr that we consider that to kind of be a hurdle rate we re not very enthusiastic about merchant in this environment i think down the road merchant may actually be a good place to be and gas may end up having some values in areas that have over integrated intermittent power and underestimated the storage costs but we re creating merchant as our ppas run off the gas fleet so we don t really have to go out and buy anybody else s merchant we ve got our own nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst okay and then just i guess taking the i guess other side of the argument in terms of potentially buying assets have you considered potentially selling assets especially assets that are such high valuations in this market particularly hydro james j moore jr president and chief executive officer yeah we look at those things all the time since i ve been here we ve continuously looked at selling individual assets and fleets of assets and doing tax free spin offs and joint ventures and we ve looked at selling the company and merging the company and buying assets and we are just disciplined value investors so we re at the right price everything is for sale and at the right price we re going to be very enthusiastic buyers we re just focused on price to value and i think we don t want to be overly tied down to particular themes the old charlie munger says they never did strategic plans because you end up handcuffing yourself and missing opportunities and what he said is their big competitive advantage has been every day they come to work and they rank order the returns available to them and then they try to do the most intelligent thing they can with their capital and that s all we re trying to do we re trying to be as rational as possible for the shareholders nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst okay and then just switching gears to williams lake i think in the 2019 bridge you re expecting a reduction in the ebitda of about 11 million so that implies an overall negative 3 million contribution from williams lake i thought the short term ppa is a positive margin contributor so could you just provide a bit more color as to why it s been negative for the year i m just wondering whether post ppa expiration are you expecting just like i guess cost to maintain that asset terrence ronan executive vice president chief financial officer sure nelson tts terry i ll take that one so last year 2018 the ebitda was about 8 million and if you recall the ppa expired at the end of march so we had the higher priced ppa in there for three months and the short term extension was modestly positive so as we look at projections for 2019 we still feel that the short term extension is modestly positive it expires in june it could be extended till september or even longer at bc hydro s request but right now the reason you see that negative is because we assume on a conservative basis that a short term extension ends in june and then we have shutdown expenses including some severance and inventory adjustments that would lead you to that negative 3 million number that you mentioned now we are hopeful that that s not going to happen we ve got some positive news on williams lake recently but right now what s the budget has nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst i see that makes sense are you able to give any more clarity on the timing like obviously you re in discussions with the government i guess right now i presume and you re hoping to get something finalized sometime this year but are you able to give a bit more clarification in terms of timing joseph e cofelice executive vice president commercial development good morning nelson this is joe really we can t the report was issued and we expect to engage with bc hydro in the next couple of months and we re pretty confident that will occur based on the communications that are taking place how long the negotiation will take we will see but the bottom line there is that it s the report by the government is it s good news it s a positive step we ve been struggling over the last couple of years to create a path of for negotiation of a long term extension and discuss that for us but having said that we don t know what terms would be an offer ph until we get something done it s not done nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst got it ok just one last question in terms of the ontario facilities obviously you have a 15 year contract at tunis but you don t have a contract for kapuskasing and north bay is there something that makes the tunis facility more attractive than kapuskasing and north bay in terms of maybe it s location i guess is there a reason why tunis has a 15 year contract whereas i guess it s more difficult to get a contract for the other terrence ronan executive vice president chief financial officer what timing when the tunis contract expired we were able to go out and get possibly the last contract that was done before they shut down contracting with ipps in ontario and of course the inaudible contract expired later and when it came time to negotiate those the contracts we no longer are at them so what timing than anything else nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst okay got it i ll leave it there thanks james j moore jr president and chief executive officer thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from rupert merer of national bank please go ahead rupert merer national bank analyst good morning everyone james j moore jr president and chief executive officer good morning rupert rupert merer national bank analyst with your growth in biomass in the southern us wondering if you could talk us through the potential of that market and maybe talk about the availability of fiber mobility to contract fiber james j moore jr president and chief executive officer sure i ll start on the on the market itself and may ask dan little bit help on the fiber question if you compare the biomass opportunities to say natural gas opportunities or wind opportunities there s a limited universe of projects available and that universe becomes even more limited when you find a minimum ppa term to them because unlike other assets biomass plants are generally not plants that you want to take into a merchant market you want contract cover on them and so what we do is we basically look at the market we prioritize the targets by ppa cover and in the global market to those people i think that it s right now there are some opportunities out there that we were engaged in discussions with people we will see where those discussions go and basically

generally in these assets when they do become available and we have the ability to move quickly when these companies are seeking quick monetization so that s that i ll just make one point on wood supply i mean when you look at markets like georgia and south carolina it s pretty considerable toward the fiber there i think georgia may be the largest market in the us as a source of fiber so we re looking at targets we do spend a lot of time evaluating some fiber and that s also important from the standpoint of ppa extensions we have target projects like the locations like williams lake where you have strong community support for the plant because the plant is so important to the local inaudible and if you ve read any of the recent press in williams lake you ll see how beneficial that can be rupert merer national bank analyst are you seeing any risk from the on the fiber supply from the pellet producers and growing demand for wood pellets that are shipped internationally dan rorabaugh senior vice president operations there certainly is competition from them but what they tend not to use is the sort of the bulk in the other parts of inaudible less desirable and what we re finding is there is a lot of urban wood waste supply whether it s because they re doing a development and sort of clearing loss or whether we re getting these further residual from sawmills and even from these pellet plants so we re just we don t look for the big contracts our philosophy is we don t want anybody now more than say 10 of our supply in any plant so we go with the large variety of smaller suppliers and that s been consistent throughout our fleet rupert merer national bank analyst and can you remind me of your south carolina facility how you re managing fiber there and of course of the

net book to bill equal to or greater than 1 2 times revenue for full year 2018 we had a record level of 2 6 billion of net new business awards representing growth of 10 and a net book to bill of 1 29 ph times as we have previously discussed our new business awards and calculation of net book to bill ratio excludes the revenue impact of adopting asc 606 excludes reimbursement revenue and excludes revenue from our data solutions segment the addition of our new awards has resulted in our backlog increasing approximately 4 on a sequential basis and 20 year over year finishing at approximately 4 2 billion as we previously disclosed our backlog does not include our data solutions segment and in addition we exclude pass through and investigator revenue from backlog the diversity of our new business awards continues to be consistent with previous quarters with approximately 58 of our new awards coming from the pharmaceutical sector and approximately 42 coming from the biotech sector revenue for the fourth quarter was approximately 730 million which represents an increase of approximately 11 year over year at actual foreign exchange rates and 12 on a constant currency basis revenue growth excluding the impact of the adoption of asc 606 and reimbursement revenue was approximately 4 year over year at actual foreign exchange rates advertisement advertisement adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was approximately 87 million an increase of approximately 26 over the same period last year adjusted net income per diluted share was 1 31 a 26 increase versus the fourth quarter of 2017 our client base continues to be well diversified with our top five clients representing approximately 36 of total revenue for the quarter and our largest client representing approximately 9 of total revenue both metrics exclude the impact of adopting asc 606 our full year 2018 financial results continue to trend of consistent and strong growth we reported solid revenue growth and improved our overall operating margins we delivered full year revenue of approximately 2 9 billion representing growth of approximately 27 at actual foreign currency exchange rates and 26 on a constant currency basis organic revenue growth which excludes impact of the adoption of asc 606 reimbursement revenue and our 2017 acquisitions was approximately 10 year over year at both actual foreign exchange rates and on a constant currency basis during 2018 we made significant investments in our business and enhanced our service offerings we believe that we ve established a foundation that will allow us to provide long term and sustainable growth and believe we are well positioned to offer a wide variety of services to our clients due to our solid performance in 2018 we are anticipating 2019 adjusted earnings per diluted share between 4 93 per share and 5 08 per share mike will provide additional details about our 2019 guidance later in the call advertisement advertisement during 2018 many of you raised questions about the status of studies that were cancelled heading into 2018 the impact of the pharma industry m a activity on our business and the integration of our symphony business i would like to take a moment just to provide a brief update on each of these items regarding the canceled studies as i ve mentioned in the past these were replaced and have been up and running since the later half of that 2018 and as we ve mentioned previously our client had prioritized their pipeline and as a result canceled and then subsequently replaced their studies the replacement studies were of a similar value but have a longer duration than the general studies as you are aware the takeda and inaudible transaction closed in january 2019 we don t anticipate the closing of this transaction to have an impact on studies that are currently running for takeda and we are optimistic about the impact of transaction will have on our new business in the future we look forward to continuing our partnership with takeda as it heads into s4 ph of our relationship regarding our data solutions segment i am pleased that we have finalized the inaudible and we are now in a position to complete our integration plans and expand on our service offerings as anticipated we saw the unusual sorry the usual seasonality in this business and we are able to meet our forecast for the year in closing i would like to thank our entire staff and our clients for their continued commitment to pra health sciences we are delighted with our strong financial results and believe we are well positioned for 2019 i would now like to hand over the call to mike bonello our chief financial officer who will go through our quarterly and full year financial results in more detail advertisement advertisement michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you colin good morning everyone for the fourth quarter of 2018 our consolidated revenue grew 11 2 at actual foreign exchange rates and 12 on a constant currency basis we reported revenue of 729 6 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 655 9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 when comparing recorded revenue to our third quarter guidance fourth quarter reported revenues negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations of approximately 3 million and lower than forecasted reimbursement revenue of 8 million our guidance assumed reimbursement revenue of approximately 28 5 of asc 605 revenue while actuals came in at 27 revenue excluding the impact of the adoption of asc 606 and reimbursement revenue increased 3 6 at actual foreign exchange rates and 4 2 on a constant currency basis revenue by segment for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 655 6 million for the clinical research segment and 74 million for the data solutions segment advertisement advertisement regarding revenue concentration for the fourth quarter of 2018 we derived 54 of our service revenue from large pharmaceutical companies 11 from small to mid sized pharmaceutical companies 16 from large biotechnology companies and 19 from all other biotechnology companies these concentration metrics exclude our data solutions segment the adoption of asc 606 and reimbursement revenue and are in line with what we ve seen in previous quarters total direct costs were 365 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 368 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease in direct costs was primarily related to a favorable impact of 8 6 million from foreign currency exchange rates which was offset by an increase in labor related costs in our clinical research segment as we continue to ensure appropriate staffing levels and an increase of 1 6 million in our data solutions segment excluding the impact of the adoption of asc 606 and reimbursement revenue direct costs were 62 1 of service revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 64 9 in the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease in direct costs as a percentage of service revenue is primarily due to favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations discussed earlier and an increase in utilization of our staff sg a expenses were 96 4 million or 16 4 of revenue excluding the impact of the adoption of asc 606 and reimbursement revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 16 2 for the fourth quarter of 2017 the slight increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of service revenue is primarily related to an increase in stock based compensation during the current year the increase in stock based compensation expense is primarily related to the initiation of our annual grant program and the adoption of our employee stock purchase plan and is consistent with the trend we saw in the third quarter of 2018 during the fourth quarter of 2018 we incurred transaction related expenses of 3 1 million compared to 75 9 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 both amounts were primarily related to changes in the fair value of earn out liabilities associated with our acquisitions advertisement advertisement adjusted net income which excludes certain items whose fluctuation from period to period does not necessarily correspond to changes in our operating results increased 26 4 year over year to 86 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 adjusted net income per diluted share grew 26 to 1 31 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 1 04 per share in the same quarter last year for the 12 months ended december 31 2018 our consolidated revenues grew approximately 27 at actual foreign exchange rates and 26 on a constant currency basis revenue excluding the impact of the adoption of asc 606 and reimbursement revenue increased 18 at actual foreign exchange rates and 17 on a constant currency basis we finished the year with approximately 2 3 billion of revenue excluding the impact of the adoption of asc 606 and reimbursement revenue compared to 1 9 million ph in the comparable prior year cash provided by operations was 131 2 million for the three months ended december 31 2018 compared to cash provided by operations of 102 6 million for the three months ended december 31 2017 for the 12 months ended december 31 2018 cash provided by operations was 329 8 million compared to 220 4 million for the 12 months ended december 31 2017 the increase in operating cash flow was the result of an increase in operational performance and optimization of our working capital our net days sales outstanding were 16 days at december 31 2018 compared to 20 days at december 31 2017 capital expenditures were 15 8 million for the three months ended december 31 2018 compared to 22 million for the three months ended december 31 2017 capital expenditures were 55 9 million for the 12 months ended december 31 2018 compared to 61 3 million for the 12 months ended december 31 2017 our capital expenditures continue to reflect our investment in information technology and the expansion of our infrastructure to support our growth advertisement advertisement our cash balance was 144 2 million at the end of the fourth quarter of which 63 2 million was held by our foreign subs net debt outstanding defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2018 was 942 3 million compared to 1 16 billion at december 31 2017 during the fourth quarter of 2018 we made additional voluntary principal payments of 110 million during 2018 total principal payments on long term debt were 224 million regarding currency concentration at december 31 2018 excluding the impact of the adoption of asc 606 and reimbursement revenue 84 of our revenue were denominated in us dollars and 62 of our total expenses were denominated in us dollars which is consistent with prior quarters and consistent with 2017 levels our euro exposure continues to be naturally hedged as we ve of discussed in prior quarters we have exposure to movements in the gbp as less than 1 of our revenue was denominated in gbp of 5 of our expenses are denominated in gbp we continue to look at ways to reduce this exposure turning to our net guidance for 2019 we are estimating revenues between 3 09 billion and 3 2 billion representing as reported in constant currency growth of 8 to 11 on an asc 605 basis we re estimating revenues between 2 475 billion and 2 57 billion representing as reported in constant currency growth of 8 to 12 we are anticipating gaap earnings per diluted share between 3 65 and 3 80 per share and adjusted earnings per diluted share of between 4 93 and 5 08 per share we anticipate that our annual effective income tax rate will be approximately 24 which incorporates the expected changes from the us tax cuts and jobs act our effective rate may differ from this estimate with the geographical distribution of our pre tax earnings changes from what we have estimated or if there are changes in the interpretation analysis or if additional guidance is issued related to the us tax cuts and jobs act regarding q1 2019 guidance we are estimating revenues between 720 million and 740 million representing as reported growth of 3 to 5 and constant currency growth of 4 to 7 on an asc 605 basis we re estimating revenues between 575 million and 595 million representing as reported growth of 3 to 6 and constant currency growth of 4 to 7 as a reminder we reported organic revenue growth excluding asc 606 and reimbursement revenue in the data solutions segment of 17 8 on an as reported basis and 15 2 on a constant currency basis in the first quarter of 2018 we are anticipating gaap earnings per share between 0 74 and 0 79 per share and adjusted earnings per diluted share of between 1 05 and 1 10 per share like our full year guidance we expect our effective income tax rate to be 24 consistent with prior years we are including q1 guidance to ensure the expectations around sequential quarter earnings growth are in line with our expectations this guidance includes the impact of the seasonality in our data solutions segment and the impact of first quarter recurring expenses such as payroll taxes and employee benefits and expenses incurred related to internal organizational meetings finally our guidance assumes a euro exchange rate of 1 15 and a british pound exchange rate of 1 35 all other foreign currency exchange rates are as of january 31 2019 our process for determining exchange rates was consistent with prior years where we use several bank resources to evaluate expected rate movements for the next 12 months that concludes our prepared remarks and now we d be happy to take your questions please provide your name and affiliation when asking a question operator you may now open the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from david windley with jefferies david windley jefferies analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my questions i wanted to focus on revenue first colin i think you had talked about the replace the canceled and then replace studies from your one of your key clients as having had or expected to have an impact in 2018 particularly in the second half and we see that in the growth rates and then in your guidance for the first quarter it looks like that growth rate is beginning to improve but still somewhat depressed and so i wanted to get a perspective on how your conversion rate how the backlog is flowing into revenue and what will drive the acceleration of your revenue growth through 2019 colin shannon president chief executive officer and director thanks dave with that mentioned obviously the cancellations had an impact there was some studies as well during the summer that we said was seeming to start a little bit slower than we anticipated but the teams have been doing a phenomenal job watching costs but then as we re approaching q4 we needed to completely change our goals and start getting into the hiring very very rapid hiring mode our company had to hire over 300 net new people a month and it was hard to switch that back on again after such conservative cost constraints and we managed to hit over 300 net new hires per month which is great stuff but we could have done more and it s been taken us a little while to really get back in drive again and it s only really now we re starting to hit on all cylinders so we re moving pretty much rapidly again so we ll start to see that improve as the year goes on everything starting to go nice again we are smoothing everything out so we remain optimistic obviously we are setting ourselves up nicely with see the q1 was still getting a little bit of after effect as we ramp up so we are pleased to see that it starts to improve as we get down later on in the year david windley jefferies analyst okay thank you second question might be for mike so my follow up is around 606 and 605 and you guys as it appears are choosing to continue to give guidance on both which i m sure we all find interesting i guess the two part would be if you could help us to understand how your systems allow you to continue to provide guidance on both and kind of as a read through do you i guess do you feel comfortable that you re going to be able to file your 10 k cleanly given some headlines lately michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sure dave so from a revenue perspective we were on an input based methodology prior to the adoption of 606 so we ve always been able to forecast the service component of our revenue unlike some of our competitors what we ve been able to do is we ve been able to separate out how we phase service and how we phase investigator and pass through so we re watching those separately and that s what allows us to be able to give you guidance on a 606 and 605 basis david windley jefferies analyst yes go ahead michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer regarding the 10 k we re planning on filing as soon as the call is over david windley jefferies analyst okay great thanks and no internal control weaknesses that we should be anticipating michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer no david windley jefferies analyst great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from john kreger with william blair john kreger william blair company analyst hi thanks very much colin can you just expand a little bit about your comments around data solutions as the earnout period ends just sort of refresh our memory what kind of synergies do you see across the two businesses and maybe if you could give us a preview on sort of product expansions that you mentioned as we move through 19 thanks colin shannon president chief executive officer and director that s great thanks john there s a few things in that question because some of them are not quite related to the data solutions by then on the data solutions the first thing that we are we moved the location the philadelphia location into our blue bell office so the team is better integrated with our main team is one of our largest offices that we have the largest office we have in the company is our blue bell and so that s helped with the integration and we ve made some adjustments to leadership just to help with the integration and culture shift because the way we re seeing with synergies it was not about cost savings it s raising new opportunities and working in collaboration together we see great opportunities and we ve had to make sure that we had the right fit to make sure that we enabled all these connections to work within the organization these things have been put in place the beginning of the year as i said i would do and we re looking forward to building on that basis for the rest of the year i mean regarding our service offerings we ve been continuing to enhance what we re doing on the inaudible as you know vested in parallel 6 and the c6 platform and is taking a lot of traction we re seeing a lot of interest from clients who are really want to be more innovative and do things differently except the same old ways of getting things done so we re excited to be where that is taking off and it is helping us with bringing new offerings to clients with new solutions we still utilize updates a very definitely from our competitors that again is giving us new insights and ways of working with them we see great opportunities on the more on the commercial side where we can start linking things together and we take advantage of some of our symphony data assets and the acquisition of that company we continue to pursue some opportunities in that direction all in all we feel very nicely positioned that we re helping to shift the mindset and even look definitely and actually offer differ solutions to our clients john kreger william blair company analyst great thank you and maybe just a quick follow up how are strategic solutions doing and are you seeing the mix of your awards shifted out toward either full services or the staffing business thanks colin shannon president chief executive officer and director that s a very good question interestingly we are much we re seeing much more solid growth on the old traditional product registration part of the business and you know as part of our build out for our guidance i do admit for being slightly more conservative on our strategic solutions part of the business i mean part of that as you re well aware with that you know the pricing discussions going on with the same with the capitol hill ph and with that biopharma s testifying that always seems to cause a little bit of an issue with expenditure within the biopharma companies we ve been generally a little bit cautious knowing that there might be squeezing the budgets and things like that so we wanted to make sure that we conserve that as we re preparing our guidance john kreger william blair company analyst thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from eric coldwell with baird eric coldwell robert w baird co analyst hey thanks very much the two smart guys asked a couple of my questions but i ll just i ll follow up with maybe a couple of easier ones hopefully good answer on data solutions i m just curious if you can tell us what your growth outlook is for this year is it 5 is it 10 and then second one i m curious if a couple of your peers have thrown out provocative terms or said hey maybe there was a little bit of softness in the market at a certain point in the third or fourth quarter i m just curious did you see any of those air pockets maybe with a certain client cohort or in a certain geography or was your pipeline in rfi activity pretty similar as the year concluded colin shannon president chief executive officer and director okay well on the data solutions side i ll have to come back to you on where we re seeing the growth we re just in the process of planning we just finished our business development meeting with the new leadership team and so i d really like to give them a little bit more time to really look at how we can build that plan together we ll set some pretty tough objectives and so think it was a little bit going through the first few weeks of the year but i expected to make up and more because we re going to be utilizing the whole organization behind them so if you don t mind i ll get back to you on that aspect as we finalize some plans i will just completed the and what s our visibility and really looking at opportunities where we want to see what we can do that regarding rfp flow and you know i didn t notice anything that was majorly different you know i say going into the beginning of the call a little bit soft in one of the months and started recoveries the trend wise it s still kind of upwards and strong we are seeing new opportunities which are always more difficult for us to win because you re always got to displace an incumbent you know but that s always gets us exciting opportunities we like to have these discussions to offer our new approaches and we like that challenge we ve been excited about the flow we are seeing new progress you know all in all i think that things are holding up nicely i mean i would obviously have competitors we re seeing a little bit of weakness on the biotech and maybe they are looking at different level of the maturities of the biotech or whatever i don t know the answer but we are seeing regular decent size opportunities and we know that there is still a lot of fun sitting within biotech that they need to spend on later stage development eric coldwell robert w baird co analyst yes colin that s really helpful just one quick one that came to mind i did hear recently that maybe there was a little bit of softness in asia pac specifically china due to some of the deal well let s say between our two governments are you seeing any change in growth in asia pac any change in client interest in china in particular and if so how is that impacting you how are you responding colin shannon president chief executive officer and director we ve always mentioned that as one of the areas that we feel like we have been a little bit behind in our growth levels there so it s really not impacting us because we are still growing and we still have a lot of vacancies so we kind of a little bit sheltered from that at the moment because we have been we are still building our infrastructure we have really solid operations guy we have got good leadership there and we re growing it very nicely we chose to continue the organic growth and so far we are still continuing to hire quite rapidly and that will that area eric coldwell robert w baird co analyst that s super helpful thanks so much i ll cede the floor here operator thank you our next question comes from donald hooker with keybanc donald hooker keybanc capital markets analyst great good morning curious with symphony health we ll wait to hear back from you on some of the growth outlook objectives there but are you needing to put more capital into that business to kind of to grow at overseas or add in new solutions how should we think about maybe capital in 2019 colin shannon president chief executive officer and director yeah we certainly are considering now we ve got a couple of initiatives ongoing just now one of them we re looking how to expand within canada the other and some overseas opportunities and we certainly are looking to make sure that we did that in a discipline format but yes we see a lot of opportunities a lot of enhancements and you know we are excited about the growth potential within that area so we continued to evolve and look at that as an opportunity donald hooker keybanc capital markets analyst and then my follow up question similar to that is is it fair to think that there could be maybe some upside in gross margins as you can integrate some of those data assets and tools and as you get more aggressive synergizing that acquisition is how should we think about that impacting gross margins over certainly next 12 or 36 months colin shannon president chief executive officer and director we re kind of sort of guided to where we feel things are going to be we ve typically mentioned some improvement every year and we don t see any dramatic change this year you are absolutely correct that as part of that in the lighting we do see that there is opportunities we re still in the investment phase just now and building out and there s lots of opportunity we want to add and get the growth back and track the way that we d like to see it going so that takes a little bit of investment so at this point we re going to be making sure that while we adding appropriate staffing getting the right ingredients from the country mix and various other things that we re looking at so this year we re really concentrating really on expansion donald hooker keybanc capital markets analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from sandy draper with suntrust alexander draper suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks very much a lot of my questions actually just got asked by four smarter people than i am so my question i guess colin would really be around the hiring and the cost as you said you re putting your foot on the pedal for hiring 300 people a month is a lot are you seeing any wage inflation and when you hire to speed it up does that mean you re going to have to spend more or what do you exactly to hire faster and are there sort of hiring marketing cost that you have to undertake colin shannon president chief executive officer and director we ve actually got a really good machine and it s not just our talent acquisition group it takes the whole organization because a lot of interviews and a lot of time and effort and that s 300 net new employees so it s way over 400 that we re hiring in a month so there s a lot of work to do that and so it s a good question you re asking because when the inflation part is mainly can be geographical it depends on which country you re looking at you might see a little bit of spike in certain areas i think the only area within the u s we saw some problems was highly qualified oncology specialists and we had to actually in january make a decision to use an agency to speed up some of the hirings to augment what we re doing because we were real pinched to get quite a number of well qualified people on board very quickly to meet our client needs so yes so sometimes it can cost a little bit more to bring them on board but overall it s within plan and we have the engine now a lot of it was just getting it going again and getting back into the right cadence alexander draper suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay that s helpful and i guess maybe just a follow up to that when you re in the hiring process and then it is get down into the leads how often are these people sort of playing you versus icon versus iqvia the multiple cros and just trying to pick the highest pay versus maybe different way to think about it how do you sell pra is the place you want to work besides just hey we re going to pay a little bit more money colin shannon president chief executive officer and director well that s a big question if you got a day to spare off you know if you want me to watch a little about pra you probably be long time obviously call it acquisition people are very well up to speed on all the things and differences that we bring to a potential candidate we just focus very much on bring the right people on board people willing to understand that we are very patient focused than driving signs and result was to ensure that the well being of patients is the goal and they ll find a good warm reception within our organization and we obviously at the rate we are growing continually gets opportunities so people can see that as a good place to join because out of expansion has a lot of people to be promoted and continue to grow within the organization so we do have a lot of offerings in some of the regions we are in we are still relatively small in comparison to others which again gives rapid growth and opportunities for these people as well joining us so i think we ve got a really good story and we continue to and focus on innovation and doing things in a different way people are excited with that prospect it helped particularly where you got more senior people here and don t wanted the same old same old and they see that as an opportunity to help as we define and help transform the industry so that s kind of where we are driving and the type of messaging that we re bringing to the organization alexander draper suntrust robinson humphrey analyst that s really helpful thanks operator thank you our next question comes from jack meehan with barclays mitchell petersen barclays analyst thanks this is actually mitch petersen for jack this morning so maybe one for mike guidance assumes some pretty nice operating leverage in 2019 i was hoping obviously the color has been really helpful on the hirings side but i was hoping we could put some numbers behind that just your expectations between leverage on the gross margin line and the sg a line in 2019 i would imagine just given the commentary it s more going to be on sg a line but i wanted to get your thoughts michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer well there s going to be some gross margin improvement as we have communicated previously we re looking for 50 basis points of overall improvement the majority of that is going to come from gross margin colin s point will start to leverage those people as the revenue ramps toward the back end of the year from an sg a prospective this probably maybe 20 bps or 30 bps coming from that as we continue to leverage our sg a team so we re looking at kind of 50 bps to 60 bps of total mitchell petersen barclays analyst got it and then maybe just as a follow up could you expand on your capital deployment expectations for 2019 and absent any m a should we assume to have repayment or is share repurchase going to be on the table in 2019 michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer we ve obviously we were looking for any interesting opportunities to help augment our data solutions which we alluded to earlier and that is some exciting things out there that we would like to see how that would take us nothing is eminent for sure but we certainly are having that active discussions with some really nice opportunities and absent that we have been paying down debt yes you re correct at some point we ll have to rethink about what should be our rate leverage ratio and s a problem to have and we ll certainly consider that with the board and shift some of these other things we re looking at not be fruitful mitchell petersen barclays analyst great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from erin wright with credit suisse erin wright credit suisse analyst great thanks i m curious to what you re seeing in terms of the mix of business coming in i think you ve commented a little bit on the full service versus asset ffp ph but as it relates to therapeutic class or any abnormally disproportionate demand dynamics around large versus small pharma biotech and an overall success in when we win rates there on thanks michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah there hasn t been that a big shift i think as we talked about kind of concentration from a large pharma versus biotech that revenue coming in is relatively the same and i think colin commented on the mix of nva and that s been consistent quarter over quarter we are seeing from an awards perspective a concentration or around oncology and immunology if you compare 2018 to 2017 so that mix has changed slightly and that also references colin s point earlier about the elongation of some of those studies because of the types that we re getting erin wright credit suisse analyst okay got it and then a random question here but how is the early development business performing what percent of that is your business now as a percentage of revenue thanks michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer it s performed very well in 2018 it s still roughly it s probably less than 10 of our business right now but it has performed very well erin wright credit suisse analyst okay great thanks operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from juan avendano with bank of america merrill lynch juan avendano bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi thank you regarding your gross wins they did decline 6 year over year despite a very strong cro industry backdrop can you tell us what drove the decline was it just prior difficult year comp and then talk to us about your ability to actually book business on an incremental basis from now on michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer well we did have quite large comps as you say and that s a pretty fair point and you know as we re looking into the year there was a number of typical larger clients that we knew that would be have a much stronger 2019 that they were coming to the end of some of the cycles of the current work last year and that we d be doing new updates this year we ve mentioned that we had at one in your prefer our partnership and q2 last year and we had anticipated what is coming in and on that toward the end of the year and that s actually didn t get all finalized until the end of the year but just recently we got our first decent sized work from that new clients so we re starting to see all the things that we put in place starting to come through the inaudible way exactly the timing is going to happen we always hope that when things will take we were very pleased with the way things progressed it gave us time to consolidate things within our organization and what s the cost bringing new systems and tools help with things that we were having to in the back burner while we re focusing on bringing in all the people and training and getting them working on the study so and it helped us really solidify our foundation again and get ready for growth which i feel really good about juan avendano bank of america merrill lynch analyst good thank you appreciate the color the other data point i guess regarding bookings was that of the cancellation rate was the lowest that you ve had over since your ipo at 1 7 that did help the net book to bill and so did you take less proactive write offs on your backlog this quarter or if that was not that and can you maybe talk about the quality of your backlog and what drove the super low cancellation rate this quarter michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer i actually think the low cancellation really drives home the quality of our backlog we have been careful about what we take into backlog and you know anything that has been and looking access there s any risk we ve been plus of the prop measuring that very carefully and watching it very closely so it s nice yes we are more in the pudding side and i m sure you can realize that we could probably at some point have taken in larger amounts of new business but we probably more prudent and we want to build up a sustainable growth business and we want to make sure that what we are reflecting to our investors is things that we feel confident and we could achieve and we don t at this swings and roundabouts where we ve got high gross nva followed by large cancellations juan avendano bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and just one quick one can you reassure us that the net book to bill is not necessarily going to decline throughout 2019 as perhaps you know according to my model unless you do over a 100 million in gross wins and about 750 ph on average on a quarterly basis that net book to bill would be declining michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer well when we did our ipo we modeled that and said these are great really long term view would be some uplift to somewhere between 1 1 and 1 15 which would actually provide very decent growth what we ve been seeing just not as quite exceptional time so no i can t guarantee anything i mean i think that we had a nice position with good offerings that we can continue to win a good opportunities and we set lay our goals that are very strong and we are optimistic that what we are putting together that is going allow us to continue this type of high book to bills and a lot depends on the marketplace and what s going on there but we feel that we ve got good product offering we have got nicely positioned for growth and we ve got a lot of the good dynamics and and we re certainly setting targets are very aggressive juan avendano bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from dan brennan with ubs daniel brennan ubs investment bank analyst great thanks thanks for taking the questions mike so i just wanted to go back if you will back to one of the earlier questions just on our conversion rates throughout the year so colin i just want to make sure i understand is it basically you talked about the aggressive hiring that you had to do and it sounds like kind of maybe being a little bit behind on that now that you re ramping that that effectively is what s going to enable you to kind of see this conversion rate go up having the right people in place at the right kind of at the right time michael j bonello executive vice president and chief financial officer well there s a couple of things there yes that certainly will help you know as we ve been watching the trends evolve part of the issue is that as you know our strategic solutions division we are very prudent on the way we recognize our new business we only take 12 months of any new contract and as that proportion of our revenue is starting to i always think with the other pieces it s more active it s not growing quite as fast as the traditional project work you re getting that 12 month period that s in backlog reducing and therefore causing a market adjacent to the conversion rate coupled with the more complex studies i have to remind that everybody seeing giving work bidding longer term more like more complex oncology trials etcetera so that s having an effect as well and we are being modeling it through and we obviously our conversion rate as a good metric but we are looking at in much more detail by study our planning is all about the resources we need to perform everything and the growth is actually much more predetermined the conversion rates are good proxy for you guys and i mean at time we continue to manage and look at it and it throws and even more issues when we re looking at 606 the issues there because we know that 606 is roughly adding an extra 28 but in q4 only added 27 so we still getting to grips with the true flow of that and how that works and how we can make sure that we get really good at forecasting that i think that what we ve done with our systems and processes has helped us really understand a lot quicker than most but even we still trying fine tuning and understanding the complexity there but overall as we start to see the trends as stabilize at least we ll certainly give an indication at this moment there is still lot of the erratic and looking forward there is no real pattern that we re seeing this is the reason why our conversion is changing and that it s just a mixture of mix both between strategic solutions and product registration and complexity of trials the hiring of people getting in top of things would certainly be helpful as well daniel brennan ubs investment bank analyst great thank you and then maybe just as a follow up just on the i think back there was a question on data solution so we ll wait obviously as the team and yourself come out with more details about the plan but could you at least just maybe speak to the opportunity or how you ve characterized it in the past to incorporate what symphony offers back in your core clinical cro offering is that something that we should be shouldn t be surprised to see a more forceful push in 2019 or is that something you think that evolves over the course of the next couple of years in terms of integrating that data into how you re delivering your cro business thank you colin shannon president chief executive officer and director we absolutely have the data part with our symphony that we utilized within our seattle piece has been fundamental for the last 10 years if you recall part of the reason that we acquired symphony was to secure that data because we became so dependent upon it for our core service delivery it was important that we capture the sources and that we could actually have that data available the nice thing is that by owning symphony we get all that data to use and expand upon and it gets this new looks and new ways of actually and helping our clients regarding the push we also made sure that symphony would be able to stand alone and at least meet all our goals of trying to get double digit growth and we feel that there s a strong potential even organically so adding on any potential future acquisitions that may help support the data from international offerings et cetera we just see some more upside as i ve mentioned a lot of the planning is still got to be put in place but back to our original remit which is what we ve got we see a nice runway of good double digit growth for the next few years there s a lot of work to get that done but we do see opportunities and we do see other new opportunities that we can expand within what of dividends and others which helps us get and going to markets that we ve never really been present before daniel brennan ubs investment bank analyst great thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in the

is neoliberlism killing russia is neoliberlism killing russia paul craig roberts and michael hudson putin s approval rating is high but it has declined over the past year the decline is mainly related to domestic policy apparently the public perceives recent kremlin economic policy as a continuation of the disastrous policies that washington imposed on russia in the 1990s when russia was loaded up with foreign debt while state assets were privatized and plundered by oligarchs sponsored by the west who cashed out by selling the assets to foreigners the approval rating of putin and the government dropped in response to the recent increases in the retirement age and value added tax the former raised concerns about pension security and reminded russians of the collapse of soviet pensions the latter reduced consumer disposable income and lowered consumer demand and the economic growth rate these policies represent austerity imposed on the domestic population instead of on foreign creditors and reflect the neoliberal view that austerity leads to prosperity russia is experiencing capital outflows due to the russian private sector s repayment of loans to western creditors russia has experienced over 25 billion a year of capital outflows since the early 1990s accumulating to over a trillion dollars this money could have been invested in russia itself to raise the productivity and living standards of its citizens the outflow puts the ruble under pressure and the interest payments draw money out of the country away from russian uses if it were not for these outflows the value of the ruble and russian wages would be higher the us sanctions give russians every reason not to repay their foreign loans yet russians continue to enable their own exploitation by foreigners as neoliberal economists have told them that there is no alternative russia s economic problems are due to the looting of the country during the yeltsin years to the imposition of neoliberal economics by the americans and to financialization as a result of the privatizations russia s stock market became the darling of the west in the mid 1990s as underpriced mining oil and infrastructure were sold for a fraction of their value to foreigners thus transferring russian income streams abroad instead of leaving the income to be invested in russia in effect russians were told that the way for their country to get rich was to let kleptocrats oligarchs and their u s and british stock brokers make hundreds of billions of dollars by privatizing russia s public domain washington took advantage of the gullible and trusting yeltsin government to do as much political and economic damage as possible to russia the country was torn apart historic parts of russia such as ukraine were split off into separate countries washington even insisted that crimera long a part of russia and the country s warm water port was retained by ukraine when the soviet union was dismembered people s savings called the overhang were wiped out with hyperinflation privatization was not accompanied by new investment the economy was not industrialized but financialized the proceeds from privatization were deposited by the russian government in private banks where the money was used to privatize more russian assets the banking system thus served to finance the transfer of ownership not to fund new investment and the proceeds were transferred abroad russia was turned into a financial colony in which proconsuls created wealth at the top today privatization continues in the de facto privatization of public assets such as charging fees for use of federal highways as the russian economic profession has been brainwashed by the americans the country is devoid of economic leadership we have pointed out on more than one occasion that it is nonsensical for russia to indebt itself by borrowing abroad in order to finance investments the russians were sold a bill of goods that the central bank cannot issue rubles unless the rubles are backed by dollars this advice served to prevent russia from using its own central bank to fund public infrastructure and private investment projects by issuing rubles in other words russia might as well not have a central bank apparently russian economists do not understand that russia does not spend borrowed foreign currencies inside russia if russia takes a foreign loan the borrowed money goes into central bank reserves the central bank then issues the ruble equivalent to be spent on the project and the cost of the project goes up by the pointless interest paid to the foreign lender as far as we can tell the institute of economics of the russian academy of sciences is so brainwashed by neoliberal economics that their minds are closed to correct policies the failure of russian economic leadership imposes far more costs on the russian economy than do washington s sanctions intellectual leadership is weak with many in the intellectual class favoring integration with the west rather than with the east to be part of the west has been an important goal since peter the first and catherine the great and the russian atlanticist integrationists cannot let go of the ancient goal this goal no longer makes sense not only does it imply russian vassalage but also europe is no longer the center of power the east is rising and china is the center and will be until the chinese destroy themselves by copying the western neoliberal policy of financializing the economy although putin is a leader and has a sense of russian purpose many officials use their office not in service to russia but in service to their own wealth much of which is held abroad corruption and embezzlement seem to be the purpose of many office holders scandals abound among members of government and reflect badly on putin and medvedev the russian government s popularity was at a peak when the government showed it had the intelligence and will to reincorporate crimea into russia however the russian government hoping to reassure washington and europe refused the requests of the luhansk and donetsk republics to be reincorporated into russia russian nationalists the majority of the population saw this as kowtowing to the west moreover the russian government s decision has resulted in ukraine s ongoing military assault on the breakaway republics and to the arming of ukraine by the west instead of acting decisively the russian government enabled the continuation of conflict that can be exploited by washington the russian people understand this even if the government does not by failing to show firmness the russian government encourages the crony system of oligarchs who want a government that they can use for their narrow interests their interests include participating in the system of western plunder known as globalism these client elites of the west oppose a powerful russian state that could assert itself on the world stage and offer an alternative policy to the west s policy of plunder the influence of this narrow interest group on government policy indicates that the russian government is compromised putin is trying to break free of the west s grip by directing russia s economic orientation to the east his effort is helped by the american sanctions but russia remains sufficiently mired in the western system to be vulnerable to sanctions and is only slowly extracting itself various aspects of russia s difficulties and transformation into a power with a foot in both west and east are discussed by commentators what goes unacknowledged is that russian economic policy is constrained indeed crippled by the neoliberal brainwashing given to russian economists by the americans in the 1990s consequently russia is enfeebled by an economic policy that encourages privatization and foreign ownership and by financialization of economic rents that is of income streams that do not result from productive investment but from such factors as location and rise in value due to public infrastructure development such as a road built across a property in a financialized economy credit is used to transfer property ownership instead of to finance new plant and equipment and construction of infrastructure the russian government and central bank have been blinded to the fact that russian infrastructure projects and private investment are not dependent on borrowing dollars abroad or by acquiring dollars by selling russian assets to foreigners such projects can be financed by ruble creation by the russian central bank money that flows into productive projects that raise output is not inflationary generally speaking such projects lower costs for russia to succeed russia needs an economic re education and a government that finds its footing in russian nationalism and discourages western provocations with firmer responses it is our view that the western world indeed all of life has an interest in a russia too strong to be attacked or provoked as a strong russia is the only way to curtail the western aggression that is leading to nuclear war share this page
the global savings glut is drying up the long era of seductively abundant capital is drawing to a close to be replaced by a ferocious battle for scarce funding this is going to be painful for those countries with public debt ratios hitting 100 per cent of gdp that rely on constant flows of imported capital even savvy investors like warren buffett say concern over government budget deficits is overblown credit bloomberg japan has been able to defy gravity for two decades with debt ratios rising to 240 per cent of gdp because it is the world s top external creditor commanding us3 trillion 4 2 trillion of net assets america enjoys no such luxury nor does britain in their infinite wisdom america s opinion elites and both political parties have chosen this moment to embrace the beguiling notion that public debt does not matter after all so long as you can print your own currency warren buffett has joined the chorus confessing hard money errors in the past and ridiculing those who regularly preach doom because of government budget deficits
rttnews the major u s index futures are currently pointing to a higher opening on friday with stocks likely to move to the upside following the relatively lackluster performance seen over the past few sessions continued optimism about u s china trade talks may generate some early buying interest following upbeat comments from white house economic adviser larry kudlow kudlow said the u s and china are making fantastic progress in their trade negotiations suggesting the world s two largest economies are on the cusp of an historic agreement meanwhile traders have largely shrugged off the geopolitical uncertainty raised by the failed summit between president donald trump and north korea s kim jong un which weighed on the markets on thursday selling pressure was somewhat subdued although stocks still moved modestly lower over the course of the trading session on thursday the major averages all ended the day in negative territory after the mixed performance in the previous

weakness on wall street came after the summit between trump and kim ended abruptly without an agreement on the denuclearization of the korean peninsula trump told reporters the north korean dictator wanted the u s to lift all sanctions without having to give up all of his weapons of mass destruction basically they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn t do that trump said they were willing to de nuke a large portion of the areas that we wanted but we couldn t give up all of the sanctions for that so we continue to work and we ll see but we had to walk away from that particular suggestion he added we had to walk away from that the president noted that the two sides will continue to work toward an agreement although the lack of a deal at the summit added to recent uncertainty on wall street however the negative sentiment was partly offset by a report from the commerce department showing u s economic growth slowed by less than expected in the fourth quarter of 2018 the report said real gross domestic product climbed by 2 6 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the 3 4 percent jump in the third quarter economists had expected gdp to increase by 2 3

during the quarter to 20 2 million recipient of the pdac safe day everyday gold award for the second consecutive year our third quarter results reflect a normal part of our operational pattern as mining and exploration companies shut down operations in some cases for extended periods over the holiday season additionally the company typically schedules substantial overhaul and maintenance work on its equipment during this slower period said denis larocque president and ceo of major drilling group international inc as expected january had a slow start as we were still waiting on customer plans for calendar 2019 and many of our rigs only restarted between late january and mid february despite this seasonal slowdown the company generated 2 8 million of ebitda and the company s net cash position net of debt improved by 5 3 million over the last three months to end the quarter at 20 2 million capital expenditures were 6 3 million this quarter as we added seven rigs that fit both our specialized and diversification strategies during the quarter we sold four rigs to local contractors in burkina faso and disposed of eighteen older inefficient underground rigs in line with our strategy of improving our underground fleet and services this brings the fleet total to 610 rigs added mr larocque we are continuing to make investments in innovation directed towards increased productivity safety and meeting customers demands we keep growing our fleet of computerized rigs as well as retrofitting some of our newer rigs with computerized consoles this falls in line with the enhancement of our recruiting and training systems as we bring in a new generation of employees while strengthening our customer service said mr larocque as we look forward the fundamentals driving the business continue to be encouraging for the coming quarter and into fiscal 2020 gold prices have increased recently and mineral reserves for gold and base metals continue to be depleted many industry experts expect that most base metals will face a significant deficit position in the next few years due to the continued production and high grading of mines combined with the lack of exploration work conducted to replace reserves given this situation most of our senior and intermediate customers have increased their exploration budgets for calendar 2019 and the demand for drilling services continues to increase during the quarter the company made the decision to close its operations in burkina faso and as such took a total charge of 8 1 million after tax this decision was based on the fact that this branch required significant additional investment to reach an acceptable return on investment at a time when political and security risks are increasing in that country the company recorded 6 9 million in restructuring charges consisting of a non cash write down of assets of 6 0 million related to vat receivable write off and impairment charges relating to property plant and equipment and inventory as well as net cash charges of 0 9 million for severance moving costs and lease termination also the company wrote down 1 2 million in deferred tax assets recorded in its deferred tax expense related to burkina faso the burkina faso operations represented approximately 2 of the total company revenue year to date finally we are pleased to be the recipient of the pdac safe day everyday gold award for the second consecutive year in recognition of our canadian crews having worked over 1 000 000 hours lost time injury free during 2017 our canadian crews have now worked more than 5 000 000 hours over four and a half years without a single lost time injury said denis larocque the safety and well being of our crews is our first and highest responsibility on every project said ben graham vice president hr safety we work hard to earn the trust and support of our crews and we are pleased to see their success recognized by a group of our clients and peers

contract drilling for companies primarily involved in mining and mineral exploration the company has operations in canada the united states mexico south america asia africa and europe 2 basis of presentation statement of compliance these interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with ias 34 interim financial reporting ias 34 as issued by the international accounting standards board iasb and using the accounting policies as outlined in the company s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended april 30 2018 except as noted in note 4 on february 28 2019 the board of directors authorized the financial statements for issue basis of consolidation these interim condensed consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the company control is achieved when the company is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated statements of operations from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate intra group transactions balances income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation where appropriate basis of preparation these interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared based on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value using the same accounting policies and methods of computation as presented in the company s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended april 30 2018 except as noted in note 4 3 application of new and revised ifrs the following iasb standards adopted as of may 1 2018 have had no significant impact on the company s interim condensed consolidated financial statements ifrs 2 share based payment ifrs 9 financial instruments ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers the company has not applied the following iasb standard that has been issued but is not yet effective ifrs 16 leases ifrs 16 ifrs 16 issued in january 2016 replaces ias 17 leases ifrs 16 specifies how to recognize measure present and disclose leases the standard provides a single lessee accounting model requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value lessor accounting remains substantially unchanged as they continue to classify leases as operating or finance ifrs 16 is effective for periods beginning on or after january 1 2019 the company has undertaken and completed a detailed review of existing contracts against the ifrs 16 criteria and has completed the calculation of lease liabilities for contracts that have been identified as containing right of use assets it is expected that a lease liability of approximately 3 million will be recognized on transition at may 1 2019 the company has elected to apply the modified transition approach whereby no restatement of comparative periods is required right of use assets will be recognized at the amount of the liability on transition leases with terms that end within 12 months of the mandatory transition date will be accounted for by the company as short term leases with payments made under the lease recognized as operating expenses it is expected that the transition to ifrs 16 will result in increases to assets and liabilities of approximately 3 million as well as increases of approximately 0 8 million to depreciation expense and 0 2 million to finance costs and a reduction of operating costs of approximately 1 million 4 changes in significant accounting policies ifrs 9 financial instruments ifrs 9 replacing ias 39 financial instruments recognition and measurement ias 39 includes finalized guidance on the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities impairment and hedge accounting the company adopted the new requirements on may 1 2018 by applying the requirements for classification and measurement including impairment retrospectively with no restatement of comparative periods financial instruments under ifrs 9 financial assets are classified and measured at amortized cost fair value through other comprehensive income fvtoci or fair value through profit or loss fvtpl and financial liabilities are classified and measured as amortized cost or fvtpl depending on the business model in which they are held and the characteristics of their contractual cash flows all of the company s financial assets and liabilities are measured at amortized cost impairment ifrs 9 replaces the incurred loss model in ias 39 with a forward looking expected credit loss ecl model since the company s trade receivables have a maturity of less than one year the company utilized a practical expedient available under the standard and estimated lifetime ecl using historical credit loss experiences resulting in a minimal impact on the company s financial statements hedge accounting as it was under ias 39 hedge accounting remains optional under ifrs 9 under ifrs 9 the effectiveness test has been replaced with the principle of an economic relationship retrospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is also no longer required the company s interest rate swap and share forward transaction hedges continue to qualify for hedge accounting under ifrs 9 and as a result the adoption of ifrs 9 did not have a significant impact on its interim condensed consolidated financial statements with respect to hedge accounting the three types of hedges cash flow fair value and net investment remain the same under ifrs 9 all of the company s hedges continue to be classified as fvtoci 5 key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with international financial reporting standards ifrs requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that are not readily apparent from other sources which affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets liabilities income and expenses actual results may differ from these estimates the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods significant areas requiring the use of management estimates relate to the useful lives of property plant and equipment for depreciation purposes property plant and equipment and inventory valuation determination of income and other taxes assumptions used in the compilation of share based payments fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business acquisitions amounts recorded as accrued liabilities and allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment testing of goodwill

cayman economic outlook 2019 address from the premier of the cayman islands hon alden mclaughlin mbe jp mla 28 february 2019 good morning my thanks to our hosts royal fidelity for this invitation to speak at what has become an important annual conference in the cayman business calendar i too wish to pay tribute to anwer sunderji former chairman and ceo of fidelity for many years he was the driving force of this conference and those who have been here before will understand how much he brought to this event and how we all looked forward to his political and economic insights and his wry humour as he addressed the conference each year governor i thank you for your kind words and as you will hear shortly from my presentation i very much agree that our economy is in great shape but let s also get the viewpoint of leading regional economist marla dukharan when she presented her annual january online video economic report on the state of caribbean economies in 2019 video shown i thank ms dukharan for continuing to acknowledge the hard work done by this government to create not only a strong fiscal climate but also one that is conducive to growth and investment and that brings benefits to caymanians ms dukharan also mentioned some challenges for us and i will speak to these later i will also later on provide a few statistics updated from those shown in the video as we gather to think about the global future economic outlook perhaps it is appropriate that you hear this morning from a politician after all it was a politician i greatly admire winston churchill britain s great war time prime minister who said politics is the ability to foretell what is going to happen tomorrow next week next month and next year and then to have the ability afterwards to explain why it didn t happen he may have made these remarks tongue in cheek but churchill certainly understood that in his time with changing world forces it was becoming more and more difficult to know with any degree of assurance what the future might bring the same holds even more true today this conference s organisers have captured that sentiment well by titling today s conference dynamic new world braving the turmoil i am not planning to dust off a crystal ball and look into the future with you today that is always a dangerous idea at an economic conference after all economists have correctly forecast at least nine of the last five recessions but neither am i planning to play it safe instead i will provide my thoughts on not only what we in the cayman islands need to keep doing to avoid the turmoil but also the things that we could consider doing to prepare ourselves for an increasingly dynamic world i will start with this observation in times of dynamic and profound change we should expect that there will be turmoil great change and turmoil are but different sides of the same coin whether the change is political economic or technological where there is great change we can expect turmoil turmoil defined not just as total disorder but also as upheaval agitation disruption or uncertainty the economic growth that the world has seen over the past 100 years has lifted millions out of poverty globally but it has also made the very rich even richer and highlighted a widening income disparity this has caused agitation and uncertainty in many countries consider the gilets jaunes protestors in france a new fuel tax has seemingly been the proverbial last straw that broke the camel s back and created an organic movement without a leader or a focus on any one particular cause but a movement that has certainly created economic social and political upheaval across france we have experienced great change in our islands over the past 50 years with the pace of change increasing at an ever faster rate and this has inevitably brought with it some agitation and uncertainty as caymanians have experienced tremendous economic growth but also significant and sustained levels of immigration and development that have not just brought new faces to cayman but are also changing the very face of our islands it is testament to the nature of our people that despite these immense changes cayman remains one of the most peaceful places on earth largely free from the racial ethnic and social tensions that plague much of the world consider just for a moment the political turmoil that is also impacting much larger countries and compare it to what we see in our small islands in the world s largest economy we ve seen political squabbling principally over a border wall and immigration shut down the very business of government for well over a month causing real problems to both those who receive public services and the civil servants who provide them in the result some 800 000 public servants were left furloughed or required to work without pay in contrast cayman continues to value the huge contribution that civil servants make in our society while we expect ever higher levels of efficiency and performance we recognize and reward their service and whilst we have some tensions around increasing immigration we also understand the need to welcome people here to help us drive our economy and build a nation and because of that our population has grown by over 700 in my lifetime with over 130 nationalities living amongst us in relative harmony we are a veritable little united nations in the uk brexit is revealing what has long been disguised fundamental fault lines that run right through the core of the political establishment again it is not simply within the political sphere that the impact is felt the british people feel it as well one of britain s most influential think tanks the institute for government in its annual report on the performance of the uk government concluded that all the time and effort that has gone into the political wrangling over brexit has squeezed government s capacity to manage public services and major projects and to bring about improvement in them in cayman by comparison political differences have been put aside in the creation of a unity government that i have the privilege to lead a coalition of the two main political parties and a number of independents the result has been a strong government that generates good decisions and is able to focus its attention on improving public services and delivering major projects in venezuela we see a once proud country with some of the largest oil reserves in the world become crippled under the weight of economic and political mismanagement its people face a humanitarian crisis suffering from a shortage in food supplies and medicines and skyrocketing inflation making their currency useless as a store of value the impact is also being felt by its neighbors including those in the caribbean as many thousands of venezuelans leave the country in desperation in cayman we have had successive governments that for 60 years have generally managed our economy and finances well and despite the many changes here there is political and social stability we are no utopia as i mentioned at last year s conference we face our own challenges but by and large we have done exceedingly well for a small nation with little in the way of natural resources i mention these things to illustrate the fact that in the present day context the political and social stability we are enjoying in cayman is more the exception than the norm there are two important lessons in this the first is that stability cannot be taken for granted we as politicians particularly those within the unity government need to continue to work tirelessly to maintain stability for the good of our country and our people the second is that political instability should we ever allow it to creep in has real world consequences that none of us want to see in our islands and so we must be vigilant and by we i mean government as well as private citizens and business we must not only appreciate the jewel that we have created here but we must jealously guard and protect it cayman s political stability is bearing fruit you can see that in our headline economic indicators annualised real terms gdp growth for the whole of 2018 is expected to close at 3 4 this is on par with our largest trading partner the usa so we have closed out the old year and started the new with continuing strong economic performance we have a strong economy that continues to generate jobs and opportunities for caymanians the fall 2018 labour force survey will be completed and released soon but preliminary results indicate that overall unemployment taking into consideration everyone legally resident here has dropped from 4 9 in fall 2017 to 2 9 in fall 2018 as significant as that number may be to me as premier the more important number is that of caymanian unemployment which has dropped from 7 3 in fall 2017 to 4 6 in fall 2018 this is the lowest level of caymanian unemployment in more than a decade and is far lower than the peak caymanian unemployment level of 10 5 that we saw in 2012 political stability then has assisted in creating strong economic performance that in turn is sustaining confidence among businesses and investors about our future and their confidence is the foundation for maintaining growth and creating further opportunities for caymanians perhaps the most tangible and visible expression of confidence in the long term prospects of our economy is the growth that is going on in our development and construction sector this was one of the key factors driving the high level of overall gdp growth in our economy that i mentioned earlier annualised growth in the construction sector reached 8 9 for the first half of 2018 this growth in development is also driving an increase in imports with more than one billion dollars worth of goods having been imported into the cayman islands last year in large part so far i have been focusing on what we are doing and must keep doing to secure and underpin our success this conference though is about looking to the future and in keeping with the theme i will consider what else we can do to prepare ourselves for the new dynamic world we face in considering the future we should not just look at the most careful and predictable of scenarios but at what exciting possibilities may be available to us if we are only more ambitious and innovative in our approach if we are to maintain and indeed improve our place in the world far into the future then we will need to be bold and to think big in my view it only makes sense to think about bigger and bolder steps if we are confident in the foundations that are needed to support them if the economic fundamentals are sound then risk is more manageable and the confidence will be there to fund the investments that will be required equally it also only makes sense to think of such steps if they will bring real and tangible benefits to the caymanian people ours is a proud history of willingness to innovate and to support inward investment but it has always been done on the basis that there is a meaningful return for our people you don t grow an economy for the sake of business you do it to provide opportunities for your people in terms of cayman s future prospects for growth and development the fundamentals remain solid the factors that have fueled the success of cayman s economy continue to do so despite challenges for financial services the bedrock foundation of our status as a uk overseas territory and our legal system based on english common law combined with the choice we have made to remain a tax neutral jurisdiction with no direct taxation remains a fundamentally attractive proposition for businesses and investors alike the ability of the industry to innovate and the willingness of government to combine a business friendly environment with appropriate but proportionate regulation will continue to maintain our competitive advantage so long as there is a level playing field despite the challenges that our financial services industry is facing i am of the view that we can withstand these and continue to grow from strength to strength ms dukharan noted one such challenge in her video when she referred to initiatives by the european union and their concern justified or not with countries that have no tax or low tax regimes for those of you unaware the cayman islands along with over 20 other countries are currently undergoing yet another review at the end of which the eu will either give us their good housekeeping badge of approval or black list us as having a harmful tax regime the concern presumably is that low or no tax regimes are harmful whilst presumably high tax regimes are not this is never though simply a technical exercise in the end the eu makes political judgments my government has therefore played its part in trying to influence those judgments by engaging with the eu this engagement continues and we along with the 20 other jurisdictions undergoing the eu review process await the decision of the eu economic and financial affairs council ecofin meeting on march 12th i repeat here what i have said elsewhere i remain confident that if the eu review process is fair and not overtly political we will not end up on any blacklist but we know that this is but one challenge there are more to come i remain confident however that we can manage that future uncertainty and that by working together government and the industry we can keep pace with changing global standards while preserving the special characteristics of this jurisdiction that make it an attractive place to do business in the first place at the same time our tourism industry continues to flourish with record numbers of tourists arriving at our newly renovated airport and at our seaport this growth will continue because we will continue to develop our world class tourism product this government has already been bold in not only modernising and tripling the size of our international airport but also in thinking of the future and committing to building the much needed cruise piers that will serve us today but also protect our key cruise tourism business into the future the immediate economic prospects for cayman are indeed therefore strong while there are uncertainties and threats i believe that both our financial services industry and tourism have a positive outlook and we can continue to deliver sustainable levels of growth however we do need to think longer term about what will drive future growth in the cayman economy the more diverse the cayman economy the more resilient it becomes diversifying our economic base also creates new kinds of opportunities for our people both as entrepreneurs and in the labour market and so we have attracted and continue to attract new types of technology and knowledge based businesses cayman enterprise city our well established special economic zone continues to attract new kinds of businesses to our islands notably internet and technology businesses including fintech and biotech newcomer tech cayman brings together caymanian business acumen with established us technology entrepreneurship and is gearing up to create new forms of digital and knowledge based business here health city cayman islands utilises some of the most modern technology available anywhere it is the first hospital in the english speaking caribbean to use robotic navigation for joint replacements the first to install artificial hearts and much more this is a key part of our medical tourism platform and we continue to look to diversify financial services more recently by attracting more reinsurance companies into cayman taking advantage of disruption in other jurisdictions to create new opportunities for us but growth too brings its own set of challenges that we must manage if we are to continue to grow it is my view that we need to make really creative use of the scarce space we have and despite the huge strides we have made in recent years we must improve our future infrastructure particularly our road network the government is currently consulting on a draft national planning framework that begins to look at some of the crucial land use choices that will face us in the years ahead i support that consultation process and i hope everyone will want to take part in the debate however the planning framework considers a relatively short time horizon and inevitably therefore this causes participants to focus on marginal or incremental change this has traditionally been the caymanian way we have taken a pragmatic approach and looked to make relatively small changes over time as circumstances have changed over a period of decades we have gradually allowed taller buildings as the demand for property for development increased this demand continues and indeed strengthens and with the growth we are now experiencing there is already pressure to go beyond the current maximum of 10 stories above ground level i pose this as a series of questions that we as a nation should now consider do we want to continue with the approach of incremental change or is now the time for us to think bigger and act more boldly when it comes to our land use and building heights if so how high and where do we want future development to be allowed last week speaking to the chamber of commerce i discussed the work government is doing in partnership with business and the wider community to revitalize our capital george town i encouraged all involved to think creatively about how we might best use the space in george town and the uses to which it might be put while i personally favour mixed use development across the redevelopment area this is a genuinely inclusive process and the government is willing to listen positively to the ideas people will bring forward the government has already removed many of the constraints that have prevented innovative planning approaches in george town in the past we would be willing to look further and remove other obstacles such as restrictions on building heights in order to see the kind of positive redevelopment we want in our capital the other obvious example of the potential for taller buildings is along the seven mile beach corridor all the messages about the strength of the tourism market and the luxury housing market suggest that there may be no obvious limit to building height in terms of what the market will bear the question becomes then what is our community willing to see happen the answer to that crucially will depend upon the benefits that any such development brings i said earlier that if we are to take bold steps then there must be clear and tangible benefits for caymanians if development is seen to be just about luxury hotels and accommodation for rich foreigners then our community will rightly reject it if on the other hand it is not just seen to be but actually is about the delivery of improvements in infrastructure and in the economic and employment opportunities and the social conditions of caymanians then i believe this is a debate we should be willing to engage in by way of a kick start to that debate i can say today that representatives from dart enterprises have recently spoken to government regarding plans for a landmark development within camana bay that includes an iconic tower that would greatly exceed the current development height limits creating a new skyline that would be recognizable the world over with this development they will commit to investing in excess of an additional 1 ½ billion into the cayman islands economy not just in the development itself but in critical infrastructure improvements and supporting workforce development we know that future development along seven mile beach is inevitable in fact the new wave of redevelopment started some years ago and is now accelerating with the demolition of condominium complexes built in the 70 s and 80 s and the construction of new 10 story luxury residences in their stead the question is whether we wish to continue to limit the type of development in the seven mile beach corridor in line with the status quo gradually ratcheting up building heights and redeveloping existing sites to take advantage of changing regulations if so the result will be more of the same in terms of what seven mile beach is slowly becoming just a higher wall of glass and concrete than we have at present and which continues to take over the whole beach perhaps we can be content with this and the economic activity this incremental and ad hoc approach will create over the next ten or so years but what about the next decade and the ones after that this approach is unlikely to ensure that as a country we maximize the full economic benefits of the seven mile beach corridor the alternative is to be bold and look at something different a more proactive approach that considers taller buildings and that conserves ever scarcer beach land on the important seven mile beach strip taller buildings but in particular hotel developments that generate much more income and economic activity for our islands than other types of development do taller buildings that will require developers to give back more of the beach and to have farther setbacks creating a large open space between the building and the beach i believe we must at least take a long hard look at the potential for the kind of tower dart is proposing the development would necessarily be mixed use with hotel residential retail and entertainment spaces the potential economic benefits are considerable more and different construction jobs during the build phase new business and job opportunities for caymanians to follow as new tourism and entertainment markets are developed to meet the needs of a different kind of tourist and a different kind of resident but we must also consider that such a large scale development project would create hundreds of jobs and economic opportunities and thus would also help to serve as a much needed buffer over the next few years when the inevitable next recession occurs as part of considering this or any similar proposal any developer will also need to bring forward a significant programme of infrastructure investment this would necessarily include road improvements but also potentially social infrastructure improvements to cayman s schools or investment in affordable housing for local people for example and so as a caymanian i am excited about the idea as premier i am determined that we engage positively with dart and with any other developers who might want to bring forward such ideas to see what might be possible there is an awfully long way to go before such ideas might come to fruition but now is the time for a national debate the plan cayman process gives us a timely and appropriate vehicle to have that national debate the next phase of consultation in that process will be on an area plan for the seven mile beach corridor and the potential for a landmark development can be addressed as part of that consultation i will leave it to dart to outline their ideas in more detail and as i have said i would welcome others coming forward with other proposals i wish to make it clear that there has been no commitment from the government to dart or anyone else at this stage but we do believe we must be willing at least to consider the proposal the renowned architect adrian smith noted in an article on tall buildings that the landmarks they create often over time become a symbol of national pride and identity such developments create new types of jobs and economic benefit as well as serving as an iconic tourist attraction in their own right think for a minute the impact that the burj khalifa which was designed by adrian smith has made for dubai or indeed the impact of the eiffel tower on paris and indeed france as a whole hang on before people start taking to social media to decry this idea hear me out many people here will know that gustave eiffel was commissioned to design his iconic tower for the 1889 world s fair in paris what you may not know is that the proposed tower was immediately controversial indeed 300 members of the paris artistic and cultural elite signed a petition to the fair s organizing committee asking for the project to be abandoned yes petitions against progress were a thing even then but i digress describing themselves as passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of paris they protested with all their strength and indignation against what they described as this useless and monstrous eiffel tower that they claimed would be antithetical to the traditions of the city and would overshadow existing cultural sites i can just imagine those in cayman who will make very similar if not pretty much identical objections to any proposals for a major development here yet now the eiffel tower is not just part of the paris skyline it is the very symbol of the city itself could we in cayman imagine a similarly iconic structure here that would come not to threaten our cultural heritage but to reimagine it and to symbolize the bold future we want for our islands and our people i have no doubt that this last section of my speech this morning will be highly controversial and will ignite considerable debate if so good that is my intention because this is a debate that the country needs to have there is much that is within our grasp if only we are bold and the decisions we make will have profound impact on the long term economic outlook of these islands it comes down to a matter of choice about the future we want for ourselves and these islands brutus in shakespeare s julius caesar put it this way there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune omitted all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries on such a full sea are we now afloat and we must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures

atlantic power management team the numbers for the fourth quarter and full year are provided in the press release the presentation and the prepared remarks which were posted to the website last evening please review those materials instead of reading off those results this morning i would like to talk about the state of the business in a bit of a year end review format following my remarks we ll take your questions at appel this week we announced that irving gerstein will retire from the board at the conclusion of the annual meeting this june in toronto irving has served atlantic power with professionalism and grace for nearly 15 years i have really enjoyed working with them i will miss his presence on the board we also announced that kevin howell will become chairman assuming he is reelected to the board kevin has extensive power and industry experience as an executive board member and board chair kevin shares our passion for a culture of safety frugality and service leadership in other people news we ve added two new vp commercial development hires bringing that group to four including evp joe cofelice this group has been focused on extending in restructuring our ppas the oefc settlement last year was an idea that originated this group and it led to a good economic result more recently this group has led the effort on asset m a with the south carolina biomass acquisition and they are continuing to work on other opportunities given our stronger balance sheet we are now a credible buyer of assets into the hundreds of millions of dollars finding adequate returns is the key on the balance sheet as noted in the financial results release we paid a 100 million of debt we repaid 100 million of debt in 2018 and plan to payoff another 86 million in 2019 we continue to strengthen the balance sheet to provide downside protection and to enhance our ability to play offence on capital allocation on capital allocation we have slightly more than 190 million of liquidity we ve had lots of good uses for our excess cash on and off the balance sheet over the past three years we have bought 36 million worth of common shares at an average price of 2 27 a share 23 million of preferred shares at a 38 discount to par and committed nearly 26 million for the koma kulshan in south carolina acquisition we will continue to rank order the risk reward from the various uses of capital available to us and then try to do the most rationale thing in capital allocation we are price to value driven so we don t have any set targets on how much capital to deploy in each bucket on company position we think we re well positioned now for various economic or industry scenarios if we have deflation or a market crash our ppa revenue will allow us to continue you paying down debt we would also be able to allocate our capital to assets that would very likely have higher returns in those generally available in today s low rate high asset price market environment it would be wrong to cheer for severe market dislocation but we would be well positioned and driving the work in the mornings with a alacrity in that scenario if we get a breakout of inflation at some point then interest rates and discount rates might rise that might lower the value of existing asset however that might be partially offset by higher power prices should they move up along with inflation higher power prices would improve the recontracting outlook in addition over time we will have more merchant generation available to sell out the markets if there is a pickup in prices lastly we have very little interest rate exposure on our debt if we get neither deflation nor inflation but rather a continuation of the current environment we plan to move forward on our path of grinding on cost and debt operating safely and efficiently and looking opportunistically for cigar butt investments turning from the macro environment to the power sector specifically if we continue to see aggressive additions of wind and solar to the grid we are likely to see great prices rise due to integration cost resulting in higher prices for end use customers and negative implications for electricity demand our belief is that the observers and market participants may be underestimating the integration cost of renewables and the cost of battery storage the retirement of nuclear and coal capacity helps the overall supply and demand picture the lack of strong capacity markets however is not good for natural gas plants at some point however flexible and please ccgt plants might see a pickup in value if their intermittent power and battery economics disappoint conversely any carbon regimes would be helpful to the value of our non carbon emitting hydro facilities higher gas prices would likely benefit our hydro facilities as well if we see a move to a more balanced approach our ccgts would likely benefit our biomass fleet has an attractive remaining ppa life on average seven years or more than nine years excluding williams lake so they re a good source of cash flow to continue in the present environment with our debt reduction and growth efforts we like our position in the near term having ample ppa coverage and in longer term being a potential hedge against inflation and was a fairly balanced portfolio of power technologies on growth after years of internal focus we re now in approved position with regard to cost and debt and can look more credibly at asset m a our koma kulshan and biomass acquisitions are one result of that positioning we are considering other potential acquisitions of various types we have nothing to report today but our deal flow and acquisition activities are picking up nicely we ve done a good job of restructuring our business there may be opportunities to merge where those skills would be useful in a combined entity we also have a strong operations expertise and that core competency has made us a more confident buyer of biomass plants as one example we re small enough that we can look at bilateral deals and not chase auctions we can also look at deals that are too small to move the needle at bigger public companies all in all we are confident but not complacent about our financial operational and strategic positioning in this market and in scenarios where we see dramatic economic market or regulatory breaks in one direction or another we are ready to take questions now operator questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from nelson ng of rbc capital markets please go ahead nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst great thanks good morning everyone james j moore jr president and chief executive officer good morning nelson nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst my first question relates to m a you mentioned that you re looking more actively at acquisition opportunities and also biomass what is your like what s your sweet spot in terms of acquisition size and what s the range of project size you think you can do james j moore jr president and chief executive officer well we on the smaller end we got the koma kulshan in south carolina deals and then at the higher end we ve got a couple of hundred million dollars of liquidity and then obviously we can look at financing acquisitions but we are going to be very opportunistic i think one of our competitive advantages is we re small enough that we can be a bit idiosyncratic and be disciplined and just look for the best deals available so whether it s biomass or some other technology whatever the contract length is we can get in here and be pretty nimble and i think we ll get some bilateral deals done over the years but we don t have any set targets that we re looking at nelson nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst and in terms of characteristics of your targets is there a minimum contract length you re looking at james j moore jr president and chief executive officer no no minimum contract length no maximum no specific technology we re just we re deal guys so we re looking for the best deals we can find and internally we always think of our hurdle rate as the press which we bought it 11 and again a little bit more even and that s a cash return so when we look at a 30 year pro forma irr that we consider that to kind of be a hurdle rate we re not very enthusiastic about merchant in this environment i think down the road merchant may actually be a good place to be and gas may end up having some values in areas that have over integrated intermittent power and underestimated the storage costs but we re creating merchant as our ppas run off the gas fleet so we don t really have to go out and buy anybody else s merchant we ve got our own nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst okay and then just i guess taking the i guess other side of the argument in terms of potentially buying assets have you considered potentially selling assets especially assets that are such high valuations in this market particularly hydro james j moore jr president and chief executive officer yeah we look at those things all the time since i ve been here we ve continuously looked at selling individual assets and fleets of assets and doing tax free spin offs and joint ventures and we ve looked at selling the company and merging the company and buying assets and we are just disciplined value investors so we re at the right price everything is for sale and at the right price we re going to be very enthusiastic buyers we re just focused on price to value and i think we don t want to be overly tied down to particular themes the old charlie munger says they never did strategic plans because you end up handcuffing yourself and missing opportunities and what he said is their big competitive advantage has been every day they come to work and they rank order the returns available to them and then they try to do the most intelligent thing they can with their capital and that s all we re trying to do we re trying to be as rational as possible for the shareholders nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst okay and then just switching gears to williams lake i think in the 2019 bridge you re expecting a reduction in the ebitda of about 11 million so that implies an overall negative 3 million contribution from williams lake i thought the short term ppa is a positive margin contributor so could you just provide a bit more color as to why it s been negative for the year i m just wondering whether post ppa expiration are you expecting just like i guess cost to maintain that asset terrence ronan executive vice president chief financial officer sure nelson tts terry i ll take that one so last year 2018 the ebitda was about 8 million and if you recall the ppa expired at the end of march so we had the higher priced ppa in there for three months and the short term extension was modestly positive so as we look at projections for 2019 we still feel that the short term extension is modestly positive it expires in june it could be extended till september or even longer at bc hydro s request but right now the reason you see that negative is because we assume on a conservative basis that a short term extension ends in june and then we have shutdown expenses including some severance and inventory adjustments that would lead you to that negative 3 million number that you mentioned now we are hopeful that that s not going to happen we ve got some positive news on williams lake recently but right now what s the budget has nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst i see that makes sense are you able to give any more clarity on the timing like obviously you re in discussions with the government i guess right now i presume and you re hoping to get something finalized sometime this year but are you able to give a bit more clarification in terms of timing joseph e cofelice executive vice president commercial development good morning nelson this is joe really we can t the report was issued and we expect to engage with bc hydro in the next couple of months and we re pretty confident that will occur based on the communications that are taking place how long the negotiation will take we will see but the bottom line there is that it s the report by the government is it s good news it s a positive step we ve been struggling over the last couple of years to create a path of for negotiation of a long term extension and discuss that for us but having said that we don t know what terms would be an offer ph until we get something done it s not done nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst got it ok just one last question in terms of the ontario facilities obviously you have a 15 year contract at tunis but you don t have a contract for kapuskasing and north bay is there something that makes the tunis facility more attractive than kapuskasing and north bay in terms of maybe it s location i guess is there a reason why tunis has a 15 year contract whereas i guess it s more difficult to get a contract for the other terrence ronan executive vice president chief financial officer what timing when the tunis contract expired we were able to go out and get possibly the last contract that was done before they shut down contracting with ipps in ontario and of course the inaudible contract expired later and when it came time to negotiate those the contracts we no longer are at them so what timing than anything else nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst okay got it i ll leave it there thanks james j moore jr president and chief executive officer thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from rupert merer of national bank please go ahead rupert merer national bank analyst good morning everyone james j moore jr president and chief executive officer good morning rupert rupert merer national bank analyst with your growth in biomass in the southern us wondering if you could talk us through the potential of that market and maybe talk about the availability of fiber mobility to contract fiber james j moore jr president and chief executive officer sure i ll start on the on the market itself and may ask dan little bit help on the fiber question if you compare the biomass opportunities to say natural gas opportunities or wind opportunities there s a limited universe of projects available and that universe becomes even more limited when you find a minimum ppa term to them because unlike other assets biomass plants are generally not plants that you want to take into a merchant market you want contract cover on them and so what we do is we basically look at the market we prioritize the targets by ppa cover and in the global market to those people i think that it s right now there are some opportunities out there that we were engaged in discussions with people we will see where those discussions go and basically what we do is we make sure that these parties that own these assets are aware that we re a buyer of these assets and we benefit from the fact that there s a limited number of interested parties generally in these assets when they do become available and we have the ability to move quickly when these companies are seeking quick monetization so that s that i ll just make one point on wood supply i mean when you look at markets like georgia and south carolina it s pretty considerable toward the fiber there i think georgia may be the largest market in the us as a source of fiber so we re looking at targets we do spend a lot of time evaluating some fiber and that s also important from the standpoint of ppa extensions we have target projects like the locations like williams lake where you have strong community support for the plant because the plant is so important to the local inaudible and if you ve read any of the recent press in williams lake you ll see how beneficial that can be rupert merer national bank analyst are you seeing any risk from the on the fiber supply from the pellet producers and growing demand for wood pellets that are shipped internationally dan rorabaugh senior vice president operations there certainly is competition from them but what they tend not to use is the sort of the bulk in the other parts of inaudible less desirable and what we re finding is there is a lot of urban wood waste supply whether it s because they re doing a development and sort of clearing loss or whether we re getting these further residual from sawmills and even from these pellet plants so we re just we don t look for the big contracts our philosophy is we don t want anybody now more than say 10 of our supply in any plant so we go with the large variety of smaller suppliers and that s been consistent throughout our fleet rupert merer national bank analyst and can you remind me of your south carolina facility how you re managing fiber there and of course of the facilities that you are looking to acquire do you have long term contracts on supply of fiber james j moore jr president and chief executive officer i think it s almost all purchase orders with smaller suppliers rupert merer national bank analyst okay very good i ll leave it there thank you james j moore jr president and chief executive officer thanks rupert operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to jim moore for any closing remarks james j moore jr president and chief executive officer okay thanks everybody we

zhun xu is an economics professor at howard university in washington d c his most recent book is from commune to capitalism how china s peasants lost collective farming and gained urban poverty monthly review press 2018 economic growth has arguably been the first and foremost issue of capitalist development from classical political economy to more recent economic studies most discussions on development boil down to the nature and characteristics of the ruling class given that the ruling class controls the surplus of society how the surplus is used whether it is invested consumed or simply wasted is at its discretion the effective utilization of surplus implies a reasonable rate of capital accumulation and economic development in 1957 in the political economy of growth paul baran made a seminal contribution to our understanding of the connection between economic surplus a concept he introduced into the development discussion and growth he argued that even poor countries still retain considerable economic surplus beyond the national essential consumption and that the way ruling classes use that surplus shapes nations development trajectories by eliminating unnecessary upper class consumption and the inefficiencies of the market economy among other factors a better organized society like socialism would make it possible for all nations to grow and develop 1 to draw on an example from chinese economic history according to economist victor lippit the per capita income in china was roughly the same in 1933 as it was in 1953 the saving rate however increased from 1 7 percent in 1933 to 20 percent in 1953 this steep increase was achieved with substantially better living standards for ordinary people the new revolutionary society lippit argued was able to simultaneously eliminate unnecessary elite consumption and waste and increase popular consumption and investment 2 from a different perspective keynes and post keynesian economics have also made significant contributions toward our understanding of capitalist investment behavior particularly with the concept of animal spirits 3 essentially animal spirits are the capitalist psychology of surplus utilization the link between expected profits and planned investment a rise in animal spirits can promote accumulation and growth at a given rate of profit the idea of economic surplus is often overlooked in neoclassical economics for example the concept of the poverty trap sees virtually no way out of poverty except through an exogenous shock in terms of supply poverty means lack of education and health care which could lead to lower labor productivity in terms of demand poverty means a small market and lack of effective demand when some neoclassical theories start to recognize the possibility of self sustained development in poor countries they jump to the other extreme relying on ahistorical assumptions about the nature of the capitalist class one illustration of this is the influential dual sector model commonly known as the lewis model after its creator william arthur lewis when proposed in the 1950s the model correctly argued that given the low consumption levels and low wages of migrant labor from the underdeveloped countryside the urban capitalists could receive a higher than average return from their investments lewis assumed that high profits would lead to continued investment and that the whole economy would grow as a consequence 4 however in reality there is no guarantee that capitalists will be willing to spend all these profits and superprofits on capital accumulation the question of surplus utilization is highly relevant to more developed countries as well for example in the last decades in the united states the decoupling of profit and capital accumulation is evident while overall after tax corporate profit as a share of gross domestic product gdp has increased from about 4 percent in the mid 1980s to about 9 percent in last few years net investment as a share of gdp has declined from about 5 6 percent to about 2 percent during the same time 5 the disconnection between profit and investment has been particularly acute since the 2007 09 economic crisis other advanced countries such as the united kingdom and japan have also seen similar patterns with downsizing stock buybacks and lack of interest in investment or simply the capitalists investment strike 6 in recent years there has been an ongoing discussion about the slowing of economic growth rates among major capitalist economies mainstream economists are increasingly recognizing the relevance of stagnation to capitalism as examples robert gordon explains the decline of u s growth through supply side factors like lack of great technological breakthroughs while paul krugman and lawrence summers attribute the problem to lack of effective demand 7 however as pointed out by hans despain few mainstream scholars acknowledge that stagnation is a tendency embedded in the capitalist system 8 marxian literature has long emphasized the importance of secular stagnation in advanced capitalism in his famous pamphlet on imperialism a century ago vladimir lenin argued that imperialist economies based on monopoly capital inevitably engenders a tendency of stagnation and decay 9 using the concept of surplus absorption baran and paul sweezy argued that capitalism required surplus waste such as through the sales effort and war as there tended to be a shortage of consumer demand and investment 10 sweezy maintained that stagnation since the 1930s was only interrupted by the second world war and the postwar economic expansion 11 the forces that brought the economic boom and a strong incentive to invest created overcapacity and in turn undermined their original contributions fred magdoff and john bellamy foster among others have contended that financialization as another major form of waste simply postponed the stagnation through limited employment and wealth effect while intensifying the contradictions of capitalism 12 the marxian tradition studies the dynamics of development and stagnation in both developing and developed economies but one major difficulty is providing a consistent measure of surplus to compare across time and space particularly to calculate the potential surplus from eliminating irrational and wasteful organization and unemployment in different contexts to aid in this end baran himself provided a number of different concepts of surpluses here i use lippit s approach to focus on a narrower and more straightforward version of surplus that is the difference between national output and essential social consumption to take it further if labor income is more or less in line with essential consumption we can approximate economic surplus by property share of income rent profit interest of course this approximation will tend to create an upward bias in developing countries as the labor incomes are often insufficient to meet basic needs it could also give rise to downward bias in developed countries as labor incomes exceed essential consumption due to high salary jobs in certain occupations all the same the property share approximation can still give a roughly accurate measure of the historical trend of economic surplus another approach is to approximate surplus using the top income share if we assume that in every society the essential consumption level is around the medium income level then the share of the top 10 percent of national income could serve as an estimated measure of the difference between national income and essential consumption the surplus this approach also comes with potentially skewing tendencies for example if income distribution is extremely unequal then a top 10 percent income share could overstate the surplus if income distribution tends to be very equal then a top 10 percent share will underestimate the size of the surplus still top income shares provide useful information and can serve as a cross check method to study the utilization of surplus or the animal spirits of the ruling class i compare the size of surplus and gross capital formation in a variety of countries starting from the mid nineteenth century to measure it i use the baran ratio defined as the ratio of investment to surplus for example relatively high baran ratios indicate that the ruling class is interested in capital accumulation while persistently low and or decreasing baran ratios imply a gradual transition to slow accumulation and stagnation my results provide strong support for the secular stagnation thesis the baran ratios for major capitalist economies such as britain and germany were low and stable from the mid nineteenth century to early twentieth century in the post second world war years the baran ratios increased historically among both developed and developing countries while the neoliberal era saw a dramatic decline in the baran ratios of most economies there are still considerable variations across the globe in recent years the baran ratios of developed countries have tended to stabilize around pre second world war lows while the ratios of china and india remain relatively high the empirical evidence shows that slow capital accumulation and growth is an inherent feature of contemporary capitalism measuring economic surplus and the baran ratio ideally economic surplus could be calculated as the residual of national income deducting social essential consumption however this is often impossible due to lack of data alternative methods include utilizing property share of gdp which equals one minus labor share and the top income research pioneered by thomas piketty this is particularly helpful when the labor share data is missing in this article i have used the top 10 percent share of the national income as a proxy for surplus other top income shares are often not available for most countries in the sample as a reliability check i then examine the difference between the estimates from the essential consumption approach and the two aforementioned alternative approaches since there are considerable differences between the developing and developed worlds data from both china and the united states is used for simplicity i assume that the median personal income in the united states is about the same as the country s essential consumption level china is a little more complicated taking into account the persistent rural urban income gap i assume that urban residents essential consumption is the same as median income and the rural residents essential consumption is 60 percent that of the urban residents 13 the surplus is then calculated as the share of gdp in both countries after essential consumption is subtracted chart 1 presents the estimates of surplus with essential consumption and the other two methods which show no persistent distortions for 1985 to 2014 all three u s estimates show very similar patterns panel a in the chinese case panel b the three estimates differ to varying degrees but share the same trend over time the alternative approaches may have underestimated the level of surplus which would lead to higher baran ratios but this potential bias should not affect the ratios overall trends therefore both property and top income share approaches seem to be fairly reliable estimates of the level of economic surplus in a country chart 1 alternative approaches of surplus measurement sources for the united states median personal income data is from the federal reserve economic data fred federal reserve bank of st louis 1975 2015 and census bureau 1955 75 property share data is calculated based on the labor share from the international labour organization ilo database for china the median income data is from the china statistical yearbook from various years property share data is based on labor share estimates in hao qi for the united states median personal income data is from the federal reserve economic data fred federal reserve bank of st louis 1975 2015 and census bureau 1955 75 property share data is calculated based on the labor share from the international labour organization ilo database for china the median income data is from thefrom various years property share data is based on labor share estimates in hao qi the labor share question in china doctoral dissertation university of massachusetts amherst 2015 also see qi s january 2014 article in mr top 10 percent income share data for both countries is from the world wealth and income database the next step in this exercise is to calculate the baran ratio or how much surplus is being employed as capital accumulation based on the above we can simply divide the investment share by the level of surplus also as share in gdp 14 due to a lack of annual data only select data points are calculated for pre 1970s series a higher or lower baran ratio means more or less efficient use of surplus and capital accumulation ratios tend to fall between zero and one although they can exceed one chart 2 presents three advanced countries that have longer data series despite being the first major capitalist country britain s baran ratio was fairly low throughout the second half of the nineteenth century this suggests that the british ruling class was not very interested in capital accumulation and spent a huge portion of their surplus on unproductive purposes germany tended more toward accumulation and rapidly caught up with britain during the late nineteenth century as its baran ratio was more than double that of the british for most of the time france in contrast ran somewhat in between britain and germany on the whole these early capitalist economies spent around 20 40 percent of their surplus on capital accumulation in the pre second world war era interestingly under the nazi regime the german capitalist class actually was less inclined to accumulate than during the weimar republic or the bismarck era chart 2 baran ratios in britain germany and france sources capital formation data between 1850 and 1970 are based on b r mitchell ed european historical statistics 1750 1970 london macmillan 1975 capital formation data from after 1970 is from the world bank database property share data from before 1970 is based on table a49 in thomas piketty and gabriel zucman databook for capital is back wealth income ratios in rich countries 1700 2010 paris school of economics 2013 available at post 1970 data is based on labor share estimates from the ilo data on the top 10 percent income share is from the world wealth and income database for france gross fixed capital in gdp was used to proxy gross capital formation before 1970 j j carré p dubois and e malinvaud trans john p hatfield french economic growth 117 the gross capital formation data of france in 1900 is missing so the 1896 value is used instead notes for simplicity and due to available data the property share method was used for britain before 1962 and an average value of the two approaches after that year similarly the top income approach was used for france before 1960 and the average value after that the property share approach was used for germany before 1992 and the average value after that this is obviously very different from the scenarios starting at the end of the second world war when capitalist psychology of surplus utilization the link between expected profits and planned investment saw a huge boost between the mid 1940s and mid 1970s the three countries baran ratios climbed rapidly at their high points britain spent more than 70 percent france spent about 80 percent and west germany spent even more of their surpluses on investment following the golden age the baran ratios steadily declined throughout the 1980s from the late 1990s to the present the baran ratios seem to have stabilized around values that correspond to their pre second world war levels ranging from 40 to 60 percent it is abundantly clear that except in a short post second world war period with active regulation and intervention capitalist classes at least in the developed countries tend to shy away from investment and only spent less than half of the available surplus on capital accumulation in other words the currently recognized disconnect between profit and investment is a long business tradition for capitalists notably in the context of the pre second world war world a baran ratio of somewhere between 20 and 40 percent may still have been substantially higher than that of a typical developing country according to lippit china in 1933 had no less than 30 percent of national income as surplus while it only invested 1 7 percent of its net domestic product 15 this implies that the baran ratio for china was about 6 percent this dynamic gives insight into why capitalist classes in developed countries were arguably considered more progressive in comparison to the comprador ruling class of the developing countries they were much more dutifully fulfilling their job of capital accumulation let us now turn to the baran ratios for other developed and developing countries first of all according to chart 3 the more advanced capitalist economies experienced a swift descent in their baran ratios beginning in the 1980s a descent that has been slowing since the late 1990s and seems to have more or less stabilized for the fifteen european union countries the baran ratio dropped from about 90 percent to about 55 percent while the u s figure fell from more than 70 percent to 40 percent chart 3 baran ratio developed economies sources capital formation data is from the world bank database labor share estimates are from the ilo and fred federal reserve bank of st louis u s top 10 percent income share data is from the world wealth and income database notes taiwan estimates are based on the top income approach south korea estimates are based on the property share approach and japan estimates are the result of an average value of both approaches other high economies in chart 3 such as japan south korea and taiwan used to have some form of industrial policy when they were quickly growing in the 1970s these economies had impressive baran ratios of over 100 percent thus the capitalist classes in these places tended to invest as much surplus as possible even by a reduction in social essential consumption this period of high accumulation came to an end in the 1980s and the baran ratios have declined to around 60 80 percent still on average this group of countries have higher baran ratios than u s or eu economies among the developing countries typical latin american economies such as brazil suffer from chronic slow growth and accumulation as can been seen from chart 4 unlike in the developed countries there was no clear sign of a decline after the golden age although under socialism russia undoubtedly had very high baran ratios still more than 100 percent in 1989 under neoliberalism it suffered from lack of investment evident in its declining baran ratio approaching 60 percent the african economies in chart 4 offer a somewhat different story both south africa and rwanda which overall have baran ratios of less than 50 percent seem to have had a moderate drop in their baran ratios during the neoliberal age however in the last decade or so rwanda and uganda have both experienced noticeable rises in their baran ratios reaching over 60 percent chart 4 baran ratio developing economies sources capital formation data is from the world bank database top 10 percent income share data is from the world wealth and income database and the world bank database notes all the estimates are based on top income share approach chart 5 presents the data about china and india two of the largest developing countries in the world china s baran ratio was very high during the maoist era and close to 100 percent in the early 1980s afterward the ratio decreased mildly until it started to climb up again following the most recent global economic crisis india shared the typical pattern of growing baran ratios in the 1960s and 70s and following the reforms of the 1990s its baran ratio began to fall in the 2000s however india s baran ratio was on the rise despite starting to decline again in recent years throughout the neoliberal age both china and india were able to maintain a remarkably high ratio chart 5 baran ratio china and india sources capital formation data is from the world bank database india s labor share data was retrieved from the fred federal reserve bank of st louis china s labor share data is from hao qi the labor share question in china notes china s post 1982 data is based on the essential consumption approach pre 1982 data is based on the property share approach as is india s data these simple statistics shed some light on the character of the international capitalist class in developing and developed countries strongly influenced by neoliberalism the average capitalists spend about 40 percent of their surplus on accumulation in places with a legacy of industrial policy like japan and south korea typical capitalists reinvest 60 percent or more of the surplus in countries with still active state regulation and intervention such as china and india the capitalist classes could easily spend more than 70 or 80 percent of the surplus on capital accumulation the historical determinants of the baran ratio in a context of competition between capitalism and socialism the period between the 1960s and the early 1980s was indeed a golden age for capitalist economies the ruling class became unprecedentedly productive this was made possible by strong government intervention and regulation for instance as we have seen the nationalist party led ruling class in mainland china was once clearly unproductive but after being defeated by communist revolution in the mainland and fleeing to taiwan it became highly productive as we can see from the data on the soviet union russia and china the baran ratio of socialist countries was also remarkably high in the postwar period in fact the efficient utilization of surplus through economic planning was one of the key advantages of socialist economies this age of productive capitalism ended in the 1980s as most economies saw declining baran ratios it was no longer a mandate that capitalists reinvest a significant portion of their surplus the waning threat of the socialist camp the rise of neoliberalism and the following deregulation in finance and other sectors all contributed to the change in behavior of the capitalist class after the decline the baran ratios of major economies stabilized around a much lower level a pattern that remained relatively unchanged by the economic crisis of 2007 09 it seems that global capitalism on the whole has moved to a new stage featuring low accumulation or long term stagnation nevertheless there are considerable regional differences latin american economies have always had lower than average baran ratios and did not experience a clear golden age the major east asian economies still maintained relatively high baran ratios despite decline in the neoliberal age and in fact these differences were not so much due to government policies japan and south korea had a tradition of industrial policy and latin america of industrially oriented import substitution their historical conditions however differ significantly in japan south korea and taiwan the threat of communist revolution was real and after the second world war the old ruling classes were dramatically restructured by domestic and u s forces land reform among other social changes also weakened the power of the nonproductive landlord class laying the basis for better appropriation and utilization of surplus latin america by contrast was not as threatened by revolutions or ruling class restructuring lack of any meaningful land reform in latin america also prevented progressive industrial policy from having substantial impact swimming against the current both china and india have had very high baran ratios in the last decade according to the data china has maintained a high baran ratio since the early 1980s and it is reasonable to assume that it enjoyed similarly high ratios in the 1960s and 70s such stability mainly arises from direct state ownership or control of the major sectors both during the planned economy era and the market economy era even with privatization and deregulation among other typical neoliberal policies the chinese government still managed to maintain firm control over the use of economic surplus as can be seen from its rising baran ratio following the most recent global economic crisis india however did not have a centrally planned economy although it learned from the experience of socialist economies to this day india still implements five year plans and emphasizes the role of public investment following the rise of neoliberalism india experienced a decline in its baran ratio but in the 2000s reversed the trend in fact the world bank recognizes that india s public infrastructure investment has been a major driver of its growth in recent years 16 does this imply that a history of socialism or industrial policy is a prerequisite for a better application of surplus in today s world to answer this question it is illustrative to look at african countries such as uganda and rwanda these economies do not have a strong legacy of socialism or industrial policy but have demonstrated remarkable surplus utilization with skyrocketing baran ratios since the beginning of this century rwanda s baran ratio has nearly doubled since 2000 and uganda s has been among the highest in the world in recent years there are two factors that could have contributed to rwanda s and uganda s growing baran ratios first given the countries poverty their governments and ruling classes prioritize economic development in policy making this means that they are more inclined to adopt strong industrial policies and focus on investment second both countries were ravaged by civil wars in the 1990s weakening part of the old ruling class these dynamics could make a restructuring of proaccumulation ruling classes comparatively easier not unlike the cases of east asian economies in sum baran ratios of capitalist economies have always generally been low of course however there are exceptions revolutionary movements can force ruling classes to waste less and invest more as in the golden age postwar economies with weaker old ruling classes can implement more regulation and proaccumulation policies with less resistance as in the golden age and some contemporary african economies and ruling classes in countries with socialist and or industrial legacies tend to be more investment inclined such as japan china and india in short the spirit of the capitalist class is a product of class struggles and overall historical conditions growth stagnation and legitimacy economic growth depends both on how much surplus the ruling class can appropriate as well as how much of that surplus will be spent on accumulation thus a higher baran ratio should more or less correspond to a higher growth rate chart 6 presents the relationship between gdp growth rate and baran ratios between 1990 and 2015 based on selected countries it clearly suggests that during the last twenty five years countries with higher baran ratios have indeed tended to have higher growth rates countries with low baran ratios below 60 0 percent grew on average by 2 4 percent per year while countries with high baran ratios grew by 5 4 percent per year to contextualize these numbers from 1870 to 2008 the average annual world gdp growth rate was about 2 8 percent 17 this is approximately in line with the growth rate of countries with low baran ratios in other words a nonproductive capitalist class is a long standing feature of capitalism during the postwar golden age 1950 75 the world gdp grew about 4 7 percent per year 18 this is close to the growth rate of economies with high baran ratios capitalism has historically been a dynamic mode of production especially compared to precapitalist societies the humble growth of major economies before the second world war might be considered significant when contrasted to the growth of previous centuries however because of the history of the golden age and the experiences of fast growing socialist economies the prewar norm has now become a sign of stagnation thus the current stagnation could be considered a return to the original standard of the late mid twentieth century which in turn developed out of the end of the postwar era s unprecedented historical conditions although relevant so called external factors like technology or effective demand are unlikely to be the main elements behind stagnation the key is the changed characteristics of the capitalist classes which result from class struggles and other historical factors as chart 6 suggests a period of rapid growth like the golden age requires an average baran ratio of about 60 percent that is a 10 to 20 percent point increase for the major capitalist economies like the united states and western europe a change of this magnitude breaks the capitalist norm and generally calls for a revolutionary and or postwar context but even if such change occurs there is no guarantee it will remain contained within capitalism chart 6 baran ratio and growth 1990 2015 sources for the economies mentioned previously the same sources are used for a few other economies capital formation data is from the world bank database labor share data is from the ilo database and the fred federal reserve bank of st louis top 10 percent income share data is from the world wealth and income database and the world bank database notes gdp growth rates and baran ratios are average values of 1990 2015 the average baran ratios result primarily from the property share approach and the top income approach when necessary for countries that have select data points of baran ratios in the time period the average of the point estimates was calculated after all the legitimacy of capitalism ultimately depends on how effectively the ruling class employs surplus despite inequality and oppression capitalism has been considered a progressive mode of production insofar as capitalists keep reinvesting larger portions of surplus value compared to other modes of production such as feudalism in the heyday of the cold war capitalists managed to use surplus at a level comparable to socialist economies showing the system s resilience and flexibility however as shown in the data the capitalist classes in major economies such as the united states and the united kingdom have gradually ceased to be productive since this trend remained unchanged even after the most recent crisis it is clear that this is not simply a return to the long run average this suggests that any potential for progress and flexibility in the system may have been exhausted in these mature capitalist economies there are countries where the young capitalist classes are still more productive but these are primarily developing countries with severe problems of their own this does not of course mean that a fast growing economy is free from its own contradictions endless growth is fundamentally incompatible with our ecological system but the move to stop global warming and build environmentally friendly infrastructure still requires tremendous effort which means that a significant part of the world surplus must be invested in the project this will not be possible without optimal utilization of the surplus or a high baran ratio conclusion the baran ratio provides a way to examine the use of surplus under different economic systems the results of international baran ratio calculations clearly support the notion of secular stagnation in capitalism for major capitalist economies such as britain and germany baran ratios were on the whole stable and low from the mid nineteenth century to the early twentieth century in the post second world war years baran ratios rose to historic levels among both developed and developing countries however the neoliberal era saw a sharp decline in the baran ratios of most economies there is of course considerable variation across the globe the baran ratios of developed countries have tended to stabilize around a low pre second world war level in recent years while the ratios of china and india remain relatively high calculations show that slow capital accumulation and growth is an inherent feature of unregulated capitalism both before the second world war and during the neoliberal era neoliberal logic often attributes lack of investment and slow growth to high labor costs this justification clearly contradicts the fact that globally labor share in gdp has fallen throughout the neoliberal era the responsibility for stagnation as well as capitalism s crisis of legitimacy lays squarely with the capitalist class notes

welcome to this week s market wrap podcast i m mike gleason later in today s program gerald celente the top trends forecaster in the world joins me to tell us why the world s central banks bought a record amount of gold in 2018 and also about what type of wildcard events may trigger a new economic crisis he also tells us what threshold gold needs to hit in order to make a run at 2 000 so stick around for my conversation with gerald celente of the trends journal later in today s program also coming up disturbing new developments in big media s and big tech s politically motivated de platforming campaigns coordinated censorship and financial blacklisting threaten to silence alternative voices including sound money advocates more on that in a bit but first let s check this week s market action precious metals markets are trading mixed this week with the monetary metals gold and silver both selling off while the platinum group metals power higher gold prices are down 1 9 this week to come in at 1 304 per ounce silver shows a weekly loss of twice that or 3 8 to trade at 15 37 platinum though is exhibiting some unusual relative strength for a second consecutive week the metal is up 2 1 since last friday s close to trade at 866 after being beaten down for so many months and left for dead by traders platinum is suddenly on the verge of closing at an 8 month high for the week if it follows in the footsteps of its sister metal palladium then platinum is headed much much higher on the charts the record setting palladium bull run still shows no signs of slowing down palladium prices are up another 3 7 this week to come in at 1 559 an ounce when gold and silver prices rise to record highs public interest in sound money issues will rise as well but vital independent sources of information may be largely hidden in internet search results google apple youtube social media sites and now amazon are all engaging in heavy handed content curation promoting points of views they approve of and demoting or even banning alternative perspectives one of the few cable tv personalities speaking out on behalf of the marginalized and censored is tucker carlson tucker carlson in a recent interview with the wall street journal the ceo of paypal dan schulman explained that diversity and inclusion are his company s top values but of course he doesn t mean it he means the opposite like most on the left what schulman actually wants is utter conformity a world where only approved opinions are allowed last year paypal banned alex jones from using its platform for saying things they didn t like they ve also banned anti muslim activist laura loomer the publication vdare and a number of other people and organizations whose speech they believe should be silenced you have to wonder how long tucker will be able to keep his job at fox news in the face of pressure from corporate advertisers who fear being associated with any non politically correct opinions this week project veritas released an investigative report showing how facebook limits the reach of popular right leaning users by deboosting their content those who are deemed to be far right in other words genuine political dissidents risk being deleted from facebook and all other social media and online payments platforms that s what happened to british activist tommy robinson this week after he released a documentary exposing fake news on the state funded bbc his last remaining social media accounts got terminated he even had his book banned by amazon amazon once vowed it would never ban books now it is doing exactly that amazon founder jeff bezos who has an estimated net worth of 140 billion controls 75 of the market for e books he has the ability to single handedly deprive authors of a livelihood if he doesn t like their opinions in the last few days amazon has removed books by immigration restrictionists historical revisionists conspiracy theorists race realists gun makers and pick up artists after offended journalists wrote articles complaining about them establishment media outlets are also trying to force out competing independent content creators on platforms such as youtube old guard media s latest crusade is against so called conspiracy theories anything that questions the prevailing narrative on any topic can now be branded as a conspiracy theory and removed or demoted by big tech s algorithms for example independently produced videos critical of the federal reserve are now being hidden in youtube s search results and replaced with banal cable tv news clips here s alternative media personality and sound money advocate mark dice with his take imagine you re a high school freshman and got a school assignment about the federal reserve you watch videos on youtube all the time so you go home and put federal reserve in the youtube search bar this is the first one that comes up with 1 6 million views oh it looks like it s a documentary from james corbett titled century of enslavement the history of the federal reserve oh and look at this now when you type in the federal reserve into youtube the number one search result is from cnn how the federal reserve works mark dice buzzfeed did an investigation and then tattled to youtube because they didn t like the videos that were coming up and so youtube changed the algorithm again to favor mainstream media sources even more heavily msnbc s chris hayes was also upset about what he was finding on youtube a few years ago mark dice put out a viral video offering random people on the street their choice of a chocolate candy bar or a 10 ounce bar of pure silver the result of the social experiment was both humorous and sad revealing just how ignorant the typical american is about the value of silver before silver was removed from u s circulating coinage in the 1960s any random person could be expected to have a general idea of what an ounce of silver was worth nobody in their right mind would prefer a chocolate bar over a ten ounce silver bar something 100 times more valuable the public has been systematically deprived of basic knowledge about sound money thanks to what s taught and not taught in our schools and what s propagandized in the mainstream media americans have been reduced to preferring the instant gratification of candy over a permanent form of real wealth their ancestors would have all recognized and highly prized but apparently anyone who tries to connect the dots of mindless short sighted consumerism to our unsound debt based monetary system is just a conspiracy theorist who has no place on the platforms of internet monopolists perhaps the greatest bait and switch scheme of all time was when a small handful of big tech companies gained the trust of everyone by openly declaring their commitment to free speech principles then when they became de facto public utilities by amassing nearly all the traffic in their respective domains they decided to become the world s biggest controllers of speech well now for more on how the mainstream media is seldom giving you the full story plus much more let s get right to this week s exclusive interview mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome in gerald celente publisher of the renowned trends journal mr celente is perhaps most well known trends forecaster in the world and it s always a joy to speak with him mr celente thanks for the time again today and welcome back gerald celente oh thanks for having me on mike mike gleason well gerald the trends journal is forecasting economic 9 11 as one of the big trends for 2019 there are plenty of indicators which just support your thesis for a major slowdown debt levels both public and private have exploded china is slowing down and all the stimulus in europe has failed to generate results there higher interest rates are hurting everything from real estate to auto sales et cetera but none of this is reflected in the stock markets which are roaring higher once again it looks like the fed is up to its old tricks promising to stop the rate hikes they had planned and end the program for selling bonds the constant intervention of the fed has always been one of the major wildcards when trying to predict where things are headed in recent years what do you think can the central bankers kick the can one more time to avoid a recession or are they finally going to lose control in the months ahead gerald celente well i think you ve summed everything up pretty well in analyzing it and the general situation when we made that forecast of an economic 9 11 remember how trends for the new year go out in december in december we just saw the dow have its worst month since the great depression and all of a sudden on january 4th 2019 it all turned around what happened was the federal reserve chairman bent over to trump and he backtracked on his aggressive stance of 2018 where they raised interest rates four times and they were scheduled to raise them three to four more times in 2019 he said he would be patient in late january they said it again that they would be patient they were in no hurry raising interest rates that changed our forecast because what they ve done is they ve injected more monetary methadone into the bull to keep it running you can see what was happening when they were going to pull the needle out the bull was dying it was od ing already and now they just got it going once again and you mentioned wildcard and that s exactly why nobody could predict the future there are too many wildcards whether they re man made or made by mother nature well of course now i have to be proper and politically correct whether women made or made by father nature what happened was they played the wildcard and the fact is whether it was fear of a fed audit or just pressure from trump we listed all the times he called the fed loco and crazy and how disgusted he was with them throughout 2018 beginning in july until they did a backtrack so now what we re looking at mike it s the presidential reality show s already heating up and trump is going to do everything he can to keep the economy pumping along or i should say trumping along remember the cat s in the real estate business to his son in law the family the cushners it s real estate you mentioned about real estate prices going down i mean what happened in december we saw southern california home sales plunge 20 in december to the lowest pace in 11 years so when those interest rates got around 5 for a 30 year mortgage you could see the big reversal not only do we see the fed not raising interest rates in 2019 we could see them aggressively bringing them down if the economy starts to slow down they raised them nine times since 2015 they could lower them nine times mike gleason this year certainly has the potential to be one for the history books in europe we spoke when you were last with us in december about the yellow jacket protests in france they are ongoing and there is reason to think they may be a bigger deal than the conventional media is letting on it is possible that president macron may be forced out which would be quite a populous victory there should also be finally a resolution with regards to brexit in the months ahead what is your take on the events in europe gerald will the populous and anti eu forces be able to win this year or will establishment forces be able to fend off these attacks for a while longer yet gerald celente well they re doing the best to fend them off you mentioned macron and you had his popularity rating was down to 27 now it s moved back up a bit to a 32 they are really really doing everything they can to stop the protest from going you know with hypocrisy by the way in the way the media covers what s going on in venezuela when a few people were killed a week or so ago when they were trying to bring in that so called humanitarian aid and then you look what s going on in france and how many people have been killed and the violence with the rubber bullets being shot out at them and people losing their eyes and on and on and how the difference in the coverage is in france it s okay in venezuela it s terrible so we think what s going to happen in europe is they re going to do everything they can to suppress any kind of populous movements and we re going to see what happens with the elections coming up for the european parliament later this year and that s going to give us the indicator of how deeply the populous movement are moving in right now it s a war between those that want more globalism and those don t want to retain their culture their nationality and their ethnic identity mike gleason you touched on it there but how about venezuela gerald what is your take on what s happening there as the u s looks to exert some of its influence to overthrow the maduro regime and then let s also get your comments about venezuela not being able to get its gold back what do you make of events there gerald celente well again you know this is the perfect example of what america has been doing in central america for over a hundred years you could not be clearer than it s a coup attempt and i love the language they used by the way you know this guy guaido he all of a sudden declares himself and says i m the interim president of venezuela and of course we covered this very deeply in our trends journal that he was brought to the united states prior to that a number of times and this is an outright coup attempt in our november trends journal remember this didn t happen until january late january our november trends journal there as a keynote story it s called the triangle of death and we had forecasted that brazil colombia and argentina would form a triangle of death aimed at venezuela with the united states behind the movement and that s precisely what has happened that s what the trends journal is about you can t make this stuff up where you ve got a bunch of clowns out there talking about bringing democracy to venezuela how many times have i heard that bs in my life oh yeah you re going to do it in iraq right no no it was libya i got it syria assad has to go we need democracy one time after another it s all about oil if their major export was broccoli and not oil there d be no demands by america s presidents obama and bush to spill blood and destroy those oil rich sovereign nations that i named and the same thing about venezuela and if you don t believe me ask the clown that s playing our national security adviser john bolton quote we re in conversation with major american companies now it would make a difference if we could have american companies produce the oil in venezuela it would be good for the people of the united states end quote mike gleason it s kind of what it s all about it s always about oil just follow the oil and sure enough there you go conflict seems to surround it switching gears here a little bit gold and silver prices are certainly holding up well here given the rally in the stock markets and the relative strength in the us dollar it s hard to have too much confidence in the paper prices of metals as we ve talked about before there s been a too much evidence of rigging and cheating by the bullion banks with the tacit blessing of the regulators including the fed we don t think they can control the markets forever particularly the physical bullion markets there is an ongoing investigation by the department of justice into the metals rigging and the fbi is getting cooperation from a former jp morgan trader as well as the documents and recordings turned over by deutsche bank a couple of years ago and there are some civil class action suits pending attorneys there are watching the progress for the criminal investigation licking their chops so this is new territory please give us your thoughts if you would if you ve been following the story at all and then please tell us what you think generally about the metals markets here gerald gerald celente it will be like everything else you know what i mean look at the bankers that were convicted of fraud outright fraud five major banks did you see any heads roll did anything change nothing will change it ll come in and go out however what the central banks are doing as you well know is they bought more gold in 2018 than they did in a half century so they know this whole ponzi scheme of a 250 trillion debt bubble is going to explode the reality is no one knows when we can make the forecast based on the current events forming future trends but again what happened was out of nowhere the federal reserve chairman comes out on a day where the employment numbers come out on january 4th and we created over 300 000 jobs and it showed that the yearly increases of wages was the best in 10 years two reasons not to be patient with interest rates they should have raised them with that kind of data what i m saying mike is you never know what s going to bring this market down as we see it is a wildcard event that s what s going to do it something that you can t predict be it a war with well look at the war now you know the war talk going on and the bombing runs committed by pakistan and india what if those two nuclear armed countries go at it what happens if the push for war with iran that keeps heating up is ignited you ll see oil prices go 100 a barrel you kiss the markets and world economies goodbye so that s where gold comes in it s the safe haven asset i ve been on your show a lot of times and i ve been saying for i don t know how long that the bottom price of gold is 1 200 i said it all of 2018 i believe it hit 1 185 for a day or two and now it s over 1 300 an ounce we keep saying it has to break over 1 385 to gain strength and the breakout point is 1 450 i ve been saying that for nearly it s going on six years almost and it hasn t done that when it breaks over the 1 450 mark we believe it will spike to the 2 000 mark mike gleason getting back to something you touched on earlier with the federal reserve likely not looking to raise interest rates this year at all maybe even cutting when the markets sort of start to realize that that s what s happening is that maybe one of those kind of explosive situations for precious metals once the real interest rates actually turn negative gerald celente it ll put more cheap money into the system but it will be positive for gold because the more expensive that dollar gets the opportunity holding of course of gold becomes less attractive the cheaper the dollar the lower the dollar the lower interest rates the more attractive gold becomes again we don t see at this point despite the pressures going on globally with japan and europe and china and an economic slowdown we don t see a recession right now in the united states particularly because they are going to do everything they can to generate a moderately strong economy prior to the 2020 elections mike gleason well finally as we close here do you have any final thoughts for investors about any other trends that you may be watching that we perhaps didn t touch on then also anything else that you care to mention as we wrap up here today gerald celente well yeah the things to look at where the markets are also going of course are copper prices doctor copper it s called in the trade that means that copper is an indicator of the health of the global economy right now we re seeing copper having about a 12 increase this year it s still relatively low but it s up from july 2018 again at 12 hit this year and it s showing strength and china is one of the largest purchases of copper they get over 50 of the new stuff developed so it shows us that yes there s going to be a slowdown again but not a decline one of the big trends that we keep watching and we ve been on this one of the first with the trends journal and that s the whole cannabis trend this is just the beginning of it we re in 1933 and they just lifted prohibition and everybody s getting any alcohol business but this is even much bigger because not only the cannabis in terms of hemp being legalized and all the medical benefits of cannabis are going to be explored more and more as i say if the planet could feed us could it heal us the irony of all this by the way is the same criminals that criminalized it that ruined the lives of millions of people for smoking a joint to getting caught selling an ounce and throwing them in jail and three strikes they re out the millions when you add up the families that were destroyed probably the tens of millions if not hundreds of millions over the decades these are the same criminals now that are giving us the regulations to de legalize god s plant and of course the only reason this political mafia is involved in it is because they want their cut that s called taxes you have places like new jersey over here where they re going to put 42 an ounce tax on it it s a criminal operation and that s the only reason they re legalizing it should have always been legal but the reason they re legalizing it is just to get more money from taxes because we re talking about that debt bubble and you got one blowing up everywhere they need more money and will do anything they can to get it you re going to see this whole cannabis trend continuing to explode globally mike gleason well we ll leave it there for now gerald we really appreciate the time once again today and before we let you go please fill folks in on what s going on there at the trends journal and the trends research institute what they need know and how they can start getting the wonderful information that you put out there on a regular basis gerald celente well they can go to trendsjournal com and of course we

morning thank you for joining us today with me this morning are terry ronan our cfo dan rorabaugh our svp of operations joe cofelice our evp commercial development and several other members of the atlantic power management team the numbers for the fourth quarter and full year are provided in the press release the presentation and the prepared remarks which were posted to the website last evening please review those materials instead of reading off those results this morning i would like to talk about the state of the business in a bit of a year end review format following my remarks we ll take your questions at appel this week we announced that irving gerstein will retire from the board at the conclusion of the annual meeting this june in toronto irving has served atlantic power with professionalism and grace for nearly 15 years i have really enjoyed working with them i will miss his presence on the board we also announced that kevin howell will become chairman assuming he is reelected to the board kevin has extensive power and industry experience as an executive board member and board chair kevin shares our passion for a culture of safety frugality and service leadership in other people news we ve added two new vp commercial development hires bringing that group to four including evp joe cofelice this group has been focused on extending in restructuring our ppas the oefc settlement last year was an idea that originated this group and it led to a good economic result more recently this group has led the effort on asset m a with the south carolina biomass acquisition and they are continuing to work on other opportunities given our stronger balance sheet we are now a credible buyer of assets into the hundreds of millions of dollars finding adequate returns is the key on the balance sheet as noted in the financial results release we paid a 100 million of debt we repaid 100 million of debt in 2018 and plan to payoff another 86 million in 2019 we continue to strengthen the balance sheet to provide downside protection and to enhance our ability to play offence on capital allocation on capital allocation we have slightly more than 190 million of liquidity we ve had lots of good uses for our excess cash on and off the balance sheet over the past three years we have bought 36 million worth of common shares at an average price of 2 27 a share 23 million of preferred shares at a 38 discount to par and committed nearly 26 million for the koma kulshan in south carolina acquisition we will continue to rank order the risk reward from the various uses of capital available to us and then try to do the most rationale thing in capital allocation we are price to value driven so we don t have any set targets on how much capital to deploy in each bucket on company position we think we re well positioned now for various economic or industry scenarios if we have deflation or a market crash our ppa revenue will allow us to continue you paying down debt we would also be able to allocate our capital to assets that would very likely have higher returns in those generally available in today s low rate high asset price market environment it would be wrong to cheer for severe market dislocation but we would be well positioned and driving the work in the mornings with a alacrity in that scenario if we get a breakout of inflation at some point then interest rates and discount rates might rise that might lower the value of existing asset however that might be partially offset by higher power prices should they move up along with inflation higher power prices would improve the recontracting outlook in addition over time we will have more merchant generation available to sell out the markets if there is a pickup in prices lastly we have very little interest rate exposure on our debt if we get neither deflation nor inflation but rather a continuation of the current environment we plan to move forward on our path of grinding on cost and debt operating safely and efficiently and looking opportunistically for cigar butt investments turning from the macro environment to the power sector specifically if we continue to see aggressive additions of wind and solar to the grid we are likely to see great prices rise due to integration cost resulting in higher prices for end use customers and negative implications for electricity demand our belief is that the observers and market participants may be underestimating the integration cost of renewables and the cost of battery storage the retirement of nuclear and coal capacity helps the overall supply and demand picture the lack of strong capacity markets however is not good for natural gas plants at some point however flexible and please ccgt plants might see a pickup in value if their intermittent power and battery economics disappoint conversely any carbon regimes would be helpful to the value of our non carbon emitting hydro facilities higher gas prices would likely benefit our hydro facilities as well if we see a move to a more balanced approach our ccgts would likely benefit our biomass fleet has an attractive remaining ppa life on average seven years or more than nine years excluding williams lake so they re a good source of cash flow to continue in the present environment with our debt reduction and growth efforts we like our position in the near term having ample ppa coverage and in longer term being a potential hedge against inflation and was a fairly balanced portfolio of power technologies on growth after years of internal focus we re now in approved position with regard to cost and debt and can look more credibly at asset m a our koma kulshan and biomass acquisitions are one result of that positioning we are considering other potential acquisitions of various types we have nothing to report today but our deal flow and acquisition activities are picking up nicely we ve done a good job of restructuring our business there may be opportunities to merge where those skills would be useful in a combined entity we also have a strong operations expertise and that core competency has made us a more confident buyer of biomass plants as one example we re small enough that we can look at bilateral deals and not chase auctions we can also look at deals that are too small to move the needle at bigger public companies all in all we are confident but not complacent about our financial operational and strategic positioning in this market and in scenarios where we see dramatic economic market or regulatory breaks in one direction or another we are ready to take questions now operator questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from nelson ng of rbc capital markets please go ahead nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst great thanks good morning everyone james j moore jr president and chief executive officer good morning nelson nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst my first question relates to m a you mentioned that you re looking more actively at acquisition opportunities and also biomass what is your like what s your sweet spot in terms of acquisition size and what s the range of project size you think you can do james j moore jr president and chief executive officer well we on the smaller end we got the koma kulshan in south carolina deals and then at the higher end we ve got a couple of hundred million dollars of liquidity and then obviously we can look at financing acquisitions but we are going to be very opportunistic i think one of our competitive advantages is we re small enough that we can be a bit idiosyncratic and be disciplined and just look for the best deals available so whether it s biomass or some other technology whatever the contract length is we can get in here and be pretty nimble and i think we ll get some bilateral deals done over the years but we don t have any set targets that we re looking at nelson nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst and in terms of characteristics of your targets is there a minimum contract length you re looking at james j moore jr president and chief executive officer no no minimum contract length no maximum no specific technology we re just we re deal guys so we re looking for the best deals we can find and internally we always think of our hurdle rate as the press which we bought it 11 and again a little bit more even and that s a cash return so when we look at a 30 year pro forma irr that we consider that to kind of be a hurdle rate we re not very enthusiastic about merchant in this environment i think down the road merchant may actually be a good place to be and gas may end up having some values in areas that have over integrated intermittent power and underestimated the storage costs but we re creating merchant as our ppas run off the gas fleet so we don t really have to go out and buy anybody else s merchant we ve got our own nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst okay and then just i guess taking the i guess other side of the argument in terms of potentially buying assets have you considered potentially selling assets especially assets that are such high valuations in this market particularly hydro james j moore jr president and chief executive officer yeah we look at those things all the time since i ve been here we ve continuously looked at selling individual assets and fleets of assets and doing tax free spin offs and joint ventures and we ve looked at selling the company and merging the company and buying assets and we are just disciplined value investors so we re at the right price everything is for sale and at the right price we re going to be very enthusiastic buyers we re just focused on price to value and i think we don t want to be overly tied down to particular themes the old charlie munger says they never did strategic plans because you end up handcuffing yourself and missing opportunities and what he said is their big competitive advantage has been every day they come to work and they rank order the returns available to them and then they try to do the most intelligent thing they can with their capital and that s all we re trying to do we re trying to be as rational as possible for the shareholders nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst okay and then just switching gears to williams lake i think in the 2019 bridge you re expecting a reduction in the ebitda of about 11 million so that implies an overall negative 3 million contribution from williams lake i thought the short term ppa is a positive margin contributor so could you just provide a bit more color as to why it s been negative for the year i m just wondering whether post ppa expiration are you expecting just like i guess cost to maintain that asset terrence ronan executive vice president chief financial officer sure nelson tts terry i ll take that one so last year 2018 the ebitda was about 8 million and if you recall the ppa expired at the end of march so we had the higher priced ppa in there for three months and the short term extension was modestly positive so as we look at projections for 2019 we still feel that the short term extension is modestly positive it expires in june it could be extended till september or even longer at bc hydro s request but right now the reason you see that negative is because we assume on a conservative basis that a short term extension ends in june and then we have shutdown expenses including some severance and inventory adjustments that would lead you to that negative 3 million number that you mentioned now we are hopeful that that s not going to happen we ve got some positive news on williams lake recently but right now what s the budget has nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst i see that makes sense are you able to give any more clarity on the timing like obviously you re in discussions with the government i guess right now i presume and you re hoping to get something finalized sometime this year but are you able to give a bit more clarification in terms of timing joseph e cofelice executive vice president commercial development good morning nelson this is joe really we can t the report was issued and we expect to engage with bc hydro in the next couple of months and we re pretty confident that will occur based on the communications that are taking place how long the negotiation will take we will see but the bottom line there is that it s the report by the government is it s good news it s a positive step we ve been struggling over the last couple of years to create a path of for negotiation of a long term extension and discuss that for us but having said that we don t know what terms would be an offer ph until we get something done it s not done nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst got it ok just one last question in terms of the ontario facilities obviously you have a 15 year contract at tunis but you don t have a contract for kapuskasing and north bay is there something that makes the tunis facility more attractive than kapuskasing and north bay in terms of maybe it s location i guess is there a reason why tunis has a 15 year contract whereas i guess it s more difficult to get a contract for the other terrence ronan executive vice president chief financial officer what timing when the tunis contract expired we were able to go out and get possibly the last contract that was done before they shut down contracting with ipps in ontario and of course the inaudible contract expired later and when it came time to negotiate those the contracts we no longer are at them so what timing than anything else nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst okay got it i ll leave it there thanks james j moore jr president and chief executive officer thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from rupert merer of national bank please go ahead rupert merer national bank analyst good morning everyone james j moore jr president and chief executive officer good morning rupert rupert merer national bank analyst with your growth in biomass in the southern us wondering if you could talk us through the potential of that market and maybe talk about the availability of fiber mobility to contract fiber james j moore jr president and chief executive officer sure i ll start on the on the market itself and may ask dan little bit help on the fiber question if you compare the biomass opportunities to say natural gas opportunities or wind opportunities there s a limited universe of projects available and that universe becomes even more limited when you find a minimum ppa term to them because unlike other assets biomass plants are generally not plants that you want to take into a merchant market you want contract cover on them and so what we do is we basically look at the market we prioritize the targets by ppa cover and in the global market to those people i think that it s right now there are some opportunities out there that we were engaged in discussions with people we will see where those discussions go and basically what we do is we make sure that these parties that own these assets are aware that we re a buyer of these assets and we benefit from the fact that there s a limited number of interested parties generally in these assets when they do become available and we have the ability to move quickly when these companies are seeking quick monetization so that s that i ll just make one point on wood supply i mean when you look at markets like georgia and south carolina it s pretty considerable toward the fiber there i think georgia may be the largest market in the us as a source of fiber so we re looking at targets we do spend a lot of time evaluating some fiber and that s also important from the standpoint of ppa extensions we have target projects like the locations like williams lake where you have strong community support for the plant because the plant is so important to the local inaudible and if you ve read any of the recent press in williams lake you ll see how beneficial that can be rupert merer national bank analyst are you seeing any risk from the on the fiber supply from the pellet producers and growing demand for wood pellets that are shipped internationally dan rorabaugh senior vice president operations there certainly is competition from them but what they tend not to use is the sort of the bulk in the other parts of inaudible less desirable and what we re finding is there is a lot of urban wood waste supply whether it s because they re doing a development and sort of clearing loss or whether we re getting these further residual from sawmills and even from these pellet plants so we re just we don t look for the big contracts our philosophy is we don t want anybody now more than say 10 of our supply in any plant so we go with the large variety of smaller suppliers and that s been consistent throughout our fleet rupert merer national bank analyst and can you remind me of your south carolina facility how you re managing fiber there and of course of the facilities that you are looking to acquire do you have long term contracts on supply of fiber james j moore jr president and chief executive officer i think it s almost all purchase orders with smaller suppliers rupert merer national bank analyst okay very good i ll leave it there thank you james j moore jr president and chief executive officer thanks rupert operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to jim moore for any closing remarks james j moore jr president and chief executive officer okay thanks everybody we

philip morris international chief executive andre calantzopoulos holds a carrying case for his company s iqos alternative tobacco device courtesy philip morris cairo 1 march 2019 during his thursday night show on alhayah tv network television anchor tawfik okasha said that the american leviathan tobacco company phillip morris owes the egyptian eastern tobacco company etc us 0 25 billion and is refusing to pay okasha called out philip morris for their actions and their refusal to pay their dues explaining that their aim in doing so is to negatively affect the egyptian economy and to hit one of the biggest egyptian companies despite the rise in the foreign companies shares in the egyptian stock exchange egx the company explained okasha wants to exploit egypt s economic condition as do many others what is the fall out about an agreement between philip morris and the eastern tobacco company that awarded the former advantages that they have no right to according to claims by the etc and led the latter to lose le 200 million has left the economic world in controversy the agreement stipulated that philip morris will pay in egyptian pounds instead of us dollars this came on the pretext that it is difficult according to philip morris to get us dollars at this point due to the difficult junction within which the egyptian economy resides due to the change in the exchange rate of the us dollar by more than 150 percent a step that severely harmed the commercial interests of both philip morris international pmi and philip morris misr both companies have all the right to renegotiate their agreement with eastern company to restore the economic balance the modified form of the agreement was approved eastern company s general assembly eastern company s statement then to justify the new developments the eastern company was pressured by pmi to settle to 5 8 as the manufacturing fees of 1 000 cigarettes among zero to 15 billion cigarettes and 6 2 for 1 000 cigarettes among 15 to 22 billion cigarettes pmi has unfairly insisted to pay its dues to the eastern company in the local currency instead of the us or any other foreign currencies which have caused severe damage to the egyptian economy eager to increase its fx reserves pmi has delayed the payment of what estimated to be 200 million to the eastern company in return for the manufacturing fees of cigarettes eastern company has gone through massive financial losses with its export revenues reduced to 14 million accordingly the egyptian parliament s industrial committee has started to look into the agreement which they view as suspicious this all comes on a heels of an agreement two years ago between the eastern company and philip morris misr in which the egyptian company agreed to present a modified form of the manufacturing agreement with philip morris misr due to the egyptian central bank s call to float the egyptian pound on november 2016 philip morris and the chemical industries holding company claimed that the amendment to the manufacturing contract guarantees the payment of all of the eastern tobacco company s liabilities stating that it would not affect the company s revenues from its dealings with the foreign company which make up about 80 of its total revenue that stands at about le 1 5 billion in the same context egypt s consumer protection agency cpa has received several complaints about pmi s role in increasing prices of cigarettes and its involvement in tax evasion incidents english health institution cancer research uk has accused pmi on october 23 of hypocrisy as the latter was running a pr campaign to encourage people into quitting smoking while it sustains its industry in other countries it s staggering hypocrisy where this tobacco giant is running a pr campaign in the uk to promote its own quit smoking products all the while continuing to promote its deadly tobacco products in countries where it s still legal to do so cancer research uk report said the cancer research uk also reported that in 2011 philip morris international launched its be marlboro campaign which has been strongly criticized for deliberately targeting young people and encouraging them to take up smoking and in 2015 the company filed a lawsuit against the uk government over its plan to introduce plain packaging for tobacco products a measure to make cigarettes less appealing to children philip morris misr llc was established in 2013 and are the licensee for philip morris international pmi products in egypt in 1985 pmi signed a manufacturing agreement with the local state monopoly eastern company to produce pmi brands
week beginning 4 march 2019 some risks next week and observations on the us rba policy decision governor lowe speaks australia gdp partials gdp dwelling approvals retail sales trade balance nz building work put in place china national people s congress trade balance europe ecb policy decision gdp 3rd estimate us non farm payrolls fed chair powell speaks key economic financial forecasts information contained in this report current as at 1 march 2019 some risks next week and observations on the us the reserve bank board meets next week on march 5 on february 21 westpac announced a change in view for the outlook for the cash rate after correctly forecasting unchanged policy since august 2016 despite the rba the market and most economists predicting rate hikes we finally changed our call to a 25 basis point cut in august and another 25 basis point cut in november we would be very surprised if the board decided to move next week but given our change of view must accept that as we move closer to our august target meetings will become increasingly more live the reasons behind our change in view have been extensively explained in the note on february 21 the gdp report for the december quarter 2018 which prints on march 6 will be important for the rate outlook following the 3 1 reported fall in construction around 14 of gdp we have further revised down our forecast for q4 gdp growth to 0 2 that would follow a currently reported 0 3 for q3 implying that the economy lost considerable momentum through the second half of 2018 this forecast is based on consumer spending growth of the reported 0 3 in q3 and our estimated 0 5 in q4 risks to our consumption view are substantial statistical revisions to q3 and a stronger than expected lift in q4 despite weak retail sales and falling vehicle sales insights on the us and fomc policy on february 18 i returned from a two week marketing trip in the us where i met with a number of fomc members real money managers hedge funds and corporates one consequence of this visit has been the decision to revise our forecast for the federal funds rate in 2019 from hikes in june and september to one hike which will be delayed until december we had been aware that on november 28 economic club of new york chairman powell noted interest rates are still low by historical standards and they remain just below the broad range of estimates of the level that would be neutral for the economy that is neither speeding up nor slowing down growth subsequently on december 15 he further increased the federal funds rate by 25 basis points with that move and the expectation that the economy was likely to slow from a 3 growth pace in 2018 to a 2 2 5 pace in 2019 the appetite for rate increases from the federal reserve has dissipated in the markets while it is accepted that the consumer will continue to support growth other more cyclical parts of the economy are seen to be slowing these include business investment housing and exports even the economists who confidently expected multiple rate hikes from the federal reserve as recently as early december have now retreated to expecting maybe one more hike near the end of the year it is accepted that it will take considerable time for the fomc to make a case for higher rates the earliest likely opportunity would be around the jackson hole conference in august the chairman is also likely to need to link any further hikes to a clear rhetoric around the economy i e the fomc did not raise rates it was the us economy proponents of the neutral setting approach accept that the measure of neutral is too imprecise to be able to assess that rates are at or above neutral it was much easier in 2018 rates were clearly below neutral and the economy had tailwinds fiscal policy global growth and easy financial conditions in 2019 rates are 100 basis points higher the stimulatory effect of fiscal policy is dissipating and should a range of spending programs expire by 2019 h2 as currently legislated fiscal policy will become a headwind in addition global growth is slowing and financial conditions are tightening while equities usually have a relatively low weight in financial conditions indexes around 5 10 they are more significant in assessing the outlook for the economy as a proxy for risk and for businesses outlook on growth while the share market has regained much of the losses of early december this volatility signals a degree of caution is warranted neutral or r is broadly defined as the interest rate setting that is consistent with 2 inflation as measured by core pce and potential growth although in 2018 inflation had hovered below the 2 target gdp growth of 3 was substantially above the measure of potential which is 1 75 2 0 for 2019 growth is expected to slow to 2 2 5 slightly above potential but inflation is expected to remain sticky at around 2 indicating that policy is very close to neutral we must also respect the argument that inflationary expectations need to be anchored around 2 allowing inflation to lift above 2 to emphasise symmetrical policy is generally supported there is universal confidence almost complacency that prospects for a blow out in inflation are limited risks on inflation continue to be pitched to the downside from my perspective the risk with this benign outlook for policy is around the labour market and wages responding to tightening conditions in the labour market although overstated by the headline unemployment rate due to ongoing slack associated with the low participation rate we have seen upward pressures on wages growth in 2016 and 2017 average weekly earnings grew around an annual pace of 2 5 3 0 that has now lifted to around 3 5 in 6 month annualised terms momentum in the jobs market does not seem to be easing and a reasonable view is that wages growth will continue to climb the consensus outlook for wages growth is mixed but generally relaxed labour s bargaining power has declined structurally businesses have limited pricing power to pass on wage increases business is committed to labour saving investments and wage and price expectations are low discussions with researchers highlight the lack of a relationship between wages growth and core pce inflation one economist told me he worked in the wages and prices section of the washington fed for five years and was unable to prove a significant causal relationship furthermore there is limited cyclicality in core pce with administered prices and shelter playing important roles theory of course dictates that wage growth is determined by inflation or inflationary expectations and productivity growth the productivity outlook for the us is not encouraging so theory would dictate that a lift in wages should be associated with rising inflation no response from inflation can only mean that inflation is being incorrectly measured or there is some other explanatory variable like labour slack that fills in the gap certainly there is a legitimate concern that wages might experience some non linear surge as catch up to the slow adjustment in the early stages of the recovery previously wages did not fall despite the collapse in demand post gfc for now i am comfortable with the benign consensus view but am still troubled by a rising wages sticky inflation scenario we doubt the recession thesis for the us recessions in the us are typically caused by a large financial shock dot com bubble and gfc or the fomc losing control of inflation and over tightening to date there is limited evidence of extreme financial excess while stable core pce inflation represents no marked threat of overshooting with only one more hike pencilled in for 2019 and no recession on the horizon we expect the federal funds rate to be steady through 2020 the week that was this week investment partial data for the december quarter cast a long shadow over australian gdp next week s key release each quarter in australia we receive two updates related to investment ahead of the gdp report construction work done and the capex survey the former outlines activity across the construction sub sectors while the latter is a guide for equipment investment in q4 construction work done was a material disappointment aggregate activity falling 3 1 against the market s expectation of 0 5 the main contributors to this downside surprise were public construction which was expected to rise and residential construction which surprised by declining at a faster thanexpected pace ahead public work is set to bounce with the pipeline of work lasting years into the future residential construction however is a very different story with further sizeable falls to come in 2019 and 2020 with the construction sector making up 14 of our economy the 3 1 decline in total activity in q4 should take 0 4ppts from gdp growth note though that outcomes for this survey do not always translate one for one to gdp the capex survey was in contrast essentially in line with our expectation with spending on equipment up a modest 0 7 in q4 given this result our focus quickly shifted to assessing the investment intentions of survey recipients provided for both the 2018 19 and 2019 20 financial years based on average realisation ratios we calculate that the current estimates for financial years 2018 19 and 2019 20 imply an increase in business investment of just 3 and 1 respectively by industry the end of the mining investment downswing is apparent with investment intentions for the sector swinging from 8 in 2018 19 to 5 in 2019 20 meanwhile the forward view for manufacturing and services points to a reduced appetite for investment come 2019 20 note that this is only the first estimate for 2019 20 and often these prove unreliable historically it has been the case that firms typically upgrade their investment intentions as the year progresses still given our expectation of a weak consumer and the deterioration in residential construction not to mention global uncertainties business investment growth in the coming two years is likely to remain subdued q4 gdp will be released for australia next wednesday given the weak read for construction and no offset from equipment spending we have revised down our forecast to just 0 2 2 4 yr if it prints around this level and absent a material revision to q3 then growth will have more than halved from the first half of 2018 to the second within the detail of the gdp report the state of consumer incomes and spending will be a particular focus the consumer is key to our call for two 25bp rate cuts in 2019 in august and november moving offshore us gdp beat market expectations in q4 but was in line with our own at 2 6 annualised this is a robust outcome which leaves year average growth at 2 9 well above potential looking forward the detail of the q4 release highlights an important shift in the make up of growth simply the consumer is increasingly dictating headline momentum as business investment moderates and residential construction falls the importance of the consumer will only grow hence given these business and residential investment trends are set to persist and support from government spending will also likely end in late 2019 the most probable outlook for the us is still growth a little above trend in 2019 and 2020 circa 2 0 as per comments from chair powell and other fomc members this week this warrants a view that a further rate hike may prove necessary but that it will only be delivered after inflation and activity data justify it we hold that the us real economy will warrant one more hike at end 2019 though global and domestic risks have to recede fully by then for this outturn to transpire finally ahead of next week s annual national people s congress in china the nbs manufacturing pmi confirmed the sector remains under considerable pressure from weak external demand the pmi printed below 50 for a thirdconsecutive month at a three year low though growth in fixed asset investment remains historically soft total orders of manufacturers lifted back above the 50 expansion contraction mark in february even as external orders weakened further to their lowest level since the gfc along with the relative strength of the services pmi february s orders outcomes point to underlying domestic momentum building in china s business sector as we recently outlined in our 2019 outlook the worst is behind china with respect to investment growth a modest but enduring uptrend should now take hold as policy easing takes effect and authorities pursue quality long term growth in their capital stock and for the economy at large chart of the week australian housing construction the deterioration in the construction sector was a key development in 2018 contributing to the material loss of momentum in the economy from the middle of the year consistent with this the private business surveys have reported a significant slowing in business conditions the housing sector is now in a downturn with further sizeable falls ahead this follows a strong and extended upswing over recent years private new home building activity grew strongly in q1 and q2 4 3 and 4 0 respectively that was followed by sizeable declines in q3 and q4 2 5 and 3 6 private dwelling approvals collapsed late in 2018 tumbling by 17 5 over the two months to december approvals are now around 30 below the levels prevailing over the second half of 2017 new zealand week ahead data wrap ups and downs the recent data for new zealand has taken on a distinctly mixed complexion but at the least it has provided some support for our view that last year s spike in petrol prices was a temporary hindrance to activity developments in household spending have been something of a puzzle in recent times employment has been rising at a solid pace and wage growth has picked up to some degree on top of this the government s families package came into full force in july putting more money into the pockets of lower income households yet retail sales volumes in the september quarter were close to flat we took the view that the impact of the families package was being cancelled out by a spike in petrol prices which reached new record highs in september and early october that increase siphoned at least 130 million out of households wallets between july and october leaving them with less to spend on other items the spike in petrol prices has since been completely unwound giving household budgets some relief combined with the ongoing payments from the families package we expected retail spending to regain some momentum again that turned out to be the case retail sales in the december quarter rose by 1 7 bouncing back by even more than we expected there were gains across most categories including large gains in areas such as supermarkets and dining out it remains true that the pace of growth in retail spending has come off its highs in the last couple of years slowing population growth has been one factor and the household wealth effect is alive and well spending growth has slowed as house price inflation has cooled off both of these factors are likely to weigh further on spending growth in the coming years elsewhere the theme of mixed data continued this week on the positive side building consents were surprisingly strong in january with a 16 jump in seasonally adjusted terms in raw terms the consent numbers were up slightly in what is normally a slow month the monthly gain was very much centred on auckland and was driven by both apartments and standalone houses over 13 200 new homes were consented in auckland in the last year the highest level in several decades the official figures go back to 1990 the number of homes being consented is now roughly in line with changes in the population and with population growth itself set to slow down in the coming years we think the construction cycle is nearing a peak another positive development of sorts was an upgrade to fonterra s farmgate milk price forecast for this season to 6 30 6 60 per kg previously 6 00 6 30 however the higher payout reflects an expected shortfall in milk collections over the remainder of the season as a result of the unusually hot and dry weather over the past month prices in the twicemonthly globaldairytrade auctions have risen by 15 since the start of year which to some degree will already reflect an awareness of the recent climatic conditions nevertheless it will be interesting to see how next week s auction fares after the fonterra announcement the less welcome news this week came from the anz business confidence survey where the modest recovery in confidence we saw over the last quarter of 2018 was unwound in february the survey is not held in january there was a deterioration across most activity indicators including expectations of profitability employment investment and export intentions the results were mixed across sectors with a particularly sharp fall in expectations for firms in the construction sector business confidence has been markedly weaker since the change of government in 2017 much more so than other indicators that point to modest growth in economic activity there has no doubt been an element of protest vote to the survey responses though there were signs that this aspect was easing off by the end of 2018 it will be interesting to see how confidence fares in the march survey after the release of the tax working group s final report which among other things recommended the introduction of a capital gains tax on investment properties farms and businesses next week brings the last of the sectoral surveys that will be used to calculate december quarter gdp including manufacturing wholesaling and building activity notwithstanding the strong retail trade figures the sectoral details that we have to date have been on the soft side we re currently forecasting just a 0 3 rise in gdp but there s a good chance that some of this weakness has just been survey noise or issues of timing our view remains that gdp growth will pick up again over 2019 supported by rising government spending and a lift in construction activity data previews aus q4 company profits mar 4 last 1 9 wbc f c 1 0 mkt f c 3 0 range 0 5 to 4 7 profits are advancing boosted by higher commodity prices in q3 profits rose by 1 9 including a 3 4 increase for mining and around a 1 gain across the broader economy for q4 we anticipate a 1 0 rise in profits as reported by the business indicators survey mining profits will likely post another strong gain up almost 5 in line with higher commodity prices since the low at end 2015 mining profits have jumped by almost 130 for the non mining sectors the loss of economic momentum may have seen profits move sideways that would still leave profits up by more than 20 from end 2015 as to the national accounts estimate of profits which abstracts from variations in the value of inventories we expect a gain in q4 of around 1 8 aus q4 inventories mar 4 last 0 0 wbc f c 0 3 0 1ppt mkt f c 0 3 range 0 0 to 0 8 over the past year inventories increased by a moderate 1 8 in response to rising domestic demand in the june quarter inventories expanded by 0 6 with a lift in mining which more than outweighed a temporary dip in manufacturing and with a 0 7 rise across other sectors for the september quarter inventories are expected to expand further albeit at a marginally slower pace up a forecast 0 5 housing and consumer spending took on a softer tone in the quarter weighing on the need to add to inventories this would see inventories make a very small subtraction from growth in q3 in the order of 0 1ppt aus jan dwelling approvals mar 4 last 8 4 wbc f c 1 0 mkt f c 1 5 range 5 0 to 8 0 dwelling approvals slid sharply into year end declining 8 4 in the final month to be down 26 over the fourth quarter the composition also showed a notable shift with a continued decline in high rise approvals but weakness starting to show through in other segments as well the shorter lags on non high rise work means these declines will likely impact activity through the first three quarters of 2019 high rise approvals are likely to settle around current low levels while there is a risk of a technical bounce following two big negatives we expect the jan update to reflect the one way traffic in housing markets evident through late 2018 on balance we expect jan to show a 1 decline as always risks are compounded by the very low activity over the holiday season which means moves can be significantly amplified by seasonal adjustment aus q4 net exports ppt s cont n mar 5 last 04 wbc f c 0 1 mkt f c 0 1 range 0 4 to 0 2 net exports were a positive in q3 adding 0 4ppts to growth this was despite flat exports and was driven by a 1 5 dip in import volumes for q4 net exports are likely to be a negative a small one subtracting 0 1ppt from activity export volumes appear to have stalled for a second quarter the drought is a material headwind falls in rural goods exports led by cereals is offsetting gains in services and manufactures while resources remain patchy constrained by supply disruptions import volumes appear to have advanced modestly up around 0 6 we estimate aus q4 current account audbn mar 5 last 10 7 wbc f c 9 4 mkt f c 9 2 range 11 5 to 8 5 australia s current account deficit is relatively well contained currently at 2 2 of gdp in the september quarter well below the post 1990s average of 4 2 in q3 the deficit was 10 7bn with a trade surplus of 6 6bn since revised lower to 5 8bn and an income deficit of 16 9bn well up from 13 7bn a year earlier for q3 the current account deficit is expected to narrow a little to a forecast 9 4bn the trade surplus widened to 8 5bn key to this improvement export earnings were boosted by higher commodity prices the terms of trade rose by around 2 5 we estimate the net income deficit is expected to widen further to 17 9bn as the higher commodity prices boost returns to foreign investors in the mining sector aus q4 public demand

pound sterling forecast to end the week around 1 1 5 higher vs us dollar and euro on diminishing risks of a no deal at the end of march the us dollar strengthened after q4 gdp figures beat market expectations japanese yen drops overnight pound sterling given lifeline as labour suggest they may support may s deal in exchange for a public vote the pound to euro exchange rate is 0 01 lower 1 16621 today the pound to us dollar exchange rate is 0 08 lower 1 32543 today overnight it was a surprisingly bombastic open to the asian session of trade overnight as the japanese yen weakened and the nikkei 225 japanese stock index roared higher analyst view marshall gittler chief strategist head of education acls global was the big loser of the day the yen s decline started with the gdp figures which sent usd jpy up sharply the pair continued to climb during the day helped by higher us bond yields widening the gap with jpy yields plus the news that the us administration was shelving the higher tariffs on chinese goods until further notice that outweighed the apparent increase in us north korean tensions caused by the collapse of the trump kim summit today s movement shows how much jpy is moved by sentiment and yield spreads rather than economic fundamentals of japan the shelving of china tariffs should be good news for japan which sends 23 of its exports to china more than to the us 19 because a healthy chinese economy is good for japanese exports it also suggests that trump may not be as tough on japanese car exports as he had threatened furthermore the markit caixin china manufacturing pmi out this morning rose far more than expected to 49 9 from 48 3 48 5 expected which is also good news on the china front the collapse of the trump kim summit might have been a negative for jpy but today s 0 5 rise in the topix index suggests people in japan aren t that worried about it although korea s kospi index was down 1 8 indicating that people in korea may have taken a more serious view of it advertisement crude oil while the australian dollar aud and new zealand dollar nzd also bounced considering that the trump kim meeting achieved absolutely nothing it was perhaps the fact that the chinese manufacturing index beat forecasts that investors felt so positive heading into the weekend the day ahead there is plenty of exciting data released today which could easily generate some serious volatility in fx markets to get the ball rolling in europe there is german and swiss retail sales with the former likely to have an impact on the value of the eur euro there is also some uk manufacturing data capped off by the overall pmi for manufacturing across the eurozone which is also significant for the euro but the most important data is the cpi inflation given the outlook for interest rates the final markit manufacturing pmis for the eurozone and the us are usually little changed from the initial ones so we can basically ignore them and just go straight to the uk manufacturing pmi it s expected to continue to move lower after the surprising jumps in november and december last year gbp negative analyst preview lloyds bank in the eurozone a flurry of first estimates of national february cpi yesterday including from the big four economies allowed markets to better size up the bloc s flash cpi estimate which is due today the fall in global oil prices has had a big impact on the headline reading in recent months with the measure having fallen from 2 2 y y last october to 1 4 in january the recent recovery in energy markets however suggests that this downward impulse may have run its course for now overall we anticipate eurozone cpi to have edged up to 1 5 y y in february while the core measure excluding food and energy remains relatively subdued at 1 1 y y the weakness of core inflation despite a tighter labour market has surprised policymakers for now clearly ecb officials are in no hurry to raise rates especially given the faltering economic momentum in recent months in the north american session canadian gdp is awaited while the federal reserve s preferred inflationary indicator pce data is hotly anticipated for dollar traders friday s are often packed with data and today will be no different with plenty to move the eur usd exchange rate foreign exchange markets the british pound to dollar exchange rate lost ground on thursday as gbp usd slipped back beneath 1 33 in what many cited as simply a correction after a great run for the uk currency into what has proven to be a tough technical level the developments in parliament generally have been viewed constructively and the latest headlines are that labour may be prepared to back theresa may s deal if it is put to a public vote from a political perspective this is absolute genius as its almost impossible for may to deny this as her deal is doomed and polling suggests that the public would then probably vote remain it s a fascinating twist and one i would expect would to possibly be construed positively for cable moving forward in their daily fx forecast analysts at lloyds believe that the current weakness in the pound is unlikely to continue and expect the currency to push back towards the mid 1 30s intra day momentum is looking to unwind from overbought so we have to allow for a consolidation phase perhaps as low as 1 3240 20 however all indicators are positive for an extension of this week s rally with 1 3410 1 3500 and 1 3640 the next upside targets only a decline through 1 3175 1 3100 support at this stage would suggest we have seen a false break and return us to the previous range trading environment medium term while over 1 3100 we see potential for a shift into a higher range between this support and 1 40 1 45 it seems like the machinations of politics are driving parliament to a democratic and appropriate ending to this saga and this can only be a good thing with labour behind her deal which is rather soft the pound can avoid a hard exit and if the people vote remain the pound is likely undervalued latest exchange rates 01 03 2019

with respect to non gaap measures in addition to reported ifrs measures the following non gaap measures are commonly used by canadian real estate investment trusts as an indicator of financial performance gaap means the generally accepted accounting principles described by the cpa canada handbook accounting which are applicable as at the date on which any calculation using gaap is to be made artis applies ifrs which is the section of gaap applicable to publicly accountable enterprises these non gaap measures are not defined under ifrs and are not intended to represent operating profits for the period or from a property nor should any of these measures be viewed as an alternative to net income cash flow from operations or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with ifrs readers should be further cautioned that the following measures as calculated by artis may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers proportionate share the reit has properties held in its investments in joint ventures which are accounted for using the equity method in its consolidated financial statements in accordance with ifrs amounts presented on a proportionate share basis include artis interest in properties held in its joint ventures based on its percentage of ownership in these properties in addition to the amounts per its consolidated financial statements management is of the view that presentation on a proportionate share basis is meaningful for investors as it is representative of how artis manages its properties as well as certain operating and financial metrics artis does not independently control its unconsolidated joint ventures and the presentation of pro rata assets liabilities revenue and expenses may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of the reit s interest in its joint ventures unless otherwise noted comparative period amounts have been updated to reflect the current period s presentation property net operating income property noi artis calculates property noi as revenues less property operating expenses such as utilities repairs and maintenance and realty taxes property noi does not include charges for interest or other expenses not specific to the day to day operation of the reit s properties management considers property noi to be a valuable measure for evaluating the operating performance of the reit s properties same property noi artis calculates same property noi by including property noi for investment properties that were owned for a full quarterly reporting period in both the current and comparative year and excludes properties held for re development adjustments are made to this measure to exclude non cash revenue items and other non recurring revenue amounts such as lease termination income management considers same property noi to be a valuable measure for evaluating the operating performance of the reit s properties due to changes in occupancy rental rates and the recovery of property operating expenses and realty taxes funds from operations ffo artis calculates ffo in accordance with the guidelines set out by the real property association of canada realpac as issued in february 2018 management considers ffo to be a valuable recurring earnings measure for evaluating the reit s operating performance as it adjusts net income for gains or losses that are not recurring in nature such as fair value gains or losses on investment properties adjusted funds from operations affo artis calculates affo in accordance with the guidelines set out by realpac as issued in february 2018 management considers affo to be a valuable recurring earnings measure for evaluating the reit s operating performance ffo and affo payout ratios artis calculates ffo and affo payout ratios by dividing the distributions per common unit by diluted ffo per unit and diluted affo per unit respectively over the same period management uses the ffo and affo payout ratios to measure the reit s ability to pay distributions earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda interest coverage ratio artis calculates ebitda as net income adjusted for interest expense transaction costs income taxes and all non cash revenue and expense items management considers this ratio to be a valuable measure of artis ability to service the interest requirements on its outstanding debt debt to gross book value gbv artis calculates gbv based on the total consolidated assets of the reit adding back the amount of accumulated depreciation of property and equipment the reit has adopted debt to gbv as an indebtedness ratio used to measure its leverage debt to ebitda ratio artis calculates debt to ebitda based on annualizing the current quarter s ebitda as defined above and comparing that balance to artis total outstanding debt management considers this ratio to be a valuable measure of artis leverage net asset value nav per unit artis calculates nav per unit as its unitholders equity adjusted for the outstanding face value in canadian dollars of its preferred units divided by its total number of dilutive units outstanding

and bill holden executive vice president and chief financial officer we have a few additional senior executives in the room to address questions in the second part of today s call as necessary before

results to differ materially from those projected or implied further our earnings release slide presentation and discussions on the call will include certain non gaap financial measures for such measures reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap measure are in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation i will now turn the call over to curt morgan to kick off our discussion curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer thank you molly and good morning to everyone on the call as always we appreciate your interest in vistra energy turning to slide six i m happy to announce today that vistra concluded the year reporting adjusted ebitda from its ongoing operations of 2 809 billion results that are both above consensus as well as slightly above our 2018 guidance midpoint of 2 8 billion when compared against our original 2018 guidance which utilized in october 2017 curves we finished the year more than 180 million above the comparable midpoint vistra achieved these results through strong cost management across all markets which helped to offset a relatively mild august in ercot in fact as you can see on the next slide vistra finished 2018 25 million ahead of plan on achieving its dynegy merger ebitda value lever targets 20 million of which we realized in the year this relentless focus on cost management flow through to various capital projects we had forecast for 2018 the vistra operating teams exhibited meaningful capex spending discipline throughout the year enabling vistra to achieve ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth of 1 611 billion results that were 61 million above the high end of our guidance range reflecting an ebitda to free cash flow conversion ratio of nearly 60 for the year since the close of the dynegy merger in april of 2018 we have developed an understanding of the operations and maintenance expenses and capital expenditures necessary to maintain the fleet of generation assets that we project will allow us to uphold this spending discipline into the future including the cumulative impact of the partial buybacks of the odessa power plant earn out vistra s adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations would have been 2 791 billion and its adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations would have been 1 589 billion as a reminder when we executed the odessa earn out buybacks which we view as a growth expenditure the economic benefit net of the premium paid was approximately 25 million which we largely locked in around the time of the buyback execution before we turn to our dynegy merger synergy tracking update i want to briefly highlight our recent retail growth initiatives as i m sure you are all aware earlier this month we announced that we executed an agreement to purchase crius energy trust an retail energy provider with approximately 1 million residential customer equivalent in 19 states and the district of columbia we estimate the purchase at approximately four times ev to ebitda and we project the acquisition will be immediately accretive to ebitda and free cash flow per share the transaction meets our internal investment return threshold and is expected to further improve our free cash flow conversion ratio as we estimate the crius portfolio will convert approximately 90 of its ebitda to free cash flow as i m sure everyone on this call is also aware we did increase our purchase price for crius due to an unexpected and hostile bid for the company while unfortunate especially because this hostile bidder had an opportunity to be the successful bidder in the competitive auction process conducted by crius leading up to the signing of our agreement we continue to believe crius is attractive to vistra at this new price point it is not our desire to get into a bidding war we have put in place stronger breakup protections and together with crius are moving quickly to obtain all necessary approvals including the shareholder approval to close the transaction both of which support our bid over any potential future hostile one any hostile bidder that would step in to the process now would have to justify the higher price including the increased termination fee and the delay in the approvals in overall closing timeline a tough thing to accomplish in our view i would also like to emphasize that we are fully prepared to take any necessary legal action that we believe is available to us to defend our acquisition of crius against any efforts by the hostile bidder to disrupt and interfere with our acquisition jim will provide more details about this transaction later on the call but suffice it to say we are very excited about the quality of the crius portfolio and its strategic fit with our existing integrated platform last i m excited to announce that our retail team grew organically residential customer counts in ercot by approximately 15 000 customers in 2018 this is the first year the team has achieved net growth on an organic basis since 2008 a tremendous outcome for the team and further proof that our marketing programs and customer satisfaction and service efforts in the ercot market have been effective let s now turn to slide seven for an update on our progress achieving the dynegy merger value lever targets on our last earnings call in november we increased our synergy value lever target to 290 million from 275 million and we increased our operations performance initiative value lever targets to 275 from 225 million we are reaffirming these ebitda value lever targets today anticipating we will achieve the full run rate of 565 million ebitda per year by the end of 2020 i am happy to report as you can see on slide seven that we finished 2018 tracking ahead of schedule captured these merger value levers realizing a 195 million of ebitda targets in 2018 ahead of our initial forecast by 20 million we achieved a run rate of 385 million by the end of 2018 25 million ahead of our plan last as a result of our latest balance sheet optimization transaction that closed earlier this month we have increased our forecast annual after tax free cash flow benefits by another 15 million to 310 million we continue to believe there could be upside to the 275 million op target so stay tuned for further updates on this topic in the second half of the year moving on to 2019 as you can see on slide eight we are reaffirming our 2018 adjusted ebitda and adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance for our ongoing operations we are calling 2019 the year of execution as we complete the full integration of dynegy merger and capture the value levers implement our capital allocation plans and hit our targeted numbers of course closing and integrating crius will be important as well we do not expect to update 2019 guidance to reflect the pending crius acquisition until after the acquisition closes which we estimate will be in the second quarter of this year perhaps even as early as april given that the crius unitholder vote is scheduled for march 28 and as i mentioned earlier the teams have already filed for the regulatory approvals we do not expect any issues with obtaining regulatory approvals from the doj or ferc importantly our 2019 ongoing operations adjusted ebitda guidance range of 3 22 billion to 3 42 billion and our 2019 ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance range of 2 1 billion to 2 3 billion represent a free cash flow conversion ratio of approximately 66 as bill will discuss later we are significantly hedged in 2019 and have materially increased our hedges in 2020 we purposely have dry powder available in ercot in 2020 given our expectation at the more significant move in ercot prices due to the ordc change will occur in that year i ve said it before and i ll say it again the 66 free cash flow conversion ratio yield is a highly attractive feature of our company and significantly higher than that of other commodity based capital intensive energy industries as a result we continue to believe that vistra s valuation should shift away from the historical ev to ebitda multiples which no longer reflect the value proposition of the sector for the free cash flow yield valuation metric at a proper yield we believe our future valuation will eventually reflect this new reality as the financial markets continue to gain confidence in the new integrated power company model with the attractive features of low leverage low cost and industry leading retail operations paired with in the money generation all leading to relative earnings stability beyond 2019 we anticipate our integrated business model will enable us to continue to realize relative earnings stability as we are expecting 2020 adjusted ebitda to be approximately flat to 2019 our expectation for generally consistent adjusted ebitda year over year is a marked improvement from dynegy s pre merger forecast which reflected declining ebitda in 2020 and 2021 due principally to lower capacity revenues in pjm through curve improvements changes to the operating reserve demand curve in ercot and enhanced management expectations for merger value lever achievement the previous dynegy declining ebitda forecast now reflects expected ebitda strength and stability in the near term we are continuing to focus on achieving our financial and leverage target returning capital to shareholders and meeting or exceeding our merger synergy targets as it relates to returning capital to shareholders our capital allocation plan remains on track as of february 2015 we had executed a total of 937 million of our aggregate 1 75 billion share repurchase program authorization slightly ahead of where we thought we would be at this point in time because market technicals gave us an opportunity to repurchase shares at an attractive price at the end of 2018 we now have 486 million shares outstanding as of february 15th a 7 reduction as compared to the number of shares outstanding at the time the dynegy merger closed with 813 million still available for opportunistic repurchases on the program under the program so long as our stock is trading at such a high free cash flow yield and what we believe is a meaningful discount to fair value we expect we will continue to allocate capital toward share repurchases we also announced earlier this week that our board has declared vistra s initial quarterly dividend of 0 125 per share or 0 50 per share on an annualized basis the dividend is payable on march 29 2019 to shareholders of record as of march 15 2019 management expects to grow the dividend at an annual rate of approximately 6 to 8 per share as a reminder the payment of the dividend of this size represents just more than 10 of vistra s forecast 2019 free cash flow before growth from the consolidated business and less than 35 of forecast 2019 free cash flow before growth from our stable retail operations we believe our targeted 6 to 8 per share dividend growth rate is supported by our projected free cash flow including tuck in ebitda growth initiatives such as our recently announced moss landing battery storage project and the crius acquisition importantly the crius acquisition is not expected to delay vistra s achievement of its long term leverage target of 2 5 times net debt to ebitda by year end 2020 balance sheet strength is a core tenet of vistra s operating model and we plan to manage our business and cash flows accordingly we believe the execution of our diverse capital allocation plan will continue to attract new long term investors while providing our shareholders with an attractive total shareholder return over the years in fact we now consider 15 out of our top 20 shareholders to be long term investors and vanguard and fidelity are now our second and third largest shareholders respectively replacing apollo and oaktree before i turn the call over to jim to discuss highlights of our planned crius acquisition i would like to spend a few minutes giving a market update in january the public utility commission of texas approved important updates to ercot scarcity pricing formula known as the operating reserve demand curve or the ordc the update simplify the ordc from 24 different curves for different seasons and time of day to a single curve and shifted the loss of load probability by half a standard deviation in two steps a quarter of a standard deviation in 2019 and another quarter of standard deviation in 2020 what all this means in plain english is that the market participants should expect to see modestly higher prices during peak periods as the scarcity pricing formula should now better price in the risk of load shedding events the goal of the market changes was twofold to better reflect significantly higher reliability risk in the market as well as to provide better price signals with an aim to help avoid additional retirements from marginal generators and to support new investment in generating capacity we are fully supportive of the market changes as ensuring ercot has sufficient generating capacity to meet texans demand for electricity is critical to the reputation of the growing texas economy we estimate the potential impact of these changes to the around the clock forward curves could be approximately 2 to 3 per megawatt hour in 2019 and approximately 3 to 4 per megawatt hour in 2020 modest overall increases in price that should support generation investment in the market while not meaningfully increasing the price of power to texas consumers it is difficult to estimate the potential impact of these changes to vistra as it is difficult to discern how the forward markets have already responded and will react in response to the new market design assuming the market fully values the impact of these changes and appreciates the risks inherent in the tight reserve margins forecasted we expect vistra could see upside in 2020 where we are much less hedged than in 2019 in fact some of the improved 2020 outlook that flattens ebitda is due to the ordc improvements we have hedged some of our open position as we believe the 2020 forward curves had moved up in anticipation of the puc s potential action especially prior to the action as there was speculation of a larger move we believe this action by the public utility commission of texas was a necessary step to ensure the long term success of the texas competitive electric market and we continue to like our meaningful position in the ercot market where we forecast we will drive more than half of our ebitda in 2019 it is the right move balancing the need to support new and existing assets and cost to customers with the end result of maintaining a healthy supply demand balance another market update has occurred since our last earnings call the clearing of the most recent iso new england capacity auction this year s auction cleared at a price of 3 80 per kw month down from 4 63 in the last year s auction despite the lower price vistra cleared nearly 500 more megawatts in the current auction making the estimated negative impact of vistra of the lower clearing price approximately 16 million or less than 0 5 of vistra s forecast 2019 adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations while the lower clearing price in the auction is certainly not ideal it is relatively immaterial to vistra given the diversity of our revenue sources from energy capacity and retail in multiple competitive electric markets across the us more fundamentally we continue to be confounded that anyone will be able to raise capital to finance a new gas plant in iso new england at a capacity price of only 3 80 a kw month as many of you know a new 650 megawatt combined cycle plant cleared the latest capacity auction for calendar years 2020 and 2023 i cannot emphasize this point enough since the restructuring of the power markets began in the late 1990s we are hard pressed to find merchant power plants with the original equity owner received an adequate return and many suffered financial distress and bankruptcy rather it is the developers who earned sizable upfront fees to site permit to construct new thermal resources that make money leaving the third party debt and equity investors owning an uneconomic asset one can only hope this reality will start to sink in with the financial community so debt and equity investors stop making irrational investments like this latest gas plant slated for development in iso new england our analysis suggests that the entire equity and likely some portion of the debt will be underwater the day the iso new england plant is put into operation if it ever is in our view something is wrong with the market design that allows a plant like this to clear and suppress prices with a high probability it never gets built the last relevant market update is of course the status of the pending pjm capacity auction reforms unfortunately we don t have much to say on this topic as the devil will really be in the details after we hear from first however we continue to believe the outcome of any capacity market reforms will be at worst neutral to the current state recall that in june of 2018 ferc labeled the existing pjm capacity auction is unjust and unreasonable given the impact of subsidized resources have on the auction as a result it would seem very counterintuitive to ferc s original intent to land at an outcome that is meaningfully worse for existing generators history tells us that ferc has consistently promoted balanced market reforms that support competitive markets which by the way is their first order of priority despite political affiliation states can formulate their own energy policy but they cannot destroy competitive markets in doing so like all of you we are anxiously awaiting ferc s decision on this issue and remain cautiously optimistic for a constructive outcome we continue to believe that vistra will be in a position to provide relatively robust and stable earnings in the years to come given our strong balance sheet low cost integrated operations in the money generating fleet and market leading retail operations which are about to become even more diverse with the closing of the pending crius acquisition on that note i will turn the call over to jim burke to talk a bit more about the crius transaction jim burke executive vice president and chief operating officer thank you curt turning to slide 11 as you can see from the high level bullets on the slide we are very excited about the strategic fit of the crius portfolio with vistra s existing retail and generation platform importantly as curt mentioned at the beginning of the call we believe the economics of this transaction are very attractive and exceeding our internal investment threshold and valued at approximately at four times enterprise value to ebitda multiple pro forma for the full run rate of forecasted synergies in fact as a national integrated power company with generation retail assets in multiple states vistra is uniquely positioned to create value with the crius platform we project we ll be able to achieve approximately 15 million in annual ebitda synergies and approximately 12 million in additional annual free cash flow synergies following the closing of the transaction the acquisition will also accelerate vistra s previously announced organic growth strategy enabling us to forego approximately 29 million of expenditures through 2023 from this effort financial benefits aside we are particularly excited about this transaction as a result of the quality of the portfolio we will be acquiring the crius portfolio has recognized established brands market leading attrition rates and a demonstrated track record of successful customer acquisition through multiple sales channels the portfolio complements vistra s long generation position in the midwest and northeast markets and as just mentioned will accelerate organic growth strategy in these regions in addition the composition of the portfolio is largely residential and small business should command a higher multiple due to the inherently higher margins in these segments let s dive a bit deeper into some of these points on the next slide crius with this approximately 1 million residential customer equivalents has demonstrated success with its high growth high margin retail strategy focusing on higher value residential and small business customers crius has an impressive track record of new customer gains through various sales channels across multiple brands and it s attrition rates are the lowest among the peers in the markets where it operates crius has been successful in its customer acquisition and retention efforts as a result of leveraging its diverse sales channels and exclusive partnership strategies these partnerships strategies are primarily executed through its energy rewards platform where crius partners with established providers to cross sell its retail electricity offerings these integrated energy platform offerings will expand vistra s existing sales and marketing channels enhancing its strategic fit with our organization following the acquisition vistra will have a retail presence in 19 states in the district of columbia with dual energy market offerings in many states as you can see on slide 13 vistra will now have a retail gas product portfolio in 13 states which we believe will be a great addition to our existing operations retail gas tends to have similar margins as electricity but gas customers tend to be a bit stickier as bill size is often meaningfully lower in this segment due to lower overall volumes being able to sell a customer two services electricity and gas leverages the cost of acquisition by adding incremental margin to the customer relationship in addition retail gas is a naturally synergistic business for vistra as we are already one of the largest purchasers of natural gas in the country to give you a bit of background on how the retail gas business works the local utilities are responsible for ensuring that natural gas can be delivered to residents in their service territories as a result the local utilities contract for the necessary gas pipeline and transport capacity as well as for local gas storage and allocate the applicable transportation and storage assets to entities providing the retail gas product to the end users vistra therefore will only be responsible for procuring and delivering the actual commodity which is very easy for us to do in an affordable manner because we already are a bulk purchaser of natural gas necessary for the operation of our gas plants in short though the retail gas portfolio is only approximately 15 of the crius retail business by volume we find it to be a nice strategic fit for our organization and we are excited to meaningfully expand our retail gas operations at the transaction close finally one of the greatest benefit of the crius transaction is the incremental retail load vistra will be acquiring which meaningfully improves our expected generation to load match including the default service load vistra has contracted we forecast we will be nearly 50 matched in 2019 with approximately 90 of that forecast load being sold through our preferred retail channel as we depict on the right hand side of slide 14 our commercial team can sell vistra s long generation through three primary channels directly to one of our retail subsidiaries to utilities in default service auctions or directly to third parties in the wholesale markets of these channels we prefer selling our leg directly to our own retail subsidiaries as we are able to eliminate transaction cost leakage on the bid ask spread and reduce the total cost of collateral postings the other sales channels are effective but marginally less attractive with sales through default service auctions and third party sales in the wholesale markets being the next most attractive channels in that order the incremental load we will be acquiring with the crius acquisition is primarily located in the midwest and northeast markets which is exactly where we are planning to focus our organic growth efforts giving us establish brands sales channels and infrastructure as a platform for this organic growth over the last several weeks the vistra management team has been working diligently with crius to ensure a smooth transition as our teams have continued the interface and share best practices we re even more excited about this transaction the crius and vistra teams emphasize a high performance culture with a primary focus on the customer i have no doubt that crius operations are the right fit for our organization and i look forward to announcing the closing of the deal hopefully in the second quarter i am hopeful we can quickly close the transaction to avoid any further disruption that has the potential to erode the value of the business i will now turn the call over to bill holden to cover fourth quarter and full year financial results j william holden executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you jim turning now to slide 16 as curt mentioned vistra concluded 2018 delivering 2 809 billion of adjusted ebitda from our ongoing operations these results reflect a full year of operations from legacy vistra and results from the legacy dynegy operations for the period from april 9 2018 through december 31 2018 including the negative 18 million net impact of the partial buybacks of the odessa power plant earn out that we executed in february and may vistra s adjusted ebitda from its ongoing operations would have been 2 791 billion for the year vistra s strong results coming in above consensus and just above the midpoint of management guidance were directly attributable to robust cost management across all markets offsetting a relatively mild august in ercot retail also exceeded management expectations for the year driven by residential customer count growth and margin and cost management for the full year caiso exceeded expectations due to favorable prices higher generation volumes and lower sg a expenses while pjm was also favorable as a result of the nepco plant retirement and subsequent move to the asset closures segment vistra s 2018 adjusted free cash flow before growth from its ongoing operations was 1 611 billion which as curt mentioned is 61 million above the high end of management s prior guidance range the favorable results are primarily attributable to capex spend discipline during the year including the negative 22 million net impact of the partial buybacks of the odessa power plant earn out vistra s 2018 adjusted free cash flow before growth from its ongoing operations would have been 1 589 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018 vistra s adjusted ebitda from its ongoing operations was 719 million or 721 million including the positive 2 million net impact of the partial buybacks of the odessa power plant earn out both segment results for the quarter can be found on slide 22 in the appendix as curt mentioned today we re also reaffirming our 2019 guidance ranges and we still believe 2020 adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations is tracking relatively flat to 2019 our confidence in our 2019 guidance ranges and the improvement in our 2020 outlook is due in large part to the incremental hedges we have added for those years as you can see on slide 17 and 18 as of december 31 2018 we were largely hedged for 2019 in our core markets of ercot pjm and iso new england and as of last week we re nearly fully hedged in these markets for the year similarly as of december 31 2018 we were largely hedged for natural gas in ercot in 2020 and we improved our ercot heat rate position to 42 from 28 at september 30 also in the fourth quarter of 2018 we improved our new york new england and pjm hedge percentages by 8 and 32 respectively as our commercial strategy is to take advantage of the volatility in forward curves the hedge prices that are at or above our fundamental point of view we have improved the 2020 hedge percentages even further in the first two months of 2019 the 48 for ercot heat rate to 32 and 66 for new york new england and pjm respectively we expect our hedging activities to further lock in a stable ebitda profile for the business in the out years finally let s turn to slide 19 for a brief capital structure update as you can see in the table vistra had approximately 11 1 billion of long term debt outstanding as of december 31 2018 reflecting debt reduction as a result of approximately 120 million of open market repurchases of senior notes in the fourth quarter in february of this year we completed a bond issue and senior notes tender offer and redemption that reduced our annual interest expense by 20 million on a pre tax basis we will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our balance sheet and reduce our total debt as we work toward achieving our long term leverage target of 2 5 times net debt to ebitda by year end 2020 and as curt mentioned we have now executed approximately half of our aggregate authorized 1 75 billion share repurchase program leaving approximately 813 million available as of february 15 2019 following our share repurchases vistra had 486 million shares outstanding as of the same date despite our stock price recently achieving a new 52 week high we continue to view our stock price as undervalued as a result we expect we will continue to allocate capital toward opportunistic share repurchases under our existing program as previously announced our diverse capital allocation program is in full swing as we initiated our dividend program this month continue to repurchase shares under our authorized share repurchase program delever and execute on tuck in growth opportunities including the moss landing battery storage project and the crius acquisition all of this is possible because of the relatively stable ebitda and meaningful cash free cash flow generated by our integrated operations we will continue to focus on execution and delivering on our commitments in 2019 all in an effort to create value for our investors with that operator we are now ready to open the lines for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of greg gordon with evercore isi greg your line is open greg gordon evercore isi analyst sorry i did hop on the call just a tad late so if i m asking you the question you already answered my apologies when you talk about the upside that you think you see in ercot from the change in the ordc rules how much of that do you think is already priced into the curves and how much of that do you think is needs to be sort of validated by volatility that we might see this summer that would cause the curves to move to where you think intrinsic value is curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes so this may be more than your marketing for but i think it s worth just talking about how the curves have moved greg back after the summer we came out there was a lot of chatter about needing to improve the ordc or some other reform as you may recall and then there was chatter out there that there maybe a one standard deviation move no discussion about whether it be a single curve or the 24 curves but we were pretty certain at that point in time some amount of that was factored into the curves i think people felt like there was a high probability that something would get done we took some advantage of that in particular a little bit in 2020 but a little bit also we had some 2019 still low but we took advantage of it and then if you remember there was two or three times that the puct sort of put it up on the schedule and then delayed it i think curves kind of drifted off a little bit because there were some uncertainty around it and of course we finally got it through and then there was a response pretty positive response after that and the reason i tell you all that is that i think it has ebbed and flowed and then recently and this is not this is pretty typical it s kind of the curves have kind of drifted off a little bit and it happens sort of this time of the year i fully expect that as we get closer to the summer we see a our first hot day and people start to see how the market is going to react then we ll probably see another move up in power prices for 2019 and then typically when you get into 2019 summer if you see a hot summer you ll see 2020 move but as it happened in this year we didn t really have august the summer we thought we would but we still saw a move up in 2019 because as we rolled out liquidity went from 2019 into 2020 so that s a factor but also people realize that reserve margins were actually going to actually go down not up i think we ll see that same thing happened in 2020 so that s a long way of saying that it s hard to really know for sure and i m not trying to avoid the question it s just very hard to know but i would say right now there s room to move in both the 2019 and the 2020 curves for summer of 2019 and 2020 respectively just where the curves are today that s partly just due to just how the market tends to move but it s also i think the market has not fully realized the impact of the ordc i think one thing is probably still being digested but this is all kind of esoteric stuff at the end of the day is this whole single curve versus multiple curves and basically it really comes down to this loss of load probability and the mean of the loss of load probability and if it s on a single curve versus multiple curves the standard deviation around that mean is actually higher which means the effect of the 0 2 or the 0 5 is actually higher than it would have been if it was under multiple curves i m not sure the market has digested it because i don t know if they really know how that s all going to play out so i think this may be a little bit of wait and see to that we re going to need to see how the market reacts i think if the market is a little bit warm and we start to see scarcity in the ordc it comes into play i think you can really see 2020 and 2021 off to the races so i think some of this is going to be driven a little bit by how weather turns out but we do believe there is still some upside around the ordc given where the curves are currently greg gordon evercore isi analyst great and bill could you reiterate where you said you are in terms of how much you ve hedged for 2020 in ercot i presume you used those those intermittent run ups as opportunities but also can you i think you guys do when you talk about hedging that s net of a significant amount of megawatts that you hold back and take the spot during the summer to sort of self hedge so can you just talk about that as well so we can understand how much exposure you have if the curves do move in your favor j william holden executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so the hedging that we ve done through our 2020 since the end of the year would take us up the 48 hedge against our ercot heat rate curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer and that s it in what you re building j william holden executive vice president and chief financial officer and that s for 2020 curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes 2020 greg gordon evercore isi analyst okay so you re but that s so you re 52 open but aren t you do i need to sort of take into account the fact that you re holding back like 1 200 megawatts or does that taken into account in that hedge percentage curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer i can this is steve muscato steve muscato here so go ahead steve muscato senior vice president and chief commercial officer yes this is steve muscato the way to think about it is yes we do hold back some generation for basically potential outages or weather changes that make our load move up pretty rapidly with temperature the way to think about it is is it gives us the opportunity to capture any deviations between the day ahead in a real time because if the day ahead clears at a particular level we could typically cover our low changes in the day ahead which then gives us a lot of that open generation for changes in the real time market so that s curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer can we just greg just asked a second question in our hedge percentage does it include the 12 50 ph in it so they are open position or not i think it does multiple speakers so greg is just asking is that against that because you know you ve got this hold back and it does include it greg gordon evercore isi analyst okay that s clear guys curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer one other thing just to tell you we ve sort of purposely held some open here in 2020 because i think if i pick that up from what i was saying is that we think there s room to move pretty significant room to move in 2020 is we don t see it s hard to see that much new build coming on and between now and 2020 so and we re also don t think that the market has fully absorbed the ordc effect but we do think there is a movement and so that we have we re kind of sitting a little bit on 2020 if the curves move you should expect us and they move up you should expect us probably to take some more off if they don t then we re going to be patient greg gordon evercore isi analyst great one more quick question for you maybe a curve ball because i don t know you probably didn t see it but nrg in their release this morning talked about how they are reducing their net debt to ebitda target to between 2 5 times and 2 75 times so they are coming down to sort of where you guys already are in terms of your net debt to ebitda aspirations and they re explicitly targeting eventually getting to an investment grade credit rating so can you just reiterate because it seems like in terms of people had been pushing you in the past sort of why don t you go toward nrg and go to three times and buy back more stock but now it seems like nrg has figured out that they need to come in your direction so can you just reiterate what your aspirations are in terms of capital allocation credit metrics and do you aspire also to ultimately get to ig jim burke executive vice president and chief operating officer yes so look the first thing i d say is imitation is this sincerest form of flattery so but more importantly into the point we ve been pretty steadfast and we did move and you know this we did move getting to 2 5 times out a year because we felt like this is where our stock was trading that made sense to reallocate capital in 2019 and so we did do that but we are absolutely committed to get to 2 5 times and we believe i think it s going to take time i think the first step is actually to get an upgrade from where we are today i think that s squarely in our sides and i think we executed that will happen and that will then lead us to the position where we can get investment grade we do want to get to investment grade the credit spreads at least today probably don t say that that s something that s a big deal but it s not about that i think it would be good for the equity and also would open up opportunities on our commercial industrial retail business where at times we have to sleeve or we may not even get to see the business so there is a business proposition in here and i think this is reason one of the reasons i believe we have such a high free cash flow yield is the risk premium in our business i think that has been driven in the past over time because we carried too much leverage and there was the risk of financial distress in these stocks and i think we want to put that completely in our rear view mirror and i think 2 5 times is a right place to get to have that discussion with the agencies and then we ll see what we do from there but we feel like given the metrics at that 2 5 times and just the absolute level of debt it feels to us like that s the right place to be in order to have a serious discussion about investment grade greg gordon evercore isi analyst right and then that drives a lower free cash flow yield and a higher share price so that s sort of the magic potion of multiple speakers jim burke executive vice president and chief operating officer yes exactly right you got it greg gordon evercore isi analyst i ve taken way too much times guys i ll hop off thank you curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer alright thanks greg operator your next question comes from the line of abe azar with deutsche bank abe your line is open abe azar deutsche bank securities analyst any thoughts on timing of refinancing the rest of the high cost legacy dynegy debt or any key dates to focus on where some of that debt becomes callable curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes abe so i think in terms of just refinancing the two new bond issues that we did have covered most of the amounts that we would need to refinance with the new money at lower cost so the remaining amount of debt reduction are those the lion s share of it will be done with redemptions from cash i think you can look at when the redemption premium step down i think a large number of some of those are in november each year we would do the math when we re planning getting close to redemption days about whether it makes sense to do it earlier or wait till the step down in the redemption premium but i think we ve laid out in the cap table at the end of the presentation that we re planning to do about 800 million that this year and then the balance of to get to the 2 5 times we would do in 2020 abe azar deutsche bank securities analyst got it and then can you provide an update on the status of the moss landing battery when was spending supposed to ramp up and is there something you re waiting for before putting capital to work there curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes so a good question as you know that s a bit of a fluid situation and with inaudible sort of throwing the it seems in our and bankruptcies in our sector there is an obligatory federal versus state fight that always seems to go on ferc versus the state that s kind of slows some things down and it has created what i d say just a little more hair on how pg e wants to proceed but what i can say abe because we re in constant contact with these guys is one the state wanted this project number two the cpuc approved it number three it doesn t suffer from what others have which is it s not while the other money in fact it was by far the lowest cost deal because of the moss landing site so there is no mark to market gain by rejecting the contract and so what we re hearing from pg e is it s full steam ahead what the real question is is when are they going to assume these types of contracts and they are a little concern i believe in how they re going to handle that given this jurisdictional issue with ferc and the battle is going on there so we re moving forward and we have talked to them they want to move forward in the contract we still have a valid contract it s not been rejected the question is when will it be assumed and we re hopeful that sooner rather than later i think what we have to remember is that we do have a contractual commitment here and then we have to weigh the odds of whether whatever be rejected and at this point in time we feel like it s an extremely low probability that it would be rejected given the discussions that we ve had directly with pg e abe azar deutsche bank securities analyst got it thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of praful mehta with citigroup praful your line is open praful mehta citi research analyst so just following up on moss landing it doesn t sound like the decision to reject or resume is going to be taken anytime soon because they probably have to figure out what the exit looks like it could take time let s just put it that way so if it does take time is the assumption that you would continue on the current course assuming that it will at some point get resumed or do you have to hold and wait for the decision which would slow down the entire process curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes so because we are in active discussion with pg e i don t feel like it would be fair for me to have that discussion but i think your observations are correct that s what i was trying to convey i ll be just very direct about it the assumption of contracts could be pushed out and we have a contract right now the only thing that would change that is if it was rejected i think the likelihood of that is very very low and so we ll work with our board and we ll work with pg e when we get to the point which is going to be in the april to may late april sort of may timeframe where we would have to actually sign the big contract for the equipment and we ll make our decision then what we have to do there is a number of different things we could do either in front of the bankruptcy court or working with pg e in order to make sure that we move forward we re committed to the project i just i can t tell you right now what that ultimate decision will be if we have to then make a decision come may to sign an epc contract or equipment contract and we ll have to we ll have to see what that is and i m going to do the consultation with our we have bankruptcy attorneys onboard because we have to understand the process and so we ll have to consult with them and then ultimately we have to go to the board but most importantly i think it s the active dialog that we have with pg e and working with them on certain things that will give us the comfort that we re going to continue on with this project and have no issues or no risk of rejection all that is still playing out but we intend and we re moving forward and with the intent of completing that project praful mehta citi research analyst understood thanks and then maybe on slide 28 you have these realized estimated power prices and there seems to be now for ercot a 6 forecasted premium that you ve kind of estimated for 2020 i know this number has moved around quite a bit could you just give us some perspective on what that 6 dollars now reflects and there s obviously something iso new england as well so some color on the confidence around that number would be helpful curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes so i just wanted to make sure because this it s easily confusing for me by the way we always struggle with what s the best way to show you guys is kind of information so part of this part of that number is what i d call sort of realized actual realized premium relative to where the market came in and then as it relates now most of it in 2020 obviously all of it is really projected there is a significant amount of option value or extrinsic value that is in the market and we model what that value is relative and you lose that value that value decays over time and then ultimately as you go from real time i mean from they head to real time you don t have that anymore you don t have that flexibility part of it is the value of being able to back down units in times in optimized by buying from the market there is a number of different options that you can that you can go after that we have historically proven that we re able to do it s also our ability to hedge at the periods of time where there s just there s just higher pricing than where spot prices come in and that s why it s so important as a company that we have a point of view and that we hedge when prices are at or above that point of view and they have a very good modeling capability so that we feel comfortable that we are hedging at prices above spot and we ve also had a very good track record of being able to do that so it s a combination of things and steve muscato is here with me steve is there anything you would add to that steve muscato senior vice president and chief commercial officer yes it s basically and i think curt you captured it it s the ability to in essence capture different points along the forward curve that we call extrinsic value selling into strength anytime the price moves up and also as we take the portfolio into the day ahead in real time markets being able to optimize around whatever price signals were given and so it s a combination of existing hedges we have on and a combination of hedges we hope to put on in the future curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer and you know what probably it s a good observation though that value does move around because it s influenced by the volatility in the market and we pull it from forward volatility and so as the market changes now we have our own fundamental view around volatility too which factors in when we hedge steve muscato senior vice president and chief commercial officer correct curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer so it does move around some i think we ve been i think what we ve been able to demonstrate i hope i believe we have is that we ve been able to capture a lot of that along the way as we hedge and so in 2019 we ve locked a lot of that volatility in the reality situation is in an increasing price environment that premium will shrink as you would expect because we re managing risk as much as we are absolute price we re trying to create a stable steady earnings and steady earnings stream and we re not looking for the highs of the highs so you may see that that premium will shrink but once the market plateaus out and it hits sort of the highs of the market then it s much easier than to create that premium and then in the years past when prices were actually declining then that we were able to hedge ahead of some of the declines because again our fundamental view shows that the market was actually on a decline and we went out as fast as we could and tried to hedge as much as we could in the forward market and then that actually proved out to work out for us in a big way so that s kind of how we think about it approaching it steve muscato senior vice president and chief commercial officer and i think you asked about new england as an example we ve all seen a material drop off in gas volatility in new england and so that s really the the component that s impacting the new england pricing going into the winter there was a lot of discussion on what s going to happen in algonquin and obviously algonquin volatility wasn t necessarily it didn t materialize and that s reflected also in the forward market at this point praful mehta citi research analyst got you that s super helpful and clearly your track record helps confirm or at least get comfort around those numbers i guess just one final thing around the shareholder base it was very helpful to hear the change in shareholder base given you have dry powder right now to buy back more shares is there any expectation of any kind of block deal or any broader deal with some of these shareholders are looking to exit are they still looking to exit any color or perspective on that curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer so look i think we i think the big thing is you guys probably saw this i mean with the 13 assets that ph came out we ve seen a dramatic change in our shareholder base obviously since we came out of bankruptcy but even recently we ve got two of the largest shareholders we had number two and number three shareholders that are now down to 60 i think one of them is probably below that at this point in time and then we ve got vanguard and fidelity who have now come up to number two and number three and then when we look at our shareholder base and we couldn t say this come out of bankruptcy i think it was about what molly 16 i think out of the 20 now or 15 sorry 15 out the 20 are what we would consider long term investors people who are coming in because they desire to own the stock in the long run they believe in the strategy and they like the price point they re able to get in on and the other thing i like about is as many of those folks came in at lower levels and have actually increased in a significant way their holdings now we re not done and this is why we are going to be in boston and new york next week we re going to europe we wouldn t even have been able to go to europe had we not had a dividend so that opened up doors in europe we are going to go over there and hopefully get in people interested long investors you guys know this and we went up to canada canada are more long term oriented investors and we re hitting about as every long oriented investors that we can hit and i m doing it personally because i think it s important to hear the story directly from us it s the only way in my mind that you get this rotation and you get it without having your stock price up or as you got to create demand for the stock we can do buybacks we can do all those things but at the end of the day we ve got to create demand and all the way we could create demand is get out and tell the story and i think we ve had really good success on that and i m willing to do whatever it takes and i know bill as well and molly will get out on the road if we have to and we ll talk to anybody that is interested in our stock i think it s the only way we know how to do it praful mehta citi research analyst super helpful guys thanks so much curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of angie storozynski from macquarie angie your line is open angie storozynski macquarie research analyst thank you good morning so two questions the 813 million left for buybacks is there any timeline attached to it is it through the end of 2019 curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer so well this will depend right on just where our stock price is but it s probably it could it could leak into the first quarter of 2020 just and this is all dependent angie and i m not trying to avoid the question it just depends on where our price is because as you probably know we have different volumes of buyback at different price points and so as you might expect our stocks moved up some and so we re buying less at that point in time but i think our projection is it could leak over a little bit into the first quarter of 2012 j william holden executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that s right and angie that s consistent with what we said last quarter we said we thought the program to be completed either q4 of this year or likely q1 of year somewhere in that timeframe depending on where the stock is trading angie storozynski macquarie research analyst okay number two is back in december when we met you guys talked about 2020 ebitda being above 2019 i know that there is upside potential upside to power curves but as they look right now do you still think that 2020 would be above midpoint of your current 2019 guidance curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes so let me it s a good question i want to be clear about this so we re i m not talking about this not including crius so but we see sort of flattish over now over 2019 and 2020 and you know this i think angie but for us that s a big deal because dynegy had a huge cliff because of the pjm per capacity clear and we ve been able to bridge that gap and create a more stable earnings profile now that s driven by value levers from the dynegy merger to some extent it s driven by curves and our ability to hedge some of that so we and that s where we are today i would say that depending on where the curves come in you heard that long winded answer i gave to greg but i do think there could be some upside in the curves i think that is more of a 2020 upside and so it could be we could see some of that in 2020 at this point in time though where we are as we think that you were sort of flattish because part of that when we mark that when we mark that when we didn t gave you that comment and we had marked that particular plan it was including some of the uplifted that had already occurred from the ordc so part of what s getting us to that flattish nature is the higher curves and part of that i believe is some of the expectation of the ordc but there could be some upside i we are going to wait obviously through 2019 when we see the 2020 curves move more significantly to lead that out and of course we ll wait all the way to october november timeframe before we give guidance on 2020 angie storozynski macquarie research analyst okay and my last question just a quick one i know we talked you talked about the battery project the pg e but how do you think about the fact that the project returns most likely you were planning to add some project level debt i would assume that the cost of that debt is now going to go up given that the offtakers credits has plunged so i mean do you still think it s an attractive return taking that into account curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes so first of all we re not going to do project level debt we ve made the decision not to project level financing it i mean i ve been in this industry too long and i remember when everybody was doing project level debts and they got confusing and we don t want a capital structure that s confusing and we like the returns i think we said this when we came out these are on a non levered basis these are returns that are in the mid teens that s very attractive to us and so it will be on balance sheet we still believe in those returns i think it s important to know that it s the absolute so we do benefit from the price or excuse me from revenues from power so we get a resource adequacy payment as part and then we also can optimize using the battery in the energy market the key on that is it doesn t it s not about absolute power price it s about the volatility in power price and our ability when prices in the day are low because there s all this solar generation and other generation and then the solar generation comes off because the sun s going down and goes down and then prices go up it s that arbitrage that occurs in there that we get so prices theoretically could be zero during the day and then 10 or 20 during the night and that s where we capture that value so we feel very comfortable about the value and the returns on this and so nothing has changed in our mind in terms of the value of this and in fact we know that california needs more of this type of investment which actually is an opportunity for us as well but that just gives you a sense of just what the demand is and if there is a higher demand for battery that means that pricing when you go from the heavy solar period to where the sun goes down that means the pricing is going to be high until they get they get all that new capacity on angie storozynski macquarie research analyst very good thank you curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer thanks angie operator your final question comes from the line of julien dumoulin smith with bank of america julien your line is open julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst so a couple of quick ones i make it snappy here so firstly just going back to the hedges just wanted to understand the change in new england the price hedge start on the 2019 just wanted to understand a little bit more detail on that and then also the expected gen moved around a good bit i get that power curves moving that shift things around anything to mention given that it was around it was across all the regions but ercot especially the northeast curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes so on the i think on new england a lot of what you saw there was really the what steve was describing earlier in the extrinsic value has come down because of the lower volatilities and so that s just had the effect of reducing the realized price without having a corresponding benefit from hedges because the extrinsic value is not fully hedged i look at steve on the whether there s anything of note in the volumes steve muscato senior vice president and chief commercial officer yes what we re seeing in volumes as we do as we continue to go through our operational improvements we are seeing some changes in how the fleet runs at night whether they re start based or run based or hours based machines and so that s causing some volume changes that you ll see it s not having material gross margin impact at this point because it s really just whether they run through the night or cycle on and off and one thing i ll add on new england it s really associated with if you look at algonquin pricing it was pretty contained this winter compared to what you ve seen historically during cold snaps like you look at 2014 as an example and that decline in volatility is participating through the market and the big reason for it was there were some lng tankers brought in at the gateway terminal outside of boston so it s something that we have to monitor from year to year how lng impacts that market and perceptions on how it s going to impact that margin j william holden executive vice president and chief financial officer and the only thing i ll just add on to what steve said is some of those price increases were in off peak hours which has affected the dispatch and to the extent we dispatch more in the off peak it lowers the average realized price because we re run that we re earning margin but we re running more at lower price hours julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it alright excellent and then lastly just real quickly on the illinois situation obviously you are somewhat dynamic and fluid here given the mps and the prospects of legislation and your own process on examining the portfolio can you give us a little bit of a more of a sense on timeline and then what the potential combination here are i suppose legislation is probably at some point during the session this year mps is at some point this year question mark but just help us understand your decision tree if you will curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes so a good question i think you guys know that there is a new administration in illinois governor pritzker he has a fairly aggressive green agenda for the state they signed on to the paris accord they made a big announcement on that and the governor has asked us at least that s our understanding through the illinois epa to have further discussions with the epa about the multi pollutant standards that the illinois pollution control board had sent forward for hearing we agreed to that i think whenever a governor ask you to do something to a state you typically do it and it has not slowed anything down yet and we ve said that we gave them 45 days that s march 15th coming up i think the discussions have been very good and so we are working toward what we hope is and i feel i d say cautiously optimistic a compromise with everybody involved including the environmental groups in the ag s office on something that will allow us to move forward so i would tell you that we are still on the timeline that we would be making decisions around our portfolio in sort of the mid year timeframe and i think things will become in some way it could even become clear to people what we re doing even sooner than that but i think action would probably be taken more in the middle of the year i ve been very open about the fact that we ve got an older an aging fleet there and the capacity market design is horrid and it s just not a very good market and we got challenged assets and so we re trying to build something where we can have a sustainable business and i think part of that is making some hard decisions like we did in texas to retire plants we ll see about that but that s on the horizon for 2019 and i ve been very clear with everybody involved in illinois that this company is going to take action one way or another because we re not going to continue to bleed cash and bleed ebitda we re going to clean up this portfolio and we are going to move on with our business it takes a tremendous amount of our time relative to the ebitda that it provides to the company and that s not sustainable and it won t be so that s about what i can say at this point in time on that julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it alright thank you all very much curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer thank you operator this concludes our question and answer session i will now turn the call back over to curt morgan for closing remarks curtis a morgan president

treachery frank herbert dune 2020 booker cory booker introduces bill to legalize marijuana nationwide with support from fellow 2020 candidates co sponsors include fellow 2020 democratic contenders sens elizabeth warren bernie sanders kamala harris and kirsten gillibrand good for booker and good for them all biden as joe biden weighs 2020 bid democrats ask does he meet the moment one tidbit nobody seems to have noticed sharon holle who has been working to organize for biden in iowa ahead of his decision argued his experience would appeal to democrats nervous about the country s direction under trump people are scared holle said we re in a crisis right now we need somebody we can trust to do what the 2020 endorsement primary top five booker harris klobuchar sanders biden bookers are all from nj 9 of harris s 10 are from ca all of klobuchar s are from mn and sanders are from ca oh pr dc vt so four of the top 5 are endorsed by regional political machines proxies for regional oligarchies and sanders is the exception from the article a lack of a consensus can mean that party leaders first choice candidate may have more trouble securing the nomination we ll see health care nancy pelosi the rolling stone interview pelosi medicare for all is not as good a benefit as the affordable care act it doesn t have catastrophic you have to go buy it it doesn t have dental s1804 has dental i haven t checked jayapal s bill but i believe it does in general all medicare for all bills have better coverage than aca pelosi is simply wrong whether stupid or evil i don t know of course she doesn t have to worry about insurance so perhaps she didn t bother to check i ll have more on this when i post on jayapal s bill on which i would welcome reader comment 2019 house democrats explode in recriminations as liberals lash out at moderates but ocasio cortez d n y the unquestioned media superstar of the freshman class upped the ante admonishing the moderates and indicating she would help liberal activists unseat them in the 2020 election she said that when activists ask her why she had to vote for a gun safety bill that also further empowers an agency that forcibly injects kids with psychotropic drugs they re going to want a list of names and she s going to give it to them trent said referring to u s immigration and customs enforcement triggering the blowup were wednesday s votes on a bill to expand federal background checks for gun purchases twenty six moderate democrats joined republicans in amending the legislation adding a provision requiring that ice be notified if an illegal immigrant seeks to purchase a gun pelosi is ticked off at them too seemingly which is hilarious since this sort of blue dog is exactly the sort of candidate the dccc sought to put in office at pelosi s behest i don t know whether that s incompetence or playing both ends against the middle but that s our democrats too bad the explosion of recriminations is about gunz and not medicareforall or the green new deal though six republicans named to house climate panel the climate committee was formed as pelosi s response to calls from progressives to form a panel designed to focus specifically on mitigating the effects of climate change originally freshman rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y had championed a committee on the green new deal which would draft a plan to get the country running on 100 percent renewable energy by 2030 pelosi instead drafted the climate crisis committee which will have no subpoena or legislative authority i ll take that as a no senate democrats introduce green new deal alternative climate change is real human activity during the last century is the dominant cause of the climate crisis and the united states and congress should take immediate action to address the challenge of climate change the resolution reads in its entirety the resolution is meant as an alternative to the green new deal resolution introduced in early february by sen ed markey sen majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky fast tracked the vote on the resolution two weeks ago in an effort to highlight a democratic divide over the plan while the new resolution doesn t offer any specific plans to decrease emissions and combat climate change democratic leaders championed it as a push in the right direction as republicans failed to back or introduce any climate bills of their own and i ll take that as a no aoc 1 if you want to scale the left this is a good approach my staff i come to decisions through robust discussion debate we operate as a team they are also intro d at community events bc i want constituents to grow familiar w the people picking up the phone when they call as an educational organizer i view it as development alexandria ocasio cortez aoc march 1 2019 though i hate to see the gradual corruption of aoc s language robust forsooth stop that aoc 2 one advantage ocasio cortez has over some colleagues is that she consistently attends even the most mundane committee hearings since she does not spend any of her day calling donors for money danielmarans paulblu aoc josh eidelson josheidelson march 1 2019 realignment and legitimacy speaking of iowa the recovery from the great recession was an urban phenomenon rural areas still have not even recovered the jobs they lost in the recession pic twitter com qpfa0xehib austin frerick austinfrerick february 27 2019 the left s latest demand race based reparations the questions that instantly arise are who would qualify as a beneficiary of reparations and who would pay the immense transfer sums involved the scaly old lizard backbrained reprobate isn t wrong though to be fair it s not clear to me that these were questions the german state asked after the holocaust the thing is however that these are basic questions for which there should be ready answers mmt is obvious framework for the transfer sums what a loaded word reparations advocate darity a scholar as opposed to a pundit like coates is mmt adjacent but the qualifications process seems tricky and fraught with unintended consequences as warren s adventure with dna shows both harris and warren aren t really proposing straight up reparations either both are simply repurposing existing programs or concepts like investment in black communities i hate to go all national conversation on this but it may be that conyers hr40 the closest to a reparations bill that there has been jayapal and khanna were cp sponsors is the best way forward it s not a study it s a lot like a truth and reconciliation commission if this could be undertaken in good faith and didn t become either a whipping boy for reactionaries or the playing of identititarian policy entrepreneurs progress could be made then again debts that can t be paid won t be stats watch personal income and outlays january 2019 edged lower today s report combines all of december s data with only january s income data the rest of the month s data delayed because of the government shutdown consumers apparently put the money they didn t spend into the bank as december s savings rate spiked 1 5 percentage points to 7 6 percent the december piece of this report is old news and was wrapped inside yesterday s fourth quarter gdp data but january s income specifically the 0 3 percent rise for wages salaries offers a respectable opening for the first quarter outlook and but u s personal income falls spending weakest since 2009 the commerce department did not publish the january consumer spending portion of the report as the collection and processing of retail sales data was delayed by a 35 day partial shutdown of the government that ended on jan 25 and the increase in personal income for december was above expectations however the change in personal income for january was well below consensus purchasing managers manufacturing index february 2019 slowing conditions through the month of february manufacturing had a strong year last year but there have been emerging signs the past six weeks or so that the sector slowed at year end and early into this year still rates of growth are sound underscored by strength in this report s employment reading and but overall surveys do not have a high correlation to the movement of industrial production manufacturing since the great recession institute for supply management manufacturing index february 2019 not all the anecdotal reports are reporting slowing but both manufacturing pmi and now ism manufacturing are though slowing rates of growth are still in the mid 50s which is not only respectable but arguably desirable though there are plenty of small sample reports like the ism showing continued strength the bulk have been signaling moderation which is probably the call right now for manufacturing this report gets close attention from the fed and today s results fit right in with their general warnings on slowing and the need for patience in monetary policy and this was below expectations of 55 0 and suggests manufacturing expanded at a slower pace in february than in january consumer sentiment february 2019 final consumer sentiment did bounce back at least some following the government shutdown today s report fits in with the general slowing theme of recent data and specifically offers a hint that consumer spending may be on the soft side this quarter and final february 2019 michigan consumer sentiment improved from preliminary surveys of consumers chief economist richard curtin makes the following comments consumers continued to react to the fed s pause in raising interest rates balancing the favorable impact on borrowing costs against the negative message that the economy at present could not withstand another rate hike does anybody know if consumers actually act that way i certainly don t retail ups offers fulfillment service for multichannel sellers ups announced a fulfillment service

photo sharing app to create and maintain accounts that aim to meet users pop culture fancies whether they be meticulously updated celebrity fan accounts nostalgic fashion ones or something else altogether more than merely using the 8 year old social media platform to display such imagery though the operators behind many of these accounts having built up a dedicated following are looking for ways to monetize their followers the practice is also potentially problematic when we consider the fact that in the vast majority of these cases the curated imagery consists of individual photos for which the instagram account operators do not have rights specifically copyright rights the next facebook scandal the bezzle or maybe this is the next facebook scandal i enabled a bunch of privacy

the biosphere exuberance i don t disagree man if we somehow actually pull this off and legitimately save the world from climate apocalypse i m going to be so fucking psyched sweet cicely spindlypete february 27 2019 there is a word for the trauma caused by distance from nature disconnection from nature can be bad for our mental health but there was no name for this particular malaise until australian sustainability professor glenn albrecht coined the term psychoterratic creating the beginning of a vocabulary to discuss the relationship between mental health and environment wood wandering as therapy began in japan in 1982 when the government introduced the concept of shinrin yoku or forest bathing japan now has 62 designated therapeutic woods attracting about 5 million visitors annually and here at nc we have antidotes and plants so we are doing our best about a dozen trees cut dumped into potomac river at trump golf club in virginia no shinrin yoku for golfers wiped out america s love of luxury toilet paper is destroying canadian forests but america s heavy use of toilet paper particularly the pillowy soft kind is worsening climate change and taking a dramatic and irreversible toll on forests especially the canadian boreal forest according to a new report by two major environmental groups the natural resources defense council nrdc and stand earth the report found that major brands refusal to switch to sustainable materials in toilet paper is having a devastating impact on forests and climate i hope this isn t too much information but i hate pillowy soft toilet paper and never buy it it never seems to er do the job labor unions are skeptical of the green new deal and they want activists to hear them out with respect to labor issues said the green new deal is leaps and bounds ahead of previous climate proposals from his group s perspective if energy workers cannot find new jobs that pay them equal to what they re currently earning then the government should step in and make up that difference he said i think the job guarantee is a really critical element of the green new deal he said it doesn t say if you re a coal miner you re now going to go work on installing solar panels it asks what are the jobs that make sense for your community and have this transition be something that s locally determined weber gets it that said doesn t that approach disempower disintermediate union leadership also interesting on carbon capture struck from h r 109 but about which unions are enthusiastic california is stuck fighting climate change with a bankrupt distrusted company the camp fire as it was named proved the deadliest and most damaging blaze in california history 85 people were killed most of them in paradise and 18 800 buildings were destroyed cal fire won t conclude its investigation into the cause for months possibly years but the realization that pg e s equipment might be the culprit led in short order to a collapse in the utility s stock price the resignation of its chief executive officer and on jan 29 a declaration of chapter 11 bankruptcy the bankruptcy is an early test of the state s new governor gavin newsom but this isn t just a california story it s also a multibillion dollar case study for a set of once abstract questions about corporate responsibility societal risk and climate change california s political leaders have long seen the power grid as a vital tool for reducing carbon emissions to curb global warming what s become clear is that the grid is also dangerously vulnerable to the already palpable effects of climate change toledo wants local control to save lake erie the lake erie bill of rights was a charter amendment that would be put on the ballot and could bestow upon this body of water the legal designation of personhood that s right toledo wanted to radically change the legality of the natural environment basically making this 10 000 square mile lake it sits upon its child with the citizens of the glass city the lake s legal guardian in essence the parents then could sue on behalf of its child if the lake was bullied with polluters he city ordinance passed this week easily by a 61 percent majority vote interesting enough the tac spin are american urban areas becoming more independent city states than second fiddle step children under the national umbrella they are also dealing with mass transit funding water conservation and renewable energy more locally in some ways what is evolving is that liberal entitlement programs and libertarian free market independence can not only coexist but can promote each other in big cities well i d expect liberals and conservatives policies to mesh because as neoliberals both put markets first so i don t know what tac s reaction would be if left universal concrete material benefits were swapped in for liberal entitlement programs emphasis on entitlement though complex eligibility requirements the city of angkor died a slow death in the early middle ages nearly one out of every thousand people in the world lived in angkor the sprawling capital of the khmer empire in present day cambodia but by the 1500s angkor had been mostly abandoned its temples citadels and complex irrigation network left to overgrowth and ruin recent studies have blamed a period of unstable climate in which heavy floods followed lengthy droughts which broke down the infrastructure that moved water around the massive city but it turns out angkor s waterworks may have been vulnerable to these changes because there was no one left to maintain and repair them a new study suggests that khmer rulers religious officials and city administrators had been steadily flowing out of angkor to other cities for at least a century before the end we should start moving federal agencies out of dc mmt krugman messed with the wrong person had enough you don t get to do this you didn t call bs on pay fors we did you were the scold warning deficits matter again you told democrats to step over a 2t bill laying in wait in 2016 stephanie kelton stephaniekelton march 1 2019 health care hundreds pack oregon hearing to oppose bill to end vaccine exemptions oregon and washington are in the midst of a measles outbreak that has touched five people in multnomah county and 65 in clark county but even for people who haven t caught the highly contagious virus the large number of cases has spurred hundreds more people to vaccinate this year than usual years and it has restarted a long running debate over whether parents and guardians should be allowed to send their children to school with the risk of exposing other children to measles lawmakers who support the bill say that parents can still choose not to vaccinate however they will have to homeschool or find ways for children to go to school online the most passionate pleas came from those who compared their plight to brown v board of education and nazi concentration camps saying that those who choose not to vaccinate their children would be segregated unfairly some said they moved out of california after it passed a similar bill in 2015 and others said they would leave oregon good what s the issue an exciting but dangerous moment for medicare for all i am also completely convinced that imposing costs on patients at the time of healthcare use has no useful purpose that seems like a radical idea and even people on the liberal left side of the spectrum sometimes say well having a reasonable copay is not such a bad idea to ensure that healthcare is not used sort of frivolously at the end of the day maybe people paying for healthcare only really affects working class and poor people because well off people are always going to be willing to pay a forty dollar copay right it really is just a way of punishing the sick and the poor yep i don t know if there are any numbers on frivolous use of health care i mean who thinks going to the doctor is fun our famously free press why the left can t stand the new york times pick up my new york times and my financial times i then walk back to my apartment look at the front page of the new york times for approximately five to eight seconds and throw the whole thing in the garbage with contempt i drink my coffee and proceed to read the entirety of the financial times excluding the particularly dense bits of the companies markets section yes more often find myself explaining my preference for the pink paper of liberal capitalism over the gray lady of cultural liberalism the answer is simple by literally any measure the financial times is just a better paper it covers the world as it is a global battle not of ideas or values but of economic and political interests ft s reportage serves a readership that gambles on world events the new york times compulsively analyzes and scrutinizes everything trump ad nauseam because it pays the bills by cultivating an audience

based on us generally accepted accounting principles gaap non gaap financial information is provided to enhance the reader s understanding of our financial performance but none of these non gaap financial measures are recognized terms under gaap and non gaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap reconciliations of the most directly comparable gaap measures to non gaap measures such as adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per share are provided within the schedules attached to this release we use non gaap measures in our operational and financial decision making believing that it is useful to exclude certain items in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations as a result internal management reports used during monthly operating reviews include adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per share additionally we believe that the presentation of non gaap measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates for example our ability to meet capital expenditures and working capital requirements and otherwise meet our obligations as they become due investors are cautioned that non gaap financial measures are not a substitute for gaap disclosures this communication also includes certain forward looking non gaap financial measures we are unable to present without unreasonable efforts a reconciliation of forward looking non gaap financial information to the corresponding gaap financial information because management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary information forward looking non gaap financial information is based on numerous assumptions including assumptions with respect to general business economic market regulatory and financial conditions and various other factors all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control accordingly investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information non gaap measures are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies comparable to cision many of which present non gaap measures when reporting their results these measures can be useful in evaluating our performance against our peer companies because we believe the measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of gaap financial disclosures however non gaap measures have limitations as an analytical tool non gaap measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies they are not presentations made in accordance with gaap are not measures of financial condition or liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to profit or loss for the period determined in accordance with gaap or operating cash flows determined in accordance

revenue reduction from purchase accounting gains losses related to divested businesses or assets sponsor fees and expenses and unrealized translation losses gains all of the items included in the reconciliation from net income to adjusted ebitda are either non cash items or are items that we consider to be less useful in assessing our operating performance in the case of the non cash items we believe that investors can better assess our operating performance if the measures are presented without such items because unlike cash expenses these adjustments do not affect our ability to generate free cash flow or invest in our business for example by excluding depreciation and amortization from ebitda users can compare operating performance without regard to different accounting determinations such as useful life in the case of the other items we believe that investors can better assess operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance 3 cision defines adjusted net income as net income loss plus provision for or minus benefit from income taxes further adjusted for acquisition and offering related costs gains losses related to divested businesses or assets stock based compensation deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting amortization related to acquired intangibles non recurring interest and losses on extinguishment of debt sponsor fees and expenses and unrealized translation losses gains which together sum to adjusted net income loss before income taxes adjusted net income loss before income taxes is then taxed at an assumed long term corporate tax rate of 33 for 2017 and periods prior and 26 for 2018 and beyond pursuant to our preliminary analysis with respect to recent u s tax law changes to determine adjusted net income the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act in december 2017 resulted in a provisional net one time tax of 11 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 based on a reasonable estimate of the income tax effects primarily from a tax on accumulated foreign earnings the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and new limitations on the deductibility of interest our calculation of adjusted net income excludes this provisional net one time tax we continue to finalize the analysis of the tax reform provisions in 2018 all of the items included in the reconciliation from net income to adjusted net income are either non cash items or are items that we consider to be less useful in assessing our operating performance in the case of the non cash items we believe that investors can better assess our operating performance if the measures are presented without such items because unlike cash expenses these adjustments do not affect our ability to generate free cash flow or invest in our business for example by excluding the amortization related to acquired intangibles users can compare operating performance without regard to highly variable amortization expenses related to our acquisitions in the case of the other items we believe that investors can better assess operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance 4 cision defines adjusted net income per diluted share as adjusted net income as defined above divided by the fully diluted pro forma weighted average shares outstanding for the period the fully diluted pro forma weighted average shares outstanding for the respective period assume that the exchange of shares pursuant to our merger with capitol acquisition iii had taken effect as of the beginning of such period additionally for purposes of calculating the number of fully diluted shares outstanding we have excluded the potential impact of dilution from outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our common stock prior to the dates of their conversion and stock options and restricted units issued and outstanding pursuant to our 2017 omnibus incentive plan during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 we issued an aggregate of 6 342 989 ordinary shares 6 100 209 ordinary shares on may 18 2018 and 242 780 ordinary shares on june 4 2018 in exchange for all of our outstanding warrants pursuant to the completion of our warrant exchange transactions during the third quarter of 2018 we issued 2 000 000 ordinary shares for the earn out achieved during the quarter commencing on these respective issuance dates we included the issued shares in our fully

canadian markets and expect to expand the program across our network in 2019 commercial highlights fourth quarter adjusted ebitda of 27 million approximately flat compared to q4 2017 full year adjusted ebitda was 93 million an increase of 23 million relative to 2017 primarily due to the acquisitions and strong first half 2018 propane organic growth and customer wins fourth quarter fuel and petroleum product volume decreased 4 relative to q4 2017 primarily due to softer volumes in western canada this was partially offset by a 4 decrease in operating costs as parkland continues to maintain a strong emphasis on cost management ongoing optimization of our commercial brand portfolio in various geographies has seen certain legacy operations particularly in eastern canada successfully rebranded to ultramar this enables parkland to drive future growth and sustained profitability under one aligned customer value proposition supply highlights fourth quarter adjusted ebitda of 199 million an increase of 105 million relative to q4 2017 these exceptional results were primarily driven by profitable supply sourcing initiatives improved supply economics continued efforts in executing parkland s supply advantage strategy and strong refining crack spreads due to the rapid price decrease of both crude feedstock and refined products in the fourth quarter parkland also realized a 49 million benefit from its working capital funding agreement at the burnaby refinery which flows through cost of purchases on a full year basis this benefit totalled 20 million full year adjusted ebitda of 561 million an increase of 401 million relative to 2017 the increase was driven by full year contributions from the acquisitions and the factors outlined above refinery utilization which measures the amount of crude oil processed and converted to products in the burnaby refinery was 87 8 for the fourth quarter compared to 94 4 for q4 2017 the burnaby refinery processed intermediary products and bio fuels such as canola and tallow which are not reflected in crude throughput and therefore not included in refinery utilization parkland usa highlights completed three acquisitions in 2018 the largest of which was the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of rhinehart oil co llc and its affiliates the rhinehart acquisition the rhinehart acquisition closed on august 27 2018 and added 10 distribution facilities 9 retail sites and 4 cardlock facilities across utah colorado wyoming and new mexico fourth quarter adjusted ebitda of 11 million an increase of 7 million relative to q4 2017 full year adjusted ebitda was 28 million an increase of 12 million relative to 2017 the increases are primarily due to the rhinehart acquisition and parkland s continued focus on its strategy to drive new business grow organically and manage costs fuel and petroleum product volume increased 92 million litres in the fourth quarter and 119 million litres on a full year basis relative to q4 2017 and full year 2017 respectively the increase was primarily due to the rhinehart acquisition and organic growth initiatives subsequent to the quarter parkland opened a houston office that will support its growing supply and trading business in the u s and caribbean markets parkland will continue to look for acquisition opportunities in the u s including tuck in opportunities in and around its existing regional operations centers and new regional operations centers in areas where we can establish a supply advantage corporate segment highlights marketing general and administrative expenses were 32 million in the fourth quarter and 111 million on a full year basis as expected these expenses increased primarily due to additional corporate costs to support the larger integrated business and execute future growth strategies in particular additional costs were incurred for technological innovation initiatives and employee costs

the pound to euro exchange rate is 1 16201 today the pound to dollar exchange rate is 1 32068 today weekly central bank highlights include rba rate statement boe gov carney speaks boc rate statement the week behind us may caves powell confirms powell put above g10 currencies change vs usd over last week gbp was the best performing g10 currency after uk pm may basically caved in to demands that parliament should have more of a say in the brexit decision and there should be the possibility of a delay in brexit rather than just my deal or no deal however her concession wasn t as much of a concession as it seems any delay assuming the eu grants her one is based around the timing of the european parliament election in may if britain takes part in that election it can keep on extending brexit after the eu parliament is seated on 1 july but if it doesn t take part then 1 july becomes an absolutely unextendible cliff edge deadline for brexit her strategy is to take britain to that cliff edge and say now it s either my deal or no deal and hope that mps vote for the deal i think that might work which would be positive for gbp but it s a hell of a way to run a country fed chair powell confirmed that the fed is rethinking its inflation target and may consider allowing an overshoot of inflation to compensate for periods of undershooting he also more or less confirmed the existance of the powell put by saying that a change in broader financial conditions matters for the macroeconomy it matters for the achievement of the dual mandate and the fed will therefore take change in broader financial conditions into account this gives rise to two questions 1 how do you measure broader financial conditions and 2 what is the reaction function by which you take those changes into account because the fact is their own financial conditions index hasn t shown any significant tightening recently and indeed was lower at the time of the january fomc meeting than it was in december when they did hike rates advertisement above chicago fed national financial conditions indices same with the vix index equity market volatilty was much higher in december than in january so i m still not sure what their reaction function is reacting to unless maybe it s the fact that volatility moved higher and the stock market even lower immediately after that meeting above vix and fomc meetings finally we had the long awaited testimony by trump s lawyer fixer michael cohen he was devastating about trump accusing him of an expansive pattern of lies and criminality as the ny times put it although his claim that he saw no collusion between the campaign and russia to sway the election seems doubtful imho my favorite exchange was rep gosar you re a pathological liar you don t know truth from falsehood so again michael cohen sorry are you referring to me or the president the coming week lots going on the coming week is filled with important indicators and events three central bank meetings the us nonfarm payrolls and the start of china s national people s congress for the central banks we get the reserve bank of australia rba on tuesday the bank of canada boc on wednesday and the european central bank ecb on thursday frankly though i m getting bored writing about central banks most of them are now on hold once again so all we re talking about is whether there will be any subtle change in bias not a real change in stance we re mostly trying to understand how the central bankers see the world and how long they are likely to keep rates on hold we re really just looking for scraps of information in this context the rba is probably the worst of the lot unlike most other central banks which meet eight times a year they meet 11 times a year no meeting in january so i m going to have to write about them every month for the rest of the year and currently the market sees just over 50 55 chance of a cut in rates this year in other words every month i m going to have to review the reasons why they probably won t make any changes in policy this is expected to last at least until around august when the possibility of a change rises to 41 perhaps i should save my comments each month and just update the numbers and graph above market estimates of probability of a change in rba rates by various times recent commentary from rba governor lowe has made clear that the rba doesn t plan any changes in policy any time soon the focus will still be on the labor market and inflation as always in the event of a sustained increase in the unemployment rate and a lack of further progress towards the inflation objective lower interest rates might be appropriate at some point he said on 6 february and again on 22 feb he said it is appropriate to maintain the current policy setting while we assess developments much will depend on what happens in our labor market it s true that they haven t met their inflation target yet the inflation rate is just below 1 8 their 2 3 target range and has been for some time however this problem isn t unique to australia every central bank is having the same issue and japan has proven that low interest rates can t necessarily solve this issue above australian cpi meanwhile the governor s stress on the labor market makes a change in policy much less likely the unemployment rate is as low as it s been in ages and employment growth is holding up well too i expect little change in stance at this week s meeting and little for the markets to get excited about above australian unemployment vs rba cash rate there s hardly more tension associated with the boc the market had been going for a rate hike but now the betting centers on rates being unchanged for all of this year with some chance of one hike above market estimates of probability of various boc rates by end 2019 boc gov poloz recently made a speech in which he discussed the limitations to monetary policy the first limitation he said was that since monetary policy has only one instrument the bank cannot use interest rates to target more than one variable ultimately inflation is the sole target of the policy given that all three of the core measures of inflation that the boc used to guide its monetary policy are just about at the middle of their 1 3 target range they should be very happy with policy at the moment i see no reason for them to change in either direction the meeting should be a relative non event for the markets i would think unless today s december q4 gdp figure disappoints enough to cause them to rethink their relatively optimistic forecast of a rebound to above potential growth later in the year above canada cpi the ecb is more interesting than the others because they have started to question their own narrative the eurozone economy is slowing down more than they expected and inflation is accelerating more slowly than they expected as a result this may necessitate a subtle change in their stance as for rates the market thinks there s a 50 50 chance that they will raise rates this year otherwise they ll be unchanged above market estimate of probability of a change in ecb depo rate by dec 2019 but that s a story for later this year the market thinks if it s likely to happen at all it s likely to happen towards the end of the year above market estimate of probability of an ecb rate hike by various times so for now the question will be just how do they see the eurozone economy developing and are they making or likely to make any progress towards their inflation goal after the last meeting ecb president draghi said on the basis of current futures prices for oil headline inflation is likely to decline further over the coming months the march meeting will bring with it an updated set of forecasts the last update in december gave a profile of 1 6 in 2019 rising to 1 7 in 20210 and 1 8 in 2021 i e still trending towards their goal of inflation below but close to 2 over the medium term if they revise down their inflation forecast can they continue on their policy normalization path my guess is that they may once again revise it down for 2019 but leave 2020 and 2021 alone that s far enough away that they can pretend it s going to happen that way they won t have to change their policy stance right now above eurozone inflation this is of course just a polite fiction that nobody really believes the 5yr 5yr inflation swap which draghi himself identified as his preferred gauge of inflation expectations now indicates that the market expects inflation to remain around the current level for the next five years and it s been trending lower if anything above eurozone inflation expectations vs actual inflation there s also the question about what the ecb should do with their long term refinancing operations ltros these non standard financing help for banks have been in operation continuously since the global financial crisis of 2008 there s still some eur 720bn outstanding in targeted ltros tlrto they start to mature in june of 2020 and the ecb is wondering what to do about it let it roll off what they would do if the economy were healthy and they were normalizing policy or replace it in whole or in part and if so how they still have some time to think about this issue so they may not decide at this meeting the market will want to see any clues as for the indicators it s once again time for the us nonfarm payrolls nfp i ve said repeatedly that i think the importance of this indicator is overblown unlike the rba the fed believes that has achieved its goal of maximum employment if indeed maximum employment can be measured by the unemployment rate some people would argue that full employment can only be measured by looking at wages that is you re not at full employment until workers can extract more money from their employers and the return to labor goes up relative to the return to capital what we see here is encouraging the employment cost index eci is trending upwards while the quit rate the percentage of people who leave their jobs voluntarily each month is rising too indicating that employees have a lot more confidence in the job market nowadays however the eci isn t rising anywhere nearly as rapidly as it was before the gfc so the fed probably doesn t have to worry about wage cost inflation remember that any time soon above employment cost index vs quit rate in any event the market is looking for some mean reversion in payrolls after two months of above trend gains in payrolls the consensus forecast of 185k is pretty close to what the six month moving average was in august september and november it seems as good a guess as any the unemployment rate is expected to fall back to 3 9 from 4 0 i e to remain in its recent range it s been between 3 7 and 4 0 since last march above change in nonfarm payrolls given my argument above about how to determine full employment the average hourly earnings are probably more important than the nfp figure itself here too the consensus is for reversion to the mean basically 80 of the time the mom change is either 0 1 0 2 or 0 3 since last month it was 0 1 the low end of the usual range the market assumes this month it will come out on the high end of the usual range namely 0 3 that would push the yoy rate back up to 3 3 the peak for this economic cycle that i think would suggest the labor market remains strong and therefore would be beneficial for the dollar above us average hourly earnings china s national people s congress will start on 5 march premier li will present the government s draft working plan for 2019 global investors will be focusing on the 2019 growth target last year s target was around 6 5 which was met the average yoy growth rate for all quarters was 6 6 while it finished the year at 6 4 above china gdp among china s 31 provinces 24 have lowered their growth targets for 2019 while only two raised them so we can assume that the national growth target will be lowered as well the only question is how far the further they target below 6 5 the worse for the commodity currencies i would assume i think anything below 6 would be a big shock while 6 6 5 would probably be within the range of expectations investors will also be interested in fiscal and monetary policy and how much additional stimulus if any the government will provide the market consensus is for some further fiscal stimulus while monetary policy is likely to remain prudent especially given the friction with the us over currency policy china s monetary policy plays an important part in driving the country s economy and thereby driving world commodity prices above china credit impulse vs world commodity prices other things to watch out for during the week there are a number of bank of england speakers gov carney testifies to the house of lords on tuesday while monetary policy committee members cunliffe and saunders speak on wednesday and tenreyro on thursday it will be interesting to hear their latest take on the brexit kerfuffle the fed releases the beige book on wednesday

limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non gaap financial measures today s discussion will contain forward looking statements which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today s date such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied further our earnings release slide presentation and discussions on the call will include certain non gaap financial measures for such measures reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap measure are in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation advertisement advertisement i will now turn the call over to curt morgan to kick off our discussion curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer thank you molly and good morning to everyone on the call as always we appreciate your interest in vistra energy turning to slide six i m happy to announce today that vistra concluded the year reporting adjusted ebitda from its ongoing operations of 2 809 billion results that are both above consensus as well as slightly above our 2018 guidance midpoint of 2 8 billion when compared against our original 2018 guidance which utilized in october 2017 curves we finished the year more than 180 million above the comparable midpoint vistra achieved these results through strong cost management across all markets which helped to offset a relatively mild august in ercot in fact as you can see on the next slide vistra finished 2018 25 million ahead of plan on achieving its dynegy merger ebitda value lever targets 20 million of which we realized in the year this relentless focus on cost management flow through to various capital projects we had forecast for 2018 advertisement advertisement the vistra operating teams exhibited meaningful capex spending discipline throughout the year enabling vistra to achieve ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth of 1 611 billion results that were 61 million above the high end of our guidance range reflecting an ebitda to free cash flow conversion ratio of nearly 60 for the year since the close of the dynegy merger in april of 2018 we have developed an understanding of the operations and maintenance expenses and capital expenditures necessary to maintain the fleet of generation assets that we project will allow us to uphold this spending discipline into the future including the cumulative impact of the partial buybacks of the odessa power plant earn out vistra s adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations would have been 2 791 billion and its adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations would have been 1 589 billion as a reminder when we executed the odessa earn out buybacks which we view as a growth expenditure the economic benefit net of the premium paid was approximately 25 million which we largely locked in around the time of the buyback execution before we turn to our dynegy merger synergy tracking update i want to briefly highlight our recent retail growth initiatives as i m sure you are all aware earlier this month we announced that we executed an agreement to purchase crius energy trust an retail energy provider with approximately 1 million residential customer equivalent in 19 states and the district of columbia we estimate the purchase at approximately four times ev to ebitda and we project the acquisition will be immediately accretive to ebitda and free cash flow per share the transaction meets our internal investment return threshold and is expected to further improve our free cash flow conversion ratio as we estimate the crius portfolio will convert approximately 90 of its ebitda to free cash flow as i m sure everyone on this call is also aware we did increase our purchase price for crius due to an unexpected and hostile bid for the company while unfortunate especially because this hostile bidder had an opportunity to be the successful bidder in the competitive auction process conducted by crius leading up to the signing of our agreement we continue to believe crius is attractive to vistra at this new price point it is not our desire to get into a bidding war we have put in place stronger breakup protections and together with crius are moving quickly to obtain all necessary approvals including the shareholder approval to close the transaction both of which support our bid over any potential future hostile one any hostile bidder that would step in to the process now would have to justify the higher price including the increased termination fee and the delay in the approvals in overall closing timeline a tough thing to accomplish in our view i would also like to emphasize that we are fully prepared to take any necessary legal action that we believe is available to us to defend our acquisition of crius against any efforts by the hostile bidder to disrupt and interfere with our acquisition jim will provide more details about this transaction later on the call but suffice it to say we are very excited about the quality of the crius portfolio and its strategic fit with our existing integrated platform advertisement advertisement last i m excited to announce that our retail team grew organically residential customer counts in ercot by approximately 15 000 customers in 2018 this is the first year the team has achieved net growth on an organic basis since 2008 a tremendous outcome for the team and further proof that our marketing programs and customer satisfaction and service efforts in the ercot market have been effective let s now turn to slide seven for an update on our progress achieving the dynegy merger value lever targets on our last earnings call in november we increased our synergy value lever target to 290 million from 275 million and we increased our operations performance initiative value lever targets to 275 from 225 million we are reaffirming these ebitda value lever targets today anticipating we will achieve the full run rate of 565 million ebitda per year by the end of 2020 i am happy to report as you can see on slide seven that we finished 2018 tracking ahead of schedule captured these merger value levers realizing a 195 million of ebitda targets in 2018 ahead of our initial forecast by 20 million we achieved a run rate of 385 million by the end of 2018 25 million ahead of our plan last as a result of our latest balance sheet optimization transaction that closed earlier this month we have increased our forecast annual after tax free cash flow benefits by another 15 million to 310 million we continue to believe there could be upside to the 275 million op target so stay tuned for further updates on this topic in the second half of the year moving on to 2019 as you can see on slide eight we are reaffirming our 2018 adjusted ebitda and adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance for our ongoing operations we are calling 2019 the year of execution as we complete the full integration of dynegy merger and capture the value levers implement our capital allocation plans and hit our targeted numbers of course closing and integrating crius will be important as well advertisement advertisement we do not expect to update 2019 guidance to reflect the pending crius acquisition until after the acquisition closes which we estimate will be in the second quarter of this year perhaps even as early as april given that the crius unitholder vote is scheduled for march 28 and as i mentioned earlier the teams have already filed for the regulatory approvals we do not expect any issues with obtaining regulatory approvals from the doj or ferc importantly our 2019 ongoing operations adjusted ebitda guidance range of 3 22 billion to 3 42 billion and our 2019 ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance range of 2 1 billion to 2 3 billion represent a free cash flow conversion ratio of approximately 66 as bill will discuss later we are significantly hedged in 2019 and have materially increased our hedges in 2020 we purposely have dry powder available in ercot in 2020 given our expectation at the more significant move in ercot prices due to the ordc change will occur in that year i ve said it before and i ll say it again the 66 free cash flow conversion ratio yield is a highly attractive feature of our company and significantly higher than that of other commodity based capital intensive energy industries as a result we continue to believe that vistra s valuation should shift away from the historical ev to ebitda multiples which no longer reflect the value proposition of the sector for the free cash flow yield valuation metric at a proper yield we believe our future valuation will eventually reflect this new reality as the financial markets continue to gain confidence in the new integrated power company model with the attractive features of low leverage low cost and industry leading retail operations paired with in the money generation all leading to relative earnings stability beyond 2019 we anticipate our integrated business model will enable us to continue to realize relative earnings stability as we are expecting 2020 adjusted ebitda to be approximately flat to 2019 our expectation for generally consistent adjusted ebitda year over year is a marked improvement from dynegy s pre merger forecast which reflected declining ebitda in 2020 and 2021 due principally to lower capacity revenues in pjm through curve improvements changes to the operating reserve demand curve in ercot and enhanced management expectations for merger value lever achievement the previous dynegy declining ebitda forecast now reflects expected ebitda strength and stability in the near term we are continuing to focus on achieving our financial and leverage target returning capital to shareholders and meeting or exceeding our merger synergy targets advertisement advertisement as it relates to returning capital to shareholders our capital allocation plan remains on track as of february 2015 we had executed a total of 937 million of our aggregate 1 75 billion share repurchase program authorization slightly ahead of where we thought we would be at this point in time because market technicals gave us an opportunity to repurchase shares at an attractive price at the end of 2018 we now have 486 million shares outstanding as of february 15th a 7 reduction as compared to the number of shares outstanding at the time the dynegy merger closed with 813 million still available for opportunistic repurchases on the program under the program so long as our stock is trading at such a high free cash flow yield and what we believe is a meaningful discount to fair value we expect we will continue to allocate capital toward share repurchases we also announced earlier this week that our board has declared vistra s initial quarterly dividend of 0 125 per share or 0 50 per share on an annualized basis the dividend is payable on march 29 2019 to shareholders of record as of march 15 2019 management expects to grow the dividend at an annual rate of approximately 6 to 8 per share as a reminder the payment of the dividend of this size represents just more than 10 of vistra s forecast 2019 free cash flow before growth from the consolidated business and less than 35 of forecast 2019 free cash flow before growth from our stable retail operations we believe our targeted 6 to 8 per share dividend growth rate is supported by our projected free cash flow including tuck in ebitda growth initiatives such as our recently announced moss landing battery storage project and the crius acquisition importantly the crius acquisition is not expected to delay vistra s achievement of its long term leverage target of 2 5 times net debt to ebitda by year end 2020 balance sheet strength is a core tenet of vistra s operating model and we plan to manage our business and cash flows accordingly we believe the execution of our diverse capital allocation plan will continue to attract new long term investors while providing our shareholders with an attractive total shareholder return over the years in fact we now consider 15 out of our top 20 shareholders to be long term investors and vanguard and fidelity are now our second and third largest shareholders respectively replacing apollo and oaktree before i turn the call over to jim to discuss highlights of our planned crius acquisition i would like to spend a few minutes giving a market update in january the public utility commission of texas approved important updates to ercot scarcity pricing formula known as the operating reserve demand curve or the ordc the update simplify the ordc from 24 different curves for different seasons and time of day to a single curve and shifted the loss of load probability by half a standard deviation in two steps a quarter of a standard deviation in 2019 and another quarter of standard deviation in 2020 what all this means in plain english is that the market participants should expect to see modestly higher prices during peak periods as the scarcity pricing formula should now better price in the risk of load shedding events advertisement advertisement the goal of the market changes was twofold to better reflect significantly higher reliability risk in the market as well as to provide better price signals with an aim to help avoid additional retirements from marginal generators and to support new investment in generating capacity we are fully supportive of the market changes as ensuring ercot has sufficient generating capacity to meet texans demand for electricity is critical to the reputation of the growing texas economy we estimate the potential impact of these changes to the around the clock forward curves could be approximately 2 to 3 per megawatt hour in 2019 and approximately 3 to 4 per megawatt hour in 2020 modest overall increases in price that should support generation investment in the market while not meaningfully increasing the price of power to texas consumers it is difficult to estimate the potential impact of these changes to vistra as it is difficult to discern how the forward markets have already responded and will react in response to the new market design assuming the market fully values the impact of these changes and appreciates the risks inherent in the tight reserve margins forecasted we expect vistra could see upside in 2020 where we are much less hedged than in 2019 in fact some of the improved 2020 outlook that flattens ebitda is due to the ordc improvements we have hedged some of our open position as we believe the 2020 forward curves had moved up in anticipation of the puc s potential action especially prior to the action as there was speculation of a larger move we believe this action by the public utility commission of texas was a necessary step to ensure the long term success of the texas competitive electric market and we continue to like our meaningful position in the ercot market where we forecast we will drive more than half of our ebitda in 2019 it is the right move balancing the need to support new and existing assets and cost to customers with the end result of maintaining a healthy supply demand balance another market update has occurred since our last earnings call the clearing of the most recent iso new england capacity auction this year s auction cleared at a price of 3 80 per kw month down from 4 63 in the last year s auction despite the lower price vistra cleared nearly 500 more megawatts in the current auction making the estimated negative impact of vistra of the lower clearing price approximately 16 million or less than 0 5 of vistra s forecast 2019 adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations while the lower clearing price in the auction is certainly not ideal it is relatively immaterial to vistra given the diversity of our revenue sources from energy capacity and retail in multiple competitive electric markets across the us advertisement advertisement more fundamentally we continue to be confounded that anyone will be able to raise capital to finance a new gas plant in iso new england at a capacity price of only 3 80 a kw month as many of you know a new 650 megawatt combined cycle plant cleared the latest capacity auction for calendar years 2020 and 2023 i cannot emphasize this point enough since the restructuring of the power markets began in the late 1990s we are hard pressed to find merchant power plants with the original equity owner received an adequate return and many suffered financial distress and bankruptcy rather it is the developers who earned sizable upfront fees to site permit to construct new thermal resources that make money leaving the third party debt and equity investors owning an uneconomic asset one can only hope this reality will start to sink in with the financial community so debt and equity investors stop making irrational investments like this latest gas plant slated for development in iso new england our analysis suggests that the entire equity and likely some portion of the debt will be underwater the day the iso new england plant is put into operation if it ever is in our view something is wrong with the market design that allows a plant like this to clear and suppress prices with a high probability it never gets built the last relevant market update is of course the status of the pending pjm capacity auction reforms unfortunately we don t have much to say on this topic as the devil will really be in the details after we hear from first however we continue to believe the outcome of any capacity market reforms will be at worst neutral to the current state recall that in june of 2018 ferc labeled the existing pjm capacity auction is unjust and unreasonable given the impact of subsidized resources have on the auction as a result it would seem very counterintuitive to ferc s original intent to land at an outcome that is meaningfully worse for existing generators history tells us that ferc has consistently promoted balanced market reforms that support competitive markets which by the way is their first order of priority despite political affiliation states can formulate their own energy policy but they cannot destroy competitive markets in doing so like all of you we are anxiously awaiting ferc s decision on this issue and remain cautiously optimistic for a constructive outcome we continue to believe that vistra will be in a position to provide relatively robust and stable earnings in the years to come given our strong balance sheet low cost integrated operations in the money generating fleet and market leading retail operations which are about to become even more diverse with the closing of the pending crius acquisition advertisement advertisement on that note i will turn the call over to jim burke to talk a bit more about the crius transaction jim burke executive vice president and chief operating officer thank you curt turning to slide 11 as you can see from the high level bullets on the slide we are very excited about the strategic fit of the crius portfolio with vistra s existing retail and generation platform importantly as curt mentioned at the beginning of the call we believe the economics of this transaction are very attractive and exceeding our internal investment threshold and valued at approximately at four times enterprise value to ebitda multiple pro forma for the full run rate of forecasted synergies in fact as a national integrated power company with generation retail assets in multiple states vistra is uniquely positioned to create value with the crius platform we project we ll be able to achieve approximately 15 million in annual ebitda synergies and approximately 12 million in additional annual free cash flow synergies following the closing of the transaction the acquisition will also accelerate vistra s previously announced organic growth strategy enabling us to forego approximately 29 million of expenditures through 2023 from this effort financial benefits aside we are particularly excited about this transaction as a result of the quality of the portfolio we will be acquiring the crius portfolio has recognized established brands market leading attrition rates and a demonstrated track record of successful customer acquisition through multiple sales channels the portfolio complements vistra s long generation position in the midwest and northeast markets and as just mentioned will accelerate organic growth strategy in these regions in addition the composition of the portfolio is largely residential and small business should command a higher multiple due to the inherently higher margins in these segments let s dive a bit deeper into some of these points on the next slide crius with this approximately 1 million residential customer equivalents has demonstrated success with its high growth high margin retail strategy focusing on higher value residential and small business customers crius has an impressive track record of new customer gains through various sales channels across multiple brands and it s attrition rates are the lowest among the peers in the markets where it operates crius has been successful in its customer acquisition and retention efforts as a result of leveraging its diverse sales channels and exclusive partnership strategies these partnerships strategies are primarily executed through its energy rewards platform where crius partners with established providers to cross sell its retail electricity offerings these integrated energy platform offerings will expand vistra s existing sales and marketing channels enhancing its strategic fit with our organization following the acquisition vistra will have a retail presence in 19 states in the district of columbia with dual energy market offerings in many states as you can see on slide 13 vistra will now have a retail gas product portfolio in 13 states which we believe will be a great addition to our existing operations retail gas tends to have similar margins as electricity but gas customers tend to be a bit stickier as bill size is often meaningfully lower in this segment due to lower overall volumes being able to sell a customer two services electricity and gas leverages the cost of acquisition by adding incremental margin to the customer relationship in addition retail gas is a naturally synergistic business for vistra as we are already one of the largest purchasers of natural gas in the country to give you a bit of background on how the retail gas business works the local utilities are responsible for ensuring that natural gas can be delivered to residents in their service territories as a result the local utilities contract for the necessary gas pipeline and transport capacity as well as for local gas storage and allocate the applicable transportation and storage assets to entities providing the retail gas product to the end users vistra therefore will only be responsible for procuring and delivering the actual commodity which is very easy for us to do in an affordable manner because we already are a bulk purchaser of natural gas necessary for the operation of our gas plants in short though the retail gas portfolio is only approximately 15 of the crius retail business by volume we find it to be a nice strategic fit for our organization and we are excited to meaningfully expand our retail gas operations at the transaction close finally one of the greatest benefit of the crius transaction is the incremental retail load vistra will be acquiring which meaningfully improves our expected generation to load match including the default service load vistra has contracted we forecast we will be nearly 50 matched in 2019 with approximately 90 of that forecast load being sold through our preferred retail channel as we depict on the right hand side of slide 14 our commercial team can sell vistra s long generation through three primary channels directly to one of our retail subsidiaries to utilities in default service auctions or directly to third parties in the wholesale markets of these channels we prefer selling our leg directly to our own retail subsidiaries as we are able to eliminate transaction cost leakage on the bid ask spread and reduce the total cost of collateral postings the other sales channels are effective but marginally less attractive with sales through default service auctions and third party sales in the wholesale markets being the next most attractive channels in that order the incremental load we will be acquiring with the crius acquisition is primarily located in the midwest and northeast markets which is exactly where we are planning to focus our organic growth efforts giving us establish brands sales channels and infrastructure as a platform for this organic growth over the last several weeks the vistra management team has been working diligently with crius to ensure a smooth transition as our teams have continued the interface and share best practices we re even more excited about this transaction the crius and vistra teams emphasize a high performance culture with a primary focus on the customer i have no doubt that crius operations are the right fit for our organization and i look forward to announcing the closing of the deal hopefully in the second quarter i am hopeful we can quickly close the transaction to avoid any further disruption that has the potential to erode the value of the business i will now turn the call over to bill holden to cover fourth quarter and full year financial results j william holden executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you jim turning now to slide 16 as curt mentioned vistra concluded 2018 delivering 2 809 billion of adjusted ebitda from our ongoing operations these results reflect a full year of operations from legacy vistra and results from the legacy dynegy operations for the period from april 9 2018 through december 31 2018 including the negative 18 million net impact of the partial buybacks of the odessa power plant earn out that we executed in february and may vistra s adjusted ebitda from its ongoing operations would have been 2 791 billion for the year vistra s strong results coming in above consensus and just above the midpoint of management guidance were directly attributable to robust cost management across all markets offsetting a relatively mild august in ercot retail also exceeded management expectations for the year driven by residential customer count growth and margin and cost management for the full year caiso exceeded expectations due to favorable prices higher generation volumes and lower sg a expenses while pjm was also favorable as a result of the nepco plant retirement and subsequent move to the asset closures segment vistra s 2018 adjusted free cash flow before growth from its ongoing operations was 1 611 billion which as curt mentioned is 61 million above the high end of management s prior guidance range the favorable results are primarily attributable to capex spend discipline during the year including the negative 22 million net impact of the partial buybacks of the odessa power plant earn out vistra s 2018 adjusted free cash flow before growth from its ongoing operations would have been 1 589 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018 vistra s adjusted ebitda from its ongoing operations was 719 million or 721 million including the positive 2 million net impact of the partial buybacks of the odessa power plant earn out both segment results for the quarter can be found on slide 22 in the appendix as curt mentioned today we re also reaffirming our 2019 guidance ranges and we still believe 2020 adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations is tracking relatively flat to 2019 our confidence in our 2019 guidance ranges and the improvement in our 2020 outlook is due in large part to the incremental hedges we have added for those years as you can see on slide 17 and 18 as of december 31 2018 we were largely hedged for 2019 in our core markets of ercot pjm and iso new england and as of last week we re nearly fully hedged in these markets for the year similarly as of december 31 2018 we were largely hedged for natural gas in ercot in 2020 and we improved our ercot heat rate position to 42 from 28 at september 30 also in the fourth quarter of 2018 we improved our new york new england and pjm hedge percentages by 8 and 32 respectively as our commercial strategy is to take advantage of the volatility in forward curves the hedge prices that are at or above our fundamental point of view we have improved the 2020 hedge percentages even further in the first two months of 2019 the 48 for ercot heat rate to 32 and 66 for new york new england and pjm respectively we expect our hedging activities to further lock in a stable ebitda profile for the business in the out years finally let s turn to slide 19 for a brief capital structure update as you can see in the table vistra had approximately 11 1 billion of long term debt outstanding as of december 31 2018 reflecting debt reduction as a result of approximately 120 million of open market repurchases of senior notes in the fourth quarter in february of this year we completed a bond issue and senior notes tender offer and redemption that reduced our annual interest expense by 20 million on a pre tax basis we will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our balance sheet and reduce our total debt as we work toward achieving our long term leverage target of 2 5 times net debt to ebitda by year end 2020 and as curt mentioned we have now executed approximately half of our aggregate authorized 1 75 billion share repurchase program leaving approximately 813 million available as of february 15 2019 following our share repurchases vistra had 486 million shares outstanding as of the same date despite our stock price recently achieving a new 52 week high we continue to view our stock price as undervalued as a result we expect we will continue to allocate capital toward opportunistic share repurchases under our existing program as previously announced our diverse capital allocation program is in full swing as we initiated our dividend program this month continue to repurchase shares under our authorized share repurchase program delever and execute on tuck in growth opportunities including the moss landing battery storage project and the crius acquisition all of this is possible because of the relatively stable ebitda and meaningful cash free cash flow generated by our integrated operations we will continue to focus on execution and delivering on our commitments in 2019 all in an effort to create value for our investors with that operator we are now ready to open the lines for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of greg gordon with evercore isi greg your line is open greg gordon evercore isi analyst sorry i did hop on the call just a tad late so if i m asking you the question you already answered my apologies when you talk about the upside that you think you see in ercot from the change in the ordc rules how much of that do you think is already priced into the curves and how much of that do you think is needs to be sort of validated by volatility that we might see this summer that would cause the curves to move to where you think intrinsic value is curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes so this may be more than your marketing for but i think it s worth just talking about how the curves have moved greg back after the summer we came out there was a lot of chatter about needing to improve the ordc or some other reform as you may recall and then there was chatter out there that there maybe a one standard deviation move no discussion about whether it be a single curve or the 24 curves but we were pretty certain at that point in time some amount of that was factored into the curves i think people felt like there was a high probability that something would get done we took some advantage of that in particular a little bit in 2020 but a little bit also we had some 2019 still low but we took advantage of it and then if you remember there was two or three times that the puct sort of put it up on the schedule and then delayed it i think curves kind of drifted off a little bit because there were some uncertainty around it and of course we finally got it through and then there was a response pretty positive response after that and the reason i tell you all that is that i think it has ebbed and flowed and then recently and this is not this is pretty typical it s kind of the curves have kind of drifted off a little bit and it happens sort of this time of the year i fully expect that as we get closer to the summer we see a our first hot day and people start to see how the market is going to react then we ll probably see another move up in power prices for 2019 and then typically when you get into 2019 summer if you see a hot summer you ll see 2020 move but as it happened in this year we didn t really have august the summer we thought we would but we still saw a move up in 2019 because as we rolled out liquidity went from 2019 into 2020 so that s a factor but also people realize that reserve margins were actually going to actually go down not up i think we ll see that same thing happened in 2020 so that s a long way of saying that it s hard to really know for sure and i m not trying to avoid the question it s just very hard to know but i would say right now there s room to move in both the 2019 and the 2020 curves for summer of 2019 and 2020 respectively just where the curves are today that s partly just due to just how the market tends to move but it s also i think the market has not fully realized the impact of the ordc i think one thing is probably still being digested but this is all kind of esoteric stuff at the end of the day is this whole single curve versus multiple curves and basically it really comes down to this loss of load probability and the mean of the loss of load probability and if it s on a single curve versus multiple curves the standard deviation around that mean is actually higher which means the effect of the 0 2 or the 0 5 is actually higher than it would have been if it was under multiple curves i m not sure the market has digested it because i don t know if they really know how that s all going to play out so i think this may be a little bit of wait and see to that we re going to need to see how the market reacts i think if the market is a little bit warm and we start to see scarcity in the ordc it comes into play i think you can really see 2020 and 2021 off to the races so i think some of this is going to be driven a little bit by how weather turns out but we do believe there is still some upside around the ordc given where the curves are currently greg gordon evercore isi analyst great and bill could you reiterate where you said you are in terms of how much you ve hedged for 2020 in ercot i presume you used those those intermittent run ups as opportunities but also can you i think you guys do when you talk about hedging that s net of a significant amount of megawatts that you hold back and take the spot during the summer to sort of self hedge so can you just talk about that as well so we can understand how much exposure you have if the curves do move in your favor j william holden executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so the hedging that we ve done through our 2020 since the end of the year would take us up the 48 hedge against our ercot heat rate curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer and that s it in what you re building j william holden executive vice president and chief financial officer and that s for 2020 curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes 2020 greg gordon evercore isi analyst okay so you re but that s so you re 52 open but aren t you do i need to sort of take into account the fact that you re holding back like 1 200 megawatts or does that taken into account in that hedge percentage curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer i can this is steve muscato steve muscato here so go ahead steve muscato senior vice president and chief commercial officer yes this is steve muscato the way to think about it is yes we do hold back some generation for basically potential outages or weather changes that make our load move up pretty rapidly with temperature the way to think about it is is it gives us the opportunity to capture any deviations between the day ahead in a real time because if the day ahead clears at a particular level we could typically cover our low changes in the day ahead which then gives us a lot of that open generation for changes in the real time market so that s curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer can we just greg just asked a second question in our hedge percentage does it include the 12 50 ph in it so they are open position or not i think it does multiple speakers so greg is just asking is that against that because you know you ve got this hold back and it does include it greg gordon evercore isi analyst okay that s clear guys curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer one other thing just to tell you we ve sort of purposely held some open here in 2020 because i think if i pick that up from what i was saying is that we think there s room to move pretty significant room to move in 2020 is we don t see it s hard to see that much new build coming on and between now and 2020 so and we re also don t think that the market has fully absorbed the ordc effect but we do think there is a movement and so that we have we re kind of sitting a little bit on 2020 if the curves move you should expect us and they move up you should expect us probably to take some more off if they don t then we re going to be patient greg gordon evercore isi analyst great one more quick question for you maybe a curve ball because i don t know you probably didn t see it but nrg in their release this morning talked about how they are reducing their net debt to ebitda target to between 2 5 times and 2 75 times so they are coming down to sort of where you guys already are in terms of your net debt to ebitda aspirations and they re explicitly targeting eventually getting to an investment grade credit rating so can you just reiterate because it seems like in terms of people had been pushing you in the past sort of why don t you go toward nrg and go to three times and buy back more stock but now it seems like nrg has figured out that they need to come in your direction so can you just reiterate what your aspirations are in terms of capital allocation credit metrics and do you aspire also to ultimately get to ig jim burke executive vice president and chief operating officer yes so look the first thing i d say is imitation is this sincerest form of flattery so but more importantly into the point we ve been pretty steadfast and we did move and you know this we did move getting to 2 5 times out a year because we felt like this is where our stock was trading that made sense to reallocate capital in 2019 and so we did do that but we are absolutely committed to get to 2 5 times and we believe i think it s going to take time i think the first step is actually to get an upgrade from where we are today i think that s squarely in our sides and i think we executed that will happen and that will then lead us to the position where we can get investment grade we do want to get to investment grade the credit spreads at least today probably don t say that that s something that s a big deal but it s not about that i think it would be good for the equity and also would open up opportunities on our commercial industrial retail business where at times we have to sleeve or we may not even get to see the business so there is a business proposition in here and i think this is reason one of the reasons i believe we have such a high free cash flow yield is the risk premium in our business i think that has been driven in the past over time because we carried too much leverage and there was the risk of financial distress in these stocks and i think we want to put that completely in our rear view mirror and i think 2 5 times is a right place to get to have that discussion with the agencies and then we ll see what we do from there but we feel like given the metrics at that 2 5 times and just the absolute level of debt it feels to us like that s the right place to be in order to have a serious discussion about investment grade greg gordon evercore isi analyst right and then that drives a lower free cash flow yield and a higher share price so that s sort of the magic potion of multiple speakers jim burke executive vice president and chief operating officer yes exactly right you got it greg gordon evercore isi analyst i ve taken way too much times guys i ll hop off thank you curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer alright thanks greg operator your next question comes from the line of abe azar with deutsche bank abe your line is open abe azar deutsche bank securities analyst any thoughts on timing of refinancing the rest of the high cost legacy dynegy debt or any key dates to focus on where some of that debt becomes callable curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes abe so i think in terms of just refinancing the two new bond issues that we did have covered most of the amounts that we would need to refinance with the new money at lower cost so the remaining amount of debt reduction are those the lion s share of it will be done with redemptions from cash i think you can look at when the redemption premium step down i think a large number of some of those are in november each year we would do the math when we re planning getting close to redemption days about whether it makes sense to do it earlier or wait till the step down in the redemption premium but i think we ve laid out in the cap table at the end of the presentation that we re planning to do about 800 million that this year and then the balance of to get to the 2 5 times we would do in 2020 abe azar deutsche bank securities analyst got it and then can you provide an update on the status of the moss landing battery when was spending supposed to ramp up and is there something you re waiting for before putting capital to work there curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes so a good question as you know that s a bit of a fluid situation and with inaudible sort of throwing the it seems in our and bankruptcies in our sector there is an obligatory federal versus state fight that always seems to go on ferc versus the state that s kind of slows some things down and it has created what i d say just a little more hair on how pg e wants to proceed but what i can say abe because we re in constant contact with these guys is one the state wanted this project number two the cpuc approved it number three it doesn t suffer from what others have which is it s not while the other money in fact it was by far the lowest cost deal because of the moss landing site so there is no mark to market gain by rejecting the contract and so what we re hearing from pg e is it s full steam ahead what the real question is is when are they going to assume these types of contracts and they are a little concern i believe in how they re going to handle that given this jurisdictional issue with ferc and the battle is going on there so we re moving forward and we have talked to them they want to move forward in the contract we still have a valid contract it s not been rejected the question is when will it be assumed and we re hopeful that sooner rather than later i think what we have to remember is that we do have a contractual commitment here and then we have to weigh the odds of whether whatever be rejected and at this point in time we feel like it s an extremely low probability that it would be rejected given the discussions that we ve had directly with pg e abe azar deutsche bank securities analyst got it thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of praful mehta with citigroup praful your line is open praful mehta citi research analyst so just following up on moss landing it doesn t sound like the decision to reject or resume is going to be taken anytime soon because they probably have to figure out what the exit looks like it could take time let s just put it that way so if it does take time is the assumption that you would continue on the current course assuming that it will at some point get resumed or do you have to hold and wait for the decision which would slow down the entire process curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes so because we are in active discussion with pg e i don t feel like it would be fair for me to have that discussion but i think your observations are correct that s what i was trying to convey i ll be just very direct about it the assumption of contracts could be pushed out and we have a contract right now the only thing that would change that is if it was rejected i think the likelihood of that is very very low and so we ll work with our board and we ll work with pg e when we get to the point which is going to be in the april to may late april sort of may timeframe where we would have to actually sign the big contract for the equipment and we ll make our decision then what we have to do there is a number of different things we could do either in front of the bankruptcy court or working with pg e in order to make sure that we move forward we re committed to the project i just i can t tell you right now what that ultimate decision will be if we have to then make a decision come may to sign an epc contract or equipment contract and we ll have to we ll have to see what that is and i m going to do the consultation with our we have bankruptcy attorneys onboard because we have to understand the process and so we ll have to consult with them and then ultimately we have to go to the board but most importantly i think it s the active dialog that we have with pg e and working with them on certain things that will give us the comfort that we re going to continue on with this project and have no issues or no risk of rejection all that is still playing out but we intend and we re moving forward and with the intent of completing that project praful mehta citi research analyst understood thanks and then maybe on slide 28 you have these realized estimated power prices and there seems to be now for ercot a 6 forecasted premium that you ve kind of estimated for 2020 i know this number has moved around quite a bit could you just give us some perspective on what that 6 dollars now reflects and there s obviously something iso new england as well so some color on the confidence around that number would be helpful curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes so i just wanted to make sure because this it s easily confusing for me by the way we always struggle with what s the best way to show you guys is kind of information so part of this part of that number is what i d call sort of realized actual realized premium relative to where the market came in and then as it relates now most of it in 2020 obviously all of it is really projected there is a significant amount of option value or extrinsic value that is in the market and we model what that value is relative and you lose that value that value decays over time and then ultimately as you go from real time i mean from they head to real time you don t have that anymore you don t have that flexibility part of it is the value of being able to back down units in times in optimized by buying from the market there is a number of different options that you can that you can go after that we have historically proven that we re able to do it s also our ability to hedge at the periods of time where there s just there s just higher pricing than where spot prices come in and that s why it s so important as a company that we have a point of view and that we hedge when prices are at or above that point of view and they have a very good modeling capability so that we feel comfortable that we are hedging at prices above spot and we ve also had a very good track record of being able to do that so it s a combination of things and steve muscato is here with me steve is there anything you would add to that steve muscato senior vice president and chief commercial officer yes it s basically and i think curt you captured it it s the ability to in essence capture different points along the forward curve that we call extrinsic value selling into strength anytime the price moves up and also as we take the portfolio into the day ahead in real time markets being able to optimize around whatever price signals were given and so it s a combination of existing hedges we have on and a combination of hedges we hope to put on in the future curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer and you know what probably it s a good observation though that value does move around because it s influenced by the volatility in the market and we pull it from forward volatility and so as the market changes now we have our own fundamental view around volatility too which factors in when we hedge steve muscato senior vice president and chief commercial officer correct curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer so it does move around some i think we ve been i think what we ve been able to demonstrate i hope i believe we have is that we ve been able to capture a lot of that along the way as we hedge and so in 2019 we ve locked a lot of that volatility in the reality situation is in an increasing price environment that premium will shrink as you would expect because we re managing risk as much as we are absolute price we re trying to create a stable steady earnings and steady earnings stream and we re not looking for the highs of the highs so you may see that that premium will shrink but once the market plateaus out and it hits sort of the highs of the market then it s much easier than to create that premium and then in the years past when prices were actually declining then that we were able to hedge ahead of some of the declines because again our fundamental view shows that the market was actually on a decline and we went out as fast as we could and tried to hedge as much as we could in the forward market and then that actually proved out to work out for us in a big way so that s kind of how we think about it approaching it steve muscato senior vice president and chief commercial officer and i think you asked about new england as an example we ve all seen a material drop off in gas volatility in new england and so that s really the the component that s impacting the new england pricing going into the winter there was a lot of discussion on what s going to happen in algonquin and obviously algonquin volatility wasn t necessarily it didn t materialize and that s reflected also in the forward market at this point praful mehta citi research analyst got you that s super helpful and clearly your track record helps confirm or at least get comfort around those numbers i guess just one final thing around the shareholder base it was very helpful to hear the change in shareholder base given you have dry powder right now to buy back more shares is there any expectation of any kind of block deal or any broader deal with some of these shareholders are looking to exit are they still looking to exit any color or perspective on that curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer so look i think we i think the big thing is you guys probably saw this i mean with the 13 assets that ph came out we ve seen a dramatic change in our shareholder base obviously since we came out of bankruptcy but even recently we ve got two of the largest shareholders we had number two and number three shareholders that are now down to 60 i think one of them is probably below that at this point in time and then we ve got vanguard and fidelity who have now come up to number two and number three and then when we look at our shareholder base and we couldn t say this come out of bankruptcy i think it was about what molly 16 i think out of the 20 now or 15 sorry 15 out the 20 are what we would consider long term investors people who are coming in because they desire to own the stock in the long run they believe in the strategy and they like the price point they re able to get in on and the other thing i like about is as many of those folks came in at lower levels and have actually increased in a significant way their holdings now we re not done and this is why we are going to be in boston and new york next week we re going to europe we wouldn t even have been able to go to europe had we not had a dividend so that opened up doors in europe we are going to go over there and hopefully get in people interested long investors you guys know this and we went up to canada canada are more long term oriented investors and we re hitting about as every long oriented investors that we can hit and i m doing it personally because i think it s important to hear the story directly from us it s the only way in my mind that you get this rotation and you get it without having your stock price up or as you got to create demand for the stock we can do buybacks we can do all those things but at the end of the day we ve got to create demand and all the way we could create demand is get out and tell the story and i think we ve had really good success on that and i m willing to do whatever it takes and i know bill as well and molly will get out on the road if we have to and we ll talk to anybody that is interested in our stock i think it s the only way we know how to do it praful mehta citi research analyst super helpful guys thanks so much curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of angie storozynski from macquarie angie your line is open angie storozynski macquarie research analyst thank you good morning so two questions the 813 million left for buybacks is there any timeline attached to it is it through the end of 2019 curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer so well this will depend right on just where our stock price is but it s probably it could it could leak into the first quarter of 2020 just and this is all dependent angie and i m not trying to avoid the question it just depends on where our price is because as you probably know we have different volumes of buyback at different price points and so as you might expect our stocks moved up some and so we re buying less at that point in time but i think our projection is it could leak over a little bit into the first quarter of 2012 j william holden executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that s right and angie that s consistent with what we said last quarter we said we thought the program to be completed either q4 of this year or likely q1 of year somewhere in that timeframe depending on where the stock is trading angie storozynski macquarie research analyst okay number two is back in december when we met you guys talked about 2020 ebitda being above 2019 i know that there is upside potential upside to power curves but as they look right now do you still think that 2020 would be above midpoint of your current 2019 guidance curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes so let me it s a good question i want to be clear about this so we re i m not talking about this not including crius so but we see sort of flattish over now over 2019 and 2020 and you know this i think angie but for us that s a big deal because dynegy had a huge cliff because of the pjm per capacity clear and we ve been able to bridge that gap and create a more stable earnings profile now that s driven by value levers from the dynegy merger to some extent it s driven by curves and our ability to hedge some of that so we and that s where we are today i would say that depending on where the curves come in you heard that long winded answer i gave to greg but i do think there could be some upside in the curves i think that is more of a 2020 upside and so it could be we could see some of that in 2020 at this point in time though where we are as we think that you were sort of flattish because part of that when we mark that when we mark that when we didn t gave you that comment and we had marked that particular plan it was including some of the uplifted that had already occurred from the ordc so part of what s getting us to that flattish nature is the higher curves and part of that i believe is some of the expectation of the ordc but there could be some upside i we are going to wait obviously through 2019 when we see the 2020 curves move more significantly to lead that out and of course we ll wait all the way to october november timeframe before we give guidance on 2020 angie storozynski macquarie research analyst okay and my last question just a quick one i know we talked you talked about the battery project the pg e but how do you think about the fact that the project returns most likely you were planning to add some project level debt i would assume that the cost of that debt is now going to go up given that the offtakers credits has plunged so i mean do you still think it s an attractive return taking that into account curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes so first of all we re not going to do project level debt we ve made the decision not to project level financing it i mean i ve been in this industry too long and i remember when everybody was doing project level debts and they got confusing and we don t want a capital structure that s confusing and we like the returns i think we said this when we came out these are on a non levered basis these are returns that are in the mid teens that s very attractive to us and so it will be on balance sheet we still believe in those returns i think it s important to know that it s the absolute so we do benefit from the price or excuse me from revenues from power so we get a resource adequacy payment as part and then we also can optimize using the battery in the energy market the key on that is it doesn t it s not about absolute power price it s about the volatility in power price and our ability when prices in the day are low because there s all this solar generation and other generation and then the solar generation comes off because the sun s going down and goes down and then prices go up it s that arbitrage that occurs in there that we get so prices theoretically could be zero during the day and then 10 or 20 during the night and that s where we capture that value so we feel very comfortable about the value and the returns on this and so nothing has changed in our mind in terms of the value of this and in fact we know that california needs more of this type of investment which actually is an opportunity for us as well but that just gives you a sense of just what the demand is and if there is a higher demand for battery that means that pricing when you go from the heavy solar period to where the sun goes down that means the pricing is going to be high until they get they get all that new capacity on angie storozynski macquarie research analyst very good thank you curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer thanks angie operator your final question comes from the line of julien dumoulin smith with bank of america julien your line is open julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst so a couple of quick ones i make it snappy here so firstly just going back to the hedges just wanted to understand the change in new england the price hedge start on the 2019 just wanted to understand a little bit more detail on that and then also the expected gen moved around a good bit i get that power curves moving that shift things around anything to mention given that it was around it was across all the regions but ercot especially the northeast curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes so on the i think on new england a lot of what you saw there was really the what steve was describing earlier in the extrinsic value has come down because of the lower volatilities and so that s just had the effect of reducing the realized price without having a corresponding benefit from hedges because the extrinsic value is not fully hedged i look at steve on the whether there s anything of note in the volumes steve muscato senior vice president and chief commercial officer yes what we re seeing in volumes as we do as we continue to go through our operational improvements we are seeing some changes in how the fleet runs at night whether they re start based or run based or hours based machines and so that s causing some volume changes that you ll see it s not having material gross margin impact at this point because it s really just whether they run through the night or cycle on and off and one thing i ll add on new england it s really associated with if you look at algonquin pricing it was pretty contained this winter compared to what you ve seen historically during cold snaps like you look at 2014 as an example and that decline in volatility is participating through the market and the big reason for it was there were some lng tankers brought in at the gateway terminal outside of boston so it s something that we have to monitor from year to year how lng impacts that market and perceptions on how it s going to impact that margin j william holden executive vice president and chief financial officer and the only thing i ll just add on to what steve said is some of those price increases were in off peak hours which has affected the dispatch and to the extent we dispatch more in the off peak it lowers the average realized price because we re run that we re earning margin but we re running more at lower price hours julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it alright excellent and then lastly just real quickly on the illinois situation obviously you are somewhat dynamic and fluid here given the mps and the prospects of legislation and your own process on examining the portfolio can you give us a little bit of a more of a sense on timeline and then what the potential combination here are i suppose legislation is probably at some point during the session this year mps is at some point this year question mark but just help us understand your decision tree if you will curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer yes so a good question i think you guys know that there is a new administration in illinois governor pritzker he has a fairly aggressive green agenda for the state they signed on to the paris accord they made a big announcement on that and the governor has asked us at least that s our understanding through the illinois epa to have further discussions with the epa about the multi pollutant standards that the illinois pollution control board had sent forward for hearing we agreed to that i think whenever a governor ask you to do something to a state you typically do it and it has not slowed anything down yet and we ve said that we gave them 45 days that s march 15th coming up i think the discussions have been very good and so we are working toward what we hope is and i feel i d say cautiously optimistic a compromise with everybody involved including the environmental groups in the ag s office on something that will allow us to move forward so i would tell you that we are still on the timeline that we would be making decisions around our portfolio in sort of the mid year timeframe and i think things will become in some way it could even become clear to people what we re doing even sooner than that but i think action would probably be taken more in the middle of the year i ve been very open about the fact that we ve got an older an aging fleet there and the capacity market design is horrid and it s just not a very good market and we got challenged assets and so we re trying to build something where we can have a sustainable business and i think part of that is making some hard decisions like we did in texas to retire plants we ll see about that but that s on the horizon for 2019 and i ve been very clear with everybody involved in illinois that this company is going to take action one way or another because we re not going to continue to bleed cash and bleed ebitda we re going to clean up this portfolio and we are going to move on with our business it takes a tremendous amount of our time relative to the ebitda that it provides to the company and that s not sustainable and it won t be so that s about what i can say at this point in time on that julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it alright thank you all very much curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer thank you operator this concludes our question and answer session i will now turn the call back over to curt morgan for closing remarks curtis a morgan president and chief executive officer once again thank you for your time this morning and we appreciate you being on our call and we look forward to the next time we have the opportunity to talk about our company so thank you operator this concludes today s conference call thank you for your participation you may now disconnect duration 72 minutes call participants molly

naidu rodrik and zucman are on the cutting edge of a new era in economics research one that casts serious doubt on the received wisdom that the free market should not be jeopardized through government intervention you would be hard pressed to find an academic economist in good standing now who doubts the essential contingency of economic outcomes the discipline has largely rejected the simplistic economics says pattern of policy prescription the idea that theory implies we must enact this or that usually elite favoring policy the public has good reason to doubt what economists have to say but the dead weight of decades of bad economics and of bad interventions by professional economists in the public debate remains in the late 1990s leading economists advocated for financial deregulation in the early 2000s federal reserve chairman alan greenspan put his great and unmerited prestige to work advocating in congress for regressive tax policy more recently in the financial crisis and the global recession that followed leading members of the economics profession placed their prestige behind the idea that the main threat to the economy was spiraling government debt and a resulting spike in interest rates that would lead to the crowding out of private investment and a stagflation crisis of the type experienced in the 1970s the fact that these dire warnings repeatedly failed to come true has not stopped a march of bad policies such as misguided fiscal austerity from being enacted by politicians who think they are doing what economics demands or so they say every new generation proclaims itself to have discovered empirical verification for the first time the public thus has good reason to doubt our lesson and they will understandably be reluctant to accord a new generation of economists the same level of prestige and deference particularly if the argument we make about why we should be listened to rests solely on an overly optimistic narrative of scientific progress such narratives have an unfortunate history in the discipline perhaps in all disciplines it seems that every new generation proclaims itself to have discovered empirical verification for the first time and is thus in a unique position to enter the policy realm in triumph in the conclusion to his presidential address to the american economic association in 1964 for example george stigler announced the age of quantification is now full upon us we are armed with a bulging arsenal of techniques of quantitative analysis and of a power as compared to untrained common sense comparable to the displacement of archers by cannon the desire to measure economic phenomena is now in the ascendant it is a scientific revolution of the very first magnitude i am convinced that economics is finally at the threshold of its golden age nay we already have one foot through the door the revolution in our thinking has begun to reach public policy and soon it will make irresistible demands upon us our expanding theoretical and empirical studies will inevitably and irresistibly enter into the subject of public policy and we shall develop a body of knowledge essential to intelligent policy formulation and then quite frankly i hope that we become the ornaments of democratic society whose opinions on economic policy shall prevail thankfully naidu rodrik and zucman are not nearly as triumphalist as stigler was but still they and the profession at large must reckon with the significance of this posture after all stigler s research and policy agenda is exactly what naidu rodrik and zucman are saying has been shown to be an intellectual dead end from which the field has only just extricated itself and yet he refers to his agenda in the same tone and rhetoric with which they refer to theirs this fact tells us that empirical verification and the narrative of progress cannot by themselves accomplish the substantial epistemological and coalition building work that the efip authors seek to place on their shoulders tests of economic theories are not simple reality checks they are shaped by implicit and unconscious bias and a reflexive defense of orthodoxy the truth is that empirical methods are always laden with assumptions both of the formal economic theoretic sort and the more folk wisdom like traditions and methods associated with the discipline s most prominent and powerful members tests of economic theories are not simple reality checks we must be on guard against the way they are informed by implicit and unconscious bias and a reflexive defense of mainstream orthodoxy stigler is a case in point earlier in that address he eagerly anticipates the application of economics to the fields of antitrust and common carrier regulation yet in the same speech he also explicitly attacks the empirical work of the german historical and american institutionalist scholars who had a great deal of sway over the introduction of regulatory and antitrust regimes during the new deal scholarship in that tradition was in fact highly rigorous it was just their ideas that motivated stigler s criticism he waged a career long successful campaign of vilification against institutionalist economics in fact from the perspective of what he and his collaborators called price theory when that approach finally made the leap from the academy and was brought to bear on antitrust and sectoral regulation starting in the late 1970s stigler s theory that regulation served inefficient incumbents at the expense of innovative entrants and that anti trust kept businesses who should properly go out of business in the market had an enormous impact on policy the deregulation of the trucking and airline industries in the late 1970s of telecom in the 1990s and of finance in the 2000s as well as the ongoing erosion of antitrust laws at the hands of the federal judiciary culminating most recently in the 2018 supreme court ruling ohio v american express stigler s enormous intellectual and professional success a lifelong campaign of academic imperialism promoted and funded by right wing interests seeking to roll back the new deal dealt immense damage to the body politic and to the public reputation of the economics profession the field has been turned into a safe space for rich white people to justify and naturalize the status quo but it turns out the scholars stigler vilified were right about how the economy worked this is but one example of a pattern repeated through the history of the discipline economists have drawn and redrawn disciplinary boundaries to exclude anything that challenged incumbent wealth and power including marginalizing the contributions of scholars and would be scholars from underrepresented communities the result was to turn the field into a safe space for rich white people to justify and naturalize the status quo another stark example comes from the work and career of economist abram harris who wrote about the banking sector s discrimination against black borrowers including on the part of black bankers as a key source of ongoing racial wealth inequality as a professor at the university of chicago in 1961 harris proposed to teach an undergraduate course on market power monopoly and antitrust policy and sought to have it listed in the economics department in response stigler privately told the department chair that the new course arouses no enthusiasm on my part it sounds like a protracted bull session in which large ideas are neither carefully analyzed nor empirically tested my own inclination would be 1 to list it with explicit proviso that it is only for as long as he teaches it and 2 advise our majors to forget it unfortunately jettisoning stiglerian methodology is not nearly sufficient to overcome this history of marginalization for example in the last several years a controversy has played out over the impact of so called ban the box regulations which seek to counter discrimination against the formerly incarcerated by restricting employers usually in the public sector from asking about criminal history as part of the job application process such legislation draws substantially on the work of sociologist devah pager who documented labor market discrimination against those tainted by past experience with the criminal justice enterprise given the high rates of incarceration among young black men the result is not just individual but group level discrimination lasting for a lifetime despite the so called empirical turn harmful pathologies remain embedded in the economics profession in response however several economics researchers concluded that such policies reduce employment opportunities for black men who had never been incarcerated because in the absence of information to the contrary employers assume such applicants do in fact have a criminal record and therefore eliminate them from hiring pools this finding received wide attention in the media and from leading think tanks fitting as it did into a narrative of misguided do gooder regulation shown to be counterproductive but this revisionist scholarship which is every bit a part of the empirical revolution naidu rodrik and zucman laud has problems of its own research by the economist terry ann craigie actually shows ban the box policies operate as intended this episode reveals that despite the so called empirical turn harmful pathologies remain embedded in the economics profession the marginalization of underrepresented scholars the assumption that economists clean up the mistakes made by social scientists from other disciplines and the eagerness to believe that egalitarian labor market regulations backfire against those they are intended to help all of these interlinked tendencies do not dissolve just because we have learned how to run experiments and quasi experiments and there is simply no basis in the history of science to think that they would justifying racial inequalities and other retrograde scholarly tendencies have always found ways to propagate themselves within whatever the dominant scientific paradigm might be so economists had best be on the lookout as they wheedle their way into contemporary empirical research institutional privilege is real a final word of caution should inform the work of efip institutional privilege is real these scholars operate in elite departments where support for their work is abundant and where threats to their academic freedom may feel remote that is an increasingly rare thing in u s higher education where successive rounds of state funding cuts have transformed public universities into vulnerable hosts for private parasites in the face of cuts administrators go looking for other funding sources to sustain them and at least in economics the open hands tend to come from business funders and right wing foundations with an agenda of instituting curricula of their own making and of hiring scholars they know will toe the line i fear that scholars without direct experience of this will be too eager to look to the bright future of a newly enlightened economics profession flush with sophisticated empiricism without recognizing the threat this right wing takeover poses to the work of less well appointed scholars and departments i do not mean to detract from the importance of the initiative naidu rodrik and zucman have launched economics desperately needs a fresh outlook after a decade that has not been kind to our public reputation too many economists have reacted defensively to that public condemnation but these three point in a new and more promising direction acknowledge that our first loyalty must be to truth and our second to the public and its welfare the will to wealth and power has acted on us and on our discipline for too long and the changing winds are all to the good hopefully when we look back at this moment a decade from now we will be able to see this as one of a series of steps we took to set the field on a better course

president donald trump is already planning a signing ceremony for next month for what he touts as a big trade deal with china but will the unfinished trade agreement with beijing like trump s out with a whimper summit in vietnam with north korean leader kim jong un turn out to be a dud president donald trump is already planning a signing ceremony for next month for what he touts as a big trade deal with china but will the unfinished trade agreement with beijing like trump s out with a whimper summit in vietnam with north korean leader kim jong un turn out to be a dud it s hard to know exactly where things stand between the united states and china after several months of negotiations while trump says the two sides are very very close to a deal u s trade representative robert lighthizer told congress wednesday that much still needs to be done both before an agreement is reached and more importantly after it is reached if one is reached on thursday white house economic advisor larry kudlow dialed up the expectations trumpeting what he called a historic deal in the making including far reaching commitments by china to limit the state s role in the economy just minutes later u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin tried to tamp down expectations the deal is not done yet but we ve made a lot of progress he said one problem is the administration s and especially the president s tendency to hype modest reforms as major achievements trump touted a few tweaks to the existing trade deal with south korea as a brand new agreement for example and he has tried to present a slightly modified north american free trade agreement as a historic breakthrough the president is relentlessly uninformative about these things said phil levy a senior fellow on the global economy at the chicago council on global affairs he told us with nafta it s the biggest deal ever for what was essentially a minor rewrite in almost two years of talks with china one important factor has been an internal administration divide between those who want to crack down on beijing s abusive trade practices such as state subsidies and stealing foreign technology and the dominant role of the state in the chinese economy and those who fixate on the bilateral trade balance and basically just want to export more u s commodities such as soybeans and natural gas the president is clearly on one side of the argument trump has no interest in china making deep structural reforms he just wants them to buy more stuff said derek scissors a china expert at the american enterprise institute trump s desire to secure any sort of agreement with china even one that falls short of what his own trade experts are pushing for helps explain his decision over the weekend to suspend the threat of additional tariffs on china due to start in march the main source of leverage washington had to force concessions from china he gave up on the march 1 deadline in november he said he wanted a deal since then the talks have been fake scissors said the biggest question around whatever emerges between the two countries is the extent of structural reforms that china agrees to make since last year washington has been pressuring beijing to make fundamental changes in how it manages its economy by lessening the role of the state curbing the theft of intellectual property opening up new markets and throttling back plans to use state power to create chinese giants in emerging fields such as semiconductors and artificial intelligence kudlow on thursday suggested that china was considering making big concessions in areas including state subsidies and currency manipulation but conceded that chinese president xi jinping and other top leaders would still have to sign off on such a deal mnuchin also stressed the need for structural reforms but suggested there was still a lot more work to be done if the united states fails to fix two decades of problematic chinese economic behavior it might be because negotiators were given a three month window to address issues that have festered for four presidential administrations you say you want deep reforms and you say you want to do it in 90 days including three major holidays said levy who served as a trade advisor to president george w bush that s stacking the deck against deep reform a more fundamental issue might be the structure of the chinese economy especially after six years with xi at the helm consolidating power in beijing and centralizing the government s role in the economy we are telling xi you have to give up state control of all these things and he s not going to do it we are not dealing with anyone who has any interest in reform scissors said in order to push beijing to make concessions he said the united states would have to be willing to accept some short term pain such as the economic harm that tariffs inflict on u s producers and consumers lost export markets for u s farmers or a potential fall in u s stock market indices we have to be willing to pay costs in order to coerce them into making structural reforms and we aren t he said even the areas that the administration says it is working to fix financial services intellectual property protections and the like don t address the fundamental challenge to american workers posed by china s export powered economy scissors said this is a sellout of industrial workers and a gift to wall street he said even if the two sides do reach a deal next month that won t entirely end the trade war trump has suspended for now the threat of additional tariffs on chinese goods but has left in place the 10 percent tariff on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of chinese exports also in place for now are china s retaliatory measures including a precipitous decline in the purchase of u s agricultural goods taken together that means that the groups in the united states feeling the pain from the trade war including manufacturers who have to pay more for the intermediate goods they need to make finished products and the farmers pining for lost markets will keep on feeling it when do those groups get relief levy asked at what point do they say it s been a little while and there s no end in sight and we re suffering here he suggested that continued pain from trump s tariffs could nudge congress to take action to rein in the president s ability to slap levies on major u s trade partners without any input from lawmakers but congress s role in any china trade deal is a lot more uncertain lighthizer told the body on wednesday that it wouldn t have any vote on the agreement whatever deal the two sides eventually come up with lighthizer said the administration considers it a remedy to chinese trade abuses that opened the door to tariffs in the first place under a so called section 301 investigation it s not a trade deal that congress can vote on in other words but if the pending agreement with china is in kudlow s words historic it s hard to see how congress could be cut out of the loop entirely substantively the agreement is either fake or it absolutely calls for a congressional role scissors said from an economic point of view it s much more important than the u s mexico canada agreement it s either fraud or they have to get congressional approval on substantive grounds if the two sides do reach some sort of agreement perhaps next month at trump s mar a lago property in florida it is likely to disappoint a broader group of china hawks in washington who had finally seen bipartisan consensus about the need to push back against beijing s abuses and who saw the trade war as a rare opportunity to force china to make concessions there s particular unease over the administration s apparent willingness to use huawei a big chinese telecom maker in the crosshairs with washington for the security threat posed by its technology as a bargaining chip to sweeten some sort of trade deal trump has recently downplayed the idea of banning huawei technology even as u s officials strong arm allies to ban the telecom giant and last week trump suggested that criminal charges against a huawei executive could be dropped as part of a trade deal china hawks in the national security community aren t going to stand down so easily no wait a second we just got serious and you didn t fix it levy said that s especially true if you see leniency toward huawei

quarter fuel and petroleum product volume was 4 4 billion litres relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 q4 2017 on a full year basis fuel and petroleum product volume was 17 0 billion

october 2018 as part of parkland s investment parkland will be the exclusive supplier of fuel to filld in canada retail highlights fourth quarter adjusted ebitda of 78 million a decrease of 16 million relative to q4 2017 due to very strong comparable gasoline and diesel margins in q4 2017 and softer fourth quarter 2018 margins in some markets our underlying retail business is performing well with consistent execution in the field resulting in strong key performance indicators full year adjusted ebitda was 316 million an increase of 85 million relative to 2017 primarily due to the acquisitions fourth quarter company c store sssg was 10 3 our 12th consecutive quarter of positive company c store sssg while full year company c store sssg was 7 6 growth was attributable to the successful

backcourt convenience store optimization that resulted in higher forecourt to backcourt conversion rates fourth quarter company volume sssg was 3 5 while full year company volume sssg was 0 7 the

petroleum product volume decreased 4 relative to q4 2017 primarily due to softer volumes in western canada this was partially offset by a 4 decrease in operating costs as parkland continues to maintain a strong emphasis on cost management ongoing optimization of our commercial brand portfolio in various geographies has seen certain legacy operations particularly in eastern canada successfully rebranded to ultramar this enables parkland to drive future growth and sustained profitability under one aligned customer value proposition supply highlights fourth quarter adjusted ebitda of 199 million an increase of 105 million relative to q4 2017 these exceptional results were primarily driven by profitable supply sourcing initiatives improved supply economics continued efforts in executing parkland s supply advantage strategy and strong refining crack spreads due to the rapid price decrease of both crude feedstock and refined products in the fourth quarter parkland also realized a 49 million benefit from its working capital funding agreement at the burnaby refinery which flows through cost of purchases on a full year basis this benefit totalled 20 million full year adjusted ebitda of 561 million an increase of 401 million relative to 2017 the increase was driven by full year contributions from the acquisitions and the factors outlined above refinery

officer general counsel thank you zach and good morning everyone as zach mentioned rina will not be joining us this morning and i will therefore be providing an update our financial results for the quarter feel better rina the fourth quarter kept off another great year for starwood property trust one which demonstrated the strength of our diverse multi cylinder platform our core earnings for the fourth quarter totaled 155 million or 0 54 per share bringing total earnings per share for the year to 2 19 collectively our investment cylinders delivered an roe of just over 12 in 2018 despite having higher cash balances at times during the year i will begin this morning with our largest business the commercial and residential lending segment during the quarter this segment contributed core earnings of 108 million or 0 37 per share on the commercial lending side we had originated 1 6 billion of loans across 13 investments we funded 1 1 billion during the quarter of which 1 billion related to new loans and 145 million of which related to pre existing loan commitments we received 806 million from repayments bringing the size of our sizable commercial loan portfolio at year end to a record 7 8 billion also on this segment is our non qualified mortgage or non qm residential lending business as a reminder these are loans with high fico scores and low ltvs that do not qualify for agency financing as of quarter end the loans in our non qm portfolio had a weighted average coupon of 6 3 and average ltv of 66 at an average fico of 724 when securitized these loans have a double digit leverage yield during the quarter we completed our second non qm securitization so 280 million of loans and retaining 45 million of subordinate securities while the transaction qualified as a sale for gaap purposes we consolidated the related trust on our balance sheet under the vie rules after the sale and new purchases during the quarter of 319 million at year end we held 624 million of loans and 88 million of securities with net equity outstanding for this business totaling 268 million at year end i will now turn to our newest segment infrastructure lending which contributed core earnings of 4 million or 0 01 per share for its first full quarter results although the majority of this acquisition was completed in september there was a delayed closing on two loans which we ultimately purchased from ge in october for 146 million during the quarter we received repayments of 160 million and acquired three loans with gross commitments of 96 million bringing the total portfolio to 2 billion at year end 97 of these assets are floating rates i will now turn to our property segment which contributed core earnings of 33 million or 0 12 per share during the quarter we sold four properties within our master lease cabelas portfolio for a core gain net of tax of 11 million bringing our year to date sales in this portfolio to 209 million we have now completed the sales plan that management established for the assets in this portfolio in doing so we have decreased our net equity exposure by 50 while increasing underwritten current cash yield for the remaining portfolio by 200 basis points to over 12 the wholly owned assets in this segment continued to perform very well with a blended cash on cash yield of 11 4 and weighted average occupancy of 98 collectively these assets are financed with debt containing an average remaining duration of nine years and weighted average fixed rate of 3 8 i will now turn to our investing and servicing segment which contributed core earnings of 62 million or 0 22 per share to the quarter in our cmbs book as we do almost every quarter we opportunistically sold 76 million of bonds for core gains of 30 million we also purchased 70 million of cmbs leaving our portfolio relatively flat to last quarter at 1 billion on the servicing front we recognized fees of 12 million this quarter this amount does not include a 2 million fee that was expected in q4 but slipped into the first quarter in our conduit we securitized 692 million of loans and three transactions bringing our total securitization volume for the year to 1 5 billion in seven transactions as we mentioned last quarter we had eight 224 million securitization flip from the third quarter into the fourth quarter which drove the higher quarter over quarter volume in the reit property portfolio as we do almost every quarter we sold assets with a cost basis of 25 million for net core gains of 2 million bringing an undepreciated balance of this portfolio to 342 million across 22 investments together with the properties in our property segment these asset carry 291 million or 1 06 per share of accumulated depreciation before i conclude i wanted to walk you through a 7 million increase for our loan loss reserve which is recorded during the quarter we had an impairment charge during the quarter related to a 21 million first mortgage loan on a grocery distribution facility located in montgomery alabama that is leased to a single tenant this loan was risk weighted five last quarter the tenant filed for bankruptcy earlier in the year but the bankruptcy court subsequently rejecting the lease this loan had an appraised value below our loan balance which resulted in an increase to our allowance for loan losses by 7 million representing the difference between the loan s previous general reserve which were reversed and a specific impairment reserve which we established this quarter in addition we also had a 14 million first mortgage loan on a grocery distribution facility in orlando florida that is leased to the same tenant this lease was similarly rejected by the bankruptcy court this loan was risk weighted four last quarter no loan losses required on this loan since the appraised value of the assets exceeded our loan balance the excess value was driven by our unamortized purchase discount on the loan and certain lease termination payments that we received in 2019 both of these loans were originally purchased as part of a pool in 2009 i will conclude by remarks with a few comments about our capitalization and dividend we ended the year with over 13 billion of credit facilities from 27 different credit providers and 2 billion of corporate debt as of december 31 we had 3 9 billion of undrawn debt capacity and a net debt to undepreciated equity ratio of 2 times as we discussed with you last quarter we began settling our 2019 convertible notes when they entered their open redemption period during the fourth quarter we settle 28 million principal amount of notes with 5 million in cash and 1 2 million newly issued common shares subsequent to year end we settled the remaining 78 million principal amount of notes with 12 million in cash and 3 6 million newly issued common shares during the quarter we also issued 1 7 million of the 1 9 million contingent op units related to our second affordable housing portfolio these units were issuable upon realization of certain property tax abatements which decreased our ongoing property expenses the majority of tax abatements have not been realized finally i will turn to our dividend for the first quarter of 2019 we declared a 0 48 per share dividend which will be paid on april 15 to shareholders of record on march 29 this represents an 8 7 annualized dividend yield on yesterday s closing share price of 22 05 with that i ll turn the call over to jeff for his comments jeffrey f dimodica president managing director thanks andrew 2018 was another tremendous year for our company with a 16 billion balance sheet we continue to diversify our business model our opportunities set and our financing sources while deploying a record 11 6 billion of capital in 2018 alone more than half of our 2018 volume came from our core business large loan lending which originated 6 billion of loans up 43 versus 2017 and at similar risk and return metrics to what we ve achieved since inception our capital markets team was again able to actively manage our borrowing costs lower through a combination of high yield unsecured where we issued bonds at libor plus 128 in january and were put on upgrade watch in q3 by moody s through the runoff of what turned out to be more expensive convertible debt bank warehouse lines where were lowered spread and increased capacity single borrower securitizations to optimize deal level financing and first mortgage sales we were able to continue to lower our borrowing costs to produce consistent returns on our large loan lending business additionally it s worth noting that in the last year we have consistently sold off a large junior mezzanine first loss position on our largest and most complex originations and we ve used our financing advantage and global reach to earn junior mezzanine or equity like returns on what s ultimately senior risk in the capital deck going forward we expect another strong loan originations quarter in q1 with approximately 1 billion close to date in our core large loan lending basis alone but like many of our peers we pulled back on investing during the market turbulence of late 2018 as transaction volumes simultaneously fell at times of market stress we ve always raised the bar on new investments and therefore focus on only the highest value add investments through runoff asset sales and a note sales we ve been able to build a cash cushion for opportunities across businesses in the coming months and quarters without raising new debt or equity capital on december 14 we welcomed approximately 200 investors and analysts to our second investor day in new york city the slides and audio of which are available on our website management spent over five hours going through each of our investment cylinders in detail and we re excited to have the opportunity to explain our newest cylinders non qm residential lending and energy infrastructure lending in detail we completed our second non qm residential lending securitization in the quarter and in our infrastructure lending business we have closed over 250 million in new loans since acquisition and have a significantly larger pipeline today we expect these purchases will achieve yields which are very accretive to our current portfolio we have begun the process of selling down the lowest returning assets from our energy infrastructure portfolio of acquisition and expect that through maturities and sales that that portfolio we purchased in september will be cut in half within a year and replaced with new assets that we expect to contribute significantly to core earnings versus the existing portfolio at our investor day we also went through a detailed analysis of net operating income and cap rate expectations across our approximately 3 5 billion owned real estate portfolios that add up to well over 500 million in gains or nearly 2 per share of potential upside these gains give us significant dividend cushion and a potential source of capital that can create incremental earnings as we ultimately reinvest those gains over time andrew mentioned the bass pro and cabela sale which we made to date which have returned approximately half of our equity and left us with a core portfolio of 16 assets with long term fixed rate financing that now return a 13 5 cash return inclusive of contractual rents step ups on a company that s performing beyond our expectations since their acquisition as evidenced by their term loan which trades at approximately par today versus 90 when we acquired the portfolio we also talked about our low income housing tax credit multifamily portfolio in florida which has seen rent increases far in excess of our underwriting tax abatements that have added significant equity value and have additional upside in units rolled to market rental rates in future years these apartment investments are extremely consistent and durable and make up nearly half of the overall gains in our property segment our reit segment obtained 11 new servicing assignments in the quarter and 34 in fiscal year 2018 which totaled 21 billion in unpaid balance and brought our name servicer portfolio up to 176 trusts with an unpaid balance of 84 billion when we purchased lnr in 2013 we were named service special servicer on 127 billion of trusts which fell to below 69 billion in q3 of 2017 through partnerships and third party assignments we managed to significantly increase our named portfolio despite the planned runoff of our 1 0 book which will produce incremental revenue for our servicer well into the future and provide a hedge against credit deterioration in the broader market our mortgage capital continue to grow market share among non bank lenders in the quarter and for the first time in our history grow over 20 of all non bank cmbs loans in the second half of 2018 benefiting from tremendous historical collateral performance long term relationships and their standing within the starwood brand we ve seen a dramatic flattening of the yield curve in the last year with a 10 year treasury rate down 21 basis points from 290 to 269 while one month libor increased by over 80 basis points from 166 to 249 as interesting as that 100 plus basis point flattening of the curve is is that forward libor is now below spot libor for the first time in 10 years you will see in our supplemental that we released this morning that we disclosed for the first time our estimation of the impact to earnings of libor following the forward curve lower due to our diversified business model and the after money libor floors we typically put in all of our cre loans our earnings are only forecast to fall by 0 01 per share for 200 basis point drop in libor from today s levels which we believe is exemplary versus both our peers and versus the 0 15 in gains we will have per share if libor rises by the same amount i will also note that we expect our property portfolio to perform better in a lower rate environment as well with that i will turn the call to barry barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer thanks jeff thanks andrew thanks zach good morning everyone thank you for listening in i m going to keep my comments pretty short this morning well i ll just and it s the beginning of the year so i ll talk about our view for the year and even next year i think we re operating under the common assumption or the gross assumption that the economy was slow in 2020 probably for two reasons one is the expiration of stimulus package of 300 billion and the second will be the ceos and other business leaders years in headlines as we re seeing between left and right and the political battle next year and with uncertainty comes delays in capital spending and it ll probably break the economy i think you ll see that manifest itself in the fourth quarter of this year people anticipate the election cycle and also you re not lapping against this stimulus package it will be zero spend in 2020 at the moment that informs the view of interest rates and right now we may or may not see a june increase given this morning gdp forecast and revisions maybe 50 50 don t think you ll see the december increase and don t think they ll do anything in the election cycle most likely you could even see a decrease in libor which is one of the reasons jeff highlighted the impact of a drop in rates which is shocking for me to say that because i never thought we d see the 10 year 265 frankly so whatever these comments are worth it i m shocked you have virtually negative real rates again in the united states and across the world and the weight of all the quantitative easing around the world has kept rates lower everywhere which has created some interesting opportunities for us and one of those which is not obvious to you probably is that our pace of investment offshore has picked up so we had a book of roughly 500 million actually even less 326 million in europe in 2017 those were the loans originated in our book in 2018 it was almost 900 million of investments offshore almost all in europe and what we call the wine growing countries jeffrey f dimodica president managing director beer drinking barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer beer drinking countries sorry yes it s not southern europe and this year 2019 we ve already closed or committed to around 450 million in just february so you re going to see us diversify and achieve our ltvs now through our infrastructure investments we have 55 people in london and a dedicated debt team so i d expect you might see us continue to increase our lending internationally which is exciting and that s what our job is to be a steward of capital and earn the highest risk adjusted returns on the capital which goes to our thoughts on the complexity of the business we built which were in my comments and in the press release and we re i think you all know we probably have the higher direct ownership with any mortgage trust or what we call finance company in the business today which positions well over a 100 million owned by senior management so we treat our investors capital just as we do with our own because it is substantially our own so my theory is and that we should have multiple business lines and we should never have to force capital down the sleeve where the risks exceed the rewards and so we ve built multiple product lines and excited to see what we ve accomplished in the nearly 10 years since we started with the near non qm business and now the energy lending business the energy lending business i d say we lagged into we paid a price that probably was slightly higher than we would have liked at the end of the day but i m really encouraged by the pipeline and the new commitments we have both what we ve weed close and what we expect to close which will probably exceed the return on our real estate book which was the whole point of getting the business anyway so you ll see us in a year of semi transition as we have the maturities and sales of lower yielding notes and then the roe and the business will increase and basically contribute we hope meaningfully to our earnings next year but it s a really exciting vertical and so far we re doing better than we under wrote on new originations and we re pretty happy about that and i m excited that is not correlated to our real estate book although i understand the complexity we ve now thrown on the analyst community because those of you who follow property don t know much about energy but bear with us because it was a 10 of equity it wasn t a giant trade it will be even less we ll probably keep it around that 500 million of equity deployed in the 5 base or something like that i also think that again you have to look at where we are in the cycle the slowing economy is good for us we like rates low slow growth is nirvana for the property cycle it doesn t induce tons of new supply people are kind of reticent to begin construction you ve already seen those factors in the multifamily start numbers you saw i guess this week and one of the reasons driving the drop in construction is the extreme rise in construction prices the cost of construction is up probably 10 in some markets year over year driven at least half by labor which is really scarce and also by materials particularly steel prices in high rises so existing property and all of our roughly 8 billion of loan book is worth more because it s harder to replace and rents have to rise and to justify new construction slower economy rather than a galloping economy keeps the real estate community development community keeps their capital in their pocket as they contemplate whether they should start consumption now or not and the banks god bless them have been incredibly disciplined in the cycle and remain disciplined we don t see the excesses we see in the lending market come from the non bank lenders not from the banks and that can include offshore money particularly in the mezzanine market that searching the goal for yields and sometimes i think doesn t really understand the returns that their or the where pricing might be if there we were not so we ve taken advantage of that and we ve actually layered in recently in doe with a scene of we took the junior the senior mezzanine and not the junior mezzanine and pushed ourselves way down in the stack so to achieve our returns there with safety which has been our model from the start and we could run this company at higher roes but levering it up further and more like our peers and we ve decided not to do that and we re trying to deploy capital consistent returns and be safe and disciplined and predictable and the diversification which some of you don t really like gives us allows us to sleep at night there s no one thing happening anywhere that s going to injure the model the other thing i two things i talked about andrew mentioned it briefly on this these two loan losses or one loan loss will have we brought that portfolio in 2009 nine years ago so that was a different team actually it wasn t even this team and this was jeffrey f dimodica president managing director two teams ago barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer two teams ago so andrew j sossen chief operating officer general counsel none of both impairments were taken barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer yeah so we ve never taken the impairments anyway so those are in a book of large actually i think we ve originated over 24 billion of loans in the 10 years i ll take that ratio pretty impressive actually i d say nine years later so we ve got a lot of earnings out of that thing for a long time and then belly flop by the borrower the other thing is it is really something when you see the servicing book turnaround and the name servicer go from 64 to 84 or something billion dollars i mean that s super exciting you re getting a free option on the collapse of something down the road and you re not paying for it there s not a lot of earnings coming from bit but we re excited to see lnr continue its growth and the teams are doing a great job and the other thing we mentioned we talked we re always going to have gains most likely i mean we have these gains in our book we told you about them repeatedly including at our investor day which jeff mentioned then they re recurring non recurring we understand that that they re not easy to underwrite but if you look at companies like ladder which i ll mention by name which i don t often do i mean they re doing this for a business that s what their businesses they make investments they trade a pretty good number right now relative to us and that is a business recurring nonrecurring gains they invest they lever they take harvest they take gains and that s sort of a portion a small portion of what we do all the time because for us with the database we have it will be foolish to not take advantage of that we always have information on this trust we buy and sell securities all the time and hopefully their guys are doing a job and we re making money interestingly if you look at our portfolio split things like our conduit slow down this year it was down year over year but it s a good business and we and it s a high roe business and so we are able to observe that with other business units that we have and i think i m really pleased with the team development but we ve never been had a bigger footprint in the market jeff mentioned our conduit market share of nonbank originations of roe and then our lending team led by dennis and his group have done a great job and we probably see every most obviously 90 of every large loan and maybe 90 yes probably 90 and we balance you can see us we re doing very diversified book i mean we re both by product type by geography within the united states and then outside the united states and this is a diversified company and what we re trying to do is convince the market that they should divorce us from book value this company can continue to produce high roes on the dollar you give us 1 we ll give you 1 12 back a 1 14 back all the time from our various lenders someday we might exceed that in the market we still have a dividend yield which is widely too far away from the risk that investors are assuming that is you ask me about 10 years the one thing that surprises me is the shared fixed dividend yield given the quality of the world and verification and the multiple business lines we look more like a bank than we do like a mortgage trust and that s what we intended to do and we ll hopefully we ll find other lines of business that will meet or exceed our roe targets so with that i think i m going to stop i want to thank our it s annual time i think our board has been very involved and disciplined and supportive of our strategy execution of the team which is 300 plus people i m speaking here from miami where the real estate service is based and the lnr team as well our teams all over the world that help originate bonds and contributes hopefully a virtual cycle for the company so with that i think i m going to stop and take we ll take questions and thank you for listening questions and answers operator thank you at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of doug harter with credit suisse please proceed with your question doug harter credit suisse analyst thanks can you talk about your outlook for asset yields in the commercial lending segment given the flattening of the libor curve you talked about and expectations around competition on loan spreads barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer spreads gap out in the fourth quarter well there weren t a lot of trades both you can t finance assets that are on trading so and one of the reasons was the financing markets kind of gapped out a little bit aaa backed out and they ve now rallied and again as the market settle in and obviously dow s p is up i don t see any material pressure on spreads right now looking at jeff and saying i think they re of consistent with what we ve done before jeffrey f dimodica president managing director that s right and if rates rise there is certainly some upside to spreads widening back out here barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer we love to mold some molds are good for spreads so we don t mind a more choppy market but we do need transaction volumes in order to finance anything and i don t see much pressure at the moment it s more asset selectivity what do you want to lend against where do you think your catchment points are and we ve been super cautious on high end residential in new york city so things like that we re not just in the market to finance condo construction in new york and that s proven we ve been saying that for three years probably anticipating what becomes a pretty tough market on the high end so and we have other markets like that that will be will wary of and it isn t really the spread it s really doug it s our ltv kind of wind up we think its 63 against 83 because the asset that is going to decline we also stress test our book and looked at what happens for a 10 or 20 decline in property value and jeff you want to mention that because i think it s kind of interesting jeffrey f dimodica president managing director sure we did stress test over new year s which the team wasn t that happy about doing but coming off december 14th to december 24th contagion that seem like it could continue for a while we thought it was important so for barry we did a draconian scenario where we said 20 decline in real estate values and a 250 basis points widening in all of our securities and we looked at the cash that we have on hand that we routinely hold and we do routinely hold a tremendous amount of cash as a conservative way of being ready for opportunities and obviously being ready for spread marks or anything else that could happen in our portfolio and we realized that we have more cash on hand at that time than we than in that draconian scenario of 20 down trade in real estate prices and a 250 basis points widening in securities that s all interesting that it all happening in one day barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer we can observe that all in one day jeffrey f dimodica president managing director never never happened and the company would be fine so there s no we stress test that against all of our bank lines credit facilities repos the whole enchilada to make sure that we can withstand that but jamie diamond said sort of maybe that systemic event and that was something the board is supposed to do in risk assessment and so we did it ourselves barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer and i ll just note it s something that we ve done historically for the rating agencies as well so from a risk perspective for the company we do at least annually jeffrey f dimodica president managing director yes barry i d add that there s still tremendous amount of powder on the sidelines i think we expect to see transaction volumes to be fairly significant again this year and that will have a tremendous not of loan volume to choose from if rates do follow the forward curve lower that could mean wider spreads but in general we ve seen slightly barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer actually that s a good point what we saw is spread rates rose those spreads came in because lenders were pegging a nominal total return it was 4 or 4 5 that is most likely to happen if rates drop spreads will widen so they wind up with the same kind of nominal rates of return that s kind of sort of a boycott of buyers that so as the rates fall so it is fascinating also the data that jeff gave you on 200 basis point drop in libor so the fed economies weakening they lowered the short end again just like they did last time which of course is what they are setting themselves up they have the ability to do and we lose a 0 01 i mean that s from a floating rate book that s kind of shocking so that s good news for us and good news for the company and our shareholders doug harter credit suisse analyst and then you guys mentioned that the biomass at this time was a purchase loan from prior origination team and i believe the other ones have been as well can you just update us on the size of that remaining portfolio how much of the portfolio is kind of originated by the current team versus prior teams barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer interesting questions i m not sure we have the answer at hand jeffrey f dimodica president managing director 100 i d say i have a graph but i think i can answer the question perfectly barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer okay while he s looking for the answer we ll take another question we ll come back and answer that one rina is not here rina was out but she s like horizontal most likely inaudible hold on we have the answer almost nothing well these are that looks like nothing like four or five loans from 2009 there s none left from 2010 none from 2008 none from 2011 and maybe it looks like one or two from and i can t tell because this is just little dots it s a bubble chart of size jeffrey f dimodica president managing director we ll come back and give you the exact by year barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer looking at this it s probably 3 of our loans something like that it looks to me i think that s all of it yes they re there are four winn dixie loans right from 2009 of which two are the ones that are impaired jeffrey f dimodica president managing director one barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer one sorry one is impaired jeffrey f dimodica president managing director and the other one we do not expect impaired i don t expect an impairment barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer that will fall from rebound so anyway that s the answer almost nothing operator our next question comes from the line of jade rahmani with kbw please proceed with your question jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks very much i was looking at the 10 k noticed two interesting trends on credit in the quarter number one the percentage of loans in the risk rate two category increased quite notably so that s a strong credit improvement to about 36 from 31 last quarter so wanted to see if you can give color on that and then secondly the ltv on new originations was 69 5 nothing alarming there but a tick up i don t know if that reflects may be a move to later transition or anything else so could give any comment on both of those facts jeffrey f dimodica president managing director sure sure thanks jade i appreciate it and i appreciate you digging out that specific i think on the first one the percentage moving to 2 we do have a we ve in this business longer for the same reason we just talked about how a little of our portfolio goes back to 2011 we do have a lot of loans from 2013 2014 2015 and for the most part those loans have performed very well and as those loans legacy loans performed well and the benefit of the length that we ve been in this business and the percentage of moving to 2 it makes sense to me going from 31 to 36 as for this quarter there was one relatively larger loan it s fully guaranteed by an investment grade counter party with a construction loan that allowed us to go up a little bit in ltc so we re just about 80 on that particular loan to s p 50 company with a lease that they cannot get out of so we feel very comfortable going a little bit higher in ltc than we normally would we also had some preferred equity investments in multifamily that we expect to perform really well that are a slightly higher ltv the biggest move in the quarter that drove it in terms of the overall ltv of the book is that the roll off of the existing book was a significantly lower ltv book we had a 20 something ltv loan in hawaii we had a couple of 40 ltv loans one in hawaii one in london so the book that rolled off was very low ltv at the same time within a quarter for obvious reasons we have originated a couple of loans that we thought were great relative value on really safe assets at slightly higher ltvs so the net rate is a one quarter phenomenon barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer just as a reminder we re the third largest owner of multies in the nation so in that scenario we have data and can try really well so and my favorite thing we probably bought globally and our 60 billion of assets are the affordable housing assets with 17 000 units in the reit which are like you would love i ve said when we these are the things that went on forever and they are occupied 100 100 of the time and the rent increase vastly exceeded our underwriting so and as jeff mentioned some of these units actually come off the restrictions in a couple of years so it s there s nothing but goodness coming from that portfolio and what we effectively did with stretch duration of our book and that was the goal in achieving double digit cash and cash yields with fixed debt the debt is locked and there was a comment about nine plus years the average loan on our equity book this is almost 25 30 of our assets is astonishingly good for the shareholder base and obviously i don t know if we were an equity reit we wouldn t shed you with an any dividend yield so jade rahmani kbw analyst in terms of the investment pipeline can you give any color on the size of it and maybe how it s split across the businesses jeffrey f dimodica president managing director sure we have 1 billion closed quarter to date in the large loan lending business my guess is you do another 50 on top of that so we end up in the mid 1 billion in the first quarter the second quarter i think like our peers we ll be slower because we did pull back in december we did get a little bit cautious there was a little bit less transaction volume across the other segments i think we have a business plan for the year that we feel we can hit fairly consistently in that sort in mid 1 billion origination in the residential business in the infrastructure finance business and our cmbs book will probably stay about flat over the course of the year so the runoff in sales we met with some new purchases barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer i just want to say we re agnostic right i mean if we get a great real estate loan the capital goes through real estate loan if we get a great energy infrastructure loan we ll deliver capital as it becomes available for that business so we get really an exciting opportunity in the resi business which is much more granular we would deploy capital i m not saying that s what we re trying to do and we continue to reassess our cost our return on equity in each of these businesses and actually i mean they all like the two big ones the resi and the energy book are ramping i mean they re both businesses that we did our first securitization last year in the resi business it was a little bit of a learning curve for us we absorbed more cost than we should have it will be amortized over future securitization so we i m happy and we re into something into 2019 or whatever it was while fixing or driving the ship through this little storm and we had a great year and it s better than we budgeted and i think we re setting ourselves up really well for 2019 and hopefully 2020 we don t care where the returns come from i ve never cared you bet the jockey not the horse we re going to have to deploy capital in these multiple business lines and remain opportunistic through all of them and not force feed anything and as you know we this is our sole business in this space we don t have 43 other things we do in debt space so this is what we do and we ll continue to do it jeffrey f dimodica president managing director and jade to your ltv question earlier one other thing that i would note is we use ltc on our construction loans so that doesn t give any credit for permitting or tenanting or things that have been done it s purely based on cost we think the ltvs on these construction loans will tend to be lower but we are using loan to cost which is going to make the number look a little higher on the ones that we haven t told you about the two of them are multifamily one in the great boston market another one in the philadelphia market and two are in london and one in dublin that we re very confident in so i think this split is a little bit interesting and on the construction side we didn t do any construction in the third quarter we did a little bit more in the fourth quarter and that s going to be part of the month or the quarter over quarter blip higher in ltv operator our next question comes from the line of steve delaney with jmp securities please proceed with your question steve delaney jmp securities analyst hey good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question on page 16 of the deck you show a new 175 million preferred equity investment just wondering if you could give us a little bit of color around that i m curious if it represents pretty much just a coupon or if there s some embedded equity option in that structure as well thank you jeffrey f dimodica president managing director yes sure thank you it is coupon only it s multifamily it s very low leverage it s full recourse it s in primary nfas it s a fixed rate investment and something that again as barry said an area that we re extremely comfortable in the multifamily side steve delaney jmp securities analyst got it okay thanks jeff and then in terms of new lending activity in the first quarter i noticed the two that s laid out on page 15 i noticed there were two of the loans were national hotel portfolios and just wondered if you could give us a little insight into whether the property type where this limited service full service kind of what was what type of property were you really lending on there jeffrey f dimodica president managing director right it s a combination one of the portfolio is a little more fold but it s bit more of a more of a limited service portfolio smaller dollar priced assets but that add up across a very large portfolio to something a little bit bigger so it is steve delaney jmp securities analyst same borrower jeff or two different borrowers jeffrey f dimodica president managing director no two different borrowers but both national portfolios and both very well known they are both very well known borrowers among the largest in the world steve delaney jmp securities analyst okay thanks for the comments jeffrey f dimodica president managing director thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ben zucker with btig please proceed with your question ben zucker btig analyst good morning and thanks for taking questions and congrats on the nice uptick in your names service and portfolio i just wanted to touch on the nonqm program real quickly your purchase volumes were growing really nicely at the year end and i think we know that this business doesn t eat a ton of capital but you ve also spoken about better returns here than the large one segment and it sounds like that s still might be the case so i d love to get your outlook for this business in 2019 but also maybe your thoughts around where you could take this business over the next couple of years looking a little beyond 2019 barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer we put it like some guardrails around on deployment of capital on the company that remake them up right their management guide increase we wouldn t promote 1 3 of the book in equity assets we keep our cmbs book around 1 billion around 20 of our 18 20 of our assets and i think in nonqm it is a business like the conduit business where we originate package and sell and it s we re actually working on improving our origination cost there as well to raise roes to other businesses i think we previously returned slightly below our real estate book last year and actually we think they stabilized at 100 200 basis points above our real estate book and so far this business is doing really well i as you said i don t think it ll look a lot like the conduit business our mortgage i think we ll get 500 700 and they will securitize it also dropped down to a couple they want to keep going we will do that as often as we can we ve turned the conduit book as many as seven i guess 11 times a year and last year seven times so i think business is there the team is doing a really nice job and if it our issue is it might require it can get bigger it could get really bigger and if it gets really bigger we re going to have to do something with it like spin it out and that is something we ll look at we have another child actually went to the invitation home s board meeting yesterday and as usual held that stock is doing pretty well that was spun off from us as you recall and then merged with invitation homes and you could see future spin off of businesses that might get too big for our current capital base or my trade at a much lower dividend yield they are outside of our penalized beast so i it s it will all be optionality and the upside for our shareholders i mean like i said i mean i m a shareholder we re going to do what we think increases the value of the company overall and that might include a spin or two jeffrey f dimodica president managing director with a very similar franchise obviously helping increasing barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer yes jeff pointed something out there s a business for sale right now in this business very similar and they re getting a huge price for this business so that s the reason i mentioned the spin off so it s i ve been corrected on something when we had a smaller asset base the cmbs was 20 now it s 8 of our 16 billion in assets the 1 billion on 16 billion i was looking in and 12 of our equity so it s not 20 it s 12 take that back thanks jeff for the correction mid course correction i love it ben zucker btig analyst and just as a follow up i just kind of would like to hear what you view as the starwood playbook in your prepared remarks you spoke about may be seeing more market uncertainty coming toward the end of this year and kind of what does that make you think as you look over your property portfolio with some nice gains as cushions now with your expectation for more uncertainties does that make you kind of a better hold and wait are you more motivated to sell or is it kind of just very opportunistic path both barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer well i mean jeff and i debate with the board taking some of these gains in real estate book as jeff says the gain is not earning anything right so we have 600 million of gains and you put it out 12 this is hitting earnings value for us my issue is duration i love the duration of these assets and the cash flows are growing and we don t i mean we re looking at them you we will probably harvest some of the gains and just approve to the street that they exist ok since they don t seem to always believe us and there s for example well i m not going to give you an example my outlook i think if rates fall the property book is worth more and i think our i mean you have heard the impact on the loan book i don t it ll be interesting to see if transaction volumes drop because and that s not great for the originators forget about us the whole industry then the other businesses will do better and maybe they ll absorb more capital but that probably is the biggest but again real estate is a yield play and lower rates will make property probably more valuable not less valuable as it s leased and fully occupied and i think what we re doing i mean we re avoiding certain asset categories like hotels for example are the most susceptible that will slow down and so we need to be super careful in the hotel space and that s always we ve usually been in a downturn like asset category that trips up the insurance companies and the banks there s always by the way the best macro demand of all the asset classes in real estate like traveler is going one way north but supply and volatility of the economy which is demand that s tied to gdp growth an important growth i mean it s more volatile so you may not lose money yes but it s one of the asset classes that we really scrub and we did do a hotel on the last quarter so or this quarter i think it s in this quarter but it s again it s a super it s a senior division and massive amount of equity behind us and other paper so and we look at i think the good news about what we do today is we look at these and we don t want to own the assets but we re like forget it we re really happy we just loaned the property book at a better price strike price so it s one of the funny things about construction lending when you re doing 0 65 on the dollar partial recourse usually or something like that you say like defaults i mean i can t wait to get the assets for 0 65 replacement cost sadly or for the better we haven t had that happened to us yet but we don t mind it we ve now gone into the property sector it s not our goal or trying to just be a lender but moment to own is something we re fine with and we ve best heritage of starwood that s where we started the company so that s not what we re trying to do by the way but if it happens we do ok jeffrey f dimodica president managing director yes barry as you always say it s hard to replace the cash return on these property assets we originated stuff at cap rates that bought from a cap rates that are similar to today when rates were significantly lower and we ve locked in long term rates so we have extremely high cash return that is going to look like a significant premium bond so you re either getting it through the premium bond or you could get it through reinvesting the assets cash and taking the gains that we struggle with barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer i want i mean i m going to choose the team form i mean we did a very conscious investment in this cabela s portfolio and we i think at the peak it was probably 400 million 500 million of equity the same size of our energy deal actually and our business and now it sounds like 200 million or something and it s earning pretty solid return north of 13 5 and i mean that s just that was just and you realize yes i mean it s retail we probably hate retail in general it s really hard today but it was 25 year leases there s a bank behind this company the bonds are trading at par and so you buy the bonds and get whatever like i don t know 3 and you can buy or buy our stock and 13 5 in the same credit so it was like that s really smart investing and we look for poles like that that s what we re supposed to do with our capital operator our next question comes from the line of stephen laws with raymond james please proceed with your question stephen laws raymond james analyst hi good morning can you talk a little bit about the energy infrastructure lending business how the volatility is in december and then some stabilization that has impacted the returns you re seeing to deploy capital may be a little bit of color there since that s a new business line for the company jeffrey f dimodica president managing director yes sure so in december and january we certainly saw some spread widen out on deals that had to come unfortunately there weren t that many deals that have to come we were able to capitalize on a couple i would say and denise is on the line with us if you wanted to go deeper into it but i would say in general spreads are flat to slightly wider versus where they were in november where they ve probably got 50 to 75 basis points wider we ve been able to get higher returns on this book as we re putting in term financing lines we ve been able to get higher returns then i think what we underwrote and so we re extremely excited about the potential to do that to the extent that we are able to get high returns we ll probably do what we ve always done in our book and that s take less leverage and earn a little bit less and try to run overall at a slightly lower leverage point but i think the opportunity that is a little bit better today than we thought it was when we bought those when we bought the company and probably not quite as good as it was at the wides in late december early january but a tremendous amount of volume in that business and a lot of really smart trades for us to do i am not sure barry if you have anything to add barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer i d say the originations are couple of hundred basis points wide than we modeled jeffrey f dimodica president managing director levered yield barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer levered yield and that s talking north of 13 which is obviously better than our real estate book and i think you may or may not know we hired a fellow named armin rothauser who ran a 50 million book for deutsche bank in the secured lending space and he s going to wind up being helping us in that space and basically help jeff run the team and manage the existing book and its runoff so he was a md at goldman sachs for three years and he was obviously an md at deutsche bank and you may or may not know but there s a change in the rules in basel iv which will make lending by foreign banks in particular much less competitive in the space so we invest in a key athlete that we think will be tremendously additive to our team and help us in a business that he was in at deutsche bank so we re pretty excited about that stephen laws raymond james analyst great and one my follow up on the loan portfolio can you touch on the maturity schedule your expected repayments through the year and how you think about any type of concentration and the maturities with extension risk later to share if we do start to see the economy weaken thank you for taking my questions jeffrey f dimodica president managing director so repayments are expected to come down a little bit this year for us overall a part of that is we have less originations in 2015 and early 2016 that was a slow period for us if you remember that s when we started to pivot into the property segment and we put a lot more money into property we were investing in cmbs at that time so we were doing other things and our loan origination volume in 2015 and 2016 were significantly lower i think we went from 2 5 billion to 3 3 billion to 4 2 billion to 6 billion this year so the loan maturities are going to likewise be slower they were late in 2018 they were elevated in early 2018 but they were through late 2018 all through 2019 we expect them to run at a slightly lower pace and given where rates are today and tightness in spreads we feel that it s fairly likely that we re able to achieve the amount of runoff that we expect there s no blitz on the credit side there s no real blitz on the refinance ability side so i would think that our estimates are pretty close and they re down i would say 30 or so versus last year in terms of run offs operator our next question comes from the line of tim hayes with b riley fbr please proceed with your question tim hayes b riley fbr analyst hey good afternoon everyone and thank you for taking my questions you contributed nearly 700 million of loans to conduit this quarter and it sounded like most of that was scheduled for 3q might might have slipped into early 4q missing some of the more severe volatility but just wondering how gain on sale compared to historical levels and what it looks like so far in 1q 2019 and then just how you would describe your appetite to execute on conduit deal this year relatively to last year jeffrey f dimodica president managing director yes we ve always had a higher gain on sale than what the average gain on sale i think is when you look at banks and others are doing larger investment grade loans the part of the market that we play in tends to give us a little bit more room december we obviously saw a widening in spreads adam do you want to talk a little bit about what that widening caused in terms of the conduit book adam behlman president real estate investing servicing yes i mean see we dropped them we had deals that were scheduled to go so they did we saw an average probably three fourth of a point to a point reduction in overall p l due to just spread widening across the deals the first quarter things have tightened back up again and i would expect a continuation of where we work from there we re not seeing on the market itself is delayed a bit for first quarter because of just typical january lightness on origination overall but we should see a pickup toward the end of the quarter into the next jeffrey f dimodica president managing director but we hope to price our first deal of the quarter on friday and i would expect again sale to be sort of a in the same vein as what we ve historically seen and when you do these splits wider if you re able to walk up some loans in that chaos you can certainly make a little bit of excess spread as well by taking that risk when markets are a little bit weaker so we re somewhat excited about that as adam said cmbs spreads have come back and they come back voraciously and we re back in one aaa to where we were few quarters ago adam behlman president real estate investing servicing got it appreciate the comments there and on the resi securitization what type of gain on sale do you recognize there and how does that compare to maybe your first deal and it seems like you ve accumulated enough assets to complete another securitization and just reflecting current market conditions when do you expect to be out within number three jeffrey f dimodica president managing director that s a great question so we had a small gain i think 4 million on the first securitization the smallest loss i think 2 million in the second securitization you re right the third securitization is something we ve been talking a lot about and spending time on we will continue to take advantage of the markets while they re open the gain or loss on securitization isn t something that we think about like we think about in the conduit business and the conduit business it is our lifeblood it is how we pay our people it s the profitability of that business ultimately our rmbs investment will be determined over the life of these investment it will be the cash flow that happened over and expected 6 year or 7 year average life but really over 30 years and obviously you have ph ios in there and longer securities that will have a bigger impact and we believe that our securitization irr are very much the same across those two even though one had a small gain and one had a small loss on securitization ultimately we retained securities and we expect the cash flows from those over much longer time barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer one thing we re going to change probably strategically is we re going to sell some of the most senior bonds that we held onto we will increase the roe and we talked about doing that bb for example and jeffrey f dimodica president managing director bbbs barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer and the bbbs so we kind of artificially depressed our roes by keeping those notes and we just met the other recently as a team and size we should just check them out into the market and increase the roes of the business so we re going to do that operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i would like to turn the call back to barry sternlicht for closing remarks barry s sternlicht chairman chief executive officer thank you everyone again i want to thank the team i don t even know how many people are there 400 500 people that work for this enterprise is a big company and we re excited about

tax income totaled 18 3 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 18 1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 the current year quarter adjustments primarily reflected restructuring expenses non cash lifo expense and non cash expense related to mark to market commodity hedging the prior year quarter adjustments consisted of restructuring expenses non cash lifo expense and pension settlement charges partially offset by a non cash benefit associated with mark to market commodity hedging consolidated sales were 425 4 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 an increase of 59 3 million or 16 2 percent from sales of 366 1 million in the prior year quarter the year over year increase in sales for the quarter was driven by acquisitions in the current year as well as its wood treatment business segments the railroad and utility products and services rups business benefited from acquisitions in the current year as well as improvements in all categories of railroad related products and services the performance chemicals pc business reflected increased sales primarily due to higher average pricing driven by a more favorable mix and improved demand in north america the carbon materials and chemicals cmc segment reported lower sales primarily due to declines in china and europe partially offset by higher sales in australia the performance reported by rups included the contribution from recent acquisitions as well as improved production utilization driven by slightly higher volumes cmc s profitability improved slightly from the prior year quarter reflecting an attractive margin level due to pricing outpacing raw material increases and permanent cost savings realized from prior restructuring initiatives partially offset by lower profitability in china results for pc s business were lower year over year due to the acceleration of commodity hedge gains in the prior year that contributed to abnormally lower raw material costs compared with the current year quarter commenting on the quarter president and ceo leroy ball said in the fourth quarter we saw year over year top line improvement in our rail products and services business for the first time since the end of 2015 if weather conditions had cooperated during this timeframe it would have allowed greater production of untreated ties and volumes could have been even higher in our performance

2019 to be much improved in our core wood based technology businesses fourth quarter financial performance sales for rups of 164 2 million increased by 54 7 million or 50 0 percent compared to sales

fourth quarter was 8 9 million or 5 4 percent compared with 1 3 million or 1 2 percent in the prior year quarter the increase in adjusted ebitda was due primarily to higher profitability from the legacy railroad business as well as the contribution from recent acquisitions sales for pc of 99 3 million increased by 6 3 million or 6 8 percent compared to sales of 93 0 million in the prior year quarter the sales increase was due primarily to a favorable product mix as well as improved demand in north america operating profit was 8 0 million or 8 1 percent for the fourth quarter compared with

profitability was lower year over year due to lower raw material costs in the prior year quarter as a result of a gain related to commodity hedging sales for cmc totaling 161 9 million decreased by 1 7 million or 1 0 percent compared to sales of 163 6 million in the prior year quarter excluding an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 5 6 million sales increased by 3 9 million or 2 4 percent from the prior year quarter the increase was due to higher demand for carbon pitch in north america and australia partially offset by lower pitch sales in china and phthalic anhydride in north america operating profit was 6 1 million or 3 8 percent in the fourth quarter compared with 3 1 million or 1 9 percent in the prior year quarter adjusted ebitda was 24 2 million or 14 9 percent

primarily due to acquisitions higher than normal capital expenditures and working capital increases at december 31 2018 the company s net leverage ratio was 4 3 and on a pro forma basis including acquisitions was 4 2 2019 outlook koppers expects that 2019 sales will be approximately 1 8 billion to 1 9 billion based upon a full year s sales from the acquisitions made in 2018 and an overall stronger demand environment in the wood based technology related businesses particularly performance chemicals although headwinds associated with higher raw material costs are expected to continue and earnings in china are likely to be lower in 2019 results are expected to improve year over year contingent on the ongoing cyclical recovery in the railroad and utility products and services business new commercial opportunities in the performance chemicals business an entire year of contribution from acquisitions and projected savings of approximately 10 million to 15 million related to the completed naphthalene unit at the stickney illinois facility in addition as part of its strategic plan the company has identified actions to improve profitability by 10 million in 2019 and approximately 25 million to 40 million to be realized over the next five years the benefits are expected to be realized through network optimization commercial development raw materials and other cost savings on an adjusted basis koppers expects ebitda of approximately 210 million to 225 million for 2019 compared with approximately 222 million in the prior year the company is anticipating higher year over year interest expenses and depreciation and amortization costs in 2019 accordingly the 2019 adjusted eps is forecasted to be in the range of 2 87 to 3 32 compared with 3 50 in the prior year the projected effective tax rate in 2019 will be approximately 30 percent koppers does not provide reconciliations of guidance for adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps to comparable gaap measures in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception koppers is unable without unreasonable efforts to forecast certain items required to develop meaningful comparable gaap financial measures these items include restructuring impairment non cash lifo charges acquisition related costs and non cash mark to market commodity hedging that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a gaap estimate and may be significant based on a capital expenditure plan of 140 million over a two year period beginning in 2018 the remaining 30 million of capital investments is forecast to occur in 2019 the pro forma net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio is projected to be in the range of 3 8x to 4 1x at december 31 2019 the company plans to reduce debt by a minimum of 80 million in 2019 commenting on the forecast mr ball said i expect our wood based businesses to see significant improvements in profitability in 2019 due to a number of factors ultimately the strength of the served end markets for wood treatment will determine whether those businesses will generate enough improvement to offset the lower contribution from cmc as that segment settles back into a more normalized profit range in our rups segment we are on the path towards the first year over year improvement since 2015 driven by an improved demand environment and enhanced by the realization of cost and commercial synergies related to various integration and strategic initiatives additionally the key to our pc business achieving improved results will be realizing at least five to eight percent of year over year volume growth driven by average year over year organic growth and greater market share penetration mr ball continued in the short term we will refocus our efforts on reducing our leverage as we have done during similar times in the past i believe that we have multiple levers at our disposal to do so and we will intently evaluate each opportunity longer term our story remains positive as we continue to

measures this press release contains certain non gaap financial measures koppers believes that adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted net income adjusted earnings per share net debt and net leverage ratio provide information useful to investors in understanding the underlying operational performance of the company its business and performance trends and facilitate comparisons between periods and with other corporations in similar industries the exclusion of certain items permits evaluation and a comparison of results for ongoing business operations and it is on this basis that koppers management internally assesses the company s performance in addition the board of directors and executive management team use adjusted ebitda as a performance measure under the company s annual incentive plans although koppers believes that these non gaap financial measures enhance investors understanding of its business and performance these non gaap financial measures should not be considered an alternative to gaap basis financial measures and should be read in conjunction with the relevant gaap financial measure other companies in a similar industry may define or calculate these measures differently than the company limiting their usefulness as comparative measures because of these limitations these non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as

marketing and business development officer who will provide an update on our new business activity and mr brian adams our chief financial officer who will provide our financial update on the fourth quarter and full year as well as an initial outlook for fiscal 2019 in 2018 we saw strength across our entire organization as we delivered a 53 revenue increase and a 70 adjusted ebitda increase compared to 2017 further we continued to see constant and consistent growth in pace expanding our pace membership by 20 we built out our pace offerings with selective strategic acquisitions our product service mix continues to see service revenue expansion from 19 in 2016 to 41 in 2017 and 45 in 2018 we expanded our leadership position in the medication therapy management market we received our enhanced medication therapy management year one results whereby our medication risk mitigation interventions exceeded expectations with net savings of 37 million or 2 500 per person in reduced medical expenses we announced our first international expansion we entered the hospital market with our acquisition of doseme and by year end trhc entities had serviced 7 5 million patients in the united states with our new analytics department we have been able to show that our medication risk mitigation interventions consistently demonstrate a four point reduction in medication risk score which translates most importantly from a quality perspective to reduce morbidity as well as the medical savings especially hospitalization admission reduction falls reduction and er visit reduction i referenced our acquisition of doseme and i d like to dig into that opportunity a bit doseme represents a great strategic fit for tabula rasa that not only brings our precision medicine and science based approach to the dosing of potentially dangerous narrow therapeutic parenteral medications but it also opens up an opportunity for us in the hospital market with their 125 hospital healthcare system clients in the us western europe and australia turning to enhanced medication therapy management we just moved into year three of our emtm pilot one of the things we are focused upon is leveraging the community pharmacists to provide more of the interventions at year end we had trained more than 400 community pharmacists at 300 locations in the northern plains these partners conducted more than 100 interventions in the second quarter of 2018 and by the fourth quarter it was over 1 100 interventions now we anticipate they will complete more than 10 000 interventions in 2019 beyond the emtm project in 2019 we intend to expand to a large number of community pharmacies by a network collaboration another recent development which we officially announced last week and mentioned on our last quarterly call as part of our tabula rasa 2 0 efforts is the launch in the location of our new scientific precision pharmacotherapy research development institute in lake nona orlando florida the research and development institute is committed to the continued development of proprietary products for optimizing medication regimens and to achieving validation and recognition of these products by the scientific and regulatory communities our goal by year end is to have additional trhc pharmacokinetic pharmacogenomic scientist in the location at lake nona lake nona is particularly a market that s rich with phds focused on pharmacokinetics to maintain our vanguard status globally in medication risk identification and mitigation the emphasis at lake nona is to continue adding pertinent attributes to our medication risk identification and mitigation software in addition to submitting germane nih grants our enhanced research and development science group is a necessity to develop home and advance the products we need for the coming years last week we were able to participate in the annual invitational lake nona impact conference i d like to share just a bit of what i heard and learned while i was there this innovation forum is an annual meeting of c level healthcare leadership leaders throughout the united states to continue the future of healthcare and well being discussion our 17th surgeon general of united states dr richard carmona open the program with an ongoing criticism of our healthcare system that it is not in fact healthcare but sick care considering the 70 of chronic disease is preventable we made excellent contacts during the meeting and feel that we are positioned very well to support the medication safety well being needs in the united states and around the world before i turn the call over to orsula i want to take a moment to touch on our plans to expand our sales force spearheaded by dr kevin boesen in his new role as chief sales officer kevin is leading our enhanced sales organization to support all sales and cross selling efforts and will ultimately be responsible for all direct and channel sales efforts our focus is to expand the adoption of medwise in the health plans healthcare system hospitals community pharmacies and any financially at risk healthcare organization we believe that this is a great position for kevin and i expect he will really thrive as he helps tabula rasa to expand our footprint into these marketplaces so 2018 was a busy year for us and i believe we are well positioned in the market and have the scale and the infrastructure in place to capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us medication adverse events is rampant and it s a pandemic i ll now turn the call over to orsula to talk about all the recent happenings in new business orsula orsula v knowlton president chief marketing new business development officer thanks cal and thank you to everyone on the call we are pleased to report a 2018 revenue retention rate of 99 consistent with 2017 and higher than 2016 at 98 similarly our client retention rate was 96 an increase over both 2017 and 2016 which were 95 and 93 respectively as with all aspects of tabula rasa business in 2018 including our successful adds of new clients and new services we are excited about the future starting in 2019 first we are focused on our enhanced ability to expand into our existing markets one such example is the payer market where we are leveraging the recent integration at sinfoniarx it s capabilities and client roster some key successes of sinfoniarx in 2018 include a six fold increase in the number of medicare plans that achieved a comprehensive medication review or a cmr conversion rate of 85 or more which is the current five star cut point we had four plans reach that in 2017 and 29 plans in 2018 overall sinfoniarx completed 450 000 cmrs which translate into over 1 million recommended intervention sinfonia also had a full soft ph launch of rxcompanion their technology with the new york health plan and through the fast licensing of rxcompanion with the national retail pharmacy chains community pharmacies completed over 3 1 million in store intervention resulting in the improvement of their medication adherence metrics and overall network performance second we are thrilled to be in a new market as a result of the doseme acquisition we have done extensive research on this market including a survey that we distributed during the third quarter to 250 pace prescribers from across 18 states who already see the trhc medication risk score in their workflow 50 of prescribers responded that they there are more confident in prescribing when using the medication risk score 85 indicated that they reconsider their medication choice when the risk score is affected by a new prescription 90 more likely to de prescribe a medication or remove the number of medications the person is taking as a result of the medication risk score and over 90 said that they both would use their medication risk score again given the opportunity and will recommend it for use by other prescribers in and outside of pace it is now our goal to take the system to other healthcare and hospital systems we believe that doseme bolsters our get to market strategy and capabilities in the market preventing adverse drug event medication optimization performance improvement programs and how we plan to market the implementation of our decision support tools at the point of care the value we bring in addition to quality and outcomes improvement include the economic benefit of affording downstream effects of adverse drug events along with reducing hospital length of stay and readmissions we are involved in the conversation of medication safety and performance improvement most recently through our attendance at the institute for health improvement 2018 national forum over 5 000 health professionals checking quality improvement methods to help solve some of their biggest challenges including adverse drug event prevention were in attendance during the conference we saw higher interest including from those members participating in ihi signature program age friendly health systems age friendly health systems is an initiative of the john a hartford foundation the institute for healthcare improvement the american hospital association and the catholic health association of the united states in case you re not aware the goal of this initiative is to develop an age friendly health systems framework and rapidly spread to 20 of us hospitals and health systems by 2020 the four essential components of an age friendly health systems are known as the 4ms framework for age friendly care and include what matters align care with specific health outcome goal mentation prevent identify treat and manage dementia depression and delirium mobility ensuring that older adults move safely in order to maintain function and to do what matters and of course medication if medication is necessary use age friendly medications that do not interfere with what matters mobility or mentation considering that adverse drug events are the fourth leading cause of death in the united states we envisioned a great opportunity to support the success of this important program for our elderly population we also attended the 2019 health information management systems society or himss global conference two weeks ago where healthcare providers and innovators use new technologies to improve performance and solve problem while many trhc members have attended himss for years this year we exhibited at their innovation showcase cal had the opportunity to present in the innovation theater as well his presentation had an excellent response from the audience including ideas to get into new markets from audience participants it was an exciting time for us and we had numerous positive conversations with interested folks and look forward to the follow up finally to assure our success in this space we are working on public api integrations using smart on fhir and cds hooks with major health information platform vendors we have a number in process and have had one recently validated we are pleased to share that athenahealth has completed their validation of our api integration which we tested through a collaboration with one of our client physician practice group athenahealth has more than 100 000 providers and 100 million patients who are using it s health information technology platform the solution that was validated with athenahealth embed our smart on fhir application within their ehr a prescriber will be able to see the medication risk score cut through to additional visualization of risk and consult with the certified medwise advisor our team will be working closely with athena s marketplace group with the expectation that we will have our integration integrated technology generally available by the fourth quarter of 2019 so more on new markets during our next quarterly call looking back at 2018 we had wonderful growth in our program of all inclusive care for the elderly or pace service lines and continue to demonstrate market leadership overall we are seeking early signs of success on the industry pace 2 0 initiative which is to double the census by 2021 and to service 100 000 participants by 2028 an example of an encouraging move we saw in december was the state of north carolina approved pace expansion of providers to serve a broader portion of the state population this marks the first expansion of service areas of north carolina initiated by the state since they were established over a decade ago we have also been contacted by start ups in the states that do not currently have pace as well as start ups in states that have not had a new sponsor in years our overall pace growth for our medication risk management and comprehensive pharmacy services in 2018 was consistent with prior years at 18 product revenue growth and 20 patient growth we expect to see an increase in rates of member enrollment and momentum in this area throughout the year when we acquired peak pace mediture eclusive and cognify last year we believed there existed a clear opportunity within the pace market for an integrated offering that combine the ehr analytics third party health plan management services consulting along with our proprietary medication risk mitigation matrix across our four primary pace offerings we touch approximately 85 of pace providers today with at least one of our pace service lines we saw great success in terms of cross selling in the last half of 2018 in august of 2018 only 15 pace providers utilized all of our four core solutions and today the number has grown to 19 we estimate progress on the other side of the spectrum decreasing the number of pace organizations that use none of our solutions from 21 to 16 as we work on five new pace organization customers over the past two quarters on november 1 we launched our medication risk mitigation services with rocky mountain pace in colorado springs colorado rocky mountain is unique and that it has leveraged its growth to over to 600 participants at one single pace center while not our largest client the location is now our largest pace center with trhc rocky mountain is seeing signs of early success in hospitalization reduction as a result of our collaboration they also had partnered with cognify ehr as noted they added medication risk mitigation in november and then further expanded into the trhc service suite with trhc s peak health plan management services during the fourth quarter we also completed the client expansion locations for mercy life west philadelphia pace carekinesis started with mercy life in 2012 their success has more than doubled since then we have also maintained an extremely robust pipeline of client expansion locations for 2019 including one in new jersey one in indiana and two in florida we have five start up organizations under contract in arkansas california colorado florida and michigan for a total of nine new centers all starting with multiple service lines of trhc in 2019 finally we have a wonderful pipeline of new and existing pace organizations within our services this year with that i ll turn the call over to brian adams our cfo brian brian w adams chief financial officer thank you orsula and thank you all for joining us this evening i want to reiterate calendars with comments that 2018 was a great year for the company and we took several steps to help support our growth well into the future let me now provide some highlights from 2018 before reviewing the fourth quarter in more detail for the full year 2018 we saw revenue growth 53 to 204 million gaap net loss of 47 3 million compared to gaap net income of 12 8 million in 2017 the net loss this year was mainly the result of 49 8 million in charges for adjustments to contingent consideration we will pay in connection with the sinfoniarx acquisition non gaap adjusted ebitda growth of 70 year over year to 29 3 million gaap net loss per diluted share of 2 48 compared to net income per diluted share of 0 68 in 2017 and non gaap adjusted net income per diluted share of 0 77 compared to non gaap adjusted net income per diluted share of 0 42 in 2017 based on a diluted share count of 22 million shares and 18 8 million shares respectively the fourth quarter of 2018 tabula rasa generated total revenue of 57 3 million a 32 increase over last year product revenue in the quarter was 30 2 million compared to 26 2 million in the same period a year ago service revenue came in at 27 2 million in the quarter quarter an increase of 59 from the fourth quarter of 2017 gross margins of 33 this quarter compared to 32 in the same period last year this was in line with our expectations as we saw some impact from the mediture and cognify acquisitions i ll reiterate that our longer term gross margin target is 35 to 40 and we continue to make incremental progress against that goal product gross margin was 24 in the fourth quarter of 2018 a slight decline from 25 last year due to the onboarding of rocky mountain pace this was a significant new client for tabula rasa and as we ve commented in the past we can see temporary positive another negative impacts on gross margin during the time when new clients are aligning with tabula rasa s methodologies for managing medication risk service gross margin of 42 in the fourth quarter of 2018 was directly in line with fourth quarter of 2017 q4 2017 have the first full quarter contribution from the sinfoniarx business providing a more appropriate comparison than previous quarters our operating expenses represented 49 of our total revenue this quarter up from 12 in the same period a year ago excluding the impact of change in fair value of acquisition related contingent consideration operating expenses would have represented 33 of revenue up from 28 in the fourth quarter of 2017 these amounts are consistent with last quarter and as we noted last quarter operating expenses in the second half of the year have ticked up to reflect investments in tabula rasa 2 0 which we believe will support growth during 2018 and beyond we generated 8 5 million in adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter compared to 6 5 million a year ago adjusted ebitda margins for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 15 and consistent with fourth quarter of last year this is in line with our expectations given the incremental spend related to tabula rasa 2 0 our gaap net loss of 10 6 million compares to a gaap net income of 10 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the net loss was largely impacted by a charge of 9 1 million related to the change in fair value of acquisition related contingent consideration for the sinfoniarx acquisition the charge we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 increased the amount of contingent consideration we will pay in connection with the acquisition gaap net loss per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0 54 compared to gaap net income per diluted share of 0 55 in the same period last year the net income and loss per diluted share calculations are based on a diluted share count of 19 4 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 versus 19 9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 adjusted net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0 21 compared to adjusted net income per diluted share of 0 15 in the fourth quarter of 2017 the net income and loss per diluted share calculations are based on diluted share count of 22 8 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 versus 19 9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 as a reminder our adjusted net income per diluted share for the quarter exclude stock based compensation amortization of acquired intangibles payroll tax on stock option exercises transaction related expenses changes in fair value of contingent consideration as well as any resulting impact on income tax turning to the balance sheet as of december 31st 2018 we had a cash balance of 20 3 million compared to cash at the end of the last quarter of last year at 13 9 million the increase is the result of positive cash flow from operations as of today we have nothing drawn on our 60 million line of credit we have outstanding debt of 1 1 million in equipment leases compared to 1 7 million at the end of last year before reviewing our financial outlook i want to comment on two additional items the first is the sinfonia earn out sinfonia has performed extremely well since the acquisition and we have finalized the calculation for the earn out payment the sellers will receive the maximum earn out of 85 million 50 of which will be paid in stock and 50 of which will be paid in cash the second item is our recent convertible debt offering on february 12th we closed a 325 million convertible senior subordinated note offering due in 2026 which carries a rate of 1 75 tabula rasa received net proceeds from the offering of approximately 315 million we used 35 8 million of the net proceeds to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions which effectively increases the stock conversion price to 105 reflecting approximately a 100 premium to the shares at the time of pricing the remaining proceeds we used to pay down our existing line of credit and will be used to pay the sinfonia earn out and to ensure that we have some capital to support future acquisitions i ll close out my comments today with an initial outlook for the first quarter and the full year 2019 for the first quarter of 2019 we anticipate revenue to be in the range of 55 million to 60 million adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 4 million to 5 million and net loss to be in the range of 6 1 million to 5 3 million i ll remind you that there is some seasonality to the sinfonia business that depresses the first quarter in addition we will see some negative impact on earnings from the doseme business as well as the recently launched scientific precision pharmacotherapy research institute while doseme and the research institute will have a shorter term impact on earnings we believe these are important investments to ensure that we are able to continue to stay on the front edge of medication management and to enhance future growth potential for the full year 2019 we anticipate total revenue to be in the range of 250 million to 260 million of that total revenue we expect product revenue of 140 million and service revenue of 115 million at the midpoint of our range we expect adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 32 million to 37 million as mentioned previously our guidance includes expected losses for 2019 for the doseme business as well as costs related to the recently announced scientific precision pharmacotherapy research institute as we previously communicated we did not expect to have an adjusted ebitda margin any higher than what we realized in 2018 and after folding in doseme in the research institute we expect to be about 100 basis points below 2018 margin at the midpoint of our guidance a very reasonable investment related to the future potential we are creating as we expect net loss to be in the range of 12 9 million to 9 2 million our first quarter and full year 2019 outlook assumes an all in normalized tax rate of 26 and we do not expect to be a cash taxpayer in 2019 for federal tax our net loss projection does not include any impact from the change of fair value of contingent consideration for the doseme and cognify acquisitions and only contemplates cash interest expense associated with the 325 million senior subordinated notes i d like to echo both cal and orsula s comments and say that 2018 was another very strong year for tabula rasa and in 2019 we can expect to drive very strong top line growth continued to expand our gross margin and make investments that will position us well to enter new markets and expand our existing footprint that concludes my prepared remarks and i ll turn the call back over to cal for closing comments cal calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder thank you brian as i think orsula brian and i have all stressed on this call we are incredibly pleased with everything tabula rasa accomplished in 2018 we continue to diversify our business markets while relying on our unique multi drug simultaneous interaction score we are quickly becoming the go to provider for medication risk management regardless of the market as has been the case every quarter we could not have delivered these results without the ongoing hard work strategic vision and dedication of all our team members we entered 2019 with great momentum and a clearly defined growth strategy in which we will continue to innovate and keep tabula rasa on the cutting edge of healthcare as the industry moves from hindsight to insight to foresight i look forward to continuing to update you throughout the year operator let s please open the call to questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from ryan daniels of william blair your line is now open ryan daniels william blair analyst yeah guys congrats on the strong end of the year and thanks for taking the questions brian maybe one for you with the growth in kind of the services business and all the deals you ve completed later in 2018 early 2019 i m just hoping to get a bit more color on the sales and ebitda cadence for the year so should we anticipate kind of a similar one half versus second half performance for sales and margins on 2019 or are there any nuances we should think about when building out the model calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder yeah i think that s that s a good question ryan appreciate it and i would expect a very similar cadence as we experienced in 2018 to repeat itself at this point the sinfonia business has become a larger percentage of the overall revenue base and there is some seasonality there where first quarter certainly is more depressed and then second third quarter start to really tick up and then kind of level off in the final quarter of the year so i would expect a pretty similar cadence ryan daniels william blair analyst okay and then in regards to the margin performance anticipated for 2019 you know that street estimates had an increase in ebitda despite the fact that you said on the q3 call in the investor day that they would be down i m actually therefore more curious about the outlook for 2020 are you still anticipating kind of after an investment year with some of these growth initiatives that we ll see a rebound in ebitda heading into 2020 calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder yes that s our expectation ryan i think that we re going to start to see some incremental stair stepped up going into 2020 based on this investment i think that the leveling off this year was anticipated earlier in the fall and even almost in the summer as we started to make some plans but we do expect and are holding that our longer term ebitda target is maintained at about 20 ryan daniels william blair analyst okay that s helpful and then final question i ll jump back in the queue on rocky mountain that was an interesting data point that despite not being your largest pace program by members that are your largest customers so can you maybe talk about any key learnings there on the sales front how to drive others either toward that level or to get new clients become and with a bevy of services right upfront thank you orsula v knowlton president chief marketing new business development officer well absolutely we definitely learned from that experience they are wonderful partner they certainly took their time evaluating their options they have to actually remove the previous provider from their building so there was quite a negotiation there and i think now that we are have an integrated model we are focused on all offerings firmware visiting with potential customers including in the start up mode they re not always as of in a position to make all those decisions but we certainly are able to support them through that process ryan daniels william blair analyst okay great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from matthew gillmor of robert baird your line is now open matthew gillmor robert baird analyst hi thanks for the question i wanted to ask about the priorities for your new sales leadership especially the cross sell opportunity into sinfoniarx you obviously elevated kevin boesen as a chief sales officer so just hoping to understand his team s priorities for 2019 and then get a sense for your goals for the year as we re integrating symphony offering with the tabula rasa capabilities and taking that to the sinfonia clients calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder yeah matt this is cal we have the number of initiatives planned for 2019 one of the top ones we re working on right now is that it says that sinfonia crossover with medwise we just had numerous meetings on that and conferences about it we have a plan set forth for how that s going to happen and it s nice because they have a disease management angle in their software and we have the medication risk mitigation identification and mitigation angle so they really complement but and will be using medwise actually be the main platform as we roll this out as far as the showing it s going on right now we ve got a lot of things happening on the opioid front that we can t be confirmed yet on this is how you but there s cross selling going on right now in the first quarter and we have a very large expectation with that just like we do in pace with the cross selling it s going on there and then the other things we re really focused on we re really keen on is with those me is the hospitalization opportunities for us and that s a huge opportunity globally with our restore events that lengthen the stay in the hospital and then and whether if it s a drg company that i mean the process where they care about that or whether it s a single payer system that cares about but there s a lot of interest in cutting down the average drug events during this today and lastly we re really keen also on taking off of the emtm project we ve had with the 300 pharmacies that we ve certified and 400 and some pharmacists we really going to have a huge initiative this year on taking the software to many many pharmacies through some collaboration we re establishing that will exponentially literally exponentially propagate pharmacies with this in the united states so that s kind of the four main things that we re really focused on right now matthew gillmor robert baird analyst okay great and then maybe get an update on your m a priorities as well you ve obviously raised a good amount of cash with the convert offering so just hoping you could you put some parameters around that the types of acquisitions that you d be interested in and then i guess specifically in the event if you did a larger deal should we assume that there would be some revenue and ebitda associated with that calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder this is cal again i think that just like we saw with sinfonia we re always looking for technology that can bring us into a new market and that s kind of a very key thing for us right now so in other ways we have this core and it can be used in so many places and so we have to be discern we will be discrete about how we do it and we re going to look at somebody or some technology we can partner with that will help us do that and that would brian i would say that we definitely would be looking in all i said will should we ll be looking for accretive top and bottom brian w adams chief financial officer that s right yeah so matt i would agree with what cal says anything we re looking at at this point would be expected to be both accretive on the top and on the bottom matthew gillmor robert baird analyst got it thank you brian w adams chief financial officer thanks matt operator thank you our next question comes from nina deka of piper jaffray your line is now open nina deka piper jaffray analyst hi congrats on the quarter and the great finish to 2018 orsula v knowlton president chief marketing new business development officer thanks nina calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder thank you nina nina deka piper jaffray analyst so to what degree are the expansion opportunities that you discussed into the new markets factored into the guidance that you provided today for fy 2019 calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder nina that s a great question so i would say in terms of materially expansion into the hospital market is not really factored into our guidance right now it s still very early days with the recent acquisition of doseme and starting to integrate the two offerings so at this point we have really just factored in the doseme stand alone business growth and have not factored in any sort of real cross sell at this point although we do anticipate to see some of that happened before the end of the year orsula v knowlton president chief marketing new business development officer yeah nina deka piper jaffray analyst and how about the athenahealth opportunity calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder similarly since that really won t be launched until the end of the year we would not expect to see material revenues in 2019 related to it orsula v knowlton president chief marketing new business development officer yes and i just want to qualify that this is involved with healthcare organization so it s not necessarily the hospital market it s aco outpatient clinics the healthcare organizations market calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder yes they are involved in hospitals obviously but also in infusion companies and we haven t talked about too much but the the tam that doseme estimates just in us is about 500 million revenue so it s a very very large opportunity for us would be very conservative brian aren t we brian w adams chief financial officer yeah calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder on how we re doing how we re brian w adams chief financial officer i would say that 500 million it s just the doseme product stand alone not including the overlap of the tabula rasa offering as well calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder that s correct yeah nina deka piper jaffray analyst okay calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder most of their installations now are in the us believe it or not of their 125 installations over 100 of them are in the us nina deka piper jaffray analyst okay that s helpful thank you and what was your organic growth for 2018 calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder so organic growth for 2018 was about 20 overall nina deka piper jaffray analyst okay great thanks i ll jump back in queue operator thank you our next question comes from stephanie demko with citi your line is now open stephanie demko citi analyst hey guys thank you for taking my questions great quarter multiple speakers i appreciate that first one s for brian i thought could you give us a little more color on maybe in a collaboration just how you should think about the revenue share of that model and its contribution to this year brian w adams chief financial officer so right now we re not expecting any real material contribution from athena to revenues given the fact that it s really going to be a q4 i would say launch within their customer base so i would be looking for any material contribution to 2020 at this point orsula v knowlton president chief marketing new business development officer but we are very interested about it stephanie demko citi analyst how should we think about the revenue model itself as you move into the ehr space brian w adams chief financial officer yeah so there s going to be two pieces there would be a monthly recurring fee for utilization of the services and then there will be an escalation component if they want to access our call centers and pharmacists stephanie demko citi analyst on a per fee basis brian w adams chief financial officer yeah that s right stephanie demko citi analyst got it and then next one will be on the r d institute side it sounds like you re doing a lot in product development for mtm and emtm there with that in mind how do you see that influencing the pmpm for your emtm offering brian w adams chief financial officer so we do think over time we re going to have the ability to continue to increase that pmpm just based on the pure fact that the roi that we delivered in year one and we re hopeful that that s going to increase in year two is a pretty significant for a health plan so we do feel like we re in a position right now to expand that and our hope is that through further development at the research institute that will continue to drive more significant savings for our customers and be able to expand the pmpm that we re able to charge there calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder and i think that we if you just think about pace let s just go there for a second we have barely scratched the surface on what we can offer for pace organizations from that will come out of the r d institute i mean we re working on obviously different genes now we re working on not just the metabolic enzyme genes but we re working on the genes that are receptors and the genes that transport drugs around the body there is also some new stuff that will be coming out in the next year that has to do with like some sensors that can help people understand how a patient at home is doing and so we re involved in some of that so there is this whole personalized patient centric care model is just blossoming and we ve got so much opportunity to continue down that path particularly located there which is where a whole bunch of the innovation is going on so i think we re going to continue to upsell i mean we hardly are doing enough right now in the pharmacogenomics and pace and we ve just expanded that immensely in this quarter so and that s an upsell so there s a lot of opportunity for us stephanie stephanie demko citi analyst inaudible to hear thank you guys for taking my questions calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from mohan naidu of oppenheimer your line now open mohan naidu oppenheimer analyst thanks for taking my questions let me add my congratulations as well cal just a couple more questions on doseme product you can give us some insights on how current hospitals are using doseme and how you can integrate your own core services into that and within the us the 100 or so locations you talked about r d in value based reimbursement setting and what is the driver for the hospitals to pull this product right now calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder a lot of it is good question thank you a lot of is quality the way that the narrow therapeutic index medications that are injected and hospitals are done right now is mostly through a lot of blood draws to see where the trough is and then just recalculate using algorithms how much to give going to give on the next dose and with doseme you don t really need to do that it s based on inference and you can do maybe one or two draws during that time of the antibiotic for example for a week or so and that s all you need and so it cuts down on expense it increases the quality and decreases the problems the problems with narrative pre index drugs particularly some of the strong antibiotics and some of the oncology medicine or we ll just leave it there they cause a lot of side effects when the peak goes above where it should and like kidney damage and ear problems stuff like that so you reduce the chance of problems that for the patient you increase the quality you will help with our workflow immensely and we the way it works right now it s a stand alone in the cloud system that s very easy to use be happy to give you a drive through some point if you like it s very easy to use and it s also been now accepted by a couple of those three of the largest electronic health record companies in the country that are will be incorporating it with smart on fhir so it won t be stand alone but it will be built into their systems so that s kind of how we re doing the integration orsula v knowlton president chief marketing new business development officer right and i just want to comment that recently i was out on kind of the sales call we know many people in the roles of chief pharmacists and hospitals and healthcare systems around us and the consolidation of hospitals is really a concern for the role of the chief of pharmacy in understanding the need to scale but also the need to standardize our systems and processes so that seems to be a very key issue of having a tax system that they could use across the entire 15 hospitals to 20 hospitals that continue to consolidate mohan naidu oppenheimer analyst that s very interesting maybe two more questions on the ma side and i was hoping to hear a little bit more on the opportunities in the current selling season now that we have the cms mlr change and some of the impressive data points from your own pilots anything we should expect through 2019 about potentially ma plans deals brian w adams chief financial officer yeah i do expect this is brian mohan we do expect that there will be some opportunities that we closed on the ma side during 2019 and just to talk for a moment more maybe about kevin both in transitioning into that head of sales role i mean that s really his background he s been focused in the payer space and selling mtm into that market and so we feel like he is very well positioned to further offered the tabula rasa strategies and products to those customers today that he is already working with so we have seen an increase in responses that include our mrm capabilities to rfps and other ongoing processes with potential clients so short answer is yes i would expect to see something close to 2019 mohan naidu oppenheimer analyst okay great and maybe one last one any updates on the portugal pilot and landmark expansion that would be great calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder well the portugal pilot is right where we thought it would be right here in the first quarter and we are right now working through workflow integration with their it group over there and that s exactly what we ll be doing this week actually so i would suspect that that things going to be launched they re not well i don t want to say anything let s just say it s a little slower process than we would have in the us so i would our thoughts in the second quarter we re going to be launching that thing we have noted a couple of other pilots that might even beat it because we are so methodical there but they re very excited about it they re very embracing of it and we spent a lot of every week with them on costs and stuff so it s moving ahead brian w adams chief financial officer i am happy to talk about landmark that phase ii continues to move forward really excited about the progress that we re making there and there are other landmark like entities out there that you are probably aware of on the phone that are similarly interested in the medication risk management offering that we have and landmark in fact is helping to facilitate and participate in some of those discussions so pretty excited about their level of continued interest in utilizing the tool mohan naidu oppenheimer analyst thank you very much for all the color congratulations again calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder thank you mohan brian w adams chief financial officer thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from david grossman of stifel financial your line is now open hi mr gorssman if you phone is on mute please unmute here your question comes david grossman stifel financial analyst okay i m here thank you good afternoon i wondered if i could just go back to an earlier question and brian maybe you can deconstruct a little bit to revenue growth and margin guidance for us and what i mean by that is maybe take revenue what s the acquired component how much growth do you expect from pace and maybe the other service lines and then similarly using 2018 as a baseline how to think about margins in the quarter versus some of these investments that you outlined earlier calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder yes david we typically haven t gone to that level of detail in the past as we ve talked about guidance so i ll give you what comfortable giving at this point i d tell you that we expect pace from the product side to continue to grow at about 20 we re comfortable with that number historically what we ve seen based on the organic additional members that these programs continue to add each month and what we can expect to see from a new business development side as well and so a kind of you can force out our assumptions around the service growth at the same time given that we re targeting about a 25 overall growth rate i do expect that gross margins will increase this year going to probably somewhere closer to 34 something that looks like that and then the investment related to both doseme and the lake nona office i m estimating to be around 5 million for 2019 so if you kind of if you back that off of the numbers we would be actually exceeding the ebitda margin that we had talked about in the fall so those are kind of the bigger moving pieces right now we don t expect the whole lot of movement in gross margin for the product or services side i think that s going to be relatively consistent but there s still will be a little bit of a change in mix driving incremental gross margin overall david grossman stifel financial analyst all right got it that s actually very helpful thank you and then maybe for cal or orsula the mange medicaid market and maybe i misunderstood earlier but i thought that was also an area that you are going to focus on beginning in 2019 so if i m remembering that right could you give us any color in terms of how you expect that market to evolve over the next 12 months to 24 months and are you seeing any indication of what type of services and how those deals may play out relative to your existing book of business orsula v knowlton president chief marketing new business development officer sure well we certainly are responding to rfps from medicaid and states were able to qualify for those and i think that what the opportunity is that the states are not required to go by the part d mtm regulations so we can provide a different level of service provider medwise medication risk mitigation tools and really be able to demonstrate roi based on risk classifications that we are able to collect and then deliver to them so that is under kevin boesen and he is actively working in that market calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder that s correct one thing that i will note on that david is that in some cases these state medicaid plans are looking for in local presence to distribute some of these services so in cases where that is a requirement we re looking to build out that function similar to what we did with the enhanced emtm model where we ve got a network of community pharmacies because we think that that will really enable us to respond well to the state programs where they re looking to keep some of those dollars within the state david grossman stifel financial analyst so with that said then would we expect some of those types of deals and to reflect more of the emtm type deal versus the traditional mtm or the market kind of falling out somewhere in between brian w adams chief financial officer no i would think right now it s going to be closer to the emtm pmpm david grossman stifel financial analyst got it and just one last question on that are there certain states that have mandated this or is this more of a voluntary thing that s happening within the stated medicaid programs orsula v knowlton president chief marketing new business development officer yeah i believe some certain states are being mandated to provide us as a way to reduce costs and improve outcomes and reduce total spend i don t have any detail on that but i can follow up with you calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder but it is very much a state by state initiative and most of them as brian said are really starting to circle the wagons and make sure that the dollars good portion of dollars stay within the state david grossman stifel financial analyst great okay well thank you very much calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from jamie stockton of wells fargo your line is now open jamie stockton wells fargo analyst hi good evening thanks calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder hi jamie jamie stockton wells fargo analyst i guess maybe brian would you just run through the acquisitions which of the two segments are they really contributing to i know i think you guys recast some revenue because of 606 from product into service in 2018 i don t know if that impacts how you re recognizing revenue from some of these recent doseme i think it s pretty obvious it s going to be in the services segment but cognify mediture eclusive if you could just give us a feel for where that s flowing through that before calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder all of the revenue related to acquisitions last year is falling into the services bucket so the reclass related specifically to the per member per month fee we re charging for our pace customers as receiving their clinical services and the technology for that charge and so we moved that from product this past year to service jamie stockton wells fargo analyst okay that s great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from frank sparacino of first analysis your line is now open frank sparacino first analysis analyst hi guys given the time i ll just keep mine to one orsula you talked about the growth in the medicare plans and the cmr rates and i m just curious what were the factors that drove the dramatic growth of 29 versus the four plans orsula v knowlton president chief marketing new business development officer i believe it s the increase in a five star cut point so people are going more toward the five star or improving their star ratings and in order to do that the requirement was 85 completion rate calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder in addition to that frank we started with a very large new customer in 2018 that drove a significant increase and we ve continued to expand that relationship even into 2019 and we ve seen in fact the cut rates go up again going into this year so we would actually expect continued expansion within our existing customer base for those targets frank sparacino first analysis analyst great thank you guys orsula v knowlton president chief marketing new business development officer thank you frank calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder thanks frank operator thank you and our next question comes from bill sutherland of benchmark your line is now open bill sutherland benchmark analyst yeah like frank i ll just look keep it to one good evening everybody on emtm i think you ve talked in the past or recent past about potential expansion another pilot is that something that we should still think about possible calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder yes i mean we continue to look at all of the other participating plans as potential partners and so those discussions continue what we do see though is the fact that this model that we ve developed for emtm it s really something that we can go out and sell today into the medicare advantage and so that s what we re going to charged kevin boesen with doing is taking this existing model into the m a market because it s something that can benefit them immediately today whereas the stand alone prescription drug benefit plans i wouldn t expect to see significant expansion outside of the pilot until it s mandated bill sutherland benchmark analyst that s the 2020 timeframe calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder it s going to be we would think within the next couple of years we re going to start to see some transition based on compensations with cms bill sutherland benchmark analyst okay and then on that organic growth question you just had brian so products is all organic and service is what would that be for 2019 calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder so right now product is all organic there was contribution from the peak pace business the mediture business and the cognify business which in total was about 8 million to 9 million in 2018 bill sutherland benchmark analyst it was 2018 so there nothing is transitioning over to 2019 then right calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder well all of those all of their contracts and everything will continue because those business are still fully in place in 2019 but we ll pick up a full year related to those businesses whereas bill sutherland benchmark analyst yeah i forgotten that the dates of those so there is some calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder yeah so peak pace was acquired may 1st of 2018 mediture and eclusive were september 1st cognify was october 19th bill sutherland benchmark analyst okay great thanks everybody calvin h knowlton chief executive officer chairman and founder thank you orsula v knowlton president chief marketing new business development officer thank you operator thank you and this does conclude our question and answer session ladies

this article is more than 5 years old the gross domestic product announcement yesterday puts economic growth in 2018 at 2 9 this makes for an astonishing thirteen straight years beginning with 2006 of growth at under 3 never has our country the land of opportunity seen something like this growth always breaks out in america well past 3 even during periods of extended underperformance the comparison with the 1980s and 1990s is distinctly unfavorable from 1983 to 2000 growth was at least 3 5 in fourteen of eighteen years getty one can object that gdp is a mismeasurement is it not preposterous to suppose that we can count up all final goods and services offered for sale what are we doing adducing government spending as production how does an economy conceivably grow on a percentage basis criticisms such as these have validity yet despite them and for whatever reason gdp generally serves as a decent proxy for economic performance there can be anomalies such as the runs of 5 growth in the stagflationary 1970s but especially over the long term if the growth numbers are low something is amiss in terms of opportunity and activity in the economy we hear today that there is a tight labor market perhaps this is so perhaps employers are having a job filling jobs over the long sluggishness over this entire millennium however punctuated as it was by the great recession untold millions left the labor force after a prolonged absence a large share of them became unemployable thanks to addiction or what have you if we had 4 or 5 growth we would know we were on the road to conquering this problem we are at 2 9 so we have to assume it persists we notice that the stock market is near an all time high and that the federal reserve is not tightening in the misplaced interest of making our modest expansion disorderly but the price of gold has broken past 1 300 per ounce into the high end of the 15 percent range it has traded in since its mighty fall from 1 800 after the great recession the signal here is that skepticism about the dominant means of exchange the dollar among innumerable global money decision makers is at the extreme level of the post crisis period significant growth is incompatible with this development we note validly that business got a nice tax cut at the end of 2017 the top corporate rate taken down 14 points to 21 business investment spiked in 2018 a good thing hence hiring and wages and growth on the personal income tax side however the cuts were minimal when not non marginal in addition 2018 saw the introduction of considerable new taxation on imports via new tariffs explanations are made of the modest size of the imports affected by the tariffs we point to the virtuosity with which executives manage supply chains these days lessening the bite of trade restrictions but analysis of this stripe is misleading the significance of the 2018 tariff push lies not in developments in economic aggregates but in the american policy dispensation it represents the more the global investment community perceives that the united states is forsaking free trade turning protectionist inclined to industrial policy and acclimating itself to having more of just a home economy no matter the degree of the impact at any moment the more prospective investment dollars will take pause gold again at 1325 2 9 growth sure is better than the 1 6 1 8 range the barack obama specialty we got in 2011 2013 and 2016 not to mention the two successive years of contraction in 2008 09 some blame for the excruciatingly substandard 2018 number probably must fall on the raft of democrats left of obama from alexandra ocasio cortez to elizabeth warren which has seized the mantle of party leadership these people have a narrow interest having their rhetoric and persona tank investment in the economy or at least spook the stock market so that a weakened donald trump runs for reelection in 2020 this is however to walk a knife s edge in that acting too ridiculously means a trump landslide at the least the manifest lack of serious democratic leadership is a signal to investors and economic agents that the american political system is not sufficiently oriented towards the delivery of mass prosperity unfortunately one point of agreement in the political class appears to be a federal budget headed toward the 5 trillion mark the president made indications last summer that a 5 across the board budget cut was in the offing but the only thing that came was military spending increases that characteristically are accompanied by me too ism on the domestic spending side the more federal spending the more the economy s most productive resource its labor force is neutralized in dead end work another tax rate cut a commitment to sound money negotiating for real for free trade not to mention persistence in the president s laudable deregulation efforts would vault us over the 3 growth barrier at last but perhaps the moment is most apt for a cut in spending which in being any cut at all would be historic

total return fund so reliably beat its bond market rivals that he was dubbed the bond king more recently gross has had less to celebrate after feuding with his pimco partners over strategy succession and managerial control gross was ousted in 2014 his second act at janus was a headline making dud as poor returns spurred withdrawals his three decade marriage fell apart in a split so acrimonious it became fodder for tabloids thousands of miles away different universes that s a lot for anyone to take let alone a portfolio manager responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in client money yet gross says he was able to maintain focus and doesn t blame his personal ordeals for poor investment decisions i m an asperger and aspergers can compartmentalize he said revealing his diagnosis publicly for the first time they can operate in different universes without the other universes affecting them as much yeah i had a nasty divorce and i still had you know feelings about pimco but i think i did pretty well in compartmentalizing them not that i didn t wake up in the middle of the night and start damning one side or the other but when i came to work it was all business shared characteristics the reason he failed to deliver better returns at janus is much simpler i made some bad trades gross learned he has asperger s only after reading michael lewis s the big short in one passage lewis recounts the unusual characteristics of one of the book s heroes michael burry a doctor turned investor who also was diagnosed with the condition as an adult gross recognized that he shared many of the same qualities and had similarly obsessive habits he went to a psychiatrist who confirmed the condition it s allowed me to stay at 30 000 feet as opposed to being on the ground gross said discussing why he thinks asperger s probably made him a better investor if also infamously short tempered that s not necessarily good in terms of one to one people think you re angry or an a hole or whatever but it helps you to focus on the longer term things without getting mixed up in the details secret diagnosis that s the bill gross his former colleagues at pimco will recognize for years they found him aloof volatile and seemingly lacking in empathy symptoms of the disorder range widely according to the autistic self advocacy network and can include degrees of difficulty with social interactions and communication as well as deeply focused thinking and a preference for consistency and order gross kept his diagnosis a secret sharing it with close friends and dropping only one hint publicly in a february 2016 blog post on investing gross speculated as to why he wasn t included as a character in lewis s best seller perhaps i wasn t addled enough like co star hedge fund manager michael burry who i share affection for and an affliction and it s not a glass eye while gross says he s sort of proud of his condition because it explains a lot about me he no longer believes it s as much of an advantage professionally the markets are substantially different today than they were when i started more day to day more robotic more machine dominated he said so it s not a negative but it s probably not as much of a positive deficit critic as a bond market investor gross had to have views on monetary and fiscal policy and he shared them publicly in the investment outlooks he posted regularly on pimco s website and later on janus s one consistent thread was a critique of budget deficits zero percent interest rates and quantitative easing he wrongly predicted they d spark runaway inflation and hurt returns on stocks and bonds now gross appears to be revisiting those views although he still believes low rate policies destroy the risk reward relationship in a market economy he recognizes that the government and the federal reserve can work together to combat deflationary forces like america s aging population and amazon com why can t the government have a 2 trillion deficit if the fed is simply going to buy it like they do in japan gross said well jim grant would say mmm it would be inflationary but it hasn t been so yeah i would say trump or the next president whoever he or she is could go to 2 trillion as long as the fed was willing to accommodate restoring balance this clearly isn t the bill gross of 2012 who declared the cult of equity dead and predicted an age of inflation he describes his politics as increasingly liberal and he jokes that he re registered as a republican just to pass muster at his country club gross believes tax rates on high earners need to be raised to restore balance in american capitalism and fund benefits for the middle class such as access to affordable health care that s why he s sympathetic to ocasio cortez the congressional freshman who has energized the left wing of the democratic party even if he doesn t agree with all her ideas maybe the next time the next election there will be a socialist in the white house he said the wealthy have been advantaged for a long time and certainly the past few years with the tax cuts the middle class hasn t necessarily suffered but the gap has increased differing billionaires the question is how heavy the tax burden should be other billionaires such as oaktree capital group llc s howard marks have warned against the consequences of confiscatory taxes gross says a top marginal rate of 70 percent the number floated by ocasio cortez would be too high i just think trump took it too far he said gross himself has a fortune the bloomberg billionaires index estimates at 1 4 billion he plans to manage that money and the 500 million in his foundation as a one man family office gross said he ll do so conservatively investing in closed end funds and municipal bonds and continuing with one of his favorite trades selling options on market volatility new routine his routine if all goes according to plan will have him starting at 6 30 or 7 a m keeping at it for two or three hours and then playing a round of golf gross said he wants to be remembered for investing clients savings profitably and helping to build a wealth creating machine at pimco that leaves only one question will there be another bond market king probably not according to gross one reason is the proliferation of passive investment vehicles anyone who claims to be a king of index funds is just a puppet because the market is making the decisions gross volunteered that he wouldn t pick jeffrey gundlach the chief executive officer and co founder of doubleline capital who s frequently cited as the new king if anyone he said it might be scott minerd the chief investment officer at guggenheim partners in part because of his great long term perspective in the right environment 20 years ago he could have been a bond king gross said but i don t think he s got the market or maybe the willingness to be a king who would well i guess i did in retrospect it carries a certain burden the crown is heavy to contact the reporter on this story erik schatzker in new york at to contact the editors responsible for this story margaret collins at josh friedman dan reichl
preface because of the bonus oil and gas fracking brought us starting in 2005 heinberg says i ve titled this essay our bonus decade because the past ten years were an unexpected by us peakists anyway extra like a bonus added to a paycheck but bonus is a borrowed latin word meaning good in retrospect whatever good we humans derived from the last ten years of reprieve may ultimately be outweighed by the bad effects of our collective failure to change course during those ten years we emitted more carbon into the atmosphere than in any previous decade we depleted more of earth s resources than in any previous decade and humanity did next to nothing to reconfigure its dominant economic and financial systems in short we that is the big we though not all equally used our extra time about as foolishly as could be imagined our bonus round of economic growth and relative normalcy will assuredly end at some point due to the combined action of these factors energy environment economy and equity heinberg doesn t venture a date when oil will peak in production globally since one can imagine a scenario in which governments and central banks again print immense amounts of money in order to keep drillers and frackers busy but heinberg and many others can forsee an end to the fracking bubble as early as 2020 since drillers are running out of sweet spots and fracked oil and gas declines 85 within 3 years after so the decline will be fast indeed and it is the one bright spot the main reason that oil production was elevated very slightly above the 2005 plateau alice friedemann www

253 kunstlercast278 peak prosperity xx2 report richard heinberg october 29 2018 our bonus decade originally here the sense of security more frequently springs from habit than from conviction and for this reason it often subsists after such a change in the conditions as might have been expected to suggest alarm the lapse of time during which a given event has not happened is in this logic of habit constantly alleged as a reason why the event should never happen even when the lapse of time is precisely the added condition which makes the event imminent george eliot silas marner it s been ten years since the global financial crisis gfc of 2008 print online and broadcast news media have dutifully featured articles and programs commemorating the crisis wherein commentators mull why it happened what we learned from it and what we failed to learn nearly all of these articles and programs have adopted the perspective of conventional economic theory in which the global economy is seen as an inherently stable system that experiences an occasional market crash as a result of greed bad policies or irrational exuberance to use alan greenspan s memorable phrase from this perspective recovery from the gfc was certainly to be expected even though it could have been impeded by poor decisions some of us have a different view from our minority perspective the global economy as currently configured is inherently not just unstable but unsustainable the economy depends on perpetual growth of gdp whereas we live upon a finite planet on which the compounded growth of any material process or quantity inevitably leads to a crash the economy requires ever increasing energy supplies mostly from fossil fuels whereas coal oil and natural gas are nonrenewable depleting and climate changing resources and the economy rather than being circular like ecosystems where waste from one component is food for another so all elements are continually recycled is instead linear proceeding from resource extraction to waste disposal even though our planet has limited resources and finite waste sinks in the minority view of those who understand that there are limits to growth the gfc or something like it was entirely to be expected since whatever cannot be sustained must by definition eventually stop indeed the crash requires less of an explanation than the recovery that followed instead of skidding into a prolonged and deepening depression the global economy at least as measured conventionally has in the past years scaled new heights in the us the stock market is up unemployment is down and gdp is humming along nicely most other nations have also seen a recovery after a fashion at least we have enjoyed ten years of reprieve from crisis and decline how was this achieved what does it mean let s take a look back through the lens of the minority view at this most unusual decade where we were the years leading up to 2008 saw among other things of course soaring interest in the notion of peak oil many peak oil analysts were industry experts who studied depletion rates production decline rates in existing oil wells and oilfields and rates of oil discovery they reached their conclusions by analyzing the available data using charts equations and graphs and by extrapolating future production rates for oilfields and countries they generally agreed that the rate of world oil production would hit a maximum sometime between 2005 and 2020 and decline thereafter however some peak oilers were ecologists i was among this group informed by the 1972 computer scenario study the limits to growth ltg these observers and commentators understood that many of earth s resources not just fossil fuels are being used at unsustainable rates the standard run ltg scenario featured peaks and declines in world industrial output food production and population all in the first half of the twenty first century the peak oil ecologists therefore saw the imminent decline in world petroleum output as a likely trigger event in the larger process of society s environmental overshoot and collapse the two groups shared an understanding that oil is the lifeblood of modern industrial civilization petroleum is central to transport and agriculture without it supply chains and most food production would quickly grind to a halt moreover there is a close historic relationship between oil consumption and gdp growth thus peakists reasoned when world oil production starts its inevitable down glide the growth phase of industrial civilization will be over in the years leading up to 2005 the rate of increase in world conventional crude oil production slowed then output growth stopped altogether and oil prices started rising by july 2008 the west texas intermediate wti crude benchmark oil price briefly hit an all time inflation adjusted high of 147 per barrel high oil prices starve the economy of consumer spending and due to subprime mortgages collateralized debt obligations and other factors the economy was set for a spill in any case within weeks the foundations of the financial industry were giving way stock prices were tumbling and companies were going bankrupt by the dozen most of the us auto industry teetered on the brink of insolvency the news media were filled with commentary about the possible demise of capitalism itself in sum the financial crash of 2008 looked to some of us like not just another stock market correction but the end of a brief and blisteringly manic phase of civilized human existence it was confirmation that our diagnosis that fossil fueled industrialism was unsustainable even over the short term and prognosis that the peak in world oil production would trigger the inevitable collapse of oil based civilization were both correct our expectation at that point was that oil production would decline energy prices would rise and the economy would shrink in fits and starts living standards would crumble it would then be up to world leaders to decide how to respond either with resource wars or with a near complete redesign of systems and institutions to minimize reliance on fossil fuels and growth but we were wrong back from death s door instead there was a recovery in both world oil output growth and in overall economic activity how so it turned out that most peakists had been unaware of a so called revolution waiting to be unleashed in the american oil and gas industry although world conventional crude oil production subtracting natural gas liquids and bitumen remained flatlined roughly at the 2005 level new sources of unconventional oil began opening up in the united states especially in north dakota and south texas small to medium sized companies began drilling tens of thousands of twisty wells deep into source rock fracturing that rock with millions of gallons of water and chemicals and then propping open newly formed cracks with tons of fine sand these techniques released oil trapped in the tight rocks it was an expensive process that came with significant environmental health and social costs but by 2015 five million barrels per day of light tight oil lto were supplementing world liquid fuel supplies this development profoundly shifted the entire global energy narrative pundits began touting the prospect of us energy independence peak oil suddenly seemed a mistaken and antiquated idea moreover while fracking was revolutionizing the oil and gas industry debt was resuscitating the financial system viewing the deflationary gfc as a mortal threat central banks in late 2008 began deploying extraordinary measures that included quantitative easing and near zero interest rates at the same time governments dramatically increased their rates of deficit spending the hope of both central bankers and government policy makers was to use the infusion of debt to revive an economy that was otherwise on the brink of dissolution the gambit worked by 2010 us and world gdp were once again growing it turned out that the fracking revolution and the central bank debt free for all were closely linked fracking was so expensive that only wells in the best locations had any chance of making money for operators even with high oil prices but companies had bought leases to a lot of inferior acreage their only realistic paths to success were to make slick if misleading presentations to gullible investors and to borrow more and more money at low interest rates to fund operations and pay dividends in fact the fracking business resembled a pyramid scheme with most companies seeing negative free cash flow year after year even as they drilled their best prospective sites in 2013 we at post carbon institute pci began publishing a series of reports about shale gas and tight oil authored by geoscientist david hughes based on proprietary well level drilling information these reports documented the high geographic variability of drilling prospects with only relatively small sweet spots offering the possibility of profit and rapid per well production declines necessitating very high rates of drilling in order to grow or even maintain overall production levels given the speed at which sweet spots were becoming crowded with wells it appeared to us that the time window during which shale gas and tight oil could provide such high rates of fuel production would be relatively brief and that an overall decline in us oil and gas production would likely resume with a vengeance in the decade starting in 2020 these conclusions flew in the face of official forecasts showing high rates of production through 2050 however our confidence in our methodology was bolstered as individual shale gas and tight oil producing regions began one by one to tip over into decline in sum without low interest federal reserve policies the fracking boom might never have been possible for the world as a whole a steady decline in energy resource quality has been hidden by massive borrowing indeed since the gfc overall global debt has grown at over twice the rate of gdp growth humanity consumes now with the promise of paying later but in this instance later will likely never come the massive public and private debt that has been run up over the past few decades and especially since the gfc is too vast ever to be repaid it s being called the everything bubble instead as repayments fall behind banks will eventually be forced to cease further lending triggering a deflationary spiral of defaults if the fracking bubble hasn t burst by that time for purely geological reasons lack of further low interest financing will provide the coup de grace while low interest debt managed to fund a brief energy reprieve and to forestall overall financial collapse it couldn t paper over a deepening sense of malaise among much of the public income growth for us wage earners had been stagnant since the early 1980s then during the 2008 2018 decade wage earners in the lowest percentiles continued to coast or even lost ground while high income households saw dramatic improvements this was partly a result of the way governments and central banks had structured their bailouts with most of the freshly minted cash going to investors and financial institutions this lopsidedness in the economic rebound was mirrored in many other countries a recent us tax cut that was targeted almost exclusively at high income households with another similar cut apparently on the way is only exacerbating the trend toward higher inequality and economic inequality is fomenting widespread dissatisfaction with both the economic system and the political system none of the bankers who contributed to the gfc via shady investment schemes went to jail and a lot of people are unhappy about that too further there was no recovery at all for the global climate during the past decade quite the opposite as humanity burned more fossil fuels and spewed more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere the scale of climate impacts grew hurricanes typhoons droughts and wildfires fed deepening poverty and in some instances e g syria simmering conflicts growing tides of refugees began migrating away from areas of crisis and toward regions of relative safety at the same time technological trends drove further wedges among social groups while automation helped tamp down wage growth the pervasive use of social media inflamed political polarization an expanding far right political fringe in turn fed anti immigrant and anti refugee populism and sought to exploit the disgruntlement of left behind wage earners all of this culminated in the ascendancy of donald trump as us president joining fellow authoritarians in russia china the philippines hungary poland and elsewhere globally political systems have been destabilized to a degree not seen in decades altogether this was a deceptive uneven and unsettling recovery how we used our bonus decade as already mentioned humanity didn t get a bonus decade with regard to climate change while building millions of solar panels and thousands of wind turbines we also increased our burn rate for oil natural gas and coal global coal consumption maxed out in 2014 and has fallen a little since then though it s still above the 2008 rate that s because as george monbiot puts it while economic growth continues we will never give up our fossil fuels habit and policy makers are not willing to give up growth here s a thought experiment if there had been no recovery that is if gdp had continued to plummet as it was doing in 2009 and if as a result demand for fossil fuels had cratered there would no doubt have been a lot of human misery which there may be anyway ultimately just delayed but there also would have been less long term impact on the global climate and on ecosystems as it was atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations rose as did the average global temperature with devastating effect on oceans forests and biodiversity at pci we spent the past decade adapting our message to shifting realities we gave a lot of thought to the transition to a post growth economic regime resulting in my book the end of growth we also spent many hours pondering societal strategies for surviving overshoot and came to much the same conclusion as some of our colleagues who ve been working on these issues for decades including dennis meadows co author of the limits to growth that is with impacts on the way building societal resilience has to be a top priority we determined that it s at the community scale that resilience building efforts are likely to be most successful and most readily undertaken determined to help build community resilience we co published a three book series of community resilience guides as well as the community resilience reader we also produced the think resilience video series we analyzed the prospects for us shale gas and tight oil production via david hughes s series of reports mentioned above also in my book snake oil and we assessed the prospects for a transition to renewable energy in a book our renewable future i coauthored with pci fellow david fridley in that book we concluded that while an energy transition is necessary and inevitable transformations in virtual every aspect of modern society will need to be undertaken and economic growth has to be curtailed in order for it to happen we at pci did other things as well including producing additional videos books and reports but these are some of the highlights i m proud of what we were able to accomplish with the participation of our followers fellows staff and funders but i m sorry to say our efforts had limited reach our books and reports got little mainstream media attention and while some communities have adopted resilience as a planning goal and transition and other initiatives have promoted resilience thinking through grassroots citizen networks most towns and cities are still woefully ill prepared for what s coming i ve titled this essay our bonus decade because the past ten years were an unexpected by us peakists anyway extra like a bonus added to a paycheck but bonus is a borrowed latin word meaning good in retrospect whatever good we humans derived from the last ten years of reprieve may ultimately be outweighed by the bad effects of our collective failure to change course during those ten years we emitted more carbon into the atmosphere than in any previous decade we depleted more of earth s resources than in any previous decade and humanity did next to nothing to reconfigure its dominant economic and financial systems in short we that is the big we though not all equally used our extra time about as foolishly as could be imagined where we stand now as discussed above us tight oil and shale gas output growth can t be expected to continue much longer lto production in the rest of the world never really took off and is unlikely to do so because conditions in other countries are not as conducive as they are in us where land owners often also own rights to minerals beneath the soil at the same time conventional crude oil whose global production rate has been on a plateau for the past decade may finally be set to decline due to a paucity of new discoveries at the same time the burden of debt that was shouldered during the past decade is becoming unbearable us federal government borrowing has soared despite robust economic conditions and interest payments on debt will soon exceed military spending china s debts have quadrupled during the decade its annual gdp growth rate is quickly slowing its oil production rate is peaking and the energy profitability of its energy sector as a whole is declining fast but that s not all that s happening let s step back and summarize 1 we peak oil analysts had assumed that energy resource depletion would be the immediate trigger for societal collapse 2 however climate change is turning out to be a far greater threat than we depletionists had thought fifteen or twenty years ago when the peak oil discussion was just getting underway the impacts of warming atmosphere and oceans are appearing at a frightening and furious pace and climate feedbacks could make future warming non linear and perhaps even unsurvivable at this point one has to wonder whether the mythic image of hell is a collective unconscious premonition of global climate change 3 ten years ago we learned that debt cycles and debt bubbles are a significant related factor potentially leading to or hastening civilizational collapse 4 now we are all getting a rapid education in the ways inequality can lead to political polarization and social instability as a shorthand way of speaking about these four related factors we at pci have begun speaking of the e4 crisis energy environment economy and equity it s no longer helpful to focus on one factor to the exclusion of the others it s far more informative to look for ways in which all four are interacting in real time our bonus round of economic growth and relative normalcy will assuredly end at some point due to the combined action of these factors i don t know when the dam will burst nor do i know for certain whether there will be yet another fake recovery afterward the next one perhaps being even weaker and more unequally experienced than the current one and i m not about to offer a definitive forecast for the timing of the global oil peak one can imagine a scenario in which governments and central banks again print immense amounts of money in order to keep drillers and frackers busy only two things can i say with confidence the big trends all add up to overshoot crisis and decline and building personal and community resilience remains the best strategy in response
greece and argentina both introduced radical pension reforms following the financial crisis drawing on recent research marina angelaki and leandro carrera argue that while both countries lacked access to international financial markets and had unsustainable pension systems the reforms have been short sighted ultimately undermining the adequacy and sustainability of pensions a future overhaul of their systems looks unavoidable latin american countries have shared with those of southern europe a common policy legacy of bismarckian welfare states where benefits are related to working age earnings in the pension field both argentina and greece introduced occupational based schemes at the beginning of the twentieth century yet in the 1990s they took different paths in their attempt to put their public finances in order argentina adopted a structural reform entailing the introduction of a private pillar on top of its public pay as you go system whereas reforms of the greek monopillar system were limited to cost containment and revenue raising measures despite the different reform paths on the eve of the 2008 crisis both systems were faced with significant sustainability and adequacy challenges in the case of argentina approximately half of the system s revenues came from ad hoc taxes and government transfers while a significant number of workers had an insufficient number of contribution years to qualify for a full pension from the public pillar and low levels of savings in the private pillar leading to an inadequate level of income retirement for example it was estimated that in 2002 30 per cent of the elderly living in rural areas were below the poverty line in the case of greece despite pension expenditure being close to the eu average the risk of poverty for those over 65 years old stood in 2009 at 21 4 per cent furthermore pension expenditure was projected to increase from 12 4 per cent of gdp in 2009 to 24 1 by 2060 according to eu projections argentina s pension reforms against this background the global financial crisis impacted on their pension systems in an unexpected way the expansionist macroeconomic policies of the kirchner government in argentina proved unsustainable leading to a fall in the government budget balance surplus to 1 1 per cent of gdp less than one third of its 3 7 peak in 2007 as the global crisis further exacerbated the economy s weakness and the country s inability to access international financial markets due to the incomplete restructuring of its debt in 2005 the renationalisation of the pension system was seen as an option for reducing public debt obligations while improving budget balances the government justified this decision as a measure that would protect private savings from the effects of the crisis even though the decline in the value of pension fund assets reflected investors concerns over the government s macroeconomic policy this move also fitted with the government s return to the idea of the state as the main provider of retirement income which was in line with the general macroeconomic policy of more state intervention in the economy thus the 2008 reform allowed the government to seize the assets from private fund administrators that amounted to about 9 5 per cent of gdp yet the speed with which the reform was passed is an indication that not enough thought was given to how the reform would impact the future sustainability of the system as also evidenced by the absence of actuarial estimates on the impact of the reform estimates provided by private analysts at the time of the reform showed that the new system could experience a deficit of between 1 7 and 4 1 percent of gdp already by 2030 reaching over 5 percent by 2050 the concerns about the sustainability of the system have been the focus of the new centre right administration in power since 2015 in 2017 the government stated that the uprating of pension benefits which was the result of applying a generous formula that combined the percentage increases in average wages and resources of the social security administration was financially unsustainable the government thus presented a reform project to change the uprating formula to one that combines the percentage increase in prices 70 and wages 30 after much resistance in congress the reform was enacted in december 2017 yet further litigation in respect of the new uprating mechanism is expected the greek pension system after the crisis in the case of greece the government announcement in 2009 of the misreporting of earlier fiscal data led to the downgrading of the country s credit rating and an eventual inability to access financial markets the bailout agreement signed with the european commission european central bank and the international monetary fund in 2010 included a series of measures pension reform being one them which would ensure the country s fiscal sustainability the pension reforms adopted in the context of the crisis entailed the transition to a system consisting of a basic pension and a proportional one based on lifetime earnings and the replacement of the defined benefit system of auxiliary funds with a notional defined contribution one this transition has been accompanied by drastic cuts in both current by about 40 to 50 per cent for certain income brackets and future pension benefits as in the case of argentina reform was justified as a measure that would contribute in restoring the country s fiscal sustainability and as the only solution for a country in a state of emergency and with no time available the significant retrenchment introduced did not prevent the introduction of further measures the syriza government that took office in 2015 introduced a reform entailing among others a new formula for the calculation of pension benefits the introduction of an upper ceiling to newly awarded pensions and increased contributions for the self employed the new law results in yet again significant cuts to pension benefits with those with a high number of contributions expected to face bigger cuts compared to those with a lower number of contributions an element that has been heavily criticised short term economic goals over long term sustainability despite the differences in the content of the reforms adopted in the two countries shaped by the existing structure of their pension systems both argentina and greece have subordinated pension reform to short term economic goals this was done to bypass isolation from international financial markets and thus access needed funds in the case of argentina and to show reform readiness in the case of greece through the adoption of measures improving the country s fiscal situation yet by using pension reform as a quick fix for pressing economic concerns not enough consideration has been given to current and future adequacy and sustainability issues thus putting the sound footing of both reforms into question the introduction of further reform rounds in both countries highlights the inability of the previous reforms to provide a long term solution to the systems challenges as pension reform remains high on the agenda of countries around the world the experiences of argentina and greece highlight the perils of using quick fix reforms that do not necessarily address long term sustainability issues this article draws on an accompanying study which can be read here please read our comments policy before commenting note this article gives the views of the authors not the
