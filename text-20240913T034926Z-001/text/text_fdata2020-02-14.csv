zimbabwe executive summary investor optimism following the november 2017 fall of president robert mugabe has weakened as president emmerson mnangagwa s government has been slow to follow through on reforms to improve the ease of doing business and a protracted currency crisis strains the economy the transitional stabilization program announced in 2018 includes structural and fiscal reforms that if fully implemented would resolve many of the economy s fundamental weaknesses the new government did move quickly to amend the restrictive indigenization local ownership law to apply only to the diamond and platinum sectors opening other sectors to unrestricted foreign ownership nevertheless investors remain cautious zimbabwe has attracted low investment inflows of less than usd 500 million annually over the past decade between 2014 and 2017 foreign direct investment inflows fell from usd 545 million to usd 289 million but rose to approximately usd 470 million in 2018 the government

protecting property rights zimbabwe s period of hyperinflation ended in 2009 with the country s commitment to the use of the multicurrency monetary regime under which the u s dollar dominated most transactions this restored a degree of business confidence in the country until november 2016 when zimbabwe introduced a surrogate currency the bond note used only for domestic transactions the local currency has since lost value and the country is currently experiencing a binding foreign exchange shortage that makes it difficult for companies to meet their foreign payment obligations in february 2019 the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz officially unpegged the local currency from the u s dollar and created an interbank market for foreign exchange but has failed to implement a market clearing exchange rate regime therefore it remains difficult to access dollars at the official exchange rate and an unstable black market for u s dollars persists zimbabwe s arrears in payments to international financial institutions and zimbabwe s high external debt public and private of over usd 10 7 billion complicate the situation by limiting the country s ability to access official development assistance at concessional rates additionally the country s banks do not offer financing for periods longer than two years with most financing available for 180 days or less zimbabwe s

investors within the mining sector exporting 50 percent of output will have reduced corporation tax of 20 percent and receive import duty exemption on imported capital goods while losses are carried

five year tax holiday duty free importation of raw materials and capital equipment for use in the epz and no tax liability from capital gains arising from the sale of property forming part of the investment in epzs since january 2004 the government has generally required that foreign capital comprise a majority of the investment the requirement on epz designated companies to export at least 80 percent of output has constrained foreign investment in the zones the merger between the zimbabwe investment centre and the zimbabwe export processing zones authority which began in 2006 has completed and the zimbabwe investment authority now performs both roles zimbabwe has recently passed amendments to the zimbabwe investment authority act to include special economic zones however to date activities in special economic zones have not been meaningful in spite of the generous incentives offered to investors in these areas although there are no discriminatory import or export policies affecting foreign firms the government s approval criteria heavily favor export oriented projects import duties and related taxes range as high as 110 percent export processing zone designated companies must export at least 80 percent of output performance and data localization requirements the government mandates local employment except for specialized skills that are in short supply locally there are no general performance requirements for businesses located outside export processing and special economic zones government policy however encourages investment in enterprises that contribute to rural development job creation exports the addition of domestic value to primary products use of local materials and the transfer of appropriate technologies government participation is

strong case in order to obtain work and residence permits normally the maximum contract period for a foreigner is three years but with possible extension to five years for individuals with highly specialized skills while currently there is no forced localization in which foreign investors must use domestic content in goods the government is in the process of developing a local content policy designed to encourage the use of local inputs in production the government does not require foreign it providers to turn over source code and or provide access to surveillance only banks are required to maintain all their data in the country through the escrow agreement the new government investment guidelines do not permit mandatory and or arbitrary performance requirements that distort or limit the expansion of trade and investment 6 financial sector capital markets and portfolio investment zimbabwe s stock market currently has 56 publicly listed companies but just 12 of them account for about 75 percent of total market capitalization which stood at usd 5 7 billion on march 25 2019 in september 1996 the government opened the stock and money markets to limited foreign portfolio investment since then a maximum of 49 percent of any locally listed company can be foreign owned in line with the indigenization policy framework with any single investor allowed to acquire up to 15 percent of the outstanding shares there is a 1 48 percent withholding tax on the sale of marketable securities while the tax on purchasing stands at 1 73 percent totaling 3 21 percent the rates are comparable with the average of 3 5 percent for the region as a way of raising funds for the state the government mandated that insurance companies and pension funds invest between 25 and 35 percent of their portfolios in prescribed government bonds zimbabwe s hyperinflation which ended with the 2009 dollarization wiped out the value of domestic debt instruments however the government has been borrowing from the local market by issuing treasury bills tbs to financial institutions to finance government expenditure official statistics show that by the end of 2017 the government had issued in excess of usd 2 billion worth of tbs to financial institutions money and banking system three major international commercial banks and a number of regional and domestic banks operate in zimbabwe with a total of over 200 branches the central bank reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz believes that the banking sector is generally stable in spite of a harsh operating environment characterized by high credit risk and liquidity constraints as most international banks reduce risk de risking in the face of high penalties for non compliance with prudential guidelines in developed countries most zimbabwean correspondent banking relationships are in jeopardy as of december 31 2018 the sector had 19 operating institutions comprising 13 commercial banks five building societies and one savings bank according to the rbz as of december 2018 all operating banking institutions complied with the prescribed minimum core capital requirements the level of non performing loans increased somewhat from 7 08 percent in december 2017 to 8 25 percent by december 2018 largely reflecting a decline in credit quality due to the poor operating environment the rbz still believes the npls of financial institutions will fall due to banks adopting credit risk management tools in line with the internationally accepted accounting standards according to the central bank the total deposits including interbank deposits rose from usd 8 48 billion in december 2017 to usd 10 32 billion by december 2018 the rbz reports that as of december 31 2018 total nostro foreign currency deposits amounted to usd 673 81 million mostly dominated by corporates 97 17 percent foreign exchange and remittances foreign exchange in 2009 the government lifted exchange controls and demonetized the zimbabwe dollar the rbz permitted bank accounts and transactions in the following currencies euro botswana pula south african rand british pound u s dollar chinese yuan australian dollar indian rupee and japanese yen with most business conducted in u s dollars zimbabwe s export performance rose but at a slower pace than imports weak investment inflows and zimbabwe s fiscal and current account deficits gradually resulted in a shortage of foreign exchange in response to a binding cash crisis the government introduced a surrogate currency the bond note in 2016 which traded on a 1 1 basis with the u s dollar but the shortage of dollars meant rbz would only allocate u s dollars to priority payments to others payments after a delay or when the situation reached a crisis in late 2018 and early 2019 not at all businesses have resorted to a black market for foreign exchange in order to make external payments on february 20 2019 the rbz introduced the real time gross settlement rtgs dollar incorporating the rtgs balances bond notes and coins whose value against the u s dollar should be market determined via a new interbank foreign exchange market emerged but rbz has not allowed the official rate to fall in line with market pressures the black market persists since october 2018 banks have set up distinct foreign currency accounts denominated in u s dollars the government s arrears on over usd 7 billion in external debt block the country s access to multilateral financing these conditions severely constrain external financing for the economy which has resulted in rising external payments arrears for necessary imports remittance policies in line with recommendations from the southern african development community sadc and the imf the government revised the foreign exchange control act which regulated currency conversions and transfers before the withdrawal of the zimbabwe dollar with these changes and the liberalization of most current account transactions exporters retained 100 percent of their foreign currency receipts for their own use until 2016 from 2016 to february 2019 the rbz retained 50 percent of the foreign exchange generated by export proceeds distributing the equivalent amount to the exporter in local currency shared among competing foreign payments needs based on a priority list in february 2019 the government raised the amount most exporters can retain for their own use to 80 percent 55 percent for gold producers 50 percent for all other minerals and 30 percent for tobacco and cotton farmers moreover foreigners can remit capital appreciation dividend income and after tax profits provided the foreign exchange is available sovereign wealth funds zimbabwe does not have a sovereign wealth fund swf the government set aside ususd 1 million toward administrative costs related to the setting up of the sovereign wealth fund in its 2016 budget although the government proposed to capitalize the swf through a charge of up to 25 percent on royalty collections on mineral sales as well as on special dividend on the sale of diamond gas granite and other minerals the concept has not progressed any further 9 corruption in 2005 the government enacted an anti corruption act that established a government appointed zimbabwe anti corruption commission zacc to investigate corruption the 2009 13 government of national unity gnu enhanced the institutional capacity of the zacc with members appointed from civil society and the private sector however when the zacc s term of office expired the new zacc did not include civil society and private sector representatives the government has a track record of prosecuting individuals selectively focusing on those who have fallen out of favor with the ruling party and ignoring transgressions by members of the favored elite accusations of corruption seldom result in formal charges and convictions many corruption charges stem from opaque procurement processes while the laws to combat corruption exist enforcement of the laws is weak as law enforcement agencies lack political will and resources as a result transparency international ranked zimbabwe 160 out of 175 countries and territories surveyed in 2018 the mnangagwa government has committed itself to eradicate corruption since december 2017 zacc has arrested and brought before the courts a number of high ranking officials mostly aligned to the mugabe faction from the previous government in spite of this the courts have not sent many of the accused persons to prison existing rules on the zimbabwe stock exchange compel listed companies to disclose through annual reports minimum disclosure requirements the government also created a policy to improve accountability in the use of state resources through the introduction of the public finance management act in march 2010 nevertheless corruption remains endemic especially within the diamond sector where production and export figures are largely unreliable the government has introduced a diamond policy that focuses on ensuring the 100 percent government ownership of all alluvial diamonds in the ground and the involvement of the zimbabwe revenue authority zimra in the entire value chain of diamond production while zimbabwe signed the united nations convention against corruption on february 20 2004 and ratified the treaty on february 20 2007 it is not party to the oecd convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions resources to report corruption transparency international

into power following the military intervention of november 2017 that resulted in the departure of longstanding dictator robert mugabe on august 1 2018 the army used live ammunition to disperse people demonstrating against the delay in announcing official presidential election results leaving six people dead following demonstrations against a 140 percent increase in fuel prices on january 14 2019 security forces responded with excessive violence and human rights abuses including the use of live ammunition arbitrary beatings and arrests resulting in 17 deaths and hundreds injured over the course of weeks the crackdown targeted members of the opposition political party civil society groups and labor leaders political uncertainty remains high violent crime such as assault carjacking and home invasion is common local police lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents 11 labor policies and practices decades of political and economic crises have led to the emigration of many of zimbabwe s skilled and well educated citizens formal sector employment has fallen significantly anecdotal evidence shows widespread youth unemployment as the country continues to produce graduates without a matching growth in employment opportunities as a result most end up joining the informal sector estimated at over 90 percent of the workforce the government encourages foreign investors to make maximum use of zimbabwean management and technical personnel the country s labor laws make it very difficult for employers to adjust employment in response to an economic downturn except in the special economic zones sezs where labor laws do not apply outside the sezs the employer must engage the employees and their representatives and agree to adopt measures to avoid retrenchment if the measures fail the employer can retrench and pay an all inclusive package of one month salary for each two years of service or the pro rata share thereof the labor laws differentiate between layoffs and severance with the former falling under retrenchment where the retrenchment law must apply the law does not accept unfair dismissal or layoffs of employees the 2015 amendments to the act only permit terminations of contracts to be in terms of a registered code of conduct expiry of a contract of fixed term duration or mutual agreement there is no unemployment insurance or other safety net programs for workers laid off for economic reasons employers in all sectors rely heavily on temporary or contract workers because there is no need to follow termination procedures the employee will only wait for the expiry of the agreed period of employment the labor amendment act of 2015 however now requires employment councils to put a limit on the number of times employers can renew short term contracts the government does not waive labor laws in order to attract or retain investment except in the case of sezs labor unions affiliated to the zimbabwe congress of trade unions zctu are independent of the government and those affiliated to the zimbabwe federation of trade unions zftu and the zimbabwe industrial revolution workers federation support the government collective bargaining takes place through a national employment council nec in each industry comprising representatives from labor business and government the agreements apply to the entire sector regardless of whether or not all employees are members to the council or not except for managerial employees the country has a labor dispute resolution process that starts at company level through disciplinary committees or grievance committees if the issue is not resolved at this level the aggrieved party can appeal to either the employment council or the labor court depending on the industrial agreement other redress is through the ministry of public service labor and social welfare in which labor officers settle disputes for industries without employment councils from the labor court an aggrieved party can appeal to the supreme court labor inspection is minimal due to a lack of inspectors and there is discrimination in practice the government continues to harass labor unions and their leaders labor leaders were among the targets of the january 2019 violent government crackdown the government is a member of the international labor organization ilo and has ratified conventions protecting worker rights the country has been subject to ilo supervisory mechanisms for practices that limit workers rights to freely associate organize and hold labor union meetings 13

correspondent banking relationships are in jeopardy as of december 31 2018 the sector had 19 operating institutions comprising 13 commercial banks five building societies and one savings bank according to the rbz as of december 2018 all operating banking institutions complied with the prescribed minimum core capital requirements the level of non performing loans increased somewhat from 7 08 percent in december 2017 to 8 25 percent by december 2018 largely reflecting a decline in credit quality due to the poor operating environment the rbz still believes the npls of financial institutions will fall due to banks adopting credit risk management tools in line with the internationally accepted accounting standards according to the central bank the total deposits including interbank deposits rose from usd 8 48 billion in december 2017 to usd 10 32 billion by december 2018 the rbz reports that as of december 31 2018 total nostro foreign currency deposits amounted to usd 673 81 million mostly dominated by corporates 97 17 percent foreign exchange and remittances foreign exchange in 2009 the government lifted exchange controls and demonetized the zimbabwe dollar the rbz permitted bank accounts and transactions in the following currencies euro botswana pula south african rand british pound u s dollar chinese yuan australian dollar indian rupee and japanese yen with most business conducted in u s dollars zimbabwe s export performance rose but at a slower pace than imports weak investment inflows and zimbabwe s fiscal and current account deficits gradually resulted in a shortage of foreign exchange in response to a binding cash crisis the government introduced a surrogate currency the bond note in 2016 which traded on a 1 1 basis with the u s dollar but the shortage of dollars meant rbz would only allocate u s dollars to priority payments to others payments after a delay or when the situation reached a crisis in late 2018 and early 2019 not at all businesses have resorted to a black market for foreign exchange in order to make external payments on february 20 2019 the rbz introduced the real time gross settlement rtgs dollar incorporating the rtgs balances bond notes and coins whose value against the u s dollar should be market determined via a new interbank foreign exchange market emerged but rbz has not allowed the official rate to fall in line with market pressures the black market persists since october 2018 banks have set up distinct foreign currency accounts denominated in u s dollars the government s arrears on over usd 7 billion in external debt block the country s access to multilateral financing these conditions severely constrain external financing for the economy which has resulted in rising external payments arrears for necessary imports remittance policies in line with recommendations from the southern african development community sadc and the imf the government revised the foreign exchange control act which regulated currency conversions and transfers before the withdrawal of the zimbabwe dollar with these changes and the liberalization of most current account transactions exporters retained 100 percent of their foreign currency receipts for their own use until 2016 from 2016 to february 2019 the rbz retained 50 percent of the foreign exchange generated by export proceeds distributing the equivalent amount to the exporter in local currency shared among competing foreign payments needs based on a priority list in february 2019 the government raised the amount most exporters can retain for their own use to 80 percent 55 percent for gold producers 50 percent for all other minerals and 30 percent for tobacco and cotton farmers moreover foreigners can remit capital appreciation dividend income and after tax profits provided the foreign exchange is available sovereign wealth funds zimbabwe does not have a sovereign wealth fund swf the government set aside ususd 1 million toward administrative costs related to the setting up of the sovereign wealth fund in its 2016 budget although the government proposed to capitalize the swf through a charge of up to 25 percent on royalty collections on mineral sales as well as on special dividend on the sale of diamond gas granite and other minerals the concept has not progressed any further 8 responsible business conduct following dollarization in 2009 there has been increased awareness of standards for responsible business conduct rbc driven by the private sector through the standards association of zimbabwe the private sector developed the national corporate governance code of zimbabwe zimcode which is a framework designed to guide zimbabwean companies on rbc an industrial advocacy group the confederation of zimbabwe industries has a standing committee on business ethics and standards that drives ethical conduct within the zimbabwean private sector the organization has developed its own charter according to oecd guidelines highlighting good corporate governance and ethical behavior the zimbabwean government has not taken any measures to encourage rbc and it does not take rbc policies or practices into its procurement decisions firms that demonstrate corporate social responsibility do not automatically garner favorable treatment from consumers employees and government with regard to indigenization foreign companies receive formal indigenization credits of up to 31 percent for conducting csr determined by the extent to which the activity achieves the government s socio economic objectives although the zimbabwean government has considered implementing the world bank s extractive industries transparency initiative eiti principles in order to strengthen accountability good governance and transparency in the mining sector it has yet to launch an eiti program however the government has stated its intention to adopt a domestic initiative called the zimbabwe mining revenue transparency initiative zmrti though it has made little progress in implementing the initiative 9 corruption in 2005 the government enacted an anti corruption act that established a government appointed zimbabwe anti corruption commission zacc to investigate corruption the 2009 13 government of national unity gnu enhanced the institutional capacity of the zacc with members appointed from civil society and the private sector however when the zacc s term of office expired the new zacc did not include civil society and private sector representatives the government has a track record of prosecuting individuals selectively focusing on those who have fallen out of favor with the ruling party and ignoring transgressions by members of the favored elite accusations of corruption seldom result in formal charges and convictions many corruption charges stem from opaque procurement processes while the laws to combat corruption exist enforcement of the laws is weak as law enforcement agencies lack political will and resources as a result transparency international ranked zimbabwe 160 out of 175 countries and territories surveyed in 2018 the mnangagwa government has committed itself to eradicate corruption since december 2017 zacc has arrested and brought before the courts a number of high ranking officials mostly aligned to the mugabe faction from the previous government in spite of this the courts have not sent many of the accused persons to prison existing rules on the zimbabwe stock exchange compel listed companies to disclose through annual reports minimum disclosure requirements the government also created a policy to improve accountability in the use of state resources through the introduction of the public finance management act in march 2010 nevertheless corruption remains endemic especially within the diamond sector where production and export figures are largely unreliable the government has introduced a diamond policy that focuses on ensuring the 100 percent government ownership of all alluvial diamonds in the ground and the involvement of the zimbabwe revenue authority zimra in the entire value chain of diamond production while zimbabwe signed the united nations convention against corruption on february 20 2004 and ratified the treaty on february 20 2007 it is not party to the oecd convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions resources to report corruption transparency international zimbabwe 96 central avenue p o box cy 434 causeway harare 263 4 793 246 7 email info tizim org 10 political and security environment political parties labor organizations and civil society groups sometimes encounter state sponsored intimidation and repression from government security forces and zimbabwe african national union patriotic front zanu pf linked activists disagreements between and within political parties occasionally resulted in violence targeting political party members political tensions and civil unrest persist under the government of president emmerson mnangagwa who came into power following the military intervention of november 2017 that resulted in the departure of longstanding dictator robert mugabe on august 1 2018 the army used live ammunition to disperse people demonstrating against the delay in announcing official presidential election results leaving six people dead following demonstrations against a 140 percent increase in fuel prices on january 14 2019 security forces responded with excessive violence and human rights abuses including the use of live ammunition arbitrary beatings and arrests resulting in 17 deaths and hundreds injured over the course of weeks the crackdown targeted members of the opposition political party civil society groups and labor leaders political uncertainty remains high violent crime such as assault carjacking and home invasion is common local police lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents 11 labor policies and practices decades of political and economic crises have led to the emigration of many of zimbabwe s skilled and well educated citizens formal sector employment has fallen significantly anecdotal evidence shows widespread youth unemployment as the country continues to produce graduates without a matching growth in employment opportunities as a result most end up joining the informal sector estimated at over 90 percent of the workforce the government encourages foreign investors to make maximum use of zimbabwean management and technical personnel the country s labor laws make it very difficult for employers to adjust employment in response to an economic downturn except in the special economic zones sezs where labor laws do not apply outside the sezs the employer must engage the employees and their representatives and agree to adopt measures to avoid retrenchment if the measures fail the employer can retrench and pay an all inclusive package of one month salary for each two years of service or the pro rata share thereof the labor laws differentiate between layoffs and severance with the former falling under retrenchment where the retrenchment law must apply the law does not accept unfair dismissal or layoffs of employees the 2015 amendments to the act only permit terminations of contracts to be in terms of a registered code of conduct expiry of a contract of fixed term duration or mutual agreement there is no unemployment insurance or other safety net programs for workers laid off for economic reasons employers in all sectors rely heavily on temporary or contract workers because there is no need to follow termination procedures the employee will only wait for the expiry of the agreed period of employment the labor amendment act of 2015 however now requires employment councils to put a limit on the number of times employers can renew short term contracts the government does not waive labor laws in order to attract or retain investment except in the case of sezs labor unions affiliated to the zimbabwe congress of trade unions zctu are independent of the government and those affiliated to the zimbabwe federation of trade unions zftu and the zimbabwe industrial revolution workers federation support the government collective bargaining takes place through a national employment council nec in each industry comprising representatives from labor business and government the agreements apply to the entire sector regardless of whether or not all employees are members to the council or not except for managerial employees the country has a labor dispute resolution process that starts at company level through disciplinary committees or grievance committees if the issue is not resolved at this level the aggrieved party can appeal to either the employment council or the labor court depending on the industrial agreement other redress is through the ministry of public service labor and social welfare in which labor officers settle disputes for industries without employment councils from the labor court an aggrieved party can appeal to the supreme court labor inspection is minimal due to a lack of inspectors and there is discrimination in practice the government continues to harass labor unions and their leaders labor leaders were among the targets of the january 2019 violent government crackdown the government is a member of the international labor organization ilo and has ratified conventions protecting worker rights the country has been subject to ilo supervisory mechanisms for practices that limit workers rights to freely associate organize and hold labor union meetings 13 foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment statistics
by as zimbabwe s economy continues its descent since a military coup installed emmerson mnangagwa as the nation s ruler in november 2017 his government s response has been to double down on its ruinous neoliberal reform program how much more austerity the zimbabwean people can endure is another question following an economic downturn of 6 5 last year and an unemployment rate that is said to stand at 95 the zimbabwe coalition on debt and development zimcodd slams the additional austerity measures that were implemented in 2019 against the backdrop of deep socio economic woes charging that they cultivated an enabling environment for inequality to thrive while budget cuts have further relegated ordinary citizens to abject poverty privatization and privation mnangagwa s aim is nothing less than the total transformation of the economy and minister of finance and economic development mthuli ncube has proclaimed we will be privatizing the banking assets that we own we are going to make a lot of progress this year and we want to make sure that we really create a private sector led economy in zimbabwe on october 5 2018 mnangagwa s government published its transitional stabilization program tsp which detailed the reform measures that the government planned to implement over the following two years in the document s preface mnangagwa stated that the policy will inevitably be driven by the private sector which will entail opening the country to international investors and financiers the civil service is being repurposed so that it focuses on serving the needs of private capital mnangagwa wants the government to create an enabling environment for state and non state actors including the private sector and communities in the delivery of public goods and services and development the aim of what the tsp terms an entrepreneurial civil service is to facilitate the identification and creation of opportunities for investors looking to establish service delivery and enterprises state and private sector actors will team in producing the delivery of public goods and services and development investors taking over privatized public services will undoubtedly be motivated by profit seeking rather than serving the common good while the role of government is to provide business with profitable opportunities a key goal of the stabilization program is to dismantle much of the public sector as the document phrases it the objective is to scale down government support for public entities and local authorities in favor of deepening synergies with the private sector as interpreted by privatization inclined officials where there can be efficiency gains it will be desirable for government entities and local authorities to move out in favor of private sector service provision since no amount of evidence can persuade the neoliberal mind that there could ever be a case of efficient public service this amounts to coded language for near total privatization the first phase of privatization is slated to be completed by the end of 2020 by that time eleven state owned enterprises should be privatized along with 23 subsidiaries of the industrial development corporation idc and the zimbabwe mining development corporation additionally two state owned firms and three idc subsidiaries are to be liquidated altogether the privatization effort is an ongoing process and many other public enterprises will undergo performance reviews which will recommend to government on the best options for reforming these initially more than half of 107 state entities will be undergoing reform while investors can seize the chance to purchase state owned enterprises at bargain basement prices government workers will follow a different economic trajectory as the program promises that the salary and benefits freeze imposed on all state entities remains in force those enterprises not immediately privatized will have the groundwork laid for their eventual disposal as the plan calls for the introduction of more private sector experts in overseeing management of public enterprises mnangagwa s economic policymakers want to pit provinces and localities against each other in lowering costs to compete in attracting investors marketwise the policy document states each province and local authority will transform itself into an investment and economic zone in order to make themselves attractive for both local and foreign investment the logic of the approach is that the return for maximizing profitability for investors will be a downward spiral in living standards for ordinary workers as they are compelled to undercut other areas except for diamonds and platinum mnangagwa had already jettisoned zimbabwe s indigenization and empowerment act which had mandated a minimum of 51 local ownership in mining companies now he has also eliminated the local ownership provision for diamond and platinum mining operations as minister ncube explains we say zimbabwe is open for business you can only be open if you allow ownership of 100 percent as a further inducement to foreign investors the royalty rate on diamond mining is being reduced by one third this year when a government is more eager to please western investors than its people the conventional approach is to seek the advice of the imf and mnangagwa s government is no different it asked the imf to help direct and manage its neoliberal stabilization program through a staff monitored program smp for the period of may 15 2019 to march 15 2020 which presumably may be extended not surprisingly the advice the imf has to offer adheres to its customary tried and failed approach the imf says the smp is designed to support the authorities reform agenda which among other structural measures includes a market based foreign exchange and steps to reform and privatize state owned enterprises as an inducement to the imf minister ncube attached a letter in his request to the imf to establish the smp offering two carrots that would be enough to gladden the heart of any public sector slashing wrecker he pointed out that zimbabwe s budget will reduce the real wages of public servants while state owned enterprises have been earmarked for privatization liquidation or merger as for the agricultural sector ncube assured the imf that our objective is to reorient the financing model for agriculture to crowd in private sector financing reduce significantly government footprint in production and lessen the dependence on the budget the imf applauded the government s 2019 budget cuts that targeted programs that benefit the population at large including further fiscal consolidation by containing the wage bill reducing transfers to soes and improving the design of agricultural subsidies what the imf meant by its use of the word improving was made more explicit when it noted that zimbabwe s budget envisages a gradual phasing out of these subsidies allowing the private sector to take the lead in driving what it rather imaginatively termed sustainable growth in the agricultural sector despite all these steps the government s drive to liberalize the economy has not been fast enough to suit the imf as zimbabwe has missed hitting some imf set targets a meeting will be held in washington dc later this month to determine the way forward a standard aim of neoliberal economic policy is to shift costs from the wealthy onto working people following that prescription zimbabwe has raised fuel costs until the nation now has the world s highest priced gasoline in a further blow to a population reeling from the impact of hyperinflation caused by mnangagwa s misconceived launch of a new currency the government boosted the average tariff on electricity by 320 worse yet the zimbabwe energy regulatory authority announced that the tax would be indexed to the u s dollar given the rapidly declining value of zimbabwe s dollar relative to the u s dollar in real terms the increase is far larger for the average person receiving pay in local currency meanwhile this year s budget reduces the corporate tax rate to less than 25 western corporations investing in zimbabwe s special economic zones can enjoy zero tax for the first five years followed by 15 after that they are also granted an allowance of 50 of costs in the first year and 25 for the next two years as well as an array of other benefits contrast that with the tax on individuals there is a value added tax rate of 14 5 which by its nature disproportionally impacts working people personal income over us 3 601 is taxed at 25 topping the corporate rate anything earned above us 12 001 is taxed at 30 and so on in steps reaching to the maximum 40 mnangagwa s transitional stabilization program is still in its early stages but already the harm that it has caused is such that one can say it would be more accurate to preface the word stabilization with de or as minister ncube rather revealingly put it zimbabwe is easily the biggest buy in africa right now whether the zimbabwean people are quite as keen on selling out their country is another matter dismantling land reform in slow motion fast track land reform in zimbabwe was an ambitious program that counteracted many of the inequities inherited from the periods of colonial and apartheid rule the program retains considerable popularity which has the effect of blocking mnangagwa from launching a frontal attack against it however the program is vulnerable to being chipped away through indirect means historically reliance on private financing in zimbabwe has disadvantaged farmers who raise crops for domestic consumption as banks preferred to support export oriented operations small farm holders have not always had access to the inputs they needed to achieve full productivity because private contract farming focused mainly on the export market the government of zimbabwe stepped in and established its command agriculture program in 2016 as a state run project to provide much needed inputs and a ready market for farmers producing crops oriented for domestic consumption command agriculture prioritized the needs of farmers and the nation over banking and western interests as four prominent agricultural specialists concluded in an analysis published by agrarian south command agriculture has been a direct challenge to world bank policy recommendations and western think tanks which see no role for the state in agricultural financing and marketing save for the provision of infrastructural development the success of farming operations is highly dependent on the provision of sufficient and timely inputs although western sanctions hampered the government it provided much needed inputs albeit in varying quantities and with inadequate supply of inputs and late input distribution nevertheless this was a decided improvement over the lack of support from private contract farming command agriculture also provided a ready market for the maize favorable prices and much needed extension services the agrarian south report added based on observation in the zvimba district because agriculture is a crucial pillar in zimbabwe s economy it is a prime target for neoliberal transformation indeed land issues have been at the forefront of western hostility mnangagwa hungers for western approval but he cannot win that until he he demonstrates progress in undoing land reform to a noticeable extent and in liberalizing the agricultural sector a joint review by the world bank and zimbabwean government officials identifies agriculture as a top priority under the transitional stabilization program under mnangagwa s direction command agriculture has been rechristened as smart agriculture and financing is being shifted from the government back to the same banks that had consistently proved recalcitrant in engaging with domestically oriented farming operations one will not hear this from mnangagwa s officials but command agriculture showed immediate and positive results and maize production jumped by 321 in the 2016 2017 season by comparison production languished for those commercial grain crops that had not been covered by command agriculture support as a result of the support given to farmers the area planted in maize exceeded that of any time in the previous ten years and yields were also high surpassing the national maize requirements for the first time in many years the world bank concedes that the government s agricultural support notably the special maize program did support agricultural production without such programs output and thus revenue would have declined but adds that it is difficult to disentangle the impact of government support from the effects of the rebound from the drought certainly improving weather that season was a factor but given that non supported grain crops fared far worse during the same planting season points to the efficacy of command agriculture no matter the results command agriculture had to go the joint world bank zimbabwe government report complains that continued pressure from command agriculture on public spending makes restoring macroeconomic stability difficult thus making it a prime target for budget cutting to no one s surprise the report advocates reforming the program and reducing its cost the stabilization program calls for agricultural growth that is premised on performance of cash crops such as tobacco cotton sugar cane and soya beans aimed at the export market this goal dovetails with the program s call for greater involvement of the domestic financial system in underpinning financing of agriculture under mnangagwa the government s role will be withdrawn while private sector support gathers momentum tradable new leases are replacing zimbabwe s system of 99 year land leases that systemic change is in line with the recommendation of the world bank zimbabwe report which asserts zimbabwe should aspire to a well functioning commercial agriculture sector that should be able to finance most of its working capital and capital expenditure needs through lines of credit with banks according to minister of lands agriculture water and rural resettlement perrance shiri previously we used not to allow joint ventures but we have relaxed the law and our people are now free to borrow using land people will also be free to lose land now that it is to be used as collateral in commercial loans or subjected to unequal economic relationships in joint ventures the inevitable outcome of this policy change will be to consolidate land into fewer and more economically advantaged hands in an assessment by zimcodd the shift to commercialization of agriculture through shrinking of agricultural subsidies is a purely neo liberal ideology that will disadvantage small farm holders giving room for private sector support is a way of privatizing the agricultural sector a move that threatens food security for the nation the baleful impact on the agricultural sector is a factor that shiri elides in his celebration of the commercialization of land the sam moyo african institute for agrarian studies warns that contract farming and joint ventures spearheaded by private capital have the potential of undermining the peasantry base through land alienation in some cases labor exploitation and unequal exchange of surplus value which occurs through input and output markets there is historical precedent and the institute points to the example of mozambique where a majority of peasants lost their land when they entered into asymmetrical relationships with domestic and foreign agrarian capital in sugar cane farming for peasants property loss through market effects happens through mechanisms of distress sales economic recession bad harvest illness or death in the family or calamity and through mortgage default markets provide an unequal playing surface favoring strong market actors that is those with the capital know how and information to protect and expand their property rights and to buffer themselves against risk over time more and more land is transferred to capital rich actors zimbabwe s agricultural sector must cope with two serious challenges western sanctions remain in place aimed at depriving the nation of access to financial resources worse yet the southern africa region is expected to be among the hardest hit by climate change nothing can alter the fact that the extent and quality of arable land in zimbabwe will steadily decline in the years ahead already drought has struck zimbabwe for two years running and the current one is the worst in nearly forty years grain reserves are nearly depleted and the world food program classifies half of zimbabwe s population as food insecure neither of those is the key issue according to the transitional stabilization program which blames the decrease in agricultural productivity on declining investment and lack of know how among others the solution as mnangagwa s government sees lies in embracing former displaced white farmers to form joint venture partnerships with the beneficiary a1 and a2 farmers acting as anchor farmers to other beneficiaries white farmers will it is claimed ensure increased production on the farms never mind the parlous impact of sanctions or climate change according to the tsp bringing back wealthy white farmers will turn around production and where are these anchor farms to be formed minister perrance shiri says the time will come when the government may really consider taking back all underutilized land and allocate it to other potential users mnangagwa is already defining underutilized in a politically expedient way targeting individuals who had opposed his scheming and were therefore forced to flee the country after the military coup even though some of their farms continue to be fully operational it does not require much imagination to anticipate how anchor farms may be established first specific tracts of land are identified then excuses will be sought to define that land as underutilized small farm holders dealing with the impact of drought or facing temporary economic challenges may have their land handed over to returning wealthy white farmers astonishingly the transitional stabilization program argues that the new dispensation will also tap into the vast agricultural knowledge skills experience and farming competencies that are inherent in the operations of most of those former farmers who lost farms and are currently without access to land thereby ensuring the revival of the agricultural sector note the usage of the word inherent in the above quotation such language embraces the insulting and misleading western narrative that white large farm owners are uniquely knowledgeable capable and efficient while black farmers inherently lack ability this concept is problematic on so many levels for one thing it confuses wealth and privilege with ability it also discounts the disparity in wealth imposed by colonialism and apartheid two decades have passed since fast track land reform surely resettled black farmers have learned a thing or two in all that time moreover many of them had previously managed farms in the arid communal areas so their experience extends even further back reestablishing extreme economic disparity in the agricultural sector is not a solution to productivity nor do black farmers need wealthy white farmers to advise them on what they already know from long experience basing agricultural policy on demeaning mythology can only have a damaging effect what is needed is to provide farmers with the support they need to do the job they are quite capable of doing that is precisely what command agriculture is designed to do field studies by experts such as sam moyo ian scoones and others have shown how productive resettled farmers have been when supplied with adequate inputs and in many cases even when not command agriculture should be expanded to enhance reliability and timeliness in the provision of inputs an ambitious government supported program to broaden water access and extend irrigation infrastructure would help to counteract the effects of climate change none of that fits with the free market mentality instead mnangagwa is eliminating command agriculture and commercializing production mnangagwa s vision as he puts it is that critically we must be a destination where capital feels safe to come and to do so we had to introduce various economic measures to attract global capital into our jurisdiction if only he had a care for the economic safety of the zimbabwean people western leaders demand nothing less than total subjugation and while mnangagwa has made significant strides in that direction more is expected from him western capital is waiting for further concessions responding to such concerns mnangagwa assured western diplomats that he would accelerate neoliberal reforms in what can only portend more hardship for the zimbabwean people he added that this year elaborate plans will be implemented to achieve our key objectives the main opposition party the movement for democratic change offers no alternative as mnangagwa has mostly adopted its neoliberal program at any rate it may be difficult to dislodge president emmerson mnangagwa and vice president constantino chiwenga the former general who led the military coup that brought them both to power one doesn t seize political power through military violence only to willingly relinquish it sadly as long as zimbabwe remains in the hands of self serving usurpers the nation can only look forward to a protracted period of economic dislocation notes 1

dollar gains from european pains as u s election threatens an otherwise rosy outlook usd gains from eur s economic funding currency pains but also advances on the jpy chf and sek wednesday recovering risk appetite argues for more usd gains ahead as democratic party primary process gets going in earnest possible bernie sanders nomination blots usd s copy book image adobe images gbp usd spot rate 1

for european rivals but an otherwise rosy outlook is increasingly at risk of a political upset as the democratic party primary election gets going in earnest investors were clearly in an upbeat mood wednesday with many stock markets across the globe gaining nearly a full percentage point while oil price rose close to three percent as fears over the global economic impact of coronavirus ebbed further after the number of new confirmed cases in china declined again that saw the dollar gain over the safe haven japanese yen and swiss franc while ceding ground to most other rivals including the pound as well as canadian australian and new zealand dollars above u s dollar performance against major rivals wednesday the greenback also rose against the swedish krona the second smallest dollar index constituent although the lion s share of gains in u s currency benchmark were attributable to steep intraday declines in the euro to dollar rate the euro which accounts for 57 of the ice dollar index was down 0 37 at 1 0879 against the greenback in late noon trading on wednesday europe s single currency was left bleeding early in the wednesday session by eurostat figures that revealed a surprise 21 decline in eurozone industrial production for december confirming the continent s mighty factory sector continued to shrink into year end that data follows other figures that showed both french and italian economies contracting in the final quarter and comes just days ahead of germany s latest economic growth figures it has called into question the ecb s recent optimism that the euro zone economy was beginning to stabilize and downside risks were easing says lee hardman a currency analyst at mufg persistently weak growth will keep pressure on the ecb to deliver further easing posing downside risks for the euro which is already weakening in anticipation of potential policy action above dollar index shown alongside euro to dollar rate at 15 minute intervals incoming data is painting a bleak picture of the eurozone economy leading some in the market to suggest the european central bank ecb could be forced to cut its already deeply negative deposit rate even further below zero in the months ahead in the hope of reviving the bloc s economic pulse although the euro may also have suffered wednesday from the funding currency status afforded to it as a result of the ecb s uber low interest rates the euro s widespread use in europe makes it one of the largest and most liquid currencies on the market while the ecb s low rates make it super cheap for investors to borrow and in recent years the combination of those things has meant that when investors are in an upbeat mood they tend to borrow and then sell euros in order to fund bets on higher yielding assets further afield and that can result in the euro to dollar rate falling as global stock markets commodities and emerging market currencies rise the market enters the day on a hopeful stance once again as riskier currencies across em and in the g10 smalls are bid says john hardy head of fx strategy at saxo bank safe haven yields are higher and have taken the yen down a notch but nothing is breaking just yet and the euro still looks very heavy here above dollar index shown alongside euro to dollar rate at daily intervals the above relationship means the dollar index can post meaningful intraday gains even when the greenback has fallen relative to the pound canadian dollar and other risk currencies that typically rise when investors are feeling more optimistic or simply less pessimistic about the global economic outlook that s exactly what happened on wednesday although some observers are warning that the party in dollar exchange rates could now be at risk from the democratic party primary election process the party process for determining its presidential candidate for november s election got going in earnest this month with members voting in primary contests in the states of iowa and new hampshire washington stalwart joe biden fared poorly in both races while the centre ground candidate pete buttigieg surprised on the upside in each only to be pipped at the post by the runner up for 2016 s nomination bernie sanders sanders is a socialist who s put medicare for all a green new deal college for all and workplace democracy at the heart of his election campaign his ongoing popularity with democratic party voters is the only thing blotting an otherwise rosy copy book for the dollar bernie sanders win in the new hampshire primary has cemented his position as the front runner says jonas goltermann of capital economics although many observers believe that his policies which could have a detrimental effect on the stock market will ultimately prove too radical to appeal to mainstream voters we think that it would be unwise to dismiss his chances too quickly above dollar index shown alongside usd jpy rate at daily intervals much like with his british counterpart jeremy corbyn who led the labour party to its worst post war election defeat in december last year sanders ideology is arguably the antithesis of the current free marketeering and capitalist order but markets are yet to really take note of his ascendant candidacy financial markets have barely batted an eyelid at sanders performance in the iowa and new hampshire in part because conventional thinking is that he d have little chance of being elected in a race against the incumbent president donald trump who in spite of all his controversies is the bookmakers favourite to win capital economics is just the latest in a growing line of observers to warn investors that they could be being complacent capital economics says stock markets would suffer from sanders pledges to raise taxes lift minimum wages and to break up large banks as well as technology firms and if u s stock markets were to be dealt a blow by a sanders election win then the dollar could face losses against the yen swiss franc and euro as a minimum a similar argument was made four years ago to dismiss trump s chances of winning first the republican nomination and then the presidency itself goltermann says the upshot is that although there is still a long way still to go the pivotal super tuesday primaries are three weeks away and even then only about 40 of votes will have been cast sanders looks to have the best chance of getting his name on the ballot in november if he does markets will eventually have to start pricing in a decent chance that he wins above dollar index shown at weekly intervals
fiscal policy is having a growing impact on currency movements debt has become a non issue for policymakers in most jurisdictions central banks have limited impact amid diminishing ammunition for the time being more debt more value currencies are moving not on higher interest rates but rather in response to growing government liabilities investors are buying up currencies of governments that spend while disregarding debt while piling obligations may come home to roost that is unlikely to happen anytime soon uk paving a road not fixing the roof the latest reshuffle rally in the pound proves the point but is only the latest case prime minister boris johnson forced out his fiscally prudent chancellor of the exchequer sajid javid with lesser known rishi sunak in what is seen as a power grab the new team is on course to loosen the purse strings abandoning deficit and debt rules set by javid and pushing infrastructure spending how did markets respond after several minutes of shock from the resignation of a reputable minister sterling rallied on prospects of more spending the has a dual positive effect on the currency gbp usd reshuffle rally first it is set to boost the economy through both the potential public splurge and by creating confidence that may encourage private sector spending the underlying currency has room to rise alongside stronger growth secondly it alleviates pressure from the bank of england to provide additional monetary accommodation even if inflation fails to rise the boe will be under no pressure an in no rush to cut interest rates or expand its bond buying scheme higher rates also underpin the pound austerity enacted by former pm david cameron and his chancellor george osborne seems to belong to a different era the previous pair at downing street aimed to fix the roof while the sun is shining while johnson wants to get things done brexit trains anything regardless of costs dollar cheers ballooning us debt in the us concerns about the deficit and the debt seem to belong to the past republicans who blasted then president barrack obama for growing america s liabilities after the debt crisis are now overseeing a ballooning national debt the mix of spending increases supported by democrats and president donald trump s massive tax cuts are taking their toll the us budget deficit has jumped by 389 2 billion in the first four months of fiscal 2020 october 2019 through january 2020 that is an increase of 25 from the first third of fiscal 2019 on a 12 month basis the gap between income and expenses topped 1 trillion with total american debt topping 23 billion the debt to gdp ratio has topped 100 and continues rising while the economy is nearing full employment contrary to the perceived wisdom of saving money when the economy is high and similar to the pound the us dollar is on the rise the greenback is hit multi month highs against the yen multi year lows against the euro and decade peaks against the australian dollar usd jpy since september 2019 rising with us debt euro falls as german schuld weighs the opposite case is in the old continent as mentioned earlier the euro has fallen to 34 month lows against the dollar and is struggling across the board germany the eurozone s locomotive has ground to an economic halt and refuses to change its constitutional brake on deficit spending berlin s reluctance comes despite crumbling roads its famous autobahns are not up to speed and low borrowing costs years of austerity and the european central bank s bond buying schemes have pushed german yields to the negative territory investors are paying the country to take their money why the ghosts of the past are weighing on policymakers back in 1923 the young weimar republic suffered from hyperinflation due to war reparations and the consequent french occupation of its industrial ruhr valley scenes of people carrying wheelbarrows of worthless cash are seen as contributing to the rise of the nazi regime moreover the german word schuld means both debt and guilt citizens of this wealthy nation are used to save not borrow to spend chancellor angela merkel s current grand coalition has stuck with the schwarze null black zero surplus policy despite installing a center left finance minister as the largest and most prominent member in the eu berlin s way of thinking has shaped brussels policy as well the fall in the exchange rate of the euro has failed to boost exports enough to compensate for the absence of inward investment will germany change and lift the euro at the time of writing the lack of an heir to merkel means political change may take longer but new forces inside and outside the country may make a change at some point see the optimist s guide to the old continent why germany will change and how eur usd may surge in the meantime eur usd is at near three year lows governments vs central banks the importance of fiscal spending is rising as central banks ammunition is running low the ecb s deposit rate is at 0 50 deep in negative territory the boe s interest rate is at 0 75 and the federal reserve stands out with 1 75 still well below pre crisis levels should traders write off central banks not so fast as the examples above show public spending has a growing impact but central banks may still move markets first and foremost fiscal spending is amplified by reduced stimulus from rate setters and that is what eventually moves currencies moreover central bankers still have some tools in the shed all three institutions mentioned above can restart or expand their bond buying or quantitative easing schemes corporate bonds and even stocks may come into play finally if government spending goes into overdrive elusive inflation might show up triggering rate hikes and a greater role for monetary policy down the road central banks have gone from being puzzled with the dearth of inflation to being resigned to lowflation as a fact of life however nothing lasts forever conclusion fiscal policy will probably have a growing impact on currencies in the medium term and indebted governments currencies are likely to be rewarded with higher valuations central banks impact is diminishing amid low rates but they still have influence and may return to battling inflation in the longer term

3 million the adoption of ifrs 16 leases at the beginning of 2019 has an impact on the comparability of aspo s key figures and financial statements calculations furthermore the administrative court s decision issued in april 2019 to reduce the tax increase imposed on telko in 2015 increased the financial income in particular and improved the earnings per share by eur 0 05 figures for 2018 include an impairment loss of eur 4 8 million recognized on kauko s goodwill in december the impact of the impairment loss on earnings per share in 2018 was approximately eur 0 16 october december 2019 aspo s net sales decreased and were eur 147 0 156 6 million operating profit increased and was eur 5 4 2 6 million profit for the period increased and stood at eur 3 7 0 8 million earnings per share increased to eur 0 10 0 02 the operating profit of esl shipping was eur 4 4 4 2 million leipurin eur 1 1 0 8 million and telko eur 0 9 1 0 million net cash from operating activities was eur 18 9 12 7 million proposal of the board of directors for the payment of dividends the board of directors proposes that eur 0 45 0 44 per share is distributed in dividends for the 2019 financial year and that the dividend is paid in two installments furthermore the board of directors proposes that the first installment of eur 0 22 per share is paid in april and the second installment of eur 0 23 per share is paid in november more information about the proposed payment of dividends is available under dividend proposal aspo s guidance for 2020 aspo s operating profit in 2020 will be higher than in 2019 eur 21 1 million general outlook for 2020 general political uncertainty in the markets remains high the increase in industrial production is expected to continue to slow down or turn to a decrease in the main market areas of aspo s business operations raw material prices are expected to remain at the current level the national economy and industrial production are growing moderately in russia an important market area for aspo while international sanctions and their possible increase maintain uncertainties regarding the development of the economy in russia and other cis countries general political risks are still on a high level and this may have rapid effects on the operating environment or decrease free trade also affecting the operating conditions of customers of aspo s businesses economic conditions are expected to remain unchanged in aspo s businesses even though there is a risk of rapid change key figures aki ojanen ceo of aspo group comments on full year 2019 and the fourth quarter our expectations for 2019 were exceptionally high in terms of increase in both net sales and operating profit as the year went on we were however forced to lower our guidance due to operational challenges faced by telko and weakening market conditions in esl shipping s business in 2019 our net sales were at a record high of eur 588 million and our operating profit improved slightly to eur 21 1 million net cash from operating activities developed very positively reaching a new record of eur 52 5 million in 2019 of which the positive effect of the adoption of the ifrs 16 standard was approximately eur 14 million strong net cash from operating activities is in a key position in increasing our distributed dividends reducing our indebtedness and carrying out future investments aspo s businesses have analyzed the external and internal factors that have slowed the increase in our operating profit and corrective actions have been taken we believe that these corrections help us to increase our results to the level enabled by aspo s current structure in 2019 unexpected industrial stoppages and lower transportation volumes in the steel industry in particular had a negative impact on the profitability of our shipping company s operations and on aspo s total results on the other hand positive factors were the development of the results of atob c a shipping company acquired in sweden particularly during the final quarter i am also very satisfied with the operational efficiency and low energy consumption of our lng fueled vessels unfortunately other shipping company operations suffered from the exceptionally steep decline in transportation volumes in the steel and energy industries due to which part of the fleet was kept at port during the final quarter considering how challenging the market situation was esl shipping s operating profit for the final quarter can be regarded as a good achievement telko reached an unusually low operating profit during the final quarter this was primarily a result of the actions taken by the company s new management that aim to improve the efficiency of the working capital by optimizing the stock levels and to reduce price and currency risks the aim of these actions is to ensure that telko s profitability improves in 2020 leipurin s operations developed positively during the final quarter of 2019 the net sales and profitability of bakery operations improved with development being particularly strong in eastern markets as bakery operations continued to grow and the operating profit rate of entire leipurin business in eastern markets climbed over 11 although 2019 did not meet our expectations in terms of operating profit i firmly believe in aspo s long term profitability and the effectiveness of our strategy major investments have been made in recent years and in the near future we will focus on improving our profitability in all our business operations aspo group net sales net sales by segment aspo has changed its segment reporting so that kauko is reported as part of the telko segment starting from january 1 2019 there are no considerable inter segment net sales net sales by market area esl shipping s acquisition of atob c in 2018 increased net sales especially in scandinavia and finland finland has become aspo s largest market area net sales in the market area of russia other cis countries and ukraine decreased in all business segments during the final quarter of 2019 this decrease in net sales resulted particularly from the decrease in the general price level of telko s products which was also reflected in lower net sales in finland in 2019 the full year net sales in eastern markets remained at the comparative period s level earnings operating profit by segment aspo has changed its segment reporting so that kauko is reported as part of the telko segment starting from january 1 2019 figures for 2018 include an impairment loss of eur 4 8 million recognized on kauko s goodwill in december the adoption of ifrs 16 leases on january 1 2019 improved the group s operating profit as for example the proportion of interest previously recognized in lease expenses is now recognized in financial items earnings per share in january december 2019 earnings per share were eur 0 47 0 42 equity per share was eur 3 92 3 75 the administrative court s decision issued on april 2 2019 to reduce the eur 1 7 million tax increase imposed on telko in 2015 to approximately eur 60 000 improved earnings per share in 2019 by approximately eur 0 05 figures for 2018 include an impairment loss recognized on kauko s goodwill which reduced earnings per share by approximately eur 0 16 financial targets aspo s objective is to reach an operating profit of 6 average return on equity of over 20 and gearing of up to 130 with its current structure aspo aims to reach these financial targets in 2023 following the adoption of ifrs 16 aspo changed its long term financial target for the gearing ratio to up to 130 on april 29 2019 aspo s earlier financial target for gearing was up to 100 the target for the operating profit was changed in at the aspo capital markets day in november 2019 aspo s previous target was an operating profit of 7 the changed target is based on the operating model of atob c a shipping company acquired by esl shipping in 2018 through which a large part of esl shipping s fleet is leased and not owned the higher percentage of leased vessels reduces esl shipping s operating profit rate the operating profit rate for january december 2019 was 3 6 3 8 return on equity was 13 5 12 4 and gearing was 162 2 154 4 the comparability of gearing is affected by the adoption of ifrs 16 leases referred to above as it increased the company s gearing by some 30 percentage points at the date of transition outlook for 2020 global economic growth is expected to continue to slow down economic growth in russia and in the entire eastern market area will continue but on a more moderate level political risks and international sanctions imposed on russia have maintained risk levels in the market area which is why it remains challenging to forecast future development the risk of increasing obstacles to international free trade has increased or remained and negative development may also be rapid which may affect the international freight rates customer companies aspo s principals or the operating prerequisites of aspo s businesses growth in finnish export volumes has decelerated in addition the labor market situation has become more unstable in finland the increase in industrial production is expected to slow down in the main market areas of aspo s businesses in northern europe economic conditions will remain unchanged in aspo s businesses although there is a risk of rapid changes the prices of production raw materials important to aspo have decreased in general prices are expected to remain low or increase in 2020 dry bulk freight rates in sea transportation important to esl shipping fell steeply at the beginning of 2020 and it is difficult to forecast future price development aspo s business operations esl shipping esl shipping is the leading dry bulk cargo company in the baltic sea region at the end of the review period the shipping company s fleet consisted of 51 vessels with a total capacity of 468 000 dwt of the vessels 24 are wholly owned 75 of the fleet two are minority owned 2 and the remaining 24 are time chartered 23 esl shipping s competitive edge is based on its ability to secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year round even in difficult weather conditions the shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service operating profit for 2018 includes eur 0 9 million in transaction costs related to the acquisition made in august esl shipping s operating profit during the fourth quarter increased to eur 4 4 4 2 million regardless of the unusually steep decline in transportation volumes in the steel industry and strikes that hindered operations during the final quarter net sales decreased by 2 from the comparative period and stood at eur 45 3 46 4 million the operating profit rate during the quarter improved to 9 7 9 1 the shipping company s cost efficiency improved from the comparative period particularly regarding the technical maintenance of vessels and operating personnel during the final quarter the cargo volume carried by esl shipping decreased slightly to 4 0 4 5 million tonnes in addition to the steel industry transportation volumes also decreased in the energy industry from the comparative period during the final quarter the shipping company s vessels primarily operated in contract traffic in the baltic sea and in northern europe and also performed loading and unloading operations at sea due to the difficult market situation in the steel industry one of the two pusher systems was exceptionally kept at port in december supramax vessels operated in the canadian arctic and afterwards in international traffic the results of these vessels were poor reducing the shipping company s relative profitability general international dry bulk freight rates decreased considerably in the largest vessel categories towards the end of the review period esl shipping s operations in the baltic sea and the north sea are primarily based on long term customer agreements and established customer relationships as contractual transportation volumes were significantly lower than what was previously estimated for the quarter the shipping company s vessels were forced to operate more than expected in weaker spot markets in the larger vessel category of more than 10 000 dwt operations succeeded fairly well considering the low volumes during the quarter the operating profit level was also as expected in the smaller vessel category of less than 10 000 dwt loading and unloading operations for large ocean liners at sea were much busier during the quarter than during the comparative period the energy efficiency of the new lng fueled vessels improved the operating profit during the final quarter together with the good results of atob c which developed positively from the comparative period and meet the expectations set for the business acquisition the ending customer agreements of atob c were renewed and contract traffic was expanded particularly in industrial markets in sweden in the vessel categories of atob c raw material and product transportation volumes in the forest industry were as planned during the fourth quarter raw mineral and fertilizer transportation volumes developed positively from the comparative period in the smaller vessel category balance improved in contract traffic the cranes of the new lng fueled vessels have operated normally the deployment of crane automation has been delayed significantly due to previous extensive warranty repairs in 2019 esl shipping purchased m s alppila in accordance with the terms and conditions of the leasing agreement signed in 2011 the transfer of the vessel under esl shipping s ownership improves the company s profitability the net sales of esl shipping in january december increased from the previous year by 46 to eur 175 0 120 1 million primarily as a result of the acquisition of atob c the weak first half of the year and the difficult market climate in the steel industry during the last part of the year reduced the operating profit by 3 to eur 14 6 15 1 million in 2019 the cargo volume carried by esl shipping amounted to 15 9 13 4 million tonnes esl shipping has taken steps to restructure its swedish shipping companies into a single company as a result the operations of atob c switched to the swedish tonnage tax system from the beginning of 2020 outlook for esl shipping for 2020 the global market prices of dry bulk cargo at the beginning of 2020 were as low as at the beginning of the comparative period stricter global sulfur regulations on ship fuels entered into force at the beginning of the year potentially leading to higher fluctuations in price levels and occasional shortages in the availability of fuel that is compliant with the new regulations however vessels equipped with a sulfur scrubber can continue to use high sulfur fuel the final determination of differences in prices of different fuels may have a particular impact on the competitiveness and profitability of the shipping company s supramax vessels which primarily operate over longer distances high fluctuations in prices may have a short term impact on profitability even though the fuel price risk is controlled profitability through fuel clauses in transportation agreements all esl shipping s vessels are fueled by environmentally friendly low sulfur oil or nearly sulfur free liquefied natural gas which significantly reduces carbon dioxide emissions economic growth is slow in the shipping company s primary market areas however the general outlook for industrial sectors important to esl shipping has brightened from the situation at the end of last year and previous restrictions in industrial production have been dissolved most of the shipping company s transportation capacity has been secured in the baltic sea and northern europe through long term agreements production in the steel industry in northern europe is expected to settle at a satisfactory level and estimated transportation volume for 2020 is higher than the realized volume of 2019 the general transportation volume estimates of contractual partners are at a satisfactory level in the most important customer segments transportation volumes in the energy industry will most likely decrease as a result of the exceptionally warm weather in northern europe the transportation of iron pellets from russia to central europe via finland using esl shipping s vessels has restarted markets continue to show signs of general uncertainty in demand and price levels however positive or negative measures directed at international free trade and increasing political risks have an impact on global material flows the general development of cargo markets in 2020 will have the highest impact on the financial performance of the shipping company s largest supramax vessels the cargo volumes of large vessels returned to a historically low level at the beginning of 2020 during spring finland may face large scale strikes that may have a significant impact on the operations of esl shipping s customer companies and their supply chains these potential strikes may also affect the availability of ship fuels in finland demand for loading and unloading operations for large ocean liners at sea a segment important to the shipping company is expected to remain at least satisfactory contractual transportation volumes in the shipping company s smaller vessel category are expected to be good and contractual coverage is expected to be better than in the previous year in the smaller vessel category the price level of renewed and new time chartering agreements is lower than last year overall which improves the shipping company s profitability esl shipping is actively investigating different opportunities to have a broader presence in growing markets in the russian arctic the shipping company will also continue its development activities to offer the most effective and environmentally friendliest future transportation solutions in the markets as well as in the smaller vessel category of atob c at the same time esl shipping is investigating opportunities to use different new solutions related to the ownership and financing of vessels used broadly in international shipping company operations to speed up its operational development esl shipping has improved the efficiency of its operations by deploying a new erp system the new system covers all vessel operations and combines cargo operations in finland and sweden into a single data system the shipping company will strengthen its sales resources to reach its strategic goals and has appointed a new commercial director who will take over the post at the beginning of march in 2020 three larger vessel units will be docked as planned during the second quarter and one of the two pusher systems will be docked completely during the third quarter at least two smaller vessels will be docked during the third quarter during these scheduled dockages new ballast water treatment systems that meet new environmental regulations will be installed in the vessels the pusher unit kept at port returned to operations during january leipurin leipurin provides solutions particularly for bakery customers

machinery supply partners leipurin operates in finland russia the baltic countries ukraine kazakhstan and belarus leipurin s operating profit during the fourth quarter improved from the comparative period by 38 to eur 1 1 0 8 million the operating profit increased as a result of the improved efficiency of operative functions in the bakery business and profitable growth in eastern markets the machinery business produced a loss and fell considerably short of the comparative period s operating profit during the final quarter the machinery business was restructured and the efficiency of functions was improved to lower fixed costs the net sales of leipurin increased from the comparative period to eur 31 9 31 6 million the operating profit rate during the fourth quarter was 3 4 2 5 net sales in the market area of russia other cis countries and ukraine decreased by approximately 6 to eur 11 1 11 8 million due to poor machinery sales while the operating profit rate improved to approximately 11 10 the net sales of the bakery business comprising more than 80 of leipurin s total net sales increased slightly during the fourth quarter and operating profit improved significantly as a result of actions taken to improve efficiency and the development of the supply chain in eastern markets the net sales of the bakery business grew by 6 in the fourth quarter amounting to eur 9 6 9 1 million growth was particularly brisk in ukraine and belarus the operating profit rate of the bakery business in the market area of russia other cis countries and ukraine was approximately 12 9 in western markets the net sales of the bakery business decreased as a result of the discontinued operations in poland whereas profitability increased considerably from the comparative period through improved operational efficiency net sales increased particularly in lithuania and estonia in finland net sales were at the comparative period s level regardless of the negative impact of bakery customers that discontinued their operations and profitability increased through more effective operating practices during the fourth quarter there were no significant changes in consumer confidence from the comparative period in leipurin s primary market areas in finland food inflation was at the comparative period s level while the food inflation rate decelerated from the comparative period in russia the prices of raw materials important to leipurin showed variation from one raw material group to the next with the variation between different raw material groups being significant regarding the market prices of seasonal products overall market prices were slightly higher than during the comparative period the new foodservice business which has so far been primarily concentrated in finnish markets represented approximately 4 of leipurin s total net sales in the fourth quarter the new baker s story bakery café concept based on a licensing model was launched during the fourth quarter the first baker s story was opened in tampere together with a local bakery entrepreneur and activities to increase business operations continued the machinery business produced a significant loss and fell considerably short of the comparative period s operating profit a strong cyclical nature is typical of the machinery business due to the timing of project deliveries during the fourth quarter the net sales of the machinery business increased by roughly 4 the machinery business was restructured and among others cooperation negotiations were held in leipurin s own machine production as a result of which the employment contracts of six people were terminated furthermore the efficiency of the management structure of the machinery business was simplified the consumer market trends important for leipurin s business opportunities i e the increasing popularity of out of home eating eating snacks and the consumption of pastries continued the market for industrially packed bread continues to decrease in the west whereas the market for in store bakeries and baking units has continued to increase this presents challenges in the operations of industrial and artisanal bakeries in russia the market for in store bakeries and the increased consumption of pastries have evened out while bread consumption is still slowly decreasing and the consumption of less expensive types of bread has increased due to consumers weakened purchasing power leipurin s operating profit in january december decreased to eur 3 0 3 3 million the operating profit of the bakery business increased by approximately eur 1 4 million as a result of the improved operational efficiency and growth in eastern markets while the operating profit of the machinery business decreased by eur 1 6 million from

sustainability aspo believes that socially financially and environmentally sustainable operations comprise a prerequisite for value creation in the long term a responsibly led growing company can create jobs tax revenue and wellbeing aspo group s ceo is in charge of the management of aspo s sustainability the ceo reports to the company s board of directors in accordance with the risk management policy aspo s code of conduct lays down a shared set of rules for sustainable operations in all the group s subsidiaries aspo s board of directors approved the revised code of conduct in december 2019 since 2018 aspo has been a member of the un s global compact initiative now the group s operations are steered by the ten global compact principles related to human rights working life principles the environment and the prevention of corruption in 2019 aspo also became a member of finnish business society fibs and aims to actively develop its sustainability at a group and subsidiary level aspo acts as a good corporate citizen in all of its operating countries being a good corporate citizen is part of social responsibility and means for example that aspo always pays its taxes in the country in which it has made its profit aspo treats its employees and stakeholders in a just and equal manner in all countries where it operates key aspects of corporate responsibility in the fields in which the businesses aspo owns operate are reductions in energy consumption and the volume of waste the wellbeing of employees and safe working conditions equality and good governance aspo s sustainability report will be included in aspo s year 2019 publication risks and risk management decreases in global trade as a result of decelerated growth in the global economy and increased uncertainties in economic development have reduced exports and the investment outlook the decrease in global purchasing manager indices has stopped while the situation continues to deteriorate in key production countries in the eu such as germany these changes have affected industrial production in the eurozone and can be seen in increased risks in aspo s market areas even though finnish exports are showing signs of growth particularly in terms of exports outside the eu despite growing uncertainties economic growth has continued in the eurozone albeit slowly however the continuous while decelerating increase in employment and continuously rising salaries support economic stability in the eurozone political tension and resulting risks have increased but they are not expected to have any impact on aspo s business operations in the short term the trade war between the usa and china including the resulting import duties which limit international free trade and has already decelerated economic growth in china have not directly affected aspo s operations aspo does not have any business operations that are or would also be affected directly by brexit or its implementation but there may be an indirect impact through the principals or customers of aspo s businesses following the financial crisis the global economy has grown simultaneously in all aspo s market areas albeit at different rates in different areas while however being largely slow in speed in the eurozone growth has slowed down due to growing political tension related to trade in addition brexit increases uncertainty the russian gdp increased by roughly 1 and industrial production by approximately 2 meaning that both have increased more slowly as a result of decelerated growth in the global economy the russian ruble has become stronger partly as a result of elevated oil prices russia s foreign exchange reserves and oil assets have increased as the economy has returned to normal in logistics chains the dry bulk freight rates of sea transportation increased steeply during the first half only to turn into a decline at the beginning of september ending up at the april level at the end of the year financial risks in all aspo s businesses are slowly increasing even though the markets are relatively stable however any unexpected changes in international politics and trade policies combined with rapid changes in exchange rates or commodities markets may have an impact on demand for and competitiveness of the products of aspo s businesses in russia increased real salaries and decelerated inflation supported increases in private consumption as there have been no structural economic reforms in russia economic growth is only expected to be moderate primarily resulting from government steered investment projects the price of oil has a significant impact on the russian economy strategic risks political and financial risks have grown globally which may have a rapid impact on aspo s operating environment free trade has already decreased and these changes may also have an impact in the long term the economic and political situation in aspo s market areas may have made it more difficult to make structural changes as part of aspo s strategy the situation may continue unchanged but as the economic and political pressure varies it may change rapidly an unfavorable turn in the situation may lead to aspo being unable to achieve its financial targets in the time it has set for it the russian economy has stabilized and inflation has decelerated while economic growth is slow the long term deterioration in consumption demand has affected trade in general and after a brief upswing the natural increase in purchasing power fluctuated strengthening towards the end of the review period no signs of weakening have been seen in the financial markets and payment transactions of russia but they involve risks that are reflected for example in the russian banking sector the ukrainian economy is still in a weak state and the macroeconomy is showing signs of weakening in nearly all sectors apart from construction inflation has slowed down but is still relatively high the increase in purchasing power combined with a favorable development in salaries has increased consumption demand the central bank s reference rate is still high although it was lowered considerably at the end of the year the promotion of local production has further increased the volume of raw materials and items produced in russia in industrial production despite the decrease in quality this may further reduce the position of imported raw materials in the value chain and lower the margin level but correspondingly an increase in import volumes may increase demand for foreign raw materials and reduce related risks for aspo economic sanctions their increase or other obstacles arising from the economic or political situation in russia may in part reduce transportation volumes originating from russia and the demand for unloading services for large ocean liners at sea protectionist actions may decrease sea transportation in the russian arctic if russia sets stricter regulations on internal transportation for example regarding the transportation of energy products in finland and the rest of europe social pressures to reduce the use of fossil energy sources in energy production are constantly increasing which has already reduced coal transport volumes and will continue to reduce them in the future correspondingly the transport volumes of replacement energy products will increase due to this change it is difficult to estimate future transportation volumes fluctuations in international freight indices their extended low level and the previous global increase in the number of vessels particularly in large size categories have increased uncertainty over the long term profitability of shipping companies strategic risks may be caused by the deterioration of the global economic situation the political atmosphere protectionism and the outlook and production choices of industrial customers decisions regarding energy production structures affected by environmental policy and other political choices cause changes in industry and energy production that will decrease the use of fossil fuels and increase the use of alternative forms of energy the flow of goods in the baltic sea may change as a result of steel production cost structures changes in the customer structure such as centralization or other reasons lower demand for metal products in global markets may cause changes in demand for sea freights in the future as well these changes may have negative consequences on operations as the need for transportation decreases but they can also be seen as significant opportunities as a result of low cargo prices in international shipping competition over cargoes may also become fiercer in the baltic sea mild ice free winters may also increase competition esl shipping received two new low emission vessels with better fuel economy for this region and customer base these will also be able to operate in ice conditions the shipping company also completed an acquisition in 2018 that significantly improved its competitiveness strategic risks are influenced by long term changes in cargo prices the building of new vessels and the removal of others from the markets investment trends and changes in trade structures especially in western markets in eastern markets risks are increased by such factors as political instability social structures or the lack of reaction to the difficulties encountered by business operations the accumulation and discharge of investments may cause long term changes in the competitive situation and customer behavior trade between eastern and western markets may suffer from restrictions on free trade as a result of which there may be a decrease in the sales of goods and services rapid changes in economic structures may cause risks due to changes in the customer or principal structure or technologies and due to unused opportunities that require a quick response changes in demand as a result of various megatrends may cause changes in the product and service ranges of aspo s subsidiaries due to which it may be difficult to replace their current products disruptive changes may be very rapid aspo s strategic risks are evened out by the distribution of business operations over three segments its engagement in business operations in a broad geographical area and its ability to react quickly to changing situations in addition to western markets aspo operates in areas where economic trends or the political atmosphere may turn rapidly positive or negative which could significantly change the prevailing operating conditions operational risks economic uncertainty in aspo s operating environment increased during the review period from the comparative period as a result operational risks have also increased these include risks related to supply chains goods and services and persons selections made by principals regarding their distribution networks may have a positive or negative impact on the representation of aspo s subsidiaries and therefore on their financial results the threat of different kinds of misuse from outside the group has increased further as a result of the development and increased activity of electronic media for a long time the focus of aspo s growth has been on emerging market areas where risks decelerating growth are affected by factors such as exchange rate fluctuations and interest rates the level of and changes in the global market prices of raw materials industrial and commercial investments customer liquidity changes in legislation and import regulations and inactivity bias or corruption among public authorities economic growth and alternatively any decrease in production may have an impact on demand for raw materials political instability makes commercial activities more difficult and if the situation prolongs it may also decelerate the growth of aspo s businesses consumer behavior and confidence are also reflected in risks associated with b to b customers and their risk levels the growth opportunities presented by emerging markets are encouraging interest among competitors in starting or expanding business operations in these areas the challenging emerging markets and their escalated situations have also caused competitors to withdraw from these markets which has created new potential for aspo s businesses and has increased their market shares hedging against exchange rate changes is not possible in all conditions or in particular at all times changes in exchange rates may reduce profit and equity on the balance sheet as a result of translation differences then again changes in exchange rates may also strengthen results and the balance sheet as changes in credit loss risks are diversified across businesses and customers aspo s businesses have not been subjected to any significant credit losses related to their customers even though credit loss risks have increased and provisions are made for them in accordance with principles of ifrs 9 standard the technical products or applications deployed by aspo s businesses may break or malfunction due to which the increase in profit based on these products or applications may slow down or be delayed sales margins may be reduced and financial claims related to deliveries may emerge if aspo s products are not suited for the customers production processes or do not have the correct technical properties operational risks have also increased as a result of cybercrime malware and the increased number of fraud attempts if realized these risks may mean financial losses for aspo aspo has appropriate information security and internal training arrangements but individual cases may occur due to the decentralized structure of operations any deviations in internal processes may result in losses for example in the form of taxes or official fees the quantity and probability of the group s loss risks are regularly assessed bidding processes are arranged for general insurance policies and the amounts insured are regularly updated the amounts insured are sufficient in view of the scope of aspo s operations but insurance companies may restrict the validity of insurance policies as a result of risks increasing for various reasons such as in conflict areas internal control and risk management one of the responsibilities of aspo s audit committee is to monitor the efficiency of the group s internal control internal audits and risk management systems the audit committee monitors the risk management process and instructs necessary measures to prevent strategic risks in particular in accordance with the internal control principles approved by the board of directors risk management is part of aspo s internal control and its task is to ensure the implementation of the group s strategy development of financial results shareholder value dividend payment ability and continuity in business operations the operational management of each business is responsible for risk management the management is responsible for specifying sufficient measures and their implementation and for monitoring and ensuring that the measures are implemented as part of day to day operational management aspo s cfo who reports to the group ceo is in charge of risk management aspo group s financing and financial risk management are

million the depreciation excluding pre ifrs 16 impact was flat yoy whereas in 4q18 the group recorded higher impairments in q4 2019 net financial income and expenses increased mainly due to interest income generated in 4q18 on a deposit made in relation to the mandatory tender offer for gth which was released in summer 2019 financial expenses slightly decreased yoy on a pre ifrs 16 basis primarily due to lower debt levels and a lower cost of debt but have not compensated for the last year interest income leading up to slightly higher net financial expenses yoy pre ifrs 16 income tax

via new digital and financial services total revenue in 4q19 was rub 73 4 billion representing a yoy decrease of 3 3 reflecting a more balanced approach to tariffs focused on reducing customer churn however pressure on our customer base continued and the increased predominance of unlimited tariff plans led to a mobile service revenue decline of 5 9 to rub 55 3 billion mainly reflecting the negative impact of unlimited tariff plans and the decline in our customer base the strong growth in vas excl messaging and revenue from mobile financial services were insufficient to offset the

uzbekistan continued to focus on attracting data customers and benefited from its position as a market leader going forward beeline uzbekistan will focus on reducing churn and maintaining its leadership position total revenue declined by 8 8 yoy to uzs 579 billion primarily driven by the negative impact of introduction of 20 excise tax uzs 106 million partially offset by data monetization activities adjusted for these negative effects the growth would have been approximately 7 8 yoy mobile data traffic increased supported by the continued roll out of high speed data networks increased smartphone penetration and the increased penetration of bundled offerings in the customer base customer base declined to 8 1 million down 10 7 yoy because of higher churn among those customers who have irregular mobile spending ebitda pre ifrs 16 increased by 22 1 to uzs 310 billion driven by good operational performance notwithstanding a slightly negative impact from changes in the tax regime ebitda in 4q18 was negatively impacted by non recurring costs and certain provisions of uzs 22 billion reported ebitda increased by 24 8 to uzs 317 billion capex excluding licenses pre ifrs 16 more

uzbekistan continued to invest in high speed data networks increasing the number of nationwide 3g and 4g sites yoy and further improvements to our high speed data networks will continue to be a priority in 2020 from january 2019 new tax reforms were introduced which aim to simplify taxation in uzbekistan the tax authorities introduced a flat 20 corporate tax rate for mobile operators previously the corporate tax rate depended on the profitability of mobile operators cancelled the revenue tax of 3 2 and introduced an excise tax of 15 over customer charges furthermore the customer tax was reduced to uzs 2 000 in fy 2019 from uzs 4 000 in fy 2018 tax reforms introduced from january 2019 had an approximately 15 negative impact on revenue in fy 2019 while the free cash flow impact was slightly negative due to utilization of deferred tax assets during the year going forward we expect a positive impact on equity free cash flow excluding licenses from 1 october 2019 the excise tax

decline of 1 6 and broadly flat quarter on quarter effective from 31 october 2019 arpce algerian telecommunication regulatory authority decided on the mtr rate changes at dzd 0 67 per minute from 0 95 dzd min creating an asymmetry in the market this change of mtr negatively impacted revenue by dzd 0 3 billion data revenue increased by 41 3 yoy due to higher usage and an increase in 4g data

while data customers increased by 9 7 as a result of simplified product offers and improved network availability total revenue in 4q19 grew by 1 2 yoy supported by mobile service revenue growth of 1 8 yoy to bdt 10 9 billion the revenue increase was mainly driven by a continued improvement in data revenue following enhanced network availability as well as the continued rationalisation of banglalink

smartphone penetration and the increased penetration of bundled offerings in the customer base customer base declined to 8 1 million down 10 7 yoy because of higher churn among those customers who have irregular mobile spending ebitda pre ifrs 16 increased by 22 1 to uzs 310 billion driven by good operational performance notwithstanding a slightly negative impact from changes in the tax regime

uzbekistan continued to invest in high speed data networks increasing the number of nationwide 3g and 4g sites yoy and further improvements to our high speed data networks will continue to be a

company has recorded 30 million including afdc in cwip related to the ioc the company is also working to advance transportation electrification with projects aimed at improving accessibility to electric vehicle charging stations and partnering with local mass transit agencies to transition to a greater use of electric vehicles in june 2019 the legislature enacted senate bill 1044 which establishes oregon s zero emissions vehicle goals in statute at 250 000 vehicle sales by 2025 and 95 of all vehicle sales by 2035 in september 2019 pge filed with the opuc its first transportation electrification plan which considers current and planned activities along with both existing and potential system impacts in relation to the state s carbon reduction goals in 2018 pge filed an energy storage proposal that called for 39 mw of storage to be developed over the next several years at various locations across the grid in august 2018 the opuc issued an order that outlined an agreed approach to the development of five energy storage projects by pge with an expected capital cost of approximately 45 million perform as a business pge focuses on providing reliable clean power to customers at affordable prices while providing a fair return to investors to achieve this goal the company must execute effectively within its regulatory framework and maintain prudent management of key financial regulatory and environmental matters that may affect customer prices and investor returns the following discussion provides detail on several such material matters 32 table of contents general rate case in 2018 pge filed with the opuc a general rate case based on a 2019 test year the filing sought recovery of costs related to better serving customers and building a smarter more resilient system and included the expectation of higher net variable power costs in 2019 in december 2018 the opuc issued an order that when combined with customer credits and the effects of tax reform would result in an overall annual increase in pge s revenues of 9 million effective january 1 2019 in addition the opuc approved a capital structure of 50 debt and 50 equity a return on equity of 9 50 a cost of capital of 7 30 and rate base of 4 75 billion the general rate case filings as well as copies of the orders direct testimony exhibits and stipulations are available on the opuc website at www oregon gov puc power costs pursuant to the aut process pge annually files an estimate of power costs for the following year as approved by the opuc in december 2018 the 2019 grc included a final projected increase in power costs for 2019 and a corresponding increase in annual revenue requirement of 25 million from 2018 levels which was reflected in customer prices effective january 1 2019 the filing for the 2020 aut indicated that power costs are expected to rise in 2020 by 27 million under the pcam for 2019 nvpc was within the limits of the deadband thus no potential refund or collection was recorded the opuc will review the results of the pcam for 2019 during the second half of 2020 with a decision expected in the fourth quarter 2020 portland harbor environmental remediation account phera mechanism the epa has listed pge as one of over one hundred prps related to the remediation of the portland harbor superfund site as of december 31 2019 significant uncertainties still remain concerning the precise boundaries for clean up the assignment of responsibility for clean up costs the final selection of a proposed remedy by the epa and the method of allocation of costs amongst prps it is probable that pge will share in a portion of these costs in a record of decision issued in 2017 the epa outlined its selected remediation plan for clean up of the portland harbor site which had an estimated total cost of 1 7 billion however the company does not currently have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amount or range of its potential costs for investigation or remediation of portland harbor although such costs could be material to pge s financial position the impact of such costs to the company s results of operations is mitigated by the phera mechanism as approved by the opuc the company s environmental recovery mechanism allows the company to defer and recover incurred environmental expenditures related to the portland harbor superfund site through a combination of third party proceeds such as insurance recoveries and customer prices as necessary the mechanism established annual prudency reviews of environmental expenditures and third party proceeds and annual expenditures in excess of 6 million excluding contingent liabilities are subject to an annual earnings test pge s results of operations may be impacted to the extent such expenditures are deemed imprudent by the opuc or disallowed per the prescribed earnings test for further information regarding the phera mechanism see epa investigation of portland harbor in note 19 contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data city of portland audit in 2019 the city of portland the city which is the largest city within pge s service territory completed its audit of pge s and the city s mutual license fees agreement for the 2012 through 2015 periods the preliminary claim by the city is that pge improperly excluded certain items from the calculation of gross revenues which resulted in underpayment of franchise taxes of 7 million including interest and penalties pge believes the city s preliminary findings are not consistent with previous audit conclusions which found that the company appropriately calculated gross revenues in determining franchise fees pge believes it has good standing for maintaining the historical approach to determining license fees and has not recorded a liability for the city s assertion the city has not provided its final letter of determination which is an initial step in an ongoing resolution process capital project deferral in the second quarter of 2018 pge placed into service a new customer information system at a total cost of 152 million in accordance with agreements reached with stakeholders in the company s 33 table of contents 2019 grc the company s capital cost of the asset is included in rate base and customer prices as of january 1 2019 consistent with past regulatory precedent in may 2018 the company submitted an application to the opuc to defer the revenue requirement associated with this new customer information system from the time the system went into service through the end of 2018 as a result pge began deferring its incurred expenses primarily related to depreciation and amortization of the new customer information system once it was placed in service in 2017 the opuc opened docket um 1909 to conduct an investigation of the scope of its authority under oregon law to allow the deferral of costs related to capital investments for later inclusion in customer prices in october 2018 the opuc issued order 18 423 order concluding that the opuc lacks authority under oregon law to allow deferrals of any costs related to capital investments in the order the opuc acknowledged that this decision is contrary to its past limited practice of allowing deferrals related to capital investments and will require adjustments to its regulatory practices the opuc directed its staff to meet with the utilities and stakeholders to address the full implications of this decision and to propose recommendations needed to implement this decision consistent with the opuc s legal authority and the public interest in response to the order pge and other utilities filed a motion for reconsideration and clarification which was denied on april 19 2019 pge and the other utilities filed a petition for judicial review of the opuc order with the oregon court of appeals while procedural steps pursuant to this petition continue pge believes that the costs incurred to date associated with the customer information system were prudently incurred and has not withdrawn its deferral application to recover the revenue requirement of this capital project during 2018 pge deferred a total of 12 million of expenses related to the customer information system however the order has impacted the probability of recovery of deferred expenses and as such the company has recorded a reserve for the full amount of the costs related to the customer information system the reserve was established with an offsetting charge to the results of operations in 2018 any amounts that may ultimately be approved by the opuc in subsequent proceedings would be recognized in earnings in the period of such approval however there is no assurance that such recovery would be granted by the opuc decoupling the decoupling mechanism authorized by the opuc through 2022 is intended to provide for recovery of margin lost as a result of a reduction in electricity sales attributable to energy efficiency customer owned generation and conservation efforts by residential and certain commercial customers the mechanism provides for collection from or refund to customers if weather adjusted use per customer is less or more than that projected in the company s most recent general rate case the company recorded an estimated collection of 14 million attributed to the year ended december 31 2019 which resulted from variances between actual weather adjusted use per customer and that projected in the 2019 grc collections under the decoupling mechanism are subject to an annual limitation of 2 of the applicable tariff schedule for 2019 this limitation would have been in total 27 million for residential and commercial customers now subject to the decoupling mechanism any collection from customers for the 2019 year is expected to occur over a one year period which would begin january 1 2021 the company recorded a deferral for an estimated collection of 2 million during the year ended december 31 2018 as a result of variances from amounts established in the 2018 grc collection for the 2018 year is expected to occur over a one year period which began january 1 2020 storm restoration costs beginning in 2011 the opuc authorized the company to collect 2 million annually from retail customers to cover incremental expenses related to major storm damages and to defer any amount not utilized in the current year under the 2019 grc the annual collection amount increased to 4 million beginning in 2019 due to a series of storm events in the first half of 2017 the company exhausted the storm collection authorized for 2017 consequently pge was exposed to the incremental costs related to such major storm events which totaled 9 million net of the amount collected in 2017 34 table of contents as a result of the additional costs incurred pge filed an application with the opuc requesting authorization to defer incremental storm related restoration costs from the date of the application in the first quarter of 2017 through the end of 2017 in the third quarter of 2019 the opuc issued an order that denied the company s application for deferral although pge had deferred the incremental expense in 2017 an offsetting reserve was also recorded at that time thus the opuc decision had no impact to the company s current results of operations corporate activity tax in 2019 the state enacted hb 3427 which imposes a new gross receipts tax on companies with annual revenues in excess of 1 million and will apply to tax years beginning on or after january 1 2020 the legislation defines that the tax will apply to commercial activities sourced in oregon less a deduction for 35 of the greater of cost inputs or labor costs the resulting amount will be taxed at 0 57 in anticipation of the incremental annual expense as a result of this new tax pge submitted a tariff filing with the opuc in the fourth quarter 2019 to establish a balancing account and provide for an estimated recovery of 7 million in customer prices in 2020 the company expects to revisit the expected tax consequences annually and revise the annual tariff accordingly on january 29 2020 the opuc issued an order approving the tariff and the associated deferral balancing account and automatic adjustment

31 2019 was 214 million or 2 39 per diluted share compared with 212 million or 2 37 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2018 among the factors that led to the 2 million or 1 increase in net income was gross margin which increased 89 million primarily due to a 132 million increase in revenues driven by higher retail prices as a result of the 2019 grc and other supplemental tariffs partially offsetting the revenue increase was a 43 million increase in purchased power and fuel expense as a result of a 46 million increase in the cost of purchased power although purchased power volumes were lower due to economic dispatch decisions the resulting savings were diminished by the increased expenses associated with higher utilization of company owned generation largely offsetting the increase in gross margin were operating expense increases of 82 million which included 27 million higher depreciation and amortization expense resulting from capital additions a 13 million increase in distribution expenses due to higher vegetation management and wildfire mitigation efforts 13 million higher labor and benefit expenses a 10 million gain from the cash settlement of carty litigation in 2018 that did not recur and a 10 million increase in income tax expense 2019 compared to 2018 total revenues increased 132 million or 6 6 in 2019 compared with 2018 as a result of the items discussed below total retail revenues increased 100 million or 5 6 in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to the net effect of 66 million as a result of customer price changes in the 2019 grc the aut and the amortization in prices of the decoupling mechanism 23 million that resulted from the 1 2 overall increase in retail energy deliveries consisting of a 0 7 increase in residential deliveries and a 6 7 increase in industrial deliveries partially offset by a 1 5 decrease in commercial deliveries the effects of weather on electricity demand is reflected predominantly in the residential revenue line in the table above the table below shows that 2019 had more heating degree days than 2018 during the heating season although the effect was partially offset by the relative lack of cooling degree days during the summer months in 2019 for further information on customer demand see customers and demand in the overview section of this item 7 and 12 million resulting from the combination of various supplemental tariffs and adjustments the largest of which pertain to the demand response pilot program and a major maintenance expense deferral which was offset in generation transmission and distribution expense total heating degree days in 2019 were slightly above the 15 year average and up considerably from total heating degree days in 2018 total cooling degree days in 2019 exceeded the 15 year average by 6 although were 18 below the 2018 total the following table presents the number of heating and cooling degree days in 2019 and 2018 along with the

risk and administer its current long term wholesale contracts such sales can vary significantly from year to year as a result of economic conditions power and fuel prices hydro and wind availability and customer demand in 2019 an 11 million or 7 increase in wholesale revenues over 2018 resulted from 14 million related to a 9 increase in wholesale sales volume partially offset by 3 million from a 1 decrease in average prices received when the company sold power into the wholesale market other operating revenues increased 21 million or 41 in 2019 from 2018 primarily as a result of an 8 million increase attributable to the sale of excess natural gas not used to fuel the company s generating facilities other contributors to the increase included 4 million related to a customer project that is offset with corresponding expense increases in generation transmission and distribution expense and 3 million as a result of higher revenue 40 table of contents from joint pole usage in addition 6 million of incremental revenues resulted from a combination of late fees transmission resale storm deferrals and a variety of smaller miscellaneous items purchased power and fuel expense includes the cost of power purchased and fuel used to generate electricity to meet pge s retail load requirements as well as the cost of settled electric and natural gas financial contracts in 2019 purchased power and fuel expense increased 43 million or 8 from 2018 which was driven by a 61 million increase that resulted from a higher average variable power cost per mwh offset by a 18 million decrease related to total system load the 61 million increase related to average variable power cost is due to an increase in cost per mwh from 25 31 in 2018 to 26 62 per mwh in 2019 the price increase was driven primarily by a 24 increase in the average variable power cost per mwh for purchased power as the company on average purchased power at higher market prices the average variable cost per mwh for pge generating resources remained relatively flat from 2018 to 2019 although total system load is up 2 from 2018 the 18 million decrease due to total system load was largely due to pge effectively dispatching its lowest cost resources in a challenged market resulting in a 14 increase in energy generated by pge resource in 2019 energy received from biglow canyon and tucannon river decreased 9 from 2018 due to less favorable wind conditions and provided 9 of the company s retail load requirement in 2019 compared with 10 in 2018 as a result of the less favorable hydro conditions in the region for 2019 energy received from pge owned hydroelectric projects in combination with mid columbia projects was 20 below 2018 levels and represented 13 of the company s retail load requirement for 2019 compared with 17 for 2018 the following table presents the actual april to september 2019 and 2018 runoff at particular points of major rivers relevant to pge s hydro resources runoff as a

deschutes river at moody oregon 111 96 actual nvpc which consists of purchased power and fuel expense net of wholesale revenues increased 32 million in 2019 compared with 2018 the increase attributable to changes in purchased power and fuel expense was the result of a 5 increase in the average variable power cost per mwh and a 2 increase in total system load this was partially offset by a 9 increase in the volume of wholesale energy deliveries that were sold on average at 1 lower average price per mwh for 2019 actual nvpc as calculated for regulatory purposes under the pcam was 5 million above the 2019 baseline nvpc in 2018 nvpc was 3 million below the anticipated baseline for further information regarding nvpc see power operations in the overview section of this item 7 generation transmission and distribution expense increased 31 million or 11 in 2019 compared with 2018 the increase was driven by 13 million higher distribution expenses for vegetation management wildfire mitigation and preventative maintenance 6 million higher expenses at the company s generation facilities 3 million higher transmission expenses and 9 million miscellaneous expenses administrative and other expense increased 19 million or 7 in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to 13 million higher overall labor and employee benefit expenses a 10 million benefit from the carty cash settlement that occurred in 2018 that did not recur in 2019 5 million higher costs related to the new customer billing system ongoing support in 2019 and 2018 deferral of costs offset by collection in 2019 6 million miscellaneous expenses offset by an 11 million net year over year impact due to the change in retail customer collection experience following the implementation of the customer information system and 4 million lower legal expenses attributable to the conclusion of the carty litigation depreciation and amortization expense in 2019 increased 27 million or 7 compared with 2018 the increase was primarily driven by a 19 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulting from capital additions an 8 million increase related to net regulatory deferrals and amortization activity which is offset in revenues a 4 million increase due to the new lease standard reflecting the amortization of finance lease right of use assets partially offset by a 4 million increase to non utility aros in 2018 that did not recur in 2019 taxes other than income taxes expense increased 5 million or 4 in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to higher oregon property taxes interest expense increased 4 million or 3 in 2019 compared with 2018 as a 6 million increase was due to the new lease standard reflecting interest associated with finance lease obligations which are offset in revenues net as costs are being recovered in the aut in addition a 1 million increase resulted from higher interest on net regulatory liabilities and a 1 million increase from lower afudc as the result of lower construction work in progress balances a 4 million decrease resulted from the maturity of 300 million and the early redemption of 50 million of fmbs that were replaced with lower rate debt reducing the company s weighted average cost of debt other income net increased 9 million compared to 2018 with the difference due to gains of 5 million related to the non qualified employee benefit trust assets a 2 million curtailment gain recognized in 2019 due to changes in retiree medical plans and 2 million lower pension costs due to changes in actuarial assumptions income tax expense increased 10 million or 59 in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a decrease in ptcs and higher pre tax income 2018 compared to 2017 for a comparison of the company s

with certain public utility districts in the state of washington the company has acquired a percentage of the output of the priest rapids and wanapum hydroelectric projects under an agreement that requires pge to pay its proportionate share of the operating and debt service costs of the projects whether or not they are operable the agreements further provide that should any other purchaser of output default on payments as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency pge would be allocated a pro rata share of both the output and the operating and debt service costs of the defaulting purchaser under an agreement for output of the wells project pge receives a share of the production in return for a fixed payment if any other purchaser of output were to default pge would receive a pro rata portion

system at colstrip steam electric station colstrip montana the aoc as required by the montana department of environmental quality it is currently anticipated that each co owner of colstrip will be required at some future point to post additional financial assurance to support further performance by the operator of closure and remediation actions under the aoc critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the statements the following accounting policies represent those that management believes are particularly important to the consolidated financial statements and that require the use of estimates assumptions and judgments to determine matters that are inherently uncertain regulatory accounting as a rate regulated enterprise pge applies regulatory accounting which includes the recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheets regulatory assets represent probable future revenue associated with certain incurred costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process regulatory accounting is appropriate as long as prices are established or subject to approval by independent third party regulators prices are designed to recover the specific enterprise s cost of service and in view of demand for service it is reasonable to assume that prices set at levels that will recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers amortization of regulatory assets and liabilities is reflected in the statement of income over the period in which they are included in customer prices if future recovery of regulatory assets is not probable pge would expense such items in the period such determination is made further if pge determines that all or a portion of its utility operations no longer meet the criteria for continued application of regulatory accounting the company would be required to write off those regulatory assets and liabilities related to operations that no longer meet requirements for regulatory accounting discontinued application of regulatory accounting would have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position asset retirement obligations pge recognizes aros for legal obligations related to dismantlement and restoration costs associated with the future retirement of tangible long lived assets upon initial recognition of aros that are measurable the probability weighted future cash flows for the associated retirement costs discounted using a credit adjusted risk free rate are recognized as both a liability and as an increase in the capitalized carrying amount of the related long lived assets due to the long lead time involved a market risk premium cannot be determined for inclusion in future cash flows in estimating the liability management must utilize significant judgment and assumptions in determining whether a legal obligation exists to remove assets other estimates may be related to lease provisions ownership agreements licensing issues cost estimates inflation and certain legal requirements changes that may arise over time with regard to these assumptions and determinations can change future amounts recorded for aros capitalized asset retirement costs related to electric utility plant are depreciated over the estimated life of the related asset and included in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of income accretion of the aro liability is classified as a depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of income 46 table of contents accumulated asset retirement removal costs that do not qualify as aros have been reclassified from accumulated depreciation to regulatory liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets contingencies pge has various unresolved legal and regulatory matters about which there is inherent uncertainty with the ultimate outcome contingent upon several factors such contingencies are evaluated using the best information available a loss contingency is accrued and disclosed if material when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated if a range of probable loss is established the minimum amount in the range is accrued unless some other amount within the range appears to be a better estimate if the probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated no accrual is recorded but the loss contingency and the reasons to the effect that it cannot be reasonably estimated are disclosed material loss contingencies are disclosed when it is reasonably possible that an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred established accruals reflect management s assessment of inherent risks credit worthiness and complexities involved in the process there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any particular contingency

risk pipeline utility model continued to deliver strong financial results and we advanced our strategic priorities on many fronts each of our core businesses delivered solid results in 2019 that translated into full year dcf per share at the top end of our guidance range the liquids mainline system achieved record annual throughput our gas pipelines were highly utilized and we re capturing synergies through the amalgamation of our ontario utility businesses in addition to strong business performance we placed a further 9 billion of new projects into service including the canadian segment of the line 3 replacement our focus on optimizing our base business and executing on our secured growth program continues to drive highly predictable and growing cash flows which resulted in exceptional annual dividend growth for our shareholders of 10 in 2019 and 9 8 in 2020 despite strong utilization and financial performance across our businesses we experienced a major incident on our natural gas system in kentucky the safety of our systems is always our number one priority and we re re doubling our efforts to ensure our pipelines continue to be the safest in the industry in the liquids pipeline segment we delivered on our plan for 100 kbpd of throughput optimizations on the mainline system by the end of 2019 we re planning for a further 50 kbpd of mainline optimizations and we re moving forward with a 50 kbpd expansion of the express pipeline in 2020 these actions will provide wcsb producers with at least 200 kbpd of much needed additional pipeline capacity on the u s portion of our line 3 replacement project on february 3 the mpuc approved the feis and reinstated the certificate of need and route permit this important decision by the mpuc reflects the most comprehensive review of a pipeline project in minnesota history and reaffirms the need for the pipeline to be replaced we ll continue to work closely with state and federal permitting agencies to secure all necessary permits prior to commencing construction in addition following almost two years of extensive negotiation with our shippers we filed the mainline contract offering with the canada energy regulator cer the priority access offering is in direct response to what our shippers have asked us for and balances their diverse needs ultimately contracting the mainline will provide all shippers with priority access at competitive tolls and supports further improvement in netbacks for wcsb producers most notably it secures long term demand for canadian crude oil while ensuring that all interested shippers can participate in a fair and transparent open season process for example we ve made this offering accessible to smaller producers by reducing the minimum volume required to contract on the system and introducing a requirements contract with very attractive terms we expect the cer will conduct a thorough review of our application which will include input from enbridge and the industry importantly we included in our application 13 letters from the shippers representing well over 70 percent of the mainline volumes to demonstrate the support we have for the offering we ve also been advancing our liquids strategy to extend our integrated value chain from western canada down to the u s gulf coast we re moving ahead with developing a terminal at jones creek texas which will be fully integrated with our seaway pipeline system and will provide connectivity and services to local refineries as well as export facilities we ve also secured an option to purchase an ownership interest in an offshore vlcc capable oil export terminal further advancing our energy export strategy in the u s gulf coast our gas transmission and midstream business is awaiting a decision from the ferc on a settlement agreement on the texas eastern rate case and are entering rate proceedings on several other pipelines this year these are important milestones as they will allow us to rebase our rates and set us up for recovery of future modernization costs also in gas transmission and midstream we ve again advanced our lng supply strategy by leveraging our incumbent position in the u s gulf coast with the announcement of the agreements to supply both the annova lng facility and the rio grande lng facility along with acquiring the rio bravo pipeline development project finally in the fourth quarter we closed the second phase of the divestiture of our canadian midstream assets which completes our 8 billion asset sale program these non core asset sales have further strengthened our balance sheet and focused our business on our low risk pipeline utility model in summary we re pleased with the company s performance in 2019 and the successful completion of the 3 year plan we announced in early 2017 following the spectra merger as we look ahead to our new 3 year plan through 2022 our strategic priorities for the business remain focused on optimizing our base

or 0 23 per share compared with the same period in 2018 the period over period comparability of earnings attributable to common shareholders was impacted by certain unusual infrequent factors or other non operating factors which are noted in the reconciliation schedule included in appendix a of this news release adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter 2019 increased by 62 million the increase was primarily driven by strong operating results across many of the company s business units and from new projects placed into service in 2019 partially offset by weaker performance in energy services due to the narrowing of certain location and quality differentials on a per share basis adjusted earnings decreased by 0 04 per share compared with the same period in 2018 reflecting the same operating factors noted above partially offset by a higher share count which reflected common shares issued by the company to buy in the public interests in its sponsored vehicles during the fourth quarter of 2018 adjusted earnings for the year ended 2019 increased by 773 million compared with the year ended 2018 the increase is primarily due to strong operating results across many of the company s business units as well as new projects placed into service in 2019 and in late 2018 these factors were partially offset by the disposition of certain gas transmission and midstream assets which included the provincially regulated portion of the canadian natural gas gathering and processing assets sold on october 1 2018 as well as the disposition of midcoast operating l p sold on august 1 2018 dcf for the fourth quarter was 2 051 million an increase of 188 million over the comparable prior period in 2018 while dcf for the year ended 2019 was 9 224 million which is an increase of 1 606 million over 2018 the increased dcf in 2019 for both the fourth quarter and full year over the comparable periods in 2018 was driven largely by the operating factors noted above as well as lower distributions to noncontrolling interests following the completion of the company s buy in of the publicly held interest in its sponsored vehicles detailed segmented financial information and analysis can be found below under adjusted ebitda by segments project execution update over the course of 2019 the company placed 9 billion of secured growth projects into service including 7 billion in the

at least twenty years by expanding enbridge s existing valley crossing system the expansion will be subject to the annova facility reaching fid the capital cost of the expansion is expected to be approximately us 0 5 billion subject to the final design specifications of the lng facility line 3 replacement the 9 billion line 3 replacement project is a significant component of the company s secured project inventory it is a critical integrity replacement project that will enhance the safety and reliability of enbridge s liquids mainline system the company placed the canadian segment of the line 3 replacement into service on december 1 2019 with an interim surcharge of us 0 20 per barrel this safety driven maintenance project reflects the importance of protecting the environment and ensuring the continued safe and reliable operations of our canadian mainline system well into the future the capital cost for the canadian portion of line 3 replacement project came in slightly below budget in minnesota the department of commerce issued a feis on december 9 and the mpuc gathered public comment through january 16 2020 on february 3 2020 the mpuc approved the adequacy of the feis and reinstated the certificate of need and route permit clearing the way for construction of the pipeline to commence following the issuance of required permits the state and federal environmental permitting agencies have continued to advance their work including the initiation of public consultation processes in parallel with the ongoing mpuc process depending on the final in service date there is a risk that the project may exceed the company s total cost estimate of 9 billion for the combined line 3 replacement project however at this time the company does not anticipate any capital cost impacts that would be material to enbridge s financial position and outlook other business updates mainline contracting on december 19 2019 the company submitted an application to the cer to implement term contracts on the liquids canadian mainline system the application for contracted and uncommitted service included the associated terms conditions and tolls of each service which would be offered in an open season following approval by the cer the tolls and services will replace the current competitive toll settlement cts that is in place until june 30 2021 if a replacement agreement is not in place by that time the cts tolls will continue on an interim basis the application that the company filed is the result of two years of extensive negotiations with a diverse group of shippers and has been designed to align the interests of its shippers and enbridge shippers representing well over 70 of the current mainline system throughput have filed letters supporting the application with the cer demonstrating the strong shipper backing for the offering the application highlights benefits of the mainline contract offering for both shippers and the public including the following secures long term demand for wcsb heavy and light barrels in premium markets supports the best netbacks for wcsb producers competitive and stable tolls for customers and flexibility for shippers of all types and sizes to participate by offering both a traditional take or pay and producer and refiner requirements contracts on january 16 2020 the cer issued a letter inviting comments from interested persons to identify issues to be considered during the regulatory proceeding and on procedural matters such as processes the cer may establish to consider the application efficiently

growth included adjusted ebitda reflected strong operating performance increased asset utilization and contributions from assets placed into service in late 2018 and through 2019 offset by the absence of contributions from the sale of assets in the gas transmission and midstream segment during 2018 as well as lower ebitda from energy services crude operations due to narrowing of certain location

depreciation and amortization expense as a result of new assets placed into service net of depreciation expense no longer recorded for assets which were classified as assets held for sale or sold during second half of 2018 higher interest expense due to the absence of capitalized interest related to assets that were placed into service in late 2018 and 2019 lower income taxes due to lower

fourth quarter of 2018 the increase in adjusted earnings noted above was more than offset on a per share basis by the issuance during the fourth quarter of 2018 of approximately 297 million common shares to acquire in separate transactions all of the outstanding equity securities of the company s sponsored vehicles not beneficially owned by enbridge for the year ended december 31 2019 adjusted earnings increased 773 million over the same period in 2018 the increase is primarily driven by the increased adjusted ebitda from strong asset performance as well as lower distributions to noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests following the completion of enbridge s buy in of the publicly held interests in its sponsored vehicles as discussed under distributable cash flow above the increase to adjusted earnings was offset by increased income tax expense in part due to higher earnings before tax and a higher effective income tax rate the period over period increase in

transmission adjusted ebitda reflected a full quarter of contributions from new assets placed into service in late 2018 including valley crossing pipeline and the nexus gas transmission pipeline the increase in ebitda was partially offset by higher planned integrity expenditures lower afudc on decreased capital spend as well as both lower revenues and higher operating costs associated with the texas eastern pipeline incident in lincoln county kentucky that occurred in the third quarter of 2019 that occurred in the third quarter of 2019 canadian gas transmission adjusted ebitda decreased

compared with the same period of 2018 key quarter over quarter performance drivers included egi adjusted ebitda increased due to higher distribution charges primarily resulting from increases in distribution rates and customer base synergies realized from the amalgamation of egd and union gas as well as the absence of earnings sharing in 2019 which was recognized in 2018 under egd s previous incentive rate structure these contributions were partially offset due to warmer weather in egi s franchise areas in the fourth quarter which led to lower utilization as well as the effects of the accelerated capital cost allowance deductions reflected as a pass through to customers consistent with the ontario energy board s prescribed deferral account treatment other gas distribution and storage adjusted ebitda decreased due to closing of the sale of enbridge gas new brunswick on october 1 2019 and st lawrence gas company inc on november 1 2019 gas distribution and storage adjusted

comparable earnings per share comparable earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or comparable ebitda and comparable funds generated from operations these and certain other comparable measures are considered to be non gaap measures as a result they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities they are used to provide you additional information on our operating performance liquidity and ability to generate funds to finance our operations with that i ll turn the call over to russ russ girling president and chief executive officer thanks david good afternoon everyone and thank you very much for joining us late in the afternoon as highlighted in our fourth quarter news release during 2019 our 100 billion portfolio of high quality long life energy infrastructure assets continue to profit from strong supply and demand fundamentals and we continue to realize the growth expected from our industry leading capital expansion program as a result despite significant asset sales that accelerated the strengthening our balance sheet we produced record financial results again in 2019 today we are advancing 30 billion of secured capital projects that largely consist of in corridor expansions of our existing assets in addition work continues on more than 20 billion of projects under development including keystone xl and the refurbishment of five reactors at bruce power as part of their long term life extension program we also made significant progress in funding our secured capital program through various portfolio management activities last year specifically we completed a partial monetization of our northern courier pipeline in alberta as well as the sale of certain columbia midstream assets in the appalachian region these initiatives combined with the sale of our coolidge generating station in arizona resulted in combined proceeds of approximately 3 4 billion each of those transactions allowed us to surface significant value for relatively mature assets and redeploy the money into our capital program thereby reducing our need for external funding as a result we exited 2019 with debt to ebitda in the high 4s as we had planned looking forward we expect our strong operating and financial performance to continue with 2020 comparable earnings per share expected to be consistent with the record results we produced in 2019 we also expect our solid financial position to be bolstered in the first half of 2020 with the completion of announced portfolio management and project financing activities last july we entered into an agreement to sell our natural gas fired power plants in ontario for approximately 2 87 billion subject to closing adjustments that transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter and in late december we announced an agreement to sell a 65 equity interest in our 6 6 billion coastal gaslink pipeline project and that is expected to close in the first half of 2020 as a result we think that we are well positioned to fund our 30 billion portfolio secured growth projects without issuing any common equity from our dividend reinvestment plan we are proud of financial performance and the significant returns we ve generated for our shareholders we do know that our ongoing success depends on our ability to balance profitability with safety and environmental and social responsibility we have a 65 year track record of safe and reliable operations but we recognize there s always room for us to improve that s why in 2019 we created a chief sustainability officer role at the executive level of our company and added sustainability to what is known as the health safety and now sustainability environment committee of our board of directors to keep you better informed we published several investor focused esg documents informed by the task force on climate related financial disclosure the sustainability accounting standards board and the global reporting initiative those documents describe some of the work we re doing to ensure our business remains resilient in an ever evolving energy landscape all of that can be found on our website at tcenergy com so with that as an overview i ll expand on some of the recent developments beginning with a brief overview of our 2019 financial results don will provide more detail on the fourth quarter results and the outlook in just a few minutes so excluding certain specific items comparable earnings were 3 9 billion or 4 14 per common share for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 3 5 billion or 3 86 per share in 2018 which is an increase of about 7 on a per share basis comparable ebitda of 9 4 billion and comparable funds generated from operations of 7 1 billion were both 9 higher than last year each of these amounts represents record results for our company and reflects the strong performance of our legacy assets as well as contributions from 8 7 billion of new long term contracted or rate regulated assets that were placed into service in 2019 based on the strength in our financial performance and our promising outlook for the future tc energy s board of directors declared a first quarter 2020 dividend of 0 81 per common share which is equivalent to 3 24 per share on an annual basis this represents an 8 increase over the amount declared in 2019 and is the 20th consecutive year that our board has increased the dividend over that same time frame we have maintained consistently strong coverage ratios with our dividend on average representing a payout of approximately 80 of comparable earnings and 40 of comparable funds generated from operations leaving us with significant internally generated cash flow to invest in our core businesses next i ll make a few comments on our five operating businesses firstly in our canadian natural gas pipeline business customer demand for access to our systems remained strong and we continue to work with industry on options to connect growing western canadian gas supply to markets across north america evidence of that can be seen in our announcement earlier today that will see us invest another 900 million in our 2023 ngtl intra basin system expansion program for incremental delivery capacity to serve oil sands petrochemical demand power generation demand and the utility sectors in alberta the expansion will add 309 million cubic feet a day of capacity to the system and is underpinned by 15 year contracts with shippers regulatory applications for that expansion are expected to be filed later this year with construction commencing as early as the fourth quarter of 2021 subject to receipt of those regulatory approvals with this announcement we are now advancing a 9 3 billion expansion program on ngtl that will add approximately 3 5 billion cubic feet a day of incremental delivery capacity by the end of 2023 we also continue to actively work with lng canada on our coastal gaslink project that 6 6 billion project will have an initial capacity of 2 1 billion cubic feet a day with potential expansion capacity up to five billion cubic feet a day coastal gaslink will play an important role in delivering canadian natural gas overseas that will displace coal fired generation in asia and contribute to the reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions construction activities continued on many locations along the pipeline group during the fourth quarter and into 2020 today we are proceeding and worked at over 30 sites along the 670 kilometer route with over 1 000 men and women currently employed on february 6 the rcmp again enforcing the supreme court of british columbia interlocutory injunction prohibiting unlawful blockades that were granting access to service roads in the maurice river area of south of houston dc we re extremely disappointed enforcement was required to reopen the maurice river for a service road but we will continue our efforts to attempt to engage with the hereditary chief of the wet suwet en and the unist ot en in search of a peaceful long term resolution that benefits all of the people in that community we ll also continue to engage with all indigenous and local communities including all 20 of the first nation communities along the route who are benefiting from the social and economic development the project offers and want to see that project move ahead finally we ll continue to work with the 21st nations on an option to acquire 10 equity interest in the project that option was announced in late december when we advanced funding plans for the project by selling a 65 interest in the project to kkr and aimco we also expect coastal gaslink will finalize a secured project financing construction credit facility with the syndicate of banks defined up to 80 of the project s capital expenditures during construction both of those transactions are expected to close in the first half of 2020 and will be and will substantially satisfy our under requirements through the project to completion looking forward we ll continue to be responsible for constructing and operating the pipeline and providing a positive long term legacy for the many local communities and first nations in northern british columbia finally in the canadian natural gas pipelines business in december we were pleased to complete negotiations on a six year settlement with our customers on the canadian mainline the settlement which will run from january 2021 through december 2026 sets a base equity churn of 10 1 on 40 deemed common equity and includes incentives to increase revenues and decrease costs which will be shared between us and the customers moving now to our u s natural gas pipelines which serve today approximately 25 of u s daily demand in conjunction with the 2023 ngtl system expansion that we announced earlier today we also announced an expansion of our anr system expansion projects referred to as the alberta xpress project will add approximately 160 million cubic feet a day of capacity to anr customers signed agreements which include customary conditions precedent with an average weighted term of 19 years regulatory applications to construct the facilities will be filed with the ferc in 2020 and subject to regulatory approvals construction is expected to commence as early as the third quarter of 2021 with main service expected to commence in 2022 the alberta xpress project in combination with existing capacity in our great lakes transmission system the canadian mainline system will provide western canadian production with a seamless path to growing lng export markets and other markets along the u s gulf coast in addition to alberta xpress we are advancing usd1 5 billion of other capacity projects across our u s natural gas pipeline network which includes the buckeye xpress project gtn xpress east lateral xpress louisiana xpress and the grand chenier xpress project each of those projects are along our existing footprint highlighting the value of our extensive a cost competitive north american network turning to mexico where the sur de texas pipeline began commercial operations in september following the execution of an amending agreement with cfe sur de texas has a capacity to provide up to 2 6 billion cubic feet a day of low cost clean burning natural gas supply to mexico with completion of sur de texas we now have five operating pipelines in mexico and another two pipeline projects under development they include the villa de reyes projects which we expect to phase into service starting in the second quarter and have fully operational by the end of the year finally in mexico the east section of the tula pipeline is now available for interruptible transportation service although construction on the central segment continues to face delays tula is expected to enter service two years after indigenous consultations are successfully concluded by the mexican government turning to our liquids business which generated very strong results in 2019 keystone continued to produce solid results in the fourth quarter although it was impacted by system outage and a pressure derate on the southern portion of our system or what we call the u s gulf coast segment capacity was increased during 2018 to more than 700 000 barrels a day and we maintained strong utilization through the fourth quarter of 2019 and in addition for much of the year we benefited from higher contribution from liquids marketing due to improved volumes and margins although those margin weakened in the fourth quarter as new pipeline capacity was brought into service between the permian and the u s gulf coast and finally in the liquids business we continued to advance the keystone xl project in march u s president trump issued a new permit for the project which superseded the 2017 permit and resulted in the dismissal of litigation related to that old permit in august the nebraska supreme court affirmed the 20 november 2017 decision by the nebraska public service commission that approved the keystone xl pipeline route through the state in december the u s department of state issued a final supplementary environmental impact statement for the project that report considered the changes in the project since 2014 when the 2014 keystone xl seis was issued including routing in nebraska as well as updated information in new states that were required and on february seven we received approval from the u s bureau of land management allowing for construction of pipeline across federally managed lands in addition we have now acquired nearly 100 of the right of way for the pipeline through all states montana south dakota and nebraska keystone xl continues to be a very important project for both canada and the united states it will create jobs in advanced energy security in both nations in an environmentally sustainable and very responsible way as such it continues to be fully subscribed by our customers under long term take or pay contracts moving forward we will continue to carefully and methodically manage various legal and regulatory matters before we consider advancing this commercially secured project into construction turning to the power and storage business where work continues on the bruce life extension project after years of preparation bruce power s unit six mcr outage commenced on january 17 when we took that unit offline we expect to invest approximately 2 4 billion in that program as well as the ongoing asset management program through 2023 when the unit six refurbishment is complete and returned to service bruce power s contract price increased to approximately 78 per megawatt hour on april 1 2019 to reflect the capital to be invested under these programs as well as normal annual inflation adjustments also in power as you know we experienced an equipment failure on napanee in 2019 that failure has now been resolved and final commissioning activities are progressing with commercial operations to are expected to commence in later the first quarter as a result we expect the sale of the facility along with the halton hills plant and our interest in the portlands energy center to close by the end of the first quarter the proceeds of approximately 2 87 billion will be used to help fund our industry leading capital program in summary today we are advancing 30 billion of secured growth projects that are expected to enter service by 2023 we have a we have invested approximately 8 billion into that program to date with approximately 6 billion of the projects expected to be completed by the end of 2020 notably they are all underpinned by cost of service regulation or long term contracts giving us visibility to earnings and cash flow that they will generate as they enter service based on the continued strong performance of our base businesses combined with our organic growth programs we expect to grow our dividend at an average annual rate of 8 to 10 through 2021 and 5 to 7 there after as always has been our practice the growth in dividends is expected to be supported by sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow per share and strong coverage ratios to close i ll leave you with the following key messages today we are a leading north american energy infrastructure company with a very strong track record of delivering long term shareholder value our assets are essential to the functioning of the north american society and to the economy and the demand for our services remains strong looking forward we have five significant platforms for growth canadian u s and mexico natural gas pipelines liquids pipelines and power and storage as we advance our 30 billion secured capital program we expect to build on our long track record of growing earnings cash flow and dividends per share we also have more than 20 billion of projects in advanced stages of development and expect numerous other in corridor organic opportunities to emanate from our extensive critical asset footprint and finally our balance sheet is back to its place historical strength and we are well positioned to fund our secured capital program without the need for any additional common equity in 2020 and beyond we will remain disciplined continuing our focus on safety sustainability and working according to our values and responding quickly to market signals and sign posts to ensure we remain industry leading and resilient as we grow shareholder value and improve society s well being for decades to come with that i ll turn the call over to don who will provide more details on our fourth quarter results and our future outlook donald r marchand executive vice president strategy corporate development and chief financial officer thanks russ and good afternoon everyone as outlined in our quarterly results issued earlier today net income attributable to common shares was 1 1 billion or 1 18 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 1 1 billion or 1 19 per share for the same period in 2018 fourth quarter results included a positive 195 million valuation allowance release recognized in the previously unrecorded benefit of certain prior year s u s tax loss carryforwards partially offset by a 61 million increase in the after tax loss on the ontario natural gas fired power plants held for sale and a 19 million adjustment to the loss on the sale of certain columbia midstream assets in the case of the ontario natural gas fired power plants the accrued loss on sale will increase each reporting period up to transaction close to reflect incremental spend and interest capitalized on napanee fourth quarter 2018 results also included several specific items as outlined on the slide and discussed in the fourth quarter 2019 financial highlights release all of these specific items as well as unrealized gains and losses from changes in risk management activities are excluded from comparable earnings which reached 970 million in the fourth quarter in 2019 24 million higher than last year after taking into account the dilutive impact of common shares issued under our dividend reinvestment program comparable earnings per share of 1 03 were consistent with last year turning to our business segment results on slide 17 in the fourth quarter comparable ebitda from our five operating segments was approximately 2 3 billion 103 138 million decrease from 2018 canadian natural gas pipelines comparable ebitda of 618 million was 200 million lower than the same period last year primarily on account of lower flow through depreciation and income taxes as well as lower incentive earnings in the canadian mainline due to recording the full year impact of the neb 2018 decision in fourth quarter 2018 i would note that for canadian natural gas pipelines changes in depreciation financial charges and income taxes impact comparable ebitda but they do not have a significant effect on net income as they are almost entirely recovered in revenues on a flow through basis net income for the ngtl system increased 20 million compared to fourth quarter 2018 as a result of higher investment higher average investment base from continued system expansions net income for the canadian mainline decreased 17 million year over year primarily due to lower incentive earnings as a result of the neb 2018 decision partially offset by decreased carrying charges on the 2019 revenue surplus u s natural gas pipelines comparable ebitda of usd648 million or cad855 million in the quarter rose by usd35 million or cad43 million compared to the same period in 2018 the increase was mainly due to contributions from columbia gas and columbia gulf growth projects placed in service partially offset by the sale of certain columbia midstream assets in august 2019 and lower earnings from buys and due to 2018 customer agreements to pay out their future contracted revenues and terminate the contracts mexico natural gas pipelines comparable ebitda of usd125 million or cad165 million was usd10 million or cad13 million above fourth quarter 2018 due to higher equity earnings from the sur de texas pipeline which was placed in service in september 2019 at which time we began recording equity income from operations prior to in service sur de texas equity income primarily reflected afudc net of our proportionate share of interest expense on inter affiliate loans the interest expense on the sur de texas inter affiliate loans are fully offset in interest income and other lower earnings from other operations are primarily a result of changes in the timing of revenue recognition in 2018 liquids pipeline s comparable ebitda declined by 66 million to 472 million in fourth quarter 2019 driven by lower volumes on the keystone pipeline system a decreased contribution from liquids marketing activities due to lower margins and reduced earnings as a result of the partial monetization of northern courier in july 2019 these decreases were partially offset by a contribution from the white spruce pipeline placed in service in may 2019 power and storage comparable ebitda rose by 43 million year over year to 210 million due to higher bruce power results which were elevated by an increased realized power price and higher volumes resulting from fewer outage days this was partially offset by decreased canadian power results largely due to greater outage days at our alberta cogeneration plants a prior period billing adjustment as well as the sale of the coolidge generating station in may 2019 for all our businesses with u s dollar denominated income including u s natural gas pipelines mexico natural gas pipelines and parts of liquids pipelines ebitda was translated into canadian dollars using an exchange rate of cad1 32 in fourth quarter 2019 similar to the rate for the same period in 2018 therefore foreign exchange had little impact on year over year business unit results as a reminder of our approach to managing foreign exchange exposure our u s dollar denominated revenue streams are partially hedged by interest on u s dollar denominated debt we then actively manage the residual exposure on a rolling one year forward basis now turning to the other income statement items on slide 18 depreciation and amortization of 625 million decreased 56 million versus fourth quarter 2018 largely due to recording the full year impact of increased depreciation rates approved in the canadian mainline neb 2018 decision in fourth quarter 2018 partially offset by higher depreciation in the ngtl system and u s natural gas pipelines reflecting new projects placed in service interest expense of 586 million for fourth quarter 2019 was 17 million lower year over year primarily due to higher capitalized interest related to keystone xl coastal gaslink and napanee partially offset by the impact of long term debt and junior subordinated note issuances in 2018 and 2019 net of maturities afudc decreased 44 million for the three months ended december 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to columbia gas and columbia gulf growth projects placed in service partially offset by continued investment in our ngtl system and mexico projects comparable interest income and other increased by 66 million in the fourth quarter versus 2018 primarily as a result of lower realized losses in 2019 on derivatives used to manage our net exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on u s dollar denominated income as noted earlier along with u s dollar interest expense these activities serve to offset the impact of currency movements in the business units and comparable ebitda income tax expense included in comparable earnings was 211 million in the fourth quarter 2019 compared to 268 million for the same period last year the 57 million decrease was mainly on account of lower flow through income taxes in canadian rate regulated pipelines and decreased comparable earnings before income taxes partially offset by lower foreign tax rate differentials comparable net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of 76 million in the fourth quarter decreased by 10 million compared to the same period last year primarily due to lower earnings in tc pipelines lp and finally preferred share dividends were comparable to fourth quarter 2018 now turning to slide 19 during the fourth quarter we invested approximately 2 4 billion in our capital program which was largely funded with comparable funds generated from operations of 1 8 billion along with drip proceeds from the third quarter dividend cash on hand and notes payable over the past several years we have taken significant steps to return our balance sheet and financial flexibility to their place of historical strength that included the partial monetization of northern courier as well as sale of certain columbia midstream assets and the coolidge generating facility in 2019 for total proceeds of approximately 3 4 billion as a result we exited 2019 having attained targeted debt to ebitda in the high 4s and in a position to fund our 30 billion portfolio of secured growth projects without further issuance of common equity as russ mentioned the company s strong financial position will be further bolstered by the completion of pending portfolio management and project financing activities expected in the first half of 2020 more specifically closing the sale of our ontario natural gas fired power plants and the partial monetization of coastal gaslink in december we entered into an agreement to sell a 65 equity interest in coastal gaslink under its terms we will receive upfront proceeds that include reimbursement of the joint venture partner s proportionate share of project costs incurred to the date of close as well as additional payment streams through construction and operation of the project concurrent with the completion of the sale we expect coastal gaslink will enter into a secured project level credit facility to fund up to 80 of costs through construction these transactions are expected to close in the first half of 2020 and substantially satisfy our funding requirements through project completion the previously announced sale of our ontario natural gas fired power plants for 2 87 billion is also expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 now turning to slide 20 this graphic highlights our forecast sources and uses of funds from 2020 through 2022 starting in the left column the total funding requirement over the next three years is projected to be 30 billion comprised of dividend and noncontrolling interest distributions of approximately 11 billion and capital expenditures of approximately 19 billion including maintenance capital this also reflects the inclusion of capital spend on coastal gaslink prior to the close of the equity sell down as well as the additions of the 2023 ngtl system expansion program and alberta xpress the second column highlights aggregate sources including approximately 21 5 billion of internally generated cash flow and 2 8 billion of proceeds from the pending sale of our ontario natural gas fired power plants it also reflects 1 6 billion which we expect to receive under the coastal gaslink secured project level construction credit facility for amounts spent by us to the date of close that leaves a residual requirement of approximately 4 4 billion in the far right column we expect to fund this through a combination of incremental debt within the constraints of our targeted debt to ebitda in the high 4s range an ffo to debt of approximately 15 supplemented by the reimbursement of equity contributions and our payments to be realized from the sale of 65 65 interest in coastal gaslink in summary our external funding needs are eminently manageable in the context of our significant internally generated cash flow and the multiple financing levers available to us we reiterate we do not foresee a need for common equity to complete our secured 30 billion capital program now turning to slide 21 next i d like to spend a moment on our 2020 comparable earnings outlook additional information is contained in our 2019 annual management s discussion and analysis which is being filed on sedar today and available on our website overall comparable earnings in 2020 on a per share basis are expected to be consistent with the record results achieved in 2019 canadian natural gas pipelines earnings are expected to be higher than 2019 mainly due to continued growth in the ngtl system investment base with the canadian mainline largely stable year over year reflecting consistent incentive earnings and investment base u s natural gas pipelines earnings are expected to be in line with 2019 due to increased revenues following the completion of expansion projects on the columbia gas and columbia gulf systems in 2019 offset by the sale of certain columbia midstream assets in august 2019 in mexico we expect earnings to be higher year over year primarily due to a full year of operations for the sur de texas pipeline along with an incremental contribution from the villa de reyes pipeline which is anticipated to be fully in service by the end of the year in liquids earnings are expected to be significantly lower than 2019 in both keystone pipeline system and liquids marketing business as a result of lower margins and volumes due to changing market conditions as significant opportunities that existed in 2019 are not anticipated to persist in 2020 earnings in 2020 will also be impacted by the partial monetization of northern courier in july 2019 comparable earnings for the power and storage segment our expected to be lower than 2019 primarily as a result of a decreased contribution from bruce power due to the unit six mcr outage which commenced in january 2020 the sale of our ontario natural gas fired power plants in the first quarter of 2020 as well as the completed sale of the coolidge generating station in may 2019 comparable earnings per share in 2020 will also be impacted by development fees related to certain capital projects offset by higher financial charges as a result of lower capitalized interest and reduced afudc after placing new assets in service with respect to income taxes excluding canadian rate regulated pipelines where income taxes are a flow through item and are thus quite variable along with equity afudc income in u s and mexico natural gas pipelines we expect our 2020 full year effective rate to be lower than 2019 but still in the mid to high teens range subject to the uncertain impact of pending final u s tax regulations and recently enacted tax reforms in mexico finally as part of the 2020 outlook i would note that our exposure to interest rate foreign exchange and commodity price variability remains quite limited in our diversified portfolio in terms of capital spending we expect to invest approximately 8 billion in 2020 on growth projects maintenance capital and contributions to equity investments the majority of the capital expenditures are attributable to ngtl system expansions columbia gas modernization projects the bruce power life extension program normal course maintenance and coastal gaslink prior to closing the sale of a 65 interest in the project subsequent to closing and the contemporaneous establishment of the secured construction credit facility we expect our investment in coastal gaslink will be accounted for under the equity method and future capital expenditures will be predominantly funded by project level financing and our equity partners lastly turning to slide 22 in closing i offer the following comments our solid financial and operational results in the fourth quarter once again highlight our diversified low risk business strategy and reflect the robust performance of both our blue chip legacy portfolio along with the contribution of equally high quality assets from our ongoing capital program today we are advancing a 30 billion suite of secured projects and have five distinct platforms for future growth in canadian u s and mexico natural gas pipelines liquids pipelines and power and storage our overall financial position remains strong we are well placed to fund our secured capital program through resilient and growing internally generated cash flow access to debt capital markets the pending sale of our ontario natural gas fired power plants along with the partial monetization and project level financing of coastal gaslink our portfolio of critical energy infrastructure projects is poised to generate high quality long life earnings and cash flow for our shareholders as well as germinate further attractive and executable in corridor opportunities that is expected to support annual dividend growth of 8 to 10 through 2021 and 5 to 7 organic growth thereafter finally we will continue to maintain financial strength and flexibility at all points of the economic cycle that will leave us well positioned to capture transformational opportunities that could supplement our organic growth should they arise in the future that s the end of my prepared remarks i ll now turn the call back over to david for the q a david moneta vice president of investor relation thanks don just a reminder before i turn it over to the conference coordinator for questions from the investment community operator instruction with that i ll turn it over to the conference coordinator questions and answers operator and the first question is from linda ezergailis from td securities please go ahead linda ezergailis td securities equity research analyst i appreciate how your esg reporting continues to evolve but i m wondering if you could give us maybe a bit of a better sense about how you might evolve how these esg and sustainability principles might guide your business decisions in terms of how you also you look at future scenarios and maybe just provide some context around that russ girling president and chief executive officer i ll take a first shot at linda that obviously the issues related to sustainability have always been sort of foremost in our minds whether that be things like safety environmental stewardship working with the communities that benefit from our projects so they ve we will continue to do those things as you know we ve heightened our awareness around safety for example we ve been implemented a zero is real program inside the company we ve made real progress we achieved 0 in a lot of pockets of our business this year that continues to be very important we continue to invest in technology that will improve our ability to detect and act on potential for leaks in our pipeline systems and we continue to evolve our processes and investment in the communities in which we operate offering continually greater benefits for those communities and understanding what their concerns are so they re far most in our mind what we ve been doing from a reporting perspective is collating that information and providing it to the investment community in a way that we hadn t in the past because folks are asking for that kind of information based on that feedback as well we continue to evolve that reporting around those kinds of issues but what i can tell you is each year in each year that i ve been at the company over the last 25 years we ve continued to make improvements on how we do business in all areas whether that be an environmental footprint social responsibility the diversity in our employment and management ranks i think you just look at the results and see that we have continuous improvement and goals on an annual basis to continually improve those things linda ezergailis td securities equity research analyst how does that inform your capital allocation decisions and how you might think about terminal values and discount rates etc russ girling president and chief executive officer well i think clearly i mean it s in our business those are concepts that we ve thought about for a long time if you think about life span of assets depreciation is a concept that we have worked with our shippers and our regulators over the years as we ve seen times in the past where supply demand or other fundamentals would point you to a shorter asset life we accelerate depreciation increase in surcharges for example and the opposite when we see that at certain locations those assets are going to be around for longer we extend those depreciation time frames we continue to look at return of and on capital and adjust our investments and revenues in a way that best allows us to capture those for our shareholders when i think about other things like weather related risks for example again those aren t issues that are new to us if you think of the way that we ve approached putting in river crossings for example where we used to cut the middle of the river put the pipe four feet under the river we ve changed our practices today in major river crossings we drill underneath those rivers such that you have 100 year flooding kind of scenarios the scouring and those kind of things don t expose our pipe anymore we continue to evolve our practices on all of these fronts so as i think about the risks inherent we have been on top of those for some time but in addition this last year we introduced and it s outlined in our reports that we ve made public we do look at scenario analysis and we ve looked at different supply demand scenarios that could evolve in the future including a two degrees reduction scenario that was put together which is by consultants and then from that we look at the resilience of our assets in those supply demand scenarios and we have i think what we found is that our portfolio performed very well and as you know one of the benefits of the large diverse footprint that we have that goes from wellhead to market and is well depreciate those assets become the ones that the people want to use going forward because of their low cost base and their location and our ability to expand them because of existing relationships with communities and things like that where it s difficult to build in those markets today so these are all concepts that have been on our mind for some time we ve collated them and we ve provided them via those reports i guess what i would tell you about our business is we believe under almost every scenario that we see going forward we re part of the solution to achieving reductions in greenhouse gas for emission emissions for example single greatest reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in north america has been the displacement of coal fired generation in united states we ve played a large role in that we played a large role in the reduction and elimination of coal fired generation in ontario with the construction of gas fired generation there our building of solar facilities there as well as our investment in the bruce power refurbishment so as we think about the resilience of our assets they appear to be very resilient and be very relevant in the marketplace for a long time that said we continue to monitor that via the scenario analysis that we do and we re very comfortable with where we are today in fact we see great opportunity as the marketplace evolves and looks for better and better environmental performance from the energy infrastructure that supplies the energy that people need linda ezergailis td securities equity research analyst okay if i can ask the second question just really quickly you re in the process of discussing with your customers the ngtl settlement for 2020 and beyond if you can just comment on how close do you think you might be to concluding those discussions and how the attributes might be similar or change versus what was in place for 2018 and 2019 tracy robinson executive vice president and president canadian natural gas pipelines hi linda it s tracy here we those dialogues continue i would say what i would say to you is on a very collaborative basis we all understand the importance of the ngtl system on in the health and the growth of the basins as we come together with our customers that kind of forms the principles around the solutions that we re looking for the dialogue is going very well and i would expect that we would have something we could talk about within the next two to three months linda ezergailis td securities equity research analyst and the range of outcomes tracy robinson executive vice president and president canadian natural gas pipelines yes those of course would be subject to what the guys are talking about at the table so it would be inappropriate i think right now to talk about what those are let s let them get through and into an agreement and then we d be happy to have a conversation around what that looks like linda ezergailis td securities equity research analyst thank you operator and the next question is from jeremy tonet from jpmorgan please go ahead jeremy bryan tonet jp morgan chase analyst i just want to see kind of next steps forward here with kxl given that you ve kind of crossed a lot of the regulatory and legal hurdles it seems like you have a more clear sight i guess to what could happen than you have at points in the past and just wondering if you ve seen any kind of acknowledgment from the federal government or from the local government as far as if the project does go forward i imagine that they would reap very significant benefits and so it seems like they d be incentivized to be stakeholders in this project as well to support the development so i didn t know if you ve heard anything from the edc as far as support there or anything else you could comment on this topic paul miller executive vice president and president liquids pipelines jeremy it s paul here i ll just talk a little bit about the progress we have made and what is in front of us yet so we did make some good progress here in the last few quarters you see just recently the approval from the bureau of land management for the access to all the federally managed land as well as the affirmation from the nebraska supreme court of our new route in nebraska as well as the receipt of the final supplemental environmental impact statement from the state department which together has allowed us to secure almost 100 of the land we need through canada and u s to build the pipeline going forward we still require an approval from the army corp of engineers for access to waters in the u s and there is outstanding litigation in federal court in montana contesting the 2019 presidential permit so those two items we need to get behind us before we move forward to an fid donald r marchand executive vice president strategy corporate development and chief financial officer yes jeremy it s don here i ll keep it at a fairly high level but this is a very compelling project with substantial benefits for many parties if we get this done the conversation on aligning the risks and rewards of this project among those parties has been under way for quite some time and i describe it as constructive and as paul mentioned we re in the final stage gates here of getting through remaining approvals costing the project looking at execution plans if we can get comfort that the risk reward proposition is attractive to us we will proceed and if we can t line all that up then the project will stay where it is right now so it s there s moving some positive moving parts here but that s kind of the high level as how we see things jeremy bryan tonet jp morgan chase analyst that s helpful and maybe if i could just go to mexico for a minute here and there s been some time since the developments that happened last year some of the changes in the market and changes in contracts there just wondering if you could refresh us on your views for mexico whether that s an area you d like to expand or shrink and just as far as some of the pipelines that came online seem like tula there s a room for it there just wondering what the scope of those opportunities could be any comments on mexico would be helpful francois poirier chief operating officer and president power storage and mexico jeremy it s francois first of all and you alluded to negotiations i think negotiations continue with the cfe and the government of mexico and we would certainly characterize them as being constructive as far as the fundamentals they re still favorable and compelling demand for energy and mexico remains strong and is growing low cost natural gas from the u s is available and will lower the cost of electricity and reduce particulate emissions as it replaces diesel and fuel oil for power generation in various parts of the country i would say that successful negotiations on sur de texas serve as a good blueprint for how we re discussing advancing negotiations on ver or villa de reyes and tula and i think we would see a successful conclusion of those negotiations as demonstrating a willingness for further foreign capital investment and that would be a basis upon which we would look at future opportunities jeremy bryan tonet jp morgan chase analyst got you and just as far as how big could the it opportunity be there and i guess your appetite for mexico within the portfolio if you re at the right size or if this could be bigger or smaller francois poirier chief operating officer and president power storage and mexico i think until we resolve as i alluded to until we conclude negotiations on the two other contracts i think we re comfortable with our exposure in mexico and with respect to it volumes i would characterize them as modest that is part of the solution set as we look to renegotiate the package of pipelines providing service into central mexico jeremy bryan tonet jp morgan chase analyst great that s it for me thank you operator and the next question is from robert catellier from cibc please go ahead robert catellier cibc capital markets analyst i ll start just on the interest rate environment we re seeing some pretty low rates on the corporate bond side i m wondering if there s any more opportunities for you to recycle capital or refinance in a way where the benefits accrue to shareholders donald r marchand executive vice president strategy corporate development and chief financial officer it s don here there s a few pockets where that might that opportunity might present itself but they re more bespoke rather than across our whole portfolio the portfolio is pretty long term and picks pretty fixed rate it s about 23 year average life including hybrids to final coal average rate is 5 2 90 area fixed a lot of the higher rate stuff is legacy debt that we used to finance rate this expansion in canada many years ago so it s flow through and any refinancing of that which we do look at from time to time would accrue to the shippers we have issued a fair bit of debt in the past few years but it was generally in the low rate environment so there s nothing that jumps out that there is some material compelling opportunity to refinance large pockets of our portfolio that would accrue to the shareholder robert catellier cibc capital markets analyst and i assume now that you have the leverage down where you want it there s no particular incentive just based on valuation to accelerate capital recycling and portfolio management donald r marchand executive vice president strategy corporate development and chief financial officer yes look the metrics are where we want them we believe the high 4s on debt to ebitda 15 ffo to debt area are the right places for us given our when you look at it as a holistic portfolio they re quite utility like in terms of our business position and so our balance sheet s where we wanted we pretty much like everything in our portfolio never say never whenever we have an opportunity that arises that may require share count growth we will obviously look at our portfolio and scour that to see if there is something there that s a more compelling opportunity than increasing share count growth robert catellier cibc capital markets analyst okay and then just finally last question i had is on the it was on the option for first nation on coastal gaslink is there anything you could tell us there in terms of what term that option has and maybe you can speak to their sense of desire to exercise that option i m just trying to get to what you might have as final interest is there an option for example if the first nations don t exercise would you consider selling down the extra 10 to third party donald r marchand executive vice president strategy corporate development and chief financial officer yes it s don again here i won t get into the details of where we are on the option process other than to say that it s our expectation we ll end up at a 25 ownership stake in coastal gaslink robert catellier cibc capital markets analyst okay thank you very much donald r marchand executive vice president strategy corporate development and chief financial officer thanks rob operator and the next question is from praneeth satish from wells fargo please go ahead praneeth satish wells fargo securities analyst just i guess i wanted to just start on the canadian mainline just wondering if you could tell us how much capacity is currently available and do you think the new tolling arrangement will help fill up some of that capacity tracy robinson executive vice president and president canadian natural gas pipelines happy to it s tracy here we have some capacity available on the mainline the western mainline right now between now and kind of late 2020 or early 2021 after that much of the western mainline has in the current operating capacity have been contracted the eastern mainline eastern triangle we have different pieces of but that s largely contracted as well so it is when we get the ngtl 2021 volumes will be delivered to east now with the mainline that we see that asset filling up so beyond that we do have as you would recall additional capacity that s not operational right now in the mainline western mainline and that provides us with some options to get more of the basins gas into market as our customers are interested in talking about that praneeth satish wells fargo securities analyst okay and then just turning to the u s northeast just wondering just given the low gas price environment are you seeing any of your producer customers come to you asking for toll relief and maybe tied to that what ability do you have to resell capacity if any of your customers really come under financial distress stanley stan g chapman iii chairman tc pipelines gp inc executive vice president and president u s natural gas pipelines t sure this is stan i can give you some color on that with respect to our northeast customers first of all we re holding well over 1 billion of collateral mostly in the form of letters of credit and you could think of that as averaging about one year s worth of coverage for any single customer most importantly though we re seeing really strong usage on our producer contracts as a matter of fact our top producers are flowing load factors anywhere between 80 to 96 which basically tell me that they re getting proper value for their capacity and we re seeing strong load factors across our entire system as a matter of fact last year january of 2019 we set a new peak day send out record across all 13 pipes at 33 bcf this winter has been relatively mild in terms of weather standards but notwithstanding that on january 20 we had our second highest all time send out of 32 bcf so again strong demand across the entire system but i think most importantly with respect to the producer customers that we have in the appalachian basin not to get too far into the weeds but there are three liquid pricing points in appalachia columbia dominion and tetco most of our customers have access to columbia s pool which is also known as teco pool and teco pool trades about 0 10 higher then dominion s pool or tetco s pool and then furthermore most of our customers have access to gulf coast markets via the columbia gulf system and that trades at a 20 premium to tetco or dominion pool so a lot of value in the proposition relative to some of the other pipes for our customers but i think most importantly out of the appalachian basin where we re finally starting to see the producers tap the brakes and that production has declined we seems to have hit a bit of a peak here in november at just over 33 bcf a day through the first 10 days or so of through february production is down to about 31 8 bcf which is about a 5 decline so as production continues to stabilize or decline as lng exports in other gulf coast markets continue to ramp up i think we ll see producers grow out of this with respect to relief we haven t provided any relief to our customers other than working with them in the normal course of business to maybe amend receipt points or delivery points and give them flexibility to get the greatest usage that they can out of their contracts praneeth satish wells fargo securities analyst okay great thank you operator and the next question is from robert kwan from rbc capital markets please go ahead robert michael kwan rbc capital markets analyst i m going to ask questions here around keystone xl i guess just on the existing system is there an update or have you been able to restore flow rates on the system and if you haven t just what s the schedule of strongest flow rates to full capacity the second just around kxl don you talked about kind of the risk reward i m just wondering as you think about managing risk has anything changed in terms of the desire for something more tangible around backstopping whether that s cgl like or maybe an equity stake paul miller executive vice president and president liquids pipelines robert it s paul here i ll speak to the existing system we have not yet restored pressure to keystone we don t have a time line when we will but we are managing a lower pressure through the use of dra as we moved into q1 here i would anticipate that we would increase our flows as we implement the dra back to normal operating levels we saw reduced flows in q4 because of course the outage we had and the time they took to restart and then it just takes time to catch up and restart your system donald r marchand executive vice president strategy corporate development and chief financial officer yes robert it s don here in terms of the risk reward on xl the conversations as much on cadence and how we would parcel out or mitigate some of the risk that we don t have control over such as last mile and that so that s being factored in in terms of a sell down to a cgl or like ownership level that s not where we see this going we see ourselves controlling this project going forward but absolutely minded to bringing in partners here and we actually don t see ourselves proceeding on our own on this one robert michael kwan rbc capital markets analyst do you have in your mind how much say capital at least for 2020 that you would be willing to spend of your own ahead of the election donald r marchand executive vice president strategy corporate development and chief financial officer i wouldn t go there at this point there s a lot of scenario planning right now and we have to get through the final stage gates in terms of final permits and legal issues right now so that s part of the conversation under way but i can t give you a tangible dollar figure on that no robert michael kwan rbc capital markets analyst okay understood if i can just finish with topic that you talked about at investor day you mentioned again today the potential for transformational opportunities so just on that you laid out your history at investor day the types of things you ve done typically crown jewel assets out of companies that have maybe had some trouble and there s been a lot of talk around gathering processing the gathering processing has never really been your thing so i guess as you think about maybe some of those crown jewel type asset is there any kind of further things that have popped up many prospects and then if you can maybe just talk about would that really from your perspective be confined to pipelines and then what would you be thinking in terms of any new geographies donald r marchand executive vice president strategy corporate development and chief financial officer yes i describe what we re looking at our long term secure annuity streams in businesses that we are comfortable with and that s a generally very blue chip energy infrastructure no we haven t nothing has moved along or popped up that s got our attention we always have our perpetual wish lists at probably unrealistic prices that we would ever transact at but at this point in time our plate is pretty full with 30 billion of stuff on the go and some potential large scale opportunities that may or may not advance here so we re we ve got the balance sheet to where we want it to be where we can actually actively think about these things if they do present themselves but at this point in time i would say the landscape is pretty spartan for anything transformational robert michael kwan rbc capital markets analyst thank you much operator and the next question is from ben pham from bmo please go ahead benjamin pham bmo capital markets analyst in the q4 report there was a commentary around converting merchant revenues to long life annuity cash flows and perhaps you can remind us what the sources of the merchant revenues are for your business and i m also curious interpretation wise is that really just replacing contracts that are rolling off the contract or are you looking to bump at 95 plus which is already pretty high to begin with donald r marchand executive vice president strategy corporate development and chief financial officer yes it s don again here where we do have variability in our portfolio is really in two places volumetrically it s cushing south to the gulf coast on the keystone marketlink system and in terms of commodity price risk it s generally restricted to the alberta power market and some merchant gas storage in alberta so on that on the commodity price side generally it s quite small we re talking a couple of points here on ebitda in terms of the cushing south asset if keystone xl did go ahead that would solve the problem right there by basically turning all that capacity or most of that capacity into 20 year contract so paul miller executive vice president and president liquids pipelines yes i ll add to that ben over the course of 2019 as we increased the capacity on marketlink we were able to increase the contracts so we remain about 80 contracted on marketlink and if you look at our performance quarter after quarter relative to q4 2018 rather our contribution from marketlink is higher in 2019 than it was in 2018 we had much softer spot but we had converted some of that capacity to our contracted revenue benjamin pham bmo capital markets analyst okay sounds like opportunity is for cushing which i had thought and then it s really the preference for you guys to get to pretty much almost close to 100 contract regulated and then contract duration and i know there s a question around terminal value assumptions and risk but i guess when i look at some of the projects you ve announced the last few years bruce power ngtl kxl i mean those are 20 35 15 year contracts that you re adding so is it fair to say that today or going forward your average contract on your assets i know you don t disclose this are they much longer than where they were say five 10 years ago donald r marchand executive vice president strategy corporate development and chief financial officer yes i would say that s a fair characterization and again i would point out at investor day i showed a slide showing ebitda through to 2030 that we have fairly high visibility of 10 billion of ebitda locked in through the decade and that s a testament to the contract length and the regulatory structures behind the vast majority of our assets here we wouldn t attribute a whole lot of recontracting risk into that profile either so yes i think that statement that our average contract length is duration is quite a bit longer today than it was five years ago is correct russ girling president and chief executive officer i think what we found ben over the last few years is as you know your demand has continued to grow whether that be for in the gas business primarily for lng export but as well domestically as industries petrochemical fertilizer and others have returned to north america looking for long term secured natural gas at low prices and looking for the cheapest way of getting that natural gas to their market and trying to secure that either existing capacity around field capacity because it s considerably cheaper than greenfield capacity and doesn t have come with the same potential risks of not being able to build greenfield capacity so what we ve seen is across the system whether it be anr in columbia systems gtn they re pretty much across the board the mainline we have a refilling up what we re seeing is people wanting to secure that capacity and secure it for the long term so if you think of something like coastal gaslink for example 25 year contracts return of and on capital they have the option of extending those contracts further we ll adjust depreciation to allow a longer term to recover return of capital but return on capital stays the same as you pointed out 20 64 for bruce power i think about the negotiation that we just went through with cfe for sur de texas for example we ve actually converted from a 25 year contract to a 30 year contract so what we re seeing is the demand for existing capacity is very strong and people want to secure that capacity for a long period of time and as you might know we pretty much experienced that across our system i think about it on the oil side to the extent that we are able to eke out more capacity from the existing keystone system for example we ve talked a little bit about how we might be able to do that and what we know is that if we had any more capacity on the keystone system we d be able to sell it multiple times over under 20 year terms so existing capacity is becoming rare commodity and people want to sign up for and secure it for the long term benjamin pham bmo capital markets analyst alright that s great thanks everybody russ girling president and chief executive officer okay thanks ben operator and the next question is from andrew kuske from credit suisse please go ahead andrew m kuske credit suisse ag analyst there s a few pipelines now being built across north america with size which is a change from the past few years are you seeing any signs of labor rate pressures or any supply chain impacts paul miller executive vice president and president liquids pipelines andrew it s paul here i ll start we see a tighter market in canada than we do in the united states in contractors and suppliers as part of our pre construction activities for keystone xl we re satisfied with the quality and the quantity of resources we have in the u s canada is a little tighter than what we ve seen in the u s but still ample capacity tracy robinson executive vice president and president canadian natural gas pipelines i ll add to that andrew it s tracy here we re experiencing the same thing as paul of course we re in the same markets and we ve got a fairly substantial program on the ngtl system we ve got coastal gaslink kind of way and of course there s a few other projects that are going the key to this is to contract well and early to make sure that you have the capacity from a prime perspective but also that you move to name certain folks from a labor perspective because the supervision on some of these spreads is critical so we re doing that and we re satisfied so far that we re getting the right folks and we re getting those contracts done we are seeing some pressure from a labor perspective on prices as we go forward and we re doing what we can to mitigate that andrew m kuske credit suisse ag analyst okay that s helpful color and then maybe just a follow up somewhat related it is just on some of the compressor upgrades that you ve announced to eke out extra capacity on some of the lines but could you maybe give a bit more color on just maybe some of the fuel efficiencies lower emissions profiles and just some of the other benefits that happen for shippers and for yourself stanley stan g chapman iii chairman tc pipelines gp inc executive vice president and president u s natural gas pipelines t yes this is stan i can give you a real good example of a project that we have on our north baja system where we re going to replace three old inefficient compressors with three new state of the art compressors that in the end is going to reduce our ghg footprint on that pipe by 30 that in of itself is a big win for us similarly when you look at columbia s modernization program which year two of or part two which is going to be completed at the end of this year so far to date we ve reduced our emissions profile by about 150 000 tons and we ve done that by not only mothballing inefficient compression but by putting new efficient facilities in place and by remediating a lot of leaks particularly methane leaks where we ve reduced our footprint by 40 from 2016 to 2018 so this is something that we do just as a matter of course every time we have a project that we re looking to build we re asking ourselves how we can improve our environmental footprint as well andrew m kuske credit suisse ag analyst all right thank you perfect operator and the next question is from rob hope from scotiabank please go ahead robert hope scotiabank global banking and markets analyst just taking a look at the capital plan the annual report has that 8 billion the investor day had a 7 2 billion just wondering if you can get some puts and takes on the higher capital plan moving forward donald r marchand executive vice president strategy corporate development and chief financial officer yes rob that s fairly simple it is our spend on coastal gaslink until expected close of the jv and project financing transaction at investor day that was assumed to be around year end but that will be sometime in q1 q2 probably q2 here robert hope scotiabank global banking and markets analyst all right that s helpful and then just when you take a look at your alberta power exposure as it moves down an overall ebitda percentage at some point does it just make sense to exit that business and focus on the pipelines francois poirier chief operating officer and president power storage and mexico i think rob it s francois i think we see some strategic value in that portfolio yes the contracts are going to be rolling off over the next several years we do have a strategic imperative to diversify our fuel mix learn and familiarize ourselves with other technologies here in terms of broadening our technology base we have strong marketing and trading capability in alberta we re one of the incumbent traders in this market that affords us the opportunity to be active in that market and it s a good market for us to experiment in we ve underwritten solar ppas that we talked about that last year we re looking at some waste heat opportunities of our natural gas compressors as well as a combined solar and slow battery project so yes it is modest in size relative to the size of the overall company but strategically we see it as an important line of business in our toolkit for potential future growth and we want to retain some of those core competencies operator and the next question is from alex kania from wolfe research please go ahead alexis stephen kania wolfe research analyt a question on the just the liquids pipelines volume outlook for next year it just i wanted to confirm it sounds like it is a combination of just the kind of ramp up gradually in volumes as you kind of get the resolution from the disruption last fall is it also just a factor of i don t know maybe competitive volumes i mean for the permian as that s built out i m just kind of curious about how and how you look at this kind of beyond just the early 2020 scenario paul miller executive vice president and president liquids pipelines alex this is paul here i ll start with keystone keystone from hardisty down to cushing patoka u s gulf coast that pipeline is 94 contracted we saw the lower volumes in q4 because of the outage we continue under derate but we are managing the impact of that derate by using dra so i see the volumes on keystone long haul ex hardisty to increase back to our 590 000 barrel per day range here in q1 and we ll continue throughout 2020 and beyond where we will see some variability is in our marketlink system south of cushing we ve seen a significant buildup of pipeline capacity in the two million to three million barrel range over the course of about a two year period and that puts tremendous pressure on the brent ti spread which is putting pressure back on the transportation guys we consciously took what contracts we could during the course of 2018 2019 so that we can maintain high flows on that pipeline so about 80 contracted there where we will see some softness is in the spot component on marketlink there s some fairly intensive pipeline pipe competition we are partially insulated with the contracts but we will see some soft spot volumes i think throughout 2020 alexis stephen kania wolfe research analyt great thanks very much operator and the next question is from patrick kenny from national bank please go ahead patrick kenny national bank financial analyst just back to the base keystone system here would you have an update on timing for the third party analysis of the spill and perhaps if you could provide us with a base case assumption for when you might be in a position to bring on the incremental 50 000 barrels a day of capacity paul miller executive vice president and president liquids pipelines patrick it s paul here i don t have a time line of the cause failure analysis that s with the third party consultant and we don t have anything in hand yet we ve been working with them on information exchange etc but that is and i just don t have any visibility into until then under the corrective action order that we have with them so we will stay in this derate situation until then until the pressures are restored and we can continue on our capacity enhancement program we will be operating at that somewhere around 590 000 barrel per day range if i had to venture a guess i would say we would look to start increasing our capacity to accommodate the new contracts we achieved earlier this year in the open season but it won t be until late this year and probably early 2021 before we start ramping up those volumes patrick kenny national bank financial analyst okay that s great and then any comment on how the upcoming regulatory decision here on the frontier project could impact the outlook for kxl directly or indirectly perhaps you could provide some color on what percentage of kxl commercial contracts are earmarked for oil sands projects that have already been fully approved or may still need ottawa s blessing paul miller executive vice president and president liquids pipelines yes we pick up our barrels out of market hub at hardisty we don t have visibility upstream of hardisty on the source of that crude keystone xl today is fully contracted it s fully contracted with the major producers in alberta the creditworthy counterparties so where we sit today we have a fully contracted pipe we re going to pick up our barrels at hardisty and we look forward to providing the marketplace with those barrels patrick kenny national bank financial analyst okay great if i could just sneak in one last one here on the esg front and i agree with you russ i think you guys have a great story to tell and obviously you will always target 0 incidents on the safety front but just curious if you ll be unveiling any 5 or 10 year targets throughout the course of the year as it relates to reducing emissions intensities or any other social or governance metrics russ girling president and chief executive officer i think we re continuing to work on what is it that our shareholders are looking to see we as you probably heard from stan internally we have our own targets with inside of our businesses of what we re trying to achieve from environmental footprint perspective and what we have to do is sort of what the marketplace wants to understand we ve got a lot of data a lot of information and we re working with our shareholders to understand what it is that they want to see so we already have targets internally around what we re trying to achieve on a lot of fronts and i guess you ll stay posted in the coming months as we expand our disclosure around that front there what i can tell you is there will be more because we have more to tell you we have lots of data we re just trying to put it in a format that it s useful for people and it s what they want to hear and what they want to see patrick kenny national bank financial analyst thanks guys operator and the next question is from matt taylor from tudor pickering holt please go ahead matthew taylor tudor pickering analyst on the temporary service protocol from the ngtl system certainly have been a positive pricing response there i m just curious if you could comment on whether you ve accomplished the short term goal there and expect it to revert back or do you expect this to become permanent if so when tracy robinson executive vice president and president canadian natural gas pipelines it s tracy here so the tsp of course is not in effect right now it s something that will be was in effect for the last section of the summer months of 2019 it will go into effect again in april and conclude in october to cover off the summer months and what it s intended to do is to dictate that how we will kind of impact flow when we re in for maintenance it has an impact flow by restricting receipts onto the system which has the impact of allowing it on the delivery side and it s storage that we re going after by the fact that all storage access are on it basis so it allows those summer flows to move into storage more effectively of course the issue in the summer in the basin is that a good chunk of demand disappears as the weather gets better so you have a lot of supply looking for a market can t find it and needs to get to that storage outlet so we have been in the past and continue to work with our customers on alternative solutions for storage access in the summer months and actually all year around and we re working very actively right now on that file so what the agreement is this temporary service protocol will remain in place through the end of this summer period and it won t be extended matthew taylor tudor pickering analyst and then just one last one if i may can you provide some you touched on this at investor day but you can you provide some updated views around m a especially we re seeing in the lng market we ve seen some pretty step downs in global pricing there any opportunities you see there any other interest you might have worth commenting on donald r marchand executive vice president strategy corporate development and chief financial officer yes so it s don again here as i mentioned earlier our plate is pretty full right now with our secured program and potentially moving projects from our development program into our secured program we keep a pretty close eye on everything out there at this point i would say the landscape from our perspective hasn t changed where there d be a very select number of opportunities we d be interested in and possibly at prices that we d never transact that but no i wouldn t say there s anything in our scopes at this point in time matthew taylor tudor pickering analyst right thanks donald r marchand executive vice president strategy corporate development and chief financial officer thanks matt operator and the next question is from shneur gershuni from ubs please go ahead and the next question is from shneur gershuni from ubs please go ahead shneur z gershuni ubs investment bank analyst i wanted to follow up maybe on praneeth s question stan you d respond to his question about shippers in the northeast specifically around the e p or producer customers but you also mentioned in your response production has started to decline a little bit how do you feel about the marketing volumes that are on the pipe in terms of those contracts renewing and so forth the spreads in the different pools or the different hubs i mean they ll still stay on or is that a risk where they can potentially roll off and not be renewed stanley stan g chapman iii chairman tc pipelines gp inc executive vice president and president u s natural gas pipelines t yes i think this is stan and most of our contracts are long term in nature so if you look across the entire columbia gas system their are contract terms of eight years or more anr is that 10 years and more and would specifically to the producer contracts their initial terms were 15 and 16 year contracts that started two years ago so we have another 12 or 13 years before we need to worry about contracts rolling off at any material size or scale with respect to our assets shneur z gershuni ubs investment bank analyst okay fair enough and maybe wondering if we can just sort of pivot to the dividend guidance that was presented today you have a dividend guidance for this year and then you ve got for 2021 8 to 10 eps is flat this year but dividend is growing so i assume the payout ratio is increasing with the growth next year as well should we expect that the payout ratio is rising than 8 as well or is there growth offset i m just trying to square with all the efforts you ve made to bring your leverage down does this cause leverage to start going back up especially with a little bit higher capex are the agencies ok with that just wondering if you can sort of comment about the thought process with the board with the targets that were set donald r marchand executive vice president strategy corporate development and chief financial officer yes it s don here we take a pretty long term view on this we when you look back over a 20 year time horizon we ve largely been in the 80 to 90 of comparable earnings payout and that s what 40 of cash flow and given the robust 2019 that we ve come off of probably below those ranges so we ll go back into them and our guidance going forward of 8 to 10 through 2021 and then 5 to 7 thereafter factors in no change to payout ratios and full compliance with the credit metrics i outlined earlier shneur z gershuni ubs investment bank analyst interesting you said that so when you re saying that there will be no change to payout ratio does that mean that we should sort of think that eps will effectively grow in 2021 by 10 if that could be a thought guide donald r marchand executive vice president strategy corporate development and chief financial officer no we re probably below the 80 to 90 comparable earnings if you look at a 3 24 dividend on 414 million of earnings we re well below that range right now so again if you re looking at this more less like an ekg chart more something that s long term linear algorithmic it s 80 to 90 of comparable earnings will stray in and out of it from time to time but that s there s been no change over 20 years here on that russ girling president and chief executive officer i think you heard us say at investor day and we ve said it a number of times over the last 20 years or so by allocating 40 of our free cash flow to dividends and 60 to growing our businesses mathematically if we invest that 60 cash flow in that 7 to 8 kind of return range we generate a long term growth rate of 6 7 8 and over the last 20 years we ve reinvested about 100 billion we generated a growth rate of earnings and cash flow per share of about 7 and hence the dividend growth rate of about 7 i think what don s saying is over the long term i don t think about it in annual terms think about it over the next five years our expectation would be is that we would revert back to that mean we ve had some what we would call hypergrowth in our world of 8 to 10 over the last couple of years but we ve got some tailwinds of interest rate reduction demand for our system buying colombia they gave us some tailwinds to get into that 8 to 10 range but i think what we re saying is long term you can expect us to grow earnings and cash flow in that kind of range of 5 to 7 and i think you ve got a long term track record of us doing that and as we ve always said our dividend is based on sustainable increases in earnings and cash flow and those ratios that don gave you are the ratios that we have used for the last 20 years so that s i think you can look at our history and as we said this year i mean we had a pretty good 2019 you had the tailwinds of some pretty good commodity markets on our liquid side some tailwinds in filling all of our businesses things that we don t expect to have reoccurring next year i d say that we re in you are in the sort of p100 range on that 5 of our portfolio that s variable we re going to be in 2020 our expectations will be closer to p50 or less on that variable component but overall if you look at the growth rate of our earnings cash flow per share and that s our dividends per share you see a number of 7 to 8 over a 20 year period donald r marchand executive vice president strategy corporate development and chief financial officer yes and the guidance introduced at investor day post 2021 wa 5 to 7 and consistent with the long term view and payouts and credit metrics on the right where we are in that range and that s an organic 5 to 7 it could be bolstered by transformational activity in the future that we never budget for but it s the mix of projects the cadence of the projects and how we execute on those projects where we end up in this range we added another 1 3 billion of projects today we think our asset base will continue to generate new opportunities in corridor here going forward so again long winded answer but we re comfortable in that range but don t see any change to long term payout metrics here at all shneur z gershuni ubs investment bank analyst alright perfect well thank you very much appreciate donald r marchand executive vice president strategy corporate development and chief financial officer thank you operator and the next question is from michael lapides from goldman sachs please go ahead michael jay lapides goldman sachs group inc analyst i ll be real quick when we think about the bruce unit six mcr this year safe just from an economic perspective to assume that the biggest impact is simply the lost megawatt hours and if so how long is it a full year or is it just a couple of months how should we think about what the extent of those lost megawatt hours are during the year francois poirier chief operating officer and president power storage and mexico michael it s francois so the mcr unit 6 we opened breaker on january seven as expected and it s not expected the mcr program is not expected to conclude on that unit until 2023 for the balance of the units the other seven units that remain in operation you can expect roughly mid 80 range availability on average over the course of this year and frankly over the next couple of years as well operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes the

the government has denied claims by the opposition national democratic congress ndc that it has over the past three years mismanaged ghana s oil revenues the ndc at a policy dialogue series on wednesday addressed by the member of parliament for yapei kasawgu mr john jinapor accused the government of wasting resources and insisted the ndc has a far superior record when its tenure is compared to that of the akufo addo government he described the vice president s presentation at the kumasi town hall meeting on tuesday on ghana s energy sector as containing factual inaccuracies but in a reaction at a press briefing on friday the deputy minister of energy dr mohammed amin adam said the ndc s claims are false as the government has rather improved the financial positions of distressed entities in the oil sector below is a copy of the government s response to the ndc s claims ministry of energy response to the ndc press statement on the state of the energy sector in ghana friday 14th february 2020 introduction on wednesday the 12 of february 2020 the national democratic congress ndc held a press conference on the state of the energy sector in ghana this statement is a response by government to the unsubstantiated claims and allegations as well as the factual errors and misrepresentations contained in their statement ndc that they adopted policies and programmes to ensure the nation consistently increased its share in most petroleum agreements that were negotiated and that ghana s share in the three oil producing fields kept increasing from 13 6 to 20 1 jubilee 2007 13 6 2 ten 15 3 sankofa gye nyame fields 20 they added that this incremental sequence in the growth of ghana s shares under the ndc government clearly demonstrates a conscious and consistent effort to increase ghana s stake in petroleum agreements response the ndc cannot claim credit for the growth in government take in these contracts these petroleum agreements were all negotiated and signed by the npp government under president kufour all the petroleum agreements that are producing crude oil in ghana were signed by the kufour s government ndc that all the thirteen 13 petroleum agreements that came to force under the ndc had enhanced fiscal terms and increased national stake response if those petroleum agreements did not have enhanced fiscal terms that would have been problematic because they were signed after several discoveries of crude oil an indication of relatively de risked basins in spite of this the ndc failed to understand conditions of the market at the time they signed these agreements hence the increased fiscal terms achieved in the petroleum agreements have taken us nowhere for most of them the 13 agreements signed by the ndc were signed between 2013 and 2016 out of these the only companies that have met their minimum obligations are eni and springfield agm had to change ownership under the npp government before it could meet its obligations the remaining 10 companies were to drill 11 wells they have not drilled a single well they were to spend 700 million but they spent only 30 million these are the contracts with the so called enhanced fiscal terms we have always said that zero percent of 100 is zero so if you have the highest fiscal terms in contracts that do not lead to production it amounts to nothing the ndc on various platforms has attributed their failure to the itlos provisional judgement that froze activities during the period however it is important to note that only three of the agreements the ndc signed were affected by itlos agm amni international and erin agreements even one of the companies affected by itlos agm has recently announced crude oil discovery what happened to the rest we must understand that fiscal terms alone do not define the success of government negotiations of oil contracts the experience and financial capacity of a company are equally important afterall the objective of every government is to negotiate a contract that can result in oil production a fiscal strategy should therefore inspire increased reserves and production however the ndc s negotiated fiscal terms have not achieved these ndc that they took a bold step in establishing the public interest and accountability committee piac as an independent statutory body mandated to promote transparency and accountability in the management of petroleum resources in ghana response the ndc created a weak piac as the committee was not given teeth to bite but to merely produce semi annual and annual reports whose adverse findings cannot be enforced piac cannot prosecute or summon officials the npp government is currently holding consultations with stakeholders on a draft natural resources governance bill which is going to empower piac to enforce its findings the npp government is committed to transparency and accountability in the oil and gas industry the npp government passed the general petroleum regulations which provided significant transparency reforms including a requirement to disclose beneficial ownership information in petroleum agreements and disclose marketing contracts signed by gnpc as well as corporate social responsibility projects the petroleum exploration and production act provided for the establishment of a register of petroleum agreements and the application of open and competitive bidding of oil blocks however it took the commitment of the npp government to establish the register and to conduct ghana s first open bidding round for oil blocks ndc that they repositioned bost and tor to become strong companies only for the npp government to weaken them and that they secured two 2 million barrels of ghana s crude oil from the ten fields to be processed by tor response the ndc almost collapsed tor and bost the claim that bost and tor were strengthened cannot be true contrary to the ndcs claim that bost was making profits during their time the facts do not support this bost in january 2017 when the ndc handed over power owed 624 million to suppliers bdcs and related parties in respect of crude oil imports for processing at tor and refined products which got lost from bost tanks but as at february 2020 the outstanding amount to settle to clear the books now stand at 57 million an audit on bost accounts shows that between the periods 2013 to 2016 there was a significant rise in the net losses by the company with the highest net loss of ghc 569 million recorded in the year 2016 the 2018 management account showed a 70 reduction in losses from the previous year 2017 similarly the 2019 management account indicated a further 41 reduction in the loss level from the year 2018 this steady decline in the loss level of the company from 2017 to 2019 shows that during the year 2020 the company will likely make a profit bost under the npp government is in a better position bost continues to pursue its objectives including holding strategic reserves of petroleum products other private depots also hold sufficient stocks which together with bost provide enough buffer for product supply we want to assure the people of ghana that unlike the ndc s time when we had long queues at petroleum stations for three days in june 2014 due to fuel shortage the akufo addo government will never expose ghanaians to such a crisis the following shows our reserve position petrol 3 5 weeks diesel 4 7 weeks aviation fuel 8 7 weeks lpg 1 week on the tema oil refinery the 2 million barrels of crude oil referred to by the ndc was not refined at the end of 2016 because the plants were not operational how do you secure crude for processing by a plant that is not operational it does not make sense under the stewardship of the npp government tor undertook a shutdown maintenance which enabled the facility to refine the 2 million barrels of crude in 2017 ndc they accused the government of renegotiating the agm agreement under bizarre and opaque circumstances they stated in the renegotiated agreement gnpc s additional participating interest was reduced from 15 to 3 as if that was not enough explorco s commercial interest of 24 was dropped to zero response the agm petroleum agreement was signed under the ndc government however the company could not meet its minimum obligations following the acquisition of the company the new owner presented a request for renegotiation to provide some incentives to support the prospects presented by the block described as the deepest oil block in ghana this renegotiation is allowed under the petroleum law and in the agreement itself government granted some incentives which resulted in the company drilling two mandatory wells and an additional well the increase in investments led the company to make oil and gas discoveries in 2019 the incentives provided have paid off as the intended objectives have been achieved the government also took advantage of the request for renegotiation to evaluate the financial position of gnpc in relation to its ownership interest in the block given its many commitments and the need to prevent it from being over exposed gnpc decided to divest part of its paid interest curiously the ndc was economical with the truth by concealing from ghanaians that the npp government also renegotiated ghana s free carried interest from 10 to 15 and local participation from 2 5 to 5 this is intellectual dishonesty negotiation is give and take in our view we had a net gain additionally crude oil discoveries have been made under this renegotiated contract this also means that ghana s take has increased without the requirement to invest about a billion united states dollars the country would have been required to do under the previous agreement this has reduced gnpc s exposure ndc that their investigations have revealed that a new company by name quad energy which was subsequently awarded a 5 free carried interest was registered a month before the akufo addo led government triggered the parliamentary processes to amend the petroleum agreement and that this beat the imagination of many well meaning ghanaians and experts in the petroleum sector response the qualification to be an indigenous ghanaian company in an oil license is that the company must be incorporated in ghana and must have 80 of its management and 100 of all other staff being ghanaians the said quad energy is therefore qualified by law to participate in an oil block the subject of a local company acquiring interest in an oil block is a commercial one it depends on the commercial partners i e the international oil company and the local company it must be noted also that quad is a consortium of old local ghanaian companies who all quality to operate in the oil and gas industry and not new as the ndc wants to portray ndc that the aker agm agreement is the highest level of betrayal by this government as it clearly smacks of corruption and raises serious transparency and accountability issues because of concessions granted to aker energy in the amended agreement response we find it curious why the ndc alleges lack of transparency and corruption in the aker project the agreement and all its contents were scrutinized and approved by parliament which included the minority bench the allegation therefore betrays the ndc s understanding of transparency the ndc has as yet not mentioned any corrupt act involving any official of the government in the aker contract we challenge them to do so on the incentives provided to aker energy we should understand that project economics can be enhanced with incentives when market conditions adversely affect the prospects of profitability and the ndc knows this well the decision to incentivize the project was further informed by the imminent threat of declining crude oil production and its potential effect on our economy the oil production profile of ghana shows that the contributions of the three producing fields will peak and reach plateau levels of approximately 230 000 bbls per day in 2020 and maintain that production level up to 2023 after which production levels will begin to decline if new fields are not brought on line if we have to discuss incentives then the ndc was the first to provide incentives to an oil company eni in the sankofa gye nyame project through a supplementary agreement and a fiscal support package the incentives were 1 an exempt debt to equity ratio of 2 1 at 7 interest on the commercial loans of the contractors when the original agreement did not have such exemptions the 7 interest allowed was too high as most commercial loans attract much less interest rates these exempted the interest expenses from tax deduction 2 a gas price of 9 8 per mmbtu if you added this to the transportation fee it became the most expensive globally for an indigenous gas this price competed with imported lng price 3 the government and gnpc offered through the supplementary agreement to make the initial gas price of 9 8 mmbtu viable by providing a fiscal package to the tune of 250 million a total of 125 million was to be provided by gnpc upfront whilst the remaining fiscal concessions amounting to another 125 million to be provided by government was to ran over the project life 4 in the event that gnpc was unable to make an upfront payment in cash to the contractors it would allow the contractors to over lift gnpc s share of oil at the beginning of production of oil 5 the government was required under the security package and fiscal support agreement to issue five 5 different sovereign guarantees estimated at about 1 5 billion in addition to world bank and ida guarantees 6 a government disbursement account to be used for payment for gas supplied to gnpc was to be established and gnpc was required to transfer its 55 share of the carried and participating interests from the jubilee fields into the account gnpc could not use its funds for any purposes until after sankofa gas payments were made this was to grind gnpc s operations to a halt 7 the gas sales agreement provided for take or pay clauses and prioritized sankfa gas over all others the implications of these incentives were very grave for the country these were 1 the country lost revenue as a result of the exemption of interest expenses from tax deductibility 2 the negotiated gas price of 9 8 per mmbtu ensured that the composite domestic gas price became 8 8 per mmbtu the price of our indigenous gas was more expensive than imported gas from nigeria which was sold at 8 3 per mmbtu 3 as a result of prioritizing sankofa gas over jubilee gas which president kufour negotiated for free for ghana and ten gas which is very cheap we have not been able to maximize the use of our free jubilee gas as we are compelled to off take more sankofa gas we take 70 mmscfd of gas from jubilee which is free against 154 mmscfd from sankofa 4 as a result of less gas off take from jubilee oil production from the jubilee fields has declined for example it is estimated that we lose about 15 000 bbls of crude oil per day because of the higher gas to oil ratio multiply 15 000 bbls by 365 days 5 475 000 bbls a year assuming no lose production days multiply by 60 per barrel it gives you us 328 5 million lost to the jubilee partners and ghana ghana is losing money because of ndc government s recklessness and tullow oil is about to lay off 25 of its workers mostly ghanaians 5 the ndc claims success over the 50 domestic requirement for lpg which is processed by the atuabo gas processing plant now you know that if we were maximizing gas export from the jubilee fields we could have been supplying 100 of our lpg requirement the npp government has proven to be better managers of the oil and gas sector this is because 1 we have renegotiated the domestic gas price from 8 8 per mmbtu to 6 08 per mmbtu the gas price would have been lower if sankofa gas price was less expensive 2 we have restored the price of ghana s gas from jubilee to zero from the 3 per mmbtu which the ndc government imposed on ghanaians why did they do this 3 we have recently negotiated with the gas producers to increase gas export from jubilee from 70 mmscfd to 125 mmscfd to recover more oil and increase lpg supply from domestic sources the npp government has recently launched a new strategy for the upstream oil and gas sector anchored on aggressive exploration and the attraction of companies with track record this has become necessary because the value of oil may decline in future as a result of climate change and declining funding for fossil fuel projects it is therefore imperative that our strategy to provide incentive is aimed at exploiting as much potential reserves as we find to maximize benefits to the nation while oil is still valuable ndc that the utilisation of revenues especially abfa and esla proceeds under this administration has been most disappointing the provided for instance that in the 2018 financial year only 49 of abfa expenditure was used for capital expenditure whilst 51 was utilized for the supply of goods and services a clear violation of the petroleum revenue management act response this demonstrates the ndc s poor understanding of the law that they passed the petroleum revenue management act 2011 act 815 there is no requirement anywhere in the law requiring a dedicated allocation of the abfa to capital expenditure section 21 4 of the law provides for a minimum of 70 of abfa to be used for public investment expenditure public investments do not necessarily mean capital expenditure for example in the year of reference and subsequently our government allocated more of the abfa towards the free senior high school programme is that not public investment due to the fact that part of the expenditure from the allocation to the free senior high school programme went to non capital spending the ndc misunderstood this to mean a violation of the law this is wrong section 21 4 of the petroleum revenue management act 2011 act 815 provides as follows for any financial year a minimum of seventy percent of the annual budget funding amount shall be used for public investment expenditure consistent with the long term national development plan or with sub section 3 interestingly apart from the fact that expenditure on providing free senior high education to our people is the most significant public investment section 3 of the law which lists items to be invested in includes service delivery in education science and technology therefore if we were to evaluate the spending of the abfa on public investments as per section 3 of the act 919 one would realize that we exceeded the minimum 70 consistent with the law the ndc must come again ndc that due to their foresight they successfully completed the atuabo gas processing plant which has dramatically improved reliable fuel supply in ghana reduced the cost of fuel for thermal power production saved the country over us 300million per annum due to a reduction of about 80 in lco imports response we applaud the ndc government for building the gas processing plant it continues to play a significant role in the energy space of our country however the attempt to play politics with it should not cloud the ndc s judgement into claiming savings without exposing the cost of their inactions on the project you will recall that the project executed by sinopec failed to meet several completion dates indeed the project was delayed for four years as a result of the ndc government s indecision and corrupt motives the decision to build the gas processing plant was not made by the ndc government the kufour government agreed with the jubilee partners to construct the plant when it successfully negotiated 200 billion cubic feet of free gas for ghana however upon coming into office the ndc opted for a loan facility to undertake the project the world bank s offer to give a concessionary facility to the government to build the plant was also turned down the government instead went for a facility from the china development bank leading to the award of the epc contract to sinopec a comparison of the savings the ndc is claiming with the cost of the project as well as the revenue losses to the state reveals a lot about the character of the ndc it is estimated that the four year delay in the completion of the project cost our country an annual average of 550 million which translated into 2 2 billion the losses were from vra s loss of revenue due to the money used for lco purchases lost revenue from lpg for ghana gas and gas sales revenue the cost of the protracted power crises from 2012 over the period as a result of the delay in the completion of the project cannot be quantified the jubilee partners had to build a third reinjection well at a cost of 100 million in october 2013 the excessive re injection of gas has led to a higher gas to oil ratio leading to crude oil production loss and its revenue we are still losing revenue to date ndc that the ndc government ended dumsor and challenged us to switch off president mahama s power plants and the gas processing plant to see the unimaginable magnitude of dumsor ghana will witness response such a myopic challenge is not surprising coming from the ndc i wonder what would have happened to the country under the ndc government of president mahama if they switched of plants built by dr kwame nkrumah president rawlings and president kuffour therefore it is simplistic to assume that only president mahama built power plants in ghana we wish to remind the ndc that we are using the mahama power plants not because there are no other generating plants most of which are owned by government but because they committed the state to take or pay contracts over those plants which require us to pay for the power even if we don t use the power president akufo addo will not subject ghanaians to such a challenge by shutting down the plants and still be paying for them with taxes from ghanaians on the causes of dumsor we state emphatically that the power crises was not technical it was financial as at the time we had power shortage our installed capacity was over 3 000mw whilst peak demand stood at 1 800mw the government failed to raise money to buy fuel when gas was not available even when the ndc was leaving office dumsor was still a major part of our country s story it did not only claim the position a minister who failed to help president mahama end it but extracted a golden confession the hon john jinapor in october 2016 reportedly confessed frankly money is a challenge ecg workers as at july 2016 also confessed mahama sitting on dumsor timetable ecg workers according to reports quoting mr samuel tetteh agbetor chairman of the western regional workers union of ecg source the ndc s solution to dumsor was to sign several unwanted power contracts some of which today have imposed serious financial burden on the state due to excess capacity payments in 2018 the cost of excess power generation capacity was an estimated 320 million in capacity charges as a result of new power plants commissioned in 2019 the excess generation capacity increased the capacity charge costs to 620 million annually power contracts are signed on take or pay basis which means that the cost of power has to be paid whether the power is used or not this is what has given rise to the excess power payments under the current purc methodology for electricity capacity charges for excess capacity generation are not included the government has been compelled to find money to finance part of this the ndc has no moral grounding to speak on ghana s energy sector after such abysmal failure to manage the sector and the people of ghana can attest to this as we all witnessed the wanton abuse of our patience theirs was a period of deal making instead of strategy driven solutions conclusion the government of president akufo addo has demonstrated significant commitment and resolve to manage the energy resources of our country efficiently for the benefit of our people as a government we take criticisms but such criticisms should be constructive and not based on propaganda deliberately packaged to deceive the people of ghana for political advantage there is no doubt that the ndc showed extreme recklessness in negotiations of oil contracts and power contracts which to day are suffocating our country overburdening our national budget and adversely affecting the pace of national development the npp government wishes to assure the people of ghana that we will not relent in ensuring that the vision of our president in applying our energy resources to build and expand ghana s industrial base to secure sustained economic transformation and to create wealth and jobs for our people is achieved disclaimer opinions expressed here are those of the writers and do not

lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer thank you ken our fourth quarter adjusted results were as we expected with sales flat to last year operating income of 205 million or 8 4 of sales and eps of 2 25 for the year our sales were 10 billion adjusted operating income was 938 million or 9 4 of sales and eps was 10 04 our cash generation remained strong with operating and free cash flow for the quarter of about 440 million and 300 million for the year operating and free cash flow were about 1 4 billion and 870 million our leverage is approaching historical lows which provides us the flexibility to pursue additional opportunities in the period we bought back approximately 23 million of stock for a total of 375 million since authorized we anticipated our business as we anticipated our business remained challenged by soft demand greater competition and reduced production volume in the us markets continued to be influenced by the strong dollar and the impact of lvt on other product categories consumer confidence remained high and lower us interest rates are positively influencing new and existing home sales us tariffs on clickable lvt from china were ascended in the fourth quarter and market pricing has declined for these products imports of ceramic tile from china dropped off substantially in the fourth quarter and shipments from other countries have not offset which we believe is due to soft demand and a reduction in us ceramic inventories competition has increased in our global markets impacting our pricing and mix as we leverage higher investments in sales and marketing to drive growth many countries where we operate are stimulating their economies with lower interest rates to encourage greater consumer spending and economic growth this year in the near term we still anticipate continued pressure in our markets and product categories throughout the period we implemented changes to increase sales and reduce costs we ve enhanced our lvt manufacturing in the us and europe and realigned our us carpet operations we have decreased our ceramic production and inventories and are taking out a wood flooring plant in the united states and in europe we are reducing the complexity of our operations improving processes to reduce costs and increasing automation to improve efficiencies we continue to improve the productivity and volume of our new lvt us countertop russian sheet vinyl and european carpet tile investments our acquisitions in australian and brazil are installing state of the art equipment that will expand their product portfolios we are introducing new design and performance innovations to enhance our market position and broaden our customer base to promote both new and existing products we re making higher levels of sales and marketing investments for a review of our financial performance during the period i ll turn the call over to glenn glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you jeff and good morning everyone moving right into our financial performance and year over year bridges as jeff shared in the fourth quarter total company net sales were 2 4 billion down 1 compared to prior year as reported and off approximately 2 on a constant basis which we define as adjusted for fx and days for the full year 2019 total company net sales were flat compared to 2018 as reported and up 2 on a constant basis organic growth in the legacy businesses was down 3 in the fourth quarter versus prior year on a constant basis and down 2 for the full year compared to 2018 also on a constant basis in terms of earnings the company s adjusted operating income was 205 million in the fourth quarter or 8 4 off 140 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year largely due to weaker volume and price mix only partially offset by improved productivity including lower start up costs with that said the company s year over year decline in margins improved on a sequential basis by 100 basis points which now represents four consecutive quarters of improvement bridging from the prior year fourth quarter adjusted operating earnings were impacted by number one lower overall volume of 10 million largely in our global ceramic and flooring north america segments and associated market related downtime costs of 4 million all taken in global ceramics to match our supply with our demand number two a modest increase in inflation of 3 million due to higher wages and benefits partially offset by lower raw materials number three an erosion of price mix of 24 million largely in our flooring rest of the world segment following easing input costs and 11 million higher spending in sg a and other due to investments in sales talent and marketing to drive sales moving to the positive offset productivity including lower start up costs swung positive by 16 million versus last year due to better utilization and non repeating one time items for the full year adjusted operating income was 938 million or 9 4 of sales off 250 basis points from prior year staying at the enterprise level adjusted sg a per net sales was 19 1 in the quarter excluding unusual items up 180 basis points year over year due to higher sales marketing and merchandising expenses to roll out new products and to grow in new markets inflation acquisition lower volume and one time charges also impacted the quarter for the full year adjusted sg a was 18 4 of sales up 100 basis points year over year and just to be clear relative to the rollback of tariffs on clickable lvt product from china prior to tariffs we had already raised inventory significantly and have since reduced purchases in 2019 as we reduced inventory and ramped up our us production we also have purchased from other countries in this period so the total gross rebate amounted to 13 5 million which is in our guidance spread over three quarters and largely offset by inventory value on hand special and unusual items in the fourth quarter consisted of a 50 million charge for restructuring and integration costs of which most was non cash and divided relatively evenly among completing us carpet realignment and rightsizing the company s wood manufacturing footprints in flooring north america and flooring rest of the world as well as a 136 million one time tax benefit associated with the consolidation of business activities in europe within a single operating entity to improve management and increase efficiencies also reducing the company s tax rate somewhat in 2019 for the full year total restructuring and integration charges taken for actions in flooring north america and flooring rest of the world were 111 million of which approximately 41 million was cash and as we have said the cash cost associated with carpet restructuring of approximately 30 million will be recovered as operational savings as lower cost pass through inventory in the first half of this year reaching full run rate in the third quarter adjusted ebitda was 363 million or 15 before interest expense of 11 million for the full year adjusted ebitda was 1 5 billion or 15 3 the effective tax rate on a non gaap basis was 18 9 in the fourth quarter and 20 6 for the full year of 19 finally adjusted net earnings per share was 2 25 in the quarter down from 2 53 or 11 versus last year and for the full year adjusted net earnings per share was 10 04 down from 12 33 versus 2018 now let me turn to the segments and i m only going to speak to the fourth quarter here the global ceramic segment delivered net sales of 858 million flat versus prior year as reported or a decrease of 1 5 on a constant basis looking at only at our legacy businesses sales decreased approximately 4 on a constant basis operating income on an adjusted basis was 54 million or 6 3 of net sales down from a 10 1 margin last year primarily due to increased competition and weaker demand in the us coupled with higher inflation so compared to last year at the segment level inflation was 16 million higher driven by higher wages and materials and benefits volume was off 14 million inclusive of 4 million of downtime sales marketing and other costs were up 5 million price mix slipped 4 million and this was all partially offset by improved productivity and lower start up costs of 6 million fx in the quarter was neutral let s move to flooring north america the business showed better overall performance with sales of 936 million down 4 versus last year as reported and down 5 on a constant basis as continued weakness in soft surfaces were partially offset by continued growth in lvt operating income on an adjusted basis was 69 million or 7 4 of net sales in the fourth quarter bridging from last year volume was down 17 million versus last year and accounted for the majority of the deficit price mix lagged prior year by approximately 6 million raw material cost decreases offset increases in wages and benefits keeping inflation flat and productivity less reduced start up costs was bettered by 6 million moving to flooring rest of the world the segment had a solid quarter with sales of 630 million up 2 6 versus last year as reported and 3 7 on a constant basis looking just at the legacy business sales were up 1 5 on a constant basis adjusted operating income came in at 89 million or 14 2 of sales in the quarter an increase of 140 basis points versus last year in a very competitive environment mainly as a result of increased volume going to the bridge volume was better by 18 million price mix lift by 15 million but was largely offset by relief in overall inflation of 11 million driven by lower input costs productivity including lower start up costs was 3 million and investments in sales product marketing and other were 6 million higher in the quarter fx was again neutral for the quarter finally at the corporate level expenses and eliminations drove an operating loss of 8 million with a full year cost of 40 million speaking now to the balance sheet receivables ended the quarter at 1 5 billion with days sales outstanding up due to changes in geographic and channel mix inventories ended the quarter at approximately 2 3 billion or 134 days higher in days versus prior year by approximately six days but relatively flat in dollars as we continued to adjust our production to match our sales fixed assets for the quarter ended at 4 7 billion and capital expenditures of 140 million in the period lower than depreciation and amortization which was 154 million so for the full year capex was at 545 million lower than our d a of 576 million as we efficiently managed our q4 project spend in each of our segments total debt was 2 6 billion at the end of the quarter down approximately 200 million versus the third quarter with leverage declining to 1 6 times debt to adjusted ebitda wrapping up the balance sheet is strong and getting stronger with free cash flow of 300 million in the quarter totaling 873 million in 2019 capping off a very solid year at overall cash generation so with that chris i ll turn it over to you w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic thanks glenn in our global ceramic segment most of our markets faced a combination of soft demand and excess industry capacity that is compressing market prices and margins during the quarter our us ceramic business remained under pressure from lvt taking share and high industry inventories from ceramic purchases ahead of tariffs additionally to align our own inventory levels we meaningfully reduced production in our north american ceramic plants which increased our cost we have started to see some trends that should benefit our business in 2020 compared to the prior year fourth quarter total us ceramic imports declined 17 with chinese ceramic imports falling 90 lower interest rates and improving new and existing home sales should also benefit the market this year to improve our sales we are rolling out multiple new products and adding sales representatives and design consultants in major markets our new collections aimed at replacing imports are gaining momentum to increase productivity and reduce cost for our customers we have streamlined ordering processes and made picking up orders at our service centers faster and easier we continue to enhance our showrooms and galleries to better communicate the beauty and performance of our ceramic products during the fourth quarter we initiated manufacturing of our new click tile in multiple sizes and designs a proprietary product has been tested in both residential and commercial applications and has received positive reviews for faster and less expensive installation that is able to be walked on the same day we are launching click tile at our trade show this quarter and have already received commitments from major customers we are expanding our mosaic and wall tile offerings to meet growing demand for these categories our quartz countertop sales continued to increase as we ramp up the productivity and throughput at our new tennessee plant we are developing more sophisticated visuals to enhance our manufactured quartz collections and improve our margins sales of our large porcelain slabs from europe are growing and we are increasing the sales of dal tile branded lvt products in mexico the economy continued to face headwinds due to uncertainty around the us trade with the overall construction activity declining in the fourth quarter we are gaining share by expanding our brands distribution and product offerings with larger sizes porcelain products and more comprehensive wall tile collection we are increasing our participation in the commercial markets and enlarging our base of stores that exclusively sell our products despite a soft economy in brazil we had good sales growth during the period due to our strong brand and product offering in december we initiated production on a new porcelain tile line that produces larger sizes to expand our premium offering to increase our sales in other south american countries we are updating our showrooms and expanding distribution the southern european economies remained slow impacting our primary ceramic markets and industry pricing in this environment we increased our volume even as lagging consumer confidence reduced demand in the larger retail remodeling channel we are expanding our activities in the commercial channels as well as outdoor products to extend our style leadership we are introducing new premium products with the surface structures aligned with the printed design to create more realistic visuals our medium priced products have enhanced our results with new sizes and visuals sales of our porcelain slabs grew dramatically from a small base during 2019 with the products gaining greater utilization in traditional areas as well as for countertops we are increasing our inventories at our regional warehouses in poland greece and romania to expand our customer base with faster local service we continue to specialize our plants by product type to optimize our cost and improve our competitive position in russia we grew our ceramic sales in a soft market our growth was driven by our unique business model that includes the industry s most comprehensive premium offering a national distribution network owned and franchise retail stores and the strongest project specification organization in the industry to further strengthen our position in 2020 we expect to expand the stores that exclusively sell our products to more than 400 locations across the country to support our growth we are starting up additional porcelain production to make super large sizes and a new plant to produce coordinated premium sanitary ware in our flooring north america segment we have executed many initiatives to align the business with the present market conditions we faced a challenging market with lvt growth continuing to impact sales of other product categories as expected our pricing and mix remained under pressure as customers traded down and lower production levels raised the cost lower raw material costs during the period were offset by a more competitive environment we streamlined our infrastructure by closing three plants consolidating high cost operations and reducing wood manufacturing the effects of these actions will increase and flow through the inventory with full cost benefit in the third period to reduce costs we have implemented numerous process improvements executed machine modifications and increased our recycled polyester production we are leveraging automation and equipment advances to produce comparable volumes with the smaller manufacturing footprint in the period our residential carpet sales performed best in the new home construction and multifamily channels our new carpet introductions were well received at the national flooring trade show and they will be in the marketplace early 2020 we are leveraging our strengths in design and fiber technology to deliver differentiated new collections in both premium and value categories in the luxury and super soft categories we have extended our multi color and pattern capabilities in our proprietary smartstrand silk collections colormax mohawk s exclusive color blending technology is rapidly growing in the marketplace with its natural pallet that coordinates with wood and stone looks we have increased our recycled polyester fiber capacity to expand our participation in the fastest growing carpet category in commercial we are coordinating the colors and stylings of our carpet in lvt collections to enhance the design options we have introduced award winning collections for schools and workplaces with nature based designs to increase our focus by channel we are expanding our commercial sales organization and enhancing their skills we continue to invest in new design capabilities proprietary carpet tile backings and a material manufacturing to create greater value for customers and improve our cost we have increased the production and speeds of our lvt operations and ongoing initiatives will further improve formulations and throughput we are now operating at similar speeds to our european lvt operations during the period us tariffs on click lvt were removed and the market has adjusted pricing to reflect this change to expand our price points and highlight our unique visuals and features we are introducing new collections for both the residential and commercial markets our expanded premium pergo and karastan collections have been well received at trade shows due to their leading visuals and styling the virus in china is postponing some production start ups and it could potentially disrupt some lvt service depending on when shipments resume sales of our waterproof laminate products are expanding across most channels and we anticipate continued market growth due to their realistic appearance durability and ease of installation the detailed visuals and performance features of our premium laminate collections are increasingly being used as alternatives for both wood and lvt to support higher laminate sales we are upgrading our hdf board production to increase capacity and reduce cost our flooring rest of world segment continued to deliver strong results in the period the segment s business is less exposed to those european countries which are having more economic difficulties across this segment our investments in product innovation cost improvements acquisitions and new businesses strengthened our results we are outperforming the european laminate market with our focus on premium products that are more realistic with unique features sales of our new laminate collection are ramping up quickly due to an enhanced level of sophistication in the period we absorbed higher marketing cost to support this introduction we announced the consolidation of our wood manufacturing to our facility in malaysia which will improve our cost and flexibility to better service our customers our lvt sales grew as our new manufacturing productivity significantly improved to further enhance our plant performance we are implementing specific initiatives to improve throughput material cost and waste to utilize our growing capacity we are introducing new rigid collections that are being well received in the retail diy and commercial channels we are expanding our lvt offering to our european distribution system to broaden our specialty store penetration our sheet vinyl sales increased primarily from strong growth in russia the russian plant is operating well and positively contributing to our results our european carpet tile business is expanding from a small base by increasing our sales organization and introducing higher value products to the market our panels business continues to perform well as we introduced higher value products to improve our mix we are increasing the use of recycled wood to benefit our cost and the environment the expansion of our glue plant is operating well and is contributing positively to our results we are also installing a second waste to energy plant to reduce our cost and increase recycling this year our installation business had good results with higher sales volume even as declining material costs considerably lowered market prices in australia and new zealand we had good performance we are launching many new carpet collections in multiple fiber to enhance our residential offering our hard surface products had strong growth with lvt outperforming new carpet tile collections are being introduced to support our new commercial carpet tile line that is being constructed with that i ll return the call to you jeff jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer thank you chris market conditions remain challenging across most of our businesses and geographies in response we are adjusting our business strategies enhancing our product offering and restructuring operations and are increasing our investments in sales and marketing expanding our commercial participation and enhancing both our premium and value collections we are bringing new products innovations and categories to the market that will broaden our distribution in the new channels and geographies our new lvt countertop sheet vinyl and carpet tile plants are improving their productivity as we invest to expand our customer base and sales volume our lvt manufacturing capacity grows with higher speeds and efficiency we are enhancing designs and features and increasing sales of our rigid and flexible offering we are limiting the traditional inventory build that we typically do in the first quarter as we manage our production with market demand taking all this into account our eps guidance for the first quarter of 2020 is 1 90 to 2 00 excluding any one time charges lvt growth exchange rate and excess global capacity continue as headwinds for our business we are executing specific initiatives to adapt to shifting consumer preferences changing markets and competitive pressure for the full year of 2020 we expect that our actions to increase sales and distribution reduce costs and enhance utilization of our new plants will deliver improved results year over year with performance accelerating during the second half of the year our balance sheet should continue to improve with ongoing cash generation and we remain focused on delivering long term value to our shareholders we ll now be glad to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you and our first question today comes from the line of philip ng from jefferies your line is open philip ng jefferies analyst good morning jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer good morning philip ng jefferies analyst your comments on lbt in europe sounded pretty promising on the manufacturing front so i m just curious are you making money with that line yet and with the success you re seeing on the manufacturing front out there are you still on track to breakeven in north america early 2020 jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer in europe we have three lines the two old ones are operating as we expect and are doing well the third one is not at the level we would like it to but it s improving and we expect it to be profitable as we go through the year as well as the us line philip ng jefferies analyst okay any more color in terms of the timing on the us line in terms of getting profitable w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic it s going to happen during the year philip ng jefferies analyst okay and then just one last one for me on the cash flow glenn you were kind enough to give us free cash flow guidance last year any color on how we should think about 2020 some of the big moving pieces whether it s working capital capex and then just given your balance sheet is in really good shape and cash flow still quite strong are you guys open to buying back more stock glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer let me speak to the first part of that and i ll just say that we had a great cash flow year and we expect cash flow to remain strong into next year and the ability to improve our balance sheet is apparent philip ng jefferies analyst a word about on buybacks glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer on buybacks jeff jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the buybacks we have 125 million left we ll continue buying against it and we ll evaluate it when we use it up philip ng jefferies analyst okay all right thanks a lot operator and our next question comes from the line of michael rehaut from jp morgan your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer good morning mike michael rehaut jp morgan analyst thanks good morning everyone first question i appreciate the kind of directional guidance for the year in terms of your outlook for improved results with acceleration in the back half i was curious as to what that assumes from a top line perspective either by segment or on a consolidated basis but just trying to get a sense of how you re thinking about sales growth for the year and if also there would be an acceleration in the back half there jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer yes i appreciate you like more detailed information but we give quarter guidance and we give you a direction but we don t detail the rest of it and we re not going to do it now michael rehaut jp morgan analyst all right i had to try i guess but appreciate that i guess secondly you ve increased or you continue to take action around some of the restructuring and this is kind of an ongoing story as you continue to adjust the conditions we ve heard about the consolidation of the carpet operations going back to be the first half of 2019 i think initially the expectations were around some of those benefits coming through in the back half of 19 and obviously as you shut those plants down we would presume that there is some amount of cost benefit on the onset so just trying to understand how those costs are flowing through or at least the cost savings are flowing through you highlighted the fact that there is things that are in inventory that continue to need to be worked through but at the same time i would have thought that some of those cost benefits might have come even in the back half of 2019 jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer like we said mike really we finished the carpet restructuring largely in the back half of 2019 and due to the timing of implementation and the inventory flow through of the costs we re talking about a full run rate impact in the third quarter yeah there is a slow ramp up but the full impact that s meaningful will be closer to the start of the third quarter michael rehaut jp morgan analyst okay great thanks very much operator our next question comes from the line of mike dahl from rbc capital markets your line is open michael dahl rbc capital markets analyst hi thanks for taking my questions and for all the details so far first question glenn thanks for outlining the lvt rebates i guess just asking more specifically so i guess the 0 15 roughly in terms of benefits for the year you said spread over three quarters how much is included in the first quarter glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer the first quarter is the lion s share but it s over three quarters it started in the first jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer it s offsetting the inventories we have high inventories that you have with long supply chains and so the majority of it s going to offset the price decreases that we ve already implemented and as the inventory flows through they match up glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer it s in our guidance it s spread over three quarters and like i said and like jeff saying it s largely offset by the inventory value on hand michael dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay that s helpful and just the second question following up on that would be just given the price declines following the exclusions you re saying it s offsetting the rebates in the first few quarters but on a go forward basis since the rebates kind of go away the price declines i guess don t necessarily how should we think about the net effect beyond the initial quarter or two where you have the offset from the rebates glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer i think the way we need to think about it is they are roughly offsetting jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer there is not there is not there is a large since we raised the inventory prior to the tariffs the inventory that most of the inventory we sold in the year came from old pieces and we still have large inventories of what we ve been purchasing through the period as it and so it s offsetting that michael dahl rbc capital markets analyst right i guess sorry just where i was going with that if market pricing has reset lower are you saying that it s only impacting the legacy inventory or is this a go forward impact from lower market pricing as well jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the market pricing has gone down on clickable lvt and i don t see any reason it s going to change michael dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer and the products we re buying have gone down too so the new prices are in line with the new selling prices and costs are aligned glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer so to the extent we re buying it it s pretty much offset michael dahl rbc capital markets analyst right right got it ok thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john baugh from stifel your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer hey john john baugh stifel nicolaus analyst thank you and good morning two quick questions one do you have a rough guess on revenue or sales basis what your market share of the us lvt market is jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer yes but we haven t we don t give out specific details on product categories john baugh stifel nicolaus analyst okay would you have a guess jeff as to when you see out into the future reaching parity or any kind of rough idea timeline jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i don t understand the question john baugh stifel nicolaus analyst well i presume your share of us lvt sales is lower than your share sort of of the flooring market in general so my question is when would you see mohawk in lvt whether it s imported or made in the us sort of match up the shares of carpet ceramic laminate all put together jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer it s continuing to increase but i don t have a date when the two match up john baugh stifel nicolaus analyst okay secondly really quickly you mentioned imports of ceramic from around the world into the us around 17 in q4 could you just remind us sort of on a normal typical year how much import as a percentage of the us consumption thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer imports is a huge part of the ceramic market maybe 70 75 it s a huge part john baugh stifel nicolaus analyst great thank you very much good luck glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks john operator our next question comes from the line of justin speer from zelman associates your line is open justin speer zelman associates analyst appreciate it just wanted to start just to get a sense from you because the removal of the click lvt tariff was fairly recent but i think we understand the deflationary aspect of that in the near term but how does that affect demand for lvt and what s your view for price and demand for the non lvt categories in the fourth quarter and what s expected in the first quarter kind of high level jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer there are no details of that available today our expectation our guess is that lvt has approximately about a 3 5 billion part of the industry it s growing we think that the growth rate is slowing as the base gets bigger as we go through it s impacting the growth rate of the other products within it as you go through so i m not sure we have the details that you re looking for justin speer zelman associates analyst okay so i would just keep our eye on that but i guess within your guidance as you unpack that there is obviously some conservatism around maybe production rates slowing and then the other element is a variable in sg a investment so sg a was up about 9 5 in the fourth quarter up 7 for the full year i m just trying to get a sense for what your sg a investment will be in 2020 recognizing that you have some cost tailwinds from restructuring efforts but you are also investing in the business so just trying to get a sense for how much sg a will be up or down next year glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer well 2020 will be higher due to the full year impact of our investments we do expect higher sales in the second half that s the target of these investments we will evaluate as we go through the year and we ll adjust if necessary depending on the sales justin speer zelman associates analyst excellent an the last question for me is just i didn t catch it but on the ceramic tile bridge what was the price mix and what was the productivity and start up cost elements of the bridge jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer yes repeat the question justin speer zelman associates analyst the bridge the ebit bridge that you gave i didn t hear price mix or the productivity elements of the ceramic tile jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer on the ceramic tile so on ceramic the price mix was slipped by 4 million justin speer zelman associates analyst down by 4 million jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer price mix slipped by 4 million and overall productivity and lower start ups costs offset that that was 6 million justin speer zelman associates analyst perfect thank you guys jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer so a little more comment on the sg a in the us we re expanding the commercial sales forces we re building markets for quartz countertops roofing and lvt in europe we re developing a new commercial sales organization to sell lvt vinyl and carpet tile we ve invested in regional distributors which we purchased our distribution and different pieces which all the costs going into sg a was offset by higher sales and margins and russia we ve talked about increasing stores so there s a lot of activities of which those are only some of justin speer zelman associates analyst so these are growth investments and just ultimately you re so you re not pulling in the range you re digging into invest to grow and ultimately you think that ll really manifest itself in growth better growth in the second half above market growth do you think jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i mean the markets we re investing to expand the areas which we think we can expand and we ll monitor as we go through the year and we also have all the new product categories and new the new businesses you have to put the sales people in before you get the sales for them and the marketing monies justin speer zelman associates analyst that makes sense thank you operator and due to time constraints and to allow everyone to ask a question going further please allow yourself one question our next question comes from the line of matthew bouley from barclays your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer hey matt matthew bouley barclays analyst hey thank you for taking my questions or question can you just provide a little more color on the comment you made around the how the virus in china is impacting the start up of lvt production and how that s flowing to you guys because obviously you re ramping your own capacity i guess the question is how reliant is mohawk on this start up capacity in china for year 2020 plants thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the information is less than perfect at this point they go on holiday for the new year then the people come back so the people are not coming back at the rate they would normally come back there are some operations have started some are in partial things and some haven t started at all and the question is how is all that going to line up and when they re going to start nobody has a clear view of what it s going to be given we have inventories in line we can last a while before it has any impact on the business and we re having monitor it to see what s going to happen in our business we do buy products from other countries and we manufacture ourselves so it has less impact on us than the rest of the industry but the whole industry has the potential of a slower service depending upon what happens matthew bouley barclays analyst great thanks for the details jeff operator and our next question comes from the line of susan maklari from goldman sachs your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer hi susan susan maklari goldman sachs analyst good morning i wondered if you could talk a little bit about how you re thinking of inflation and raw materials as we go through the year i know that you said it was a 3 million benefit as it related to the consolidated business in the fourth quarter but how are you thinking about that as we look to 2020 jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the raw material prices in general mostly the oil related products have come down at the same time there is more aggressive pricing in the marketplace and we re assuming that the market prices are going to continue to reflect the decreases mostly in the commodity categories and we re going to continue to participate in aggressive manner we ll have to see how competition reacts in some of the other places we had in europe for instance we had prices on our insulation boards come down dramatically but so have the prices of the products in each so we re assuming given the excess capacities in the world today that the changes will be reflected in market prices susan maklari goldman sachs analyst okay thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of seldon clarke from deutsche bank your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer good morning seldon clarke deutsche bank analyst hey thanks for the question just given all the moving parts with your various product rollouts and investments in sg a and just how the timing of these investments relate to your production ramp when should we expect to see some operating leverage show up on the sg a side jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer in the second half we re expecting to see some benefits from the actions we re taking and we will keep reevaluating them and depending upon how the markets change we will continue to adjust seldon clarke deutsche bank analyst and are those operating leverage are those savings tied to operating leverage or purely cost kind of 30 million you re targeting glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer the 30 million of restructuring is more about cost jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer you re tying the restructuring piece with the marketing investments they are separate seldon clarke deutsche bank analyst right so i m just trying to ask like when you should start to see some operating leverage on the sg a side jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer we re expecting to see most more of the benefits about in the third quarter in the second half we keep saying seldon clarke deutsche bank analyst got it ok appreciate the question thanks operator our next question comes from the line of tim wojs from baird your line is open tim wojs baird analyst hey guys good morning jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer good morning tim wojs baird analyst just a clarification so sg a is up and is expected to be up over the next few quarters as you re investing in to grow sales but the gross profit was actually up in q4 for the first time in i think six or seven quarters so should we expect that that gross profit can actually grow a little bit and you re reinvesting that in sg a now and that s really what s driving some of the year over year ebit margin compression is that the right way to look at it jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer you answer what he wants glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer i think we stated broadly we expect 2020 to improve over this year our overall results back end weighted to the second half and that s broad based it s based on our initiatives and the pass through of the costs so sg a is a function of that and ultimately the trend should continue tim wojs baird analyst okay jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer on the cost side we re expecting the restructuring pieces we ve done to benefit at the same time the increased volume through the new plants should reduce the cost and help the margins in those also tim wojs baird analyst okay okay that sounds good and then just sneaking another one in what s the cost inflation outlook in ceramic glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer again we ve talked about that several times in ceramic and that s really overseas that is largely some raw material but energy costs that are driven by the eastern european facilities and fixed government pricing jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think in europe we expect maybe a little relief on some of the energy increases this year tim wojs baird analyst okay okay thanks operator our next question comes from the line of keith hughes from suntrust your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer hi keith keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks questions on north america ceramic in light of the fall in imports as you had identified is that i guess my question is where does the channel inventory stand now when do you think that will be more balanced i know it s been out of over inventory for sometimes jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer keith we don t know we don t have the data to see the inventory exactly what we know is that the imports which is a huge piece of the market came down 17 in the quarter and the imports from china dropped off altogether so we expect that it s a combination of inventories in this channel coming down and softness in the market keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst is this still something that s going to affect the first half jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer it s just hard to tell because keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hard to tell jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer all we can really see is the amount of inventory coming in to the country but we don t have a sense yet exactly the size of the inventory in the channel keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst i understand thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of michael wood from nomura instinet your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer good morning michael wood nomura instinet analyst hi good morning just wanted to talk about that ceramics import data if i look at it historically it is down considerably fourth quarter year over year although it s still higher than the fourth quarter in 17 and 16 so i m just curious how you re looking at that level of imports and how you re thinking where it should be i mean is this a level a healthy amount of import activity currently that we can sustain jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer well what we believe is that as you got into 2019 and when the tariffs were announced on the chinese product prior to those going to effect there was we believe a significant increase in pre buys related to that in addition as they replace the chinese inventory with other countries you had a combination of chinese inventories in the system plus new products that they were purchasing to replace it which elevated those inventories and sort of we believe gave a sort of a thoughts view of how much the industry was growing we don t know exactly last year but we think it probably declined 3 to 5 would be but it s just a guess michael wood nomura instinet analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of truman patterson from wells fargo your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer hi truman hi good morning guys and thanks for taking my question appreciate it the question for me the capacity that you all have coming online previously earlier last year you said you had about 1 2 billion coming online in 2019 and 2020 could you just give us an update of how much is coming online in 2020 and possibly 2021 remind us which products and categories and then just one item for clarification the lvt rebate if i m hearing you correctly in the first quarter it will probably be somewhere around maybe 0 10 benefit to eps glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer well again what we said is that s the total rebate which will be largely offset by inventory and lower pricing so again it s immaterial but it s in the guidance truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay and then the capacity jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the new plants are they the different pieces we have lvt which is still ramping up that will ramp up all through this year we have the russian sheet vinyl plant which is running it s positively helping the business now but it still has it s only used about 30 of the capacity as we push it into the marketplace we have the carpet tile business which we re developing an entire commercial sales organization which is also going to sell vinyl and lvt in europe so it s ramping up it takes a while to develop the customers and pieces we put in a new capacity in brazil to put in higher end products we have capacity in eastern europe to make low end ceramic which expands our market there is ramping up we have the quartz plant in the united states that s running about three shifts today but it s building inventory and also pushing it in over time that would go to four shifts and the productivity and inventories the productivity and throughput will go up and all of them we have to get the mix aligned because you start out selling more lower quality products to get more volume through the plants and it s going to take time to develop those as we go through so they re all working through they system at different rates truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay thank you is that still about 1 2 billion that you re bringing online over the next couple of years jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i mean part of it s already on so what s happening is some of the upside is getting offset by decreases in our legacy businesses so the legacy businesses have declines and it s offsetting some of the gains in the new pieces truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay okay thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of kathryn thompson from thompson research group your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer hi kat brian biros thompson research group analyst this is actually brian biros on for kathryn thank you for taking my question i wanted to ask a follow up on the coronavirus and i guess the supply chain impact trg industry contacts are telling us that the supply chain has not really yet been meaningfully impacted but if the manufacturing stoppages are extended another three to four weeks that could then impact shipments about three to five months from now actually wanted to see if you guys think that logic makes sense and maybe any color on what you re hearing from manufacturers from either vietnam or south korea on the impact to their supply chain jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i think that s close to what we said we said that right now it s difficult to say how fast it s going to come up that there are huge inventories in the chain over different times that it depends on each piece so typically there is anywhere from four to seven months of inventory through the channels and the stuff coming through and in that you have some that have low parts and some that have high parts across the industry so depending upon what it is and each piece and how fast the part comes up it depends on the time there could be people on the channel with less than that and they could be impacted with a few weeks worth of delays the non chinese production and the surrounding countries some of it or a significant part of it also uses inputs coming out of china so if the inputs don t come up it could affect those also so at this point it s really difficult to know what s going to happen and the impact it depends on the inventory levels of any individual skus at this point as most people when they buy from there there is the chinese new year where they shut down so you have the product that was bought in anticipation of that still flowing across the water coming in and so it still comes back to how fast it s going to pick up and what the timing of the new production is going to production coming up and nobody has any idea brian biros thompson research group analyst got it thanks for the color operator our next question comes from the line of john lovallo from bank of america your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer hi john john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys thank you for fitting me in here i just want to make sure that i understand your outlook seems to imply year over year operating margin expansion at least in 3q and 4q is that correct glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer yes john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks operator and our final question today comes from the line of laura champine from loop capital your line is open laura champine loop capital analyst thanks for taking my question if we look at your new production of lvt in the us how competitively do you think you ll be able to price that product relative to chinese competition and how does that influence your ability to get close to full capacity by the end of the year jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer we think when it s fully optimized that we ll be able to compete with the world marketplaces at the same time our goal isn t to sell all commodity product our goal is to sell value added products that have a higher average mix which will help which will allow us to meet the return goals that we have laura champine loop capital analyst got it thank you operator i would now like to turn the call back over to mr lorberbaum for closing remarks jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer while reacting to the market conditions we see excess capacities in the market continuing and we ll have to continue to react to competition in the marketplaces as they evolve there are a lot of indicators that many of the markets around the world are expecting the economies to get better and improve we have a lot of a lot going on to increase the utilization of our new plants which we think will help the second half as the throughputs go up which will allow the cost to come down and also the mix to improve over time we think we re doing the right things to react to the market and invest in the categories to increase our business level during these times we appreciate you taking your time and listening to us have a

business news of friday 14 february 2020 source classfmonline com the energy ministry has rubbished the opposition national democratic congress claim that the growth in the government s stake in the various oil contracts is due to the previous government s prudent management of the sector these petroleum agreements were all negotiated and signed by the npp government under president kufour all the petroleum agreements that are producing crude oil in ghana were signed by the kufour government a statement from the ministry said in a response to the biggest opposition party s comments on state of the energy sector in ghana when it held a forum two days ago the ndc mentioned the adoption of policies and programmes by the mahama administration to ensure the nation consistently increased its share in most petroleum agreements that were negotiated it added that ghana s share in the three oil producing fields kept increasing from 13 6 to 20 as a result the opposition said the increase in the growth of ghana s shares under the ndc government clearly demonstrates a conscious and consistent effort to increase ghana s stake in petroleum agreements but the energy ministry credited the kufuor administration for the growth the ndc also said all the 13 petroleum agreements that came to force under its administration had enhanced fiscal terms and increased national stake however the ministry argued if those petroleum agreements did not have enhanced fiscal terms that would have been problematic because they were signed after several discoveries of crude oil an indication of relatively de risked basins read below the energy ministry response ministry of energy response to the ndc press statement on the state of the energy sector in ghana friday 14th february 2020 introduction on wednesday the 12 of february 2020 the national democratic congress ndc held a press conference on the state of the energy sector in ghana this statement is a response by government to the unsubstantiated claims and allegations as well as the factual errors and misrepresentations contained in their statement ndc that they adopted policies and programmes to ensure the nation consistently increased its share in most petroleum agreements that were negotiated and that ghana s share in the three oil producing fields kept increasing from 13 6 to 20 1 jubilee 2007 13 6 2 ten 15 3 sankofa gye nyame fields 20 they added that this incremental sequence in the growth of ghana s shares under the ndc government clearly demonstrates a conscious and consistent effort to increase ghana s stake in petroleum agreements response the ndc cannot claim credit for the growth in government take in these contracts these petroleum agreements were all negotiated and signed by the npp government under president kufour all the petroleum agreements that are producing crude oil in ghana were signed by the kufour s government ndc that all the thirteen 13 petroleum agreements that came to force under the ndc had enhanced fiscal terms and increased national stake response if those petroleum agreements did not have enhanced fiscal terms that would have been problematic because they were signed after several discoveries of crude oil an indication of relatively de risked basins in spite of this the ndc failed to understand conditions of the market at the time they signed these agreements hence the increased fiscal terms achieved in the petroleum agreements have taken us nowhere for most of them the 13 agreements signed by the ndc were signed between 2013 and 2016 out of these the only companies that have met their minimum obligations are eni and springfield agm had to change ownership under the npp government before it could meet its obligations the remaining 10 companies were to drill 11 wells they have not drilled a single well they were to spend 700 million but they spent only 30 million these are the contracts with the so called enhanced fiscal terms we have always said that zero percent of 100 is zero so if you have the highest fiscal terms in contracts that do not lead to production it amounts to nothing the ndc on various platforms has attributed their failure to the itlos provisional judgement that froze activities during the period however it is important to note that only three of the agreements the ndc signed were affected by itlos agm amni international and erin agreements even one of the companies affected by itlos agm has recently announced crude oil discovery what happened to the rest we must understand that fiscal terms alone do not define the success of government negotiations of oil contracts the experience and financial capacity of a company are equally important afterall the objective of every government is to negotiate a contract that can result in oil production a fiscal strategy should therefore inspire increased reserves and production however the ndc s negotiated fiscal terms have not achieved these ndc that they took a bold step in establishing the public interest and accountability committee piac as an independent statutory body mandated to promote transparency and accountability in the management of petroleum resources in ghana response the ndc created a weak piac as the committee was not given teeth to bite but to merely produce semi annual and annual reports whose adverse findings cannot be enforced piac cannot prosecute or summon officials the npp government is currently holding consultations with stakeholders on a draft natural resources governance bill which is going to empower piac to enforce its findings the npp government is committed to transparency and accountability in the oil and gas industry the npp government passed the general petroleum regulations which provided significant transparency reforms including a requirement to disclose beneficial ownership information in petroleum agreements and disclose marketing contracts signed by gnpc as well as corporate social responsibility projects the petroleum exploration and production act provided for the establishment of a register of petroleum agreements and the application of open and competitive bidding of oil blocks however it took the commitment of the npp government to establish the register and to conduct ghana s first open bidding round for oil blocks ndc that they repositioned bost and tor to become strong companies only for the npp government to weaken them and that they secured two 2 million barrels of ghana s crude oil from the ten fields to be processed by tor response the ndc almost collapsed tor and bost the claim that bost and tor were strengthened cannot be true contrary to the ndcs claim that bost was making profits during their time the facts do not support this bost in january 2017 when the ndc handed over power owed 624 million to suppliers bdcs and related parties in respect of crude oil imports for processing at tor and refined products which got lost from bost tanks but as at february 2020 the outstanding amount to settle to clear the books now stand at 57 million an audit on bost accounts shows that between the periods 2013 to 2016 there was a significant rise in the net losses by the company with the highest net loss of ghc 569 million recorded in the year 2016 the 2018 management account showed a 70 reduction in losses from the previous year 2017 similarly the 2019 management account indicated a further 41 reduction in the loss level from the year 2018 this steady decline in the loss level of the company from 2017 to 2019 shows that during the year 2020 the company will likely make a profit bost under the npp government is in a better position bost continues to pursue its objectives including holding strategic reserves of petroleum products other private depots also hold sufficient stocks which together with bost provide enough buffer for product supply we want to assure the people of ghana that unlike the ndc s time when we had long queues at petroleum stations for three days in june 2014 due to fuel shortage the akufo addo government will never expose ghanaians to such a crisis the following shows our reserve position petrol 3 5 weeks diesel 4 7 weeks aviation fuel 8 7 weeks lpg 1 week on the tema oil refinery the 2 million barrels of crude oil referred to by the ndc was not refined at the end of 2016 because the plants were not operational how do you secure crude for processing by a plant that is not operational it does not make sense under the stewardship of the npp government tor undertook a shutdown maintenance which enabled the facility to refine the 2 million barrels of crude in 2017 ndc they accused the government of renegotiating the agm agreement under bizarre and opaque circumstances they stated in the renegotiated agreement gnpc s additional participating interest was reduced from 15 to 3 as if that was not enough explorco s commercial interest of 24 was dropped to zero response the agm petroleum agreement was signed under the ndc government however the company could not meet its minimum obligations following the acquisition of the company the new owner presented a request for renegotiation to provide some incentives to support the prospects presented by the block described as the deepest oil block in ghana this renegotiation is allowed under the petroleum law and in the agreement itself government granted some incentives which resulted in the company drilling two mandatory wells and an additional well the increase in investments led the company to make oil and gas discoveries in 2019 the incentives provided have paid off as the intended objectives have been achieved the government also took advantage of the request for renegotiation to evaluate the financial position of gnpc in relation to its ownership interest in the block given its many commitments and the need to prevent it from being over exposed gnpc decided to divest part of its paid interest curiously the ndc was economical with the truth by concealing from ghanaians that the npp government also renegotiated ghana s free carried interest from 10 to 15 and local participation from 2 5 to 5 this is intellectual dishonesty negotiation is give and take in our view we had a net gain additionally crude oil discoveries have been made under this renegotiated contract this also means that ghana s take has increased without the requirement to invest about a billion united states dollars the country would have been required to do under the previous agreement this has reduced gnpc s exposure ndc that their investigations have revealed that a new company by name quad energy which was subsequently awarded a 5 free carried interest was registered a month before the akufo addo led government triggered the parliamentary processes to amend the petroleum agreement and that this beat the imagination of many well meaning ghanaians and experts in the petroleum sector response the qualification to be an indigenous ghanaian company in an oil license is that the company must be incorporated in ghana and must have 80 of its management and 100 of all other staff being ghanaians the said quad energy is therefore qualified by law to participate in an oil block the subject of a local company acquiring interest in an oil block is a commercial one it depends on the commercial partners i e the international oil company and the local company it must be noted also that quad is a consortium of old local ghanaian companies who all quality to operate in the oil and gas industry and not new as the ndc wants to portray ndc that the aker agm agreement is the highest level of betrayal by this government as it clearly smacks of corruption and raises serious transparency and accountability issues because of concessions granted to aker energy in the amended agreement response we find it curious why the ndc alleges lack of transparency and corruption in the aker project the agreement and all its contents were scrutinized and approved by parliament which included the minority bench the allegation therefore betrays the ndc s understanding of transparency the ndc has as yet not mentioned any corrupt act involving any official of the government in the aker contract we challenge them to do so on the incentives provided to aker energy we should understand that project economics can be enhanced with incentives when market conditions adversely affect the prospects of profitability and the ndc knows this well the decision to incentivize the project was further informed by the imminent threat of declining crude oil production and its potential effect on our economy the oil production profile of ghana shows that the contributions of the three producing fields will peak and reach plateau levels of approximately 230 000 bbls per day in 2020 and maintain that production level up to 2023 after which production levels will begin to decline if new fields are not brought on line if we have to discuss incentives then the ndc was the first to provide incentives to an oil company eni in the sankofa gye nyame project through a supplementary agreement and a fiscal support package the incentives were 1 an exempt debt to equity ratio of 2 1 at 7 interest on the commercial loans of the contractors when the original agreement did not have such exemptions the 7 interest allowed was too high as most commercial loans attract much less interest rates these exempted the interest expenses from tax deduction 2 a gas price of 9 8 per mmbtu if you added this to the transportation fee it became the most expensive globally for an indigenous gas this price competed with imported lng price 3 the government and gnpc offered through the supplementary agreement to make the initial gas price of 9 8 mmbtu viable by providing a fiscal package to the tune of 250 million a total of 125 million was to be provided by gnpc upfront whilst the remaining fiscal concessions amounting to another 125 million to be provided by government was to ran over the project life 4 in the event that gnpc was unable to make an upfront payment in cash to the contractors it would allow the contractors to over lift gnpc s share of oil at the beginning of production of oil 5 the government was required under the security package and fiscal support agreement to issue five 5 different sovereign guarantees estimated at about 1 5 billion in addition to world bank and ida guarantees 6 a government disbursement account to be used for payment for gas supplied to gnpc was to be established and gnpc was required to transfer its 55 share of the carried and participating interests from the jubilee fields into the account gnpc could not use its funds for any purposes until after sankofa gas payments were made this was to grind gnpc s operations to a halt 7 the gas sales agreement provided for take or pay clauses and prioritized sankfa gas over all others the implications of these incentives were very grave for the country these were 1 the country lost revenue as a result of the exemption of interest expenses from tax deductibility 2 the negotiated gas price of 9 8 per mmbtu ensured that the composite domestic gas price became 8 8 per mmbtu the price of our indigenous gas was more expensive than imported gas from nigeria which was sold at 8 3 per mmbtu 3 as a result of prioritizing sankofa gas over jubilee gas which president kufour negotiated for free for ghana and ten gas which is very cheap we have not been able to maximize

ndc government s recklessness and tullow oil is about to lay off 25 of its workers mostly ghanaians 5 the ndc claims success over the 50 domestic requirement for lpg which is processed by the atuabo gas processing plant now you know that if we were maximizing gas export from the jubilee fields we could have been supplying 100 of our lpg requirement the npp government has proven to be better managers of the oil and gas sector this is because 1 we have renegotiated the domestic gas price from 8 8 per mmbtu to 6 08 per mmbtu the gas price would have been lower if sankofa gas price was less expensive 2 we have restored the price of ghana s gas from jubilee to zero from the 3 per mmbtu which the ndc government imposed on ghanaians why did they do this 3 we have recently negotiated with the gas producers to increase gas export from jubilee from 70 mmscfd to 125 mmscfd to recover more oil and increase lpg supply from domestic sources the npp government has recently launched a new strategy for the upstream oil and gas sector anchored on aggressive exploration and the attraction of companies with track record this has become necessary because the value of oil may decline in future as a result of climate change and declining funding for fossil fuel projects it is therefore imperative that our strategy to provide incentive is aimed at exploiting as much potential reserves

the provided for instance that in the 2018 financial year only 49 of abfa expenditure was used for capital expenditure whilst 51 was utilized for the supply of goods and services a clear violation of

the country under the ndc government of president mahama if they switched of plants built by dr kwame nkrumah president rawlings and president kuffour therefore it is simplistic to assume that only president mahama built power plants in ghana we wish to remind the ndc that we are using the mahama power plants not because there are no other generating plants most of which are owned by government but because they committed the state to take or pay contracts over those plants which require us to pay for the power even if we don t use the power president akufo addo will not subject ghanaians to such a challenge by shutting down the plants and still be paying for them with taxes from ghanaians on the causes of dumsor we state emphatically that the power crises was not technical it was financial as at the time we had power shortage our installed capacity was over 3 000mw whilst peak demand stood at 1 800mw the government failed to raise money to buy fuel when gas was not available even when the ndc was leaving office dumsor was still a major part of our country s story it did not only claim the position a minister who failed to help president mahama end it but extracted a golden confession the hon john jinapor in october 2016 reportedly confessed frankly money is a challenge ecg workers as at july 2016 also confessed mahama sitting on dumsor timetable ecg workers according to reports quoting mr samuel tetteh agbetor chairman of the western regional workers union of ecg source the ndc s solution to dumsor was to sign several unwanted power contracts some of which today have imposed serious financial burden on the state due to excess capacity payments in 2018 the cost of excess power generation capacity was an estimated 320 million in capacity charges as a result of new power plants commissioned in 2019 the excess generation capacity increased the capacity charge costs to 620 million annually power contracts are signed on take or pay basis which means that the cost of power has to be paid whether the power is used or not this is what has given rise to the excess power payments under the current purc methodology for electricity capacity charges for excess capacity generation are not included the government has been compelled to find money to finance part of this the ndc has no moral grounding to speak on ghana s energy sector after such abysmal failure to manage the sector and the people of ghana can attest to this as we all witnessed the wanton abuse of our patience theirs was a period of deal making instead of strategy driven solutions conclusion the government of president akufo addo has demonstrated significant commitment and resolve to manage the energy resources of our country efficiently for the benefit of our people as a government we take criticisms but such criticisms should be constructive and not based on propaganda deliberately packaged to deceive the people of ghana for political advantage there is no doubt that the ndc showed extreme recklessness in negotiations of oil contracts and power contracts which to day are suffocating our country overburdening our national budget and adversely affecting the pace of national development the npp government wishes to assure the people of ghana that we will not relent in ensuring that the vision of our president in applying our energy resources to build and expand ghana s industrial base to secure sustained economic transformation and to create wealth and jobs for our people is achieved

govt reacts to jinapor s claims and denies mismanaging oil revenues graphic online politics feb 14 2020 14 56 the government has denied claims by the opposition national democratic congress ndc that it has over the past three years mismanaged ghana s oil revenues the ndc at a policy dialogue series on wednesday addressed by the member of parliament for yapei kasawgu mr john jinapor accused the government of wasting resources and insisted the ndc has a far superior record when its tenure is compared to that of the akufo addo government he described the vice president s presentation at the kumasi town hall meeting on tuesday on ghana s energy sector as containing factual inaccuracies but in a reaction at a press briefing on friday the deputy minister of energy dr mohammed amin adam said the ndc s claims are false as the government has rather improved the financial positions of distressed entities in the oil sector below is a copy of the government s response to the ndc s claims ministry of energy response to the ndc press statement on the state of the energy sector in ghana friday 14th february 2020 introduction on wednesday the 12 of february 2020 the national democratic congress ndc held a press conference on the state of the energy sector in ghana this statement is a response by government to the unsubstantiated claims and allegations as well as the factual errors and misrepresentations contained in their statement ndc that they adopted policies and programmes to ensure the nation consistently increased its share in most petroleum agreements that were negotiated and that ghana s share in the three oil producing fields kept increasing from 13 6 to 20 1 jubilee 2007 13 6 2 ten 15 3 sankofa gye nyame fields 20 they added that this incremental sequence in the growth of ghana s shares under the ndc government clearly demonstrates a conscious and consistent effort to increase ghana s stake in petroleum agreements response the ndc cannot claim credit for the growth in government take in these contracts these petroleum agreements were all negotiated and signed by the npp government under president kufour all the petroleum agreements that are producing crude oil in ghana were signed by the kufour s government ndc that all the thirteen 13 petroleum agreements that came to force under the ndc had enhanced fiscal terms and increased national stake response if those petroleum agreements did not have enhanced fiscal terms that would have been problematic because they were signed after several discoveries of crude oil an indication of relatively de risked basins in spite of this the ndc failed to understand conditions of the market at the time they signed these agreements hence the increased fiscal terms achieved in the petroleum agreements have taken us nowhere for most of them the 13 agreements signed by the ndc were signed between 2013 and 2016 out of these the only companies that have met their minimum obligations are eni and springfield agm had to change ownership under the npp government before it could meet its obligations the remaining 10 companies were to drill 11 wells they have not drilled a single well they were to spend 700 million but they spent only 30 million these are the contracts with the so called enhanced fiscal terms we have always said that zero percent of 100 is zero so if you have the highest fiscal terms in contracts that do not lead to production it amounts to nothing the ndc on various platforms has attributed their failure to the itlos provisional judgement that froze activities during the period however it is important to note that only three of the agreements the ndc signed were affected by itlos agm amni international and erin agreements even one of the companies affected by itlos agm has recently announced crude oil discovery what happened to the rest we must understand that fiscal terms alone do not define the success of government negotiations of oil contracts the experience and financial capacity of a company are equally important afterall the objective of every government is to negotiate a contract that can result in oil production a fiscal strategy should therefore inspire increased reserves and production however the ndc s negotiated fiscal terms have not achieved these ndc that they took a bold step in establishing the public interest and accountability committee piac as an independent statutory body mandated to promote transparency and accountability in the management of petroleum resources in ghana response the ndc created a weak piac as the committee was not given teeth to bite but to merely produce semi annual and annual reports whose adverse findings cannot be enforced piac cannot prosecute or summon officials the npp government is currently holding consultations with stakeholders on a draft natural resources governance bill which is going to empower piac to enforce its findings the npp government is committed to transparency and accountability in the oil and gas industry the npp government passed the general petroleum regulations which provided significant transparency reforms including a requirement to disclose beneficial ownership information in petroleum agreements and disclose marketing contracts signed by gnpc as well as corporate social responsibility projects the petroleum exploration and production act provided for the establishment of a register of petroleum agreements and the application of open and competitive bidding of oil blocks however it took the commitment of the npp government to establish the register and to conduct ghana s first open bidding round for oil blocks ndc that they repositioned bost and tor to become strong companies only for the npp government to weaken them and that they secured two 2 million barrels of ghana s crude oil from the ten fields to be processed by tor response the ndc almost collapsed tor and bost the claim that bost and tor were strengthened cannot be true contrary to the ndcs claim that bost was making profits during their time the facts do not support this bost in january 2017 when the ndc handed over power owed 624 million to suppliers bdcs and related parties in respect of crude oil imports for processing at tor and refined products which got lost from bost tanks but as at february 2020 the outstanding amount to settle to clear the books now stand at 57 million an audit on bost accounts shows that between the periods 2013 to 2016 there was a significant rise in the net losses by the company with the highest net loss of ghc 569 million recorded in the year 2016 the 2018 management account showed a 70 reduction in losses from the previous year 2017 similarly the 2019 management account indicated a further 41 reduction in the loss level from the year 2018 this steady decline in the loss level of the company from 2017 to 2019 shows that during the year 2020 the company will likely make a profit bost under the npp government is in a better position bost continues to pursue its objectives including holding strategic reserves of petroleum products other private depots also hold sufficient stocks which together with bost provide enough buffer for product supply we want to assure the people of ghana that unlike the ndc s time when we had long queues at petroleum stations for three days in june 2014 due to fuel shortage the akufo addo government will never expose ghanaians to such a crisis the following shows our reserve position petrol 3 5 weeks diesel 4 7 weeks aviation fuel 8 7 weeks lpg 1 week on the tema oil refinery the 2 million barrels of crude oil referred to by the ndc was not refined at the end of 2016 because the plants were not operational how do you secure crude for processing by a plant that is not operational it does not make sense under the stewardship of the npp government tor undertook a shutdown maintenance which enabled the facility to refine the 2 million barrels of crude in 2017 ndc they accused the government of renegotiating the agm agreement under bizarre and opaque circumstances they stated in the renegotiated agreement gnpc s additional participating interest was reduced from 15 to 3 as if that was not enough explorco s commercial interest of 24 was dropped to zero response the agm petroleum agreement was signed under the ndc government however the company could not meet its minimum obligations following the acquisition of the company the new owner presented a request for renegotiation to provide some incentives to support the prospects presented by the block described as the deepest oil block in ghana this renegotiation is allowed under the petroleum law and in the agreement itself government granted some incentives which resulted in the company drilling two mandatory wells and an additional well the increase in investments led the company to make oil and gas discoveries in 2019 the incentives provided have paid off as the intended objectives have been achieved the government also took advantage of the request for renegotiation to evaluate the financial position of gnpc in relation to its ownership interest in the block given its many commitments and the need to prevent it from being over exposed gnpc decided to divest part of its paid interest curiously the ndc was economical with the truth by concealing from ghanaians that the npp government also renegotiated ghana s free carried interest from 10 to 15 and local participation from 2 5 to 5 this is intellectual dishonesty negotiation is give and take in our view we had a net gain additionally crude oil discoveries have been made under this renegotiated contract this also means that ghana s take has increased without the requirement to invest about a billion united states dollars the country would have been required to do under the previous agreement this has reduced gnpc s exposure ndc that their investigations have revealed that a new company by name quad energy which was subsequently awarded a 5 free carried interest was registered a month before the akufo addo led government triggered the parliamentary processes to amend the petroleum agreement and that this beat the imagination of many well meaning ghanaians and experts in the petroleum sector response the qualification to be an indigenous ghanaian company in an oil license is that the company must be incorporated in ghana and must have 80 of its management and 100 of all other staff being ghanaians the said quad energy is therefore qualified by law to participate in an oil block the subject of a local company acquiring interest in an oil block is a commercial one it depends on the commercial partners i e the international oil company and the local company it must be noted also that quad is a consortium of old local ghanaian companies who all quality to operate in the oil and gas industry and not new as the ndc wants to portray ndc that the aker agm agreement is the highest level of betrayal by this government as it clearly smacks of corruption and raises serious transparency and accountability issues because of concessions granted to aker energy in the amended agreement response we find it curious why the ndc alleges lack of transparency and corruption in the aker project the agreement and all its contents were scrutinized and approved by parliament which included the minority bench the allegation therefore betrays the ndc s understanding of transparency the ndc has as yet not mentioned any corrupt act involving any official of the government in the aker contract we challenge them to do so on the incentives provided to aker energy we should understand that project economics can be enhanced with incentives when market conditions adversely affect the prospects of profitability and the ndc knows this well the decision to incentivize the project was further informed by the imminent threat of declining crude oil production and its potential effect on our economy the oil production profile of ghana shows that the contributions of the three producing fields will peak and reach plateau levels of approximately 230 000 bbls per day in 2020 and maintain that production level up to 2023 after which production levels will begin to decline if new fields are not brought on line if we have to discuss incentives then the ndc was the first to provide incentives to an oil company eni in the sankofa gye nyame project through a supplementary agreement and a fiscal support package the incentives were 1 an exempt debt to equity ratio of 2 1 at 7 interest on the commercial loans of the contractors when the original agreement did not have such exemptions the 7 interest allowed was too high as most commercial loans attract much less interest rates these exempted the interest expenses from tax deduction 2 a gas price of 9 8 per mmbtu if you added this to the transportation fee it became the most expensive globally for an indigenous gas this price competed with imported lng price 3 the government and gnpc offered through the supplementary agreement to make the initial gas price of 9 8 mmbtu viable by providing a fiscal package to the tune of 250 million a total of 125 million was to be provided by gnpc upfront whilst the remaining fiscal concessions amounting to another 125 million to be provided by government was to ran over the project life 4 in the event that gnpc was unable to make an upfront payment in cash to the contractors it would allow the contractors to over lift gnpc s share of oil at the beginning of production of oil 5 the government was required under the security package and fiscal support agreement to issue five 5 different sovereign guarantees estimated at about 1 5 billion in addition to world bank and ida guarantees 6 a government disbursement account to be used for payment for gas supplied to gnpc was to be established and gnpc was required to transfer its 55 share of the carried and participating interests from the jubilee fields into the account gnpc could not use its funds for any purposes until after sankofa gas payments were made this was to grind gnpc s operations to a halt 7 the gas sales agreement provided for take or pay clauses and prioritized sankfa gas over all others the implications of these incentives were very grave for the country these were 1 the country lost revenue as a result of the exemption of interest expenses from tax deductibility 2 the negotiated gas price of 9 8 per mmbtu ensured that the composite domestic gas price became 8 8 per mmbtu the price of our indigenous gas was more expensive than imported gas from nigeria which was sold at 8 3 per mmbtu 3 as a result of prioritizing sankofa gas over jubilee gas which president kufour negotiated for free for ghana and ten gas which is very cheap we have not been able to maximize the use of our free jubilee gas as we are compelled to off take more sankofa gas we take 70 mmscfd of

lose about 15 000 bbls of crude oil per day because of the higher gas to oil ratio multiply 15 000 bbls by 365 days 5 475 000 bbls a year assuming no lose production days multiply by 60 per barrel it gives you us 328 5 million lost to the jubilee partners and ghana ghana is losing money because of ndc government s recklessness and tullow oil is about to lay off 25 of its workers mostly ghanaians 5 the ndc claims success over the 50 domestic requirement for lpg which is processed by the atuabo gas processing plant now you know that if we were maximizing gas export from the jubilee fields we could have been supplying 100 of our lpg requirement the npp government has proven to be better managers of the oil and gas sector this is because 1 we have renegotiated the domestic gas price from 8 8 per mmbtu to 6 08 per mmbtu the gas price would have been lower if sankofa gas price was less expensive 2 we have restored the price of ghana s gas from jubilee to zero from the 3 per mmbtu which

the cost of excess power generation capacity was an estimated 320 million in capacity charges as a result of new power plants commissioned in 2019 the excess generation capacity increased the capacity charge costs to 620 million annually power contracts are signed on take or pay basis which means that the cost of power has to be paid whether the power is used or not this is what has given rise to the excess power payments under the current purc methodology for electricity capacity charges for excess capacity generation are not included the government has been compelled to find money to finance part of this the ndc has no moral grounding to speak on ghana s energy sector after such abysmal failure to manage the sector and the people of ghana can attest to this as we all witnessed the wanton abuse of our patience theirs was a period of deal making instead of strategy driven solutions conclusion the government of president akufo addo has demonstrated significant commitment and resolve to manage the energy resources of our country efficiently for the benefit of our people as a government we take criticisms but such criticisms should be constructive and not based on propaganda deliberately packaged to deceive the people of ghana for political advantage there is no doubt that the ndc showed extreme recklessness in negotiations of oil contracts and power contracts which to day are suffocating our country overburdening our national budget and adversely affecting the pace of national development the npp government wishes to assure the people of ghana that we will not relent in ensuring that the vision of our president in applying our energy resources to build and expand ghana s industrial base to secure sustained economic transformation and to create wealth and jobs for our people is achieved

when the facts change the coronavirus is a human tragedy but the markets remain sanguine a slowing of global growth is already factored into market expectations further central bank easing is expected to calm any market fears a pick up in import price inflation has been discounted before it arrives my title is the first part of jm keynes famous remark when the facts change i change my mind this phrase has been nagging at my conscience ever since the coronavirus epidemic began to engulf china and send shockwaves around the world from an investment perspective have the facts changed financial markets have certainly behaved in a predictable manner government bonds rallied and stocks declined then the market caught its breath and stocks recovered there have of course been exceptions while the s p 500 has made new highs those companies and sectors most likely to be effected by the viral outbreak have been hardest hit is the impact of covid 19 going to be seen in economic data absolutely will economic growth slow yes though it will be felt most in wuhan and the hubei region a region estimated to account for 4 5 in chinese gdp and 7 of autopart manufacture the impact will be less pronounced in other parts of the world although korea s hyundai has already ceased vehicle production at its factories due to a lack of chinese car parts will there be a longer term impact on the global supply chain and will this affect stock and bond prices these are more difficult questions to answer global supply chains have been shortening ever since the financial crisis the sino us trade war has merely added fresh impetus to the process as for financial markets stock prices around the world declined in january but those markets farthest from the epicentre of the outbreak have since recovered in some cases making new all time highs the longer term impact remains unclear why because the performance of the stock market over the last decade has been driven almost entirely by the direction of interest rates whilst economic growth since the financial crisis has been anaemic at best as rates have fallen and central banks have purchased bonds so bond yields have declined making stocks look relatively more attractive some central banks have even bought stocks to add to their cache of bonds but i digress returning to my title from an investment perspective have the facts changed global economic growth will undoubtedly take a hit estimates of 0 1 to 0 2 fall in 2020 already abound in order to mitigate this downturn central banks will cut rates where they can and buy progressively longer dated and less desirable bonds as they work their way along the maturity spectrum and down the credit structure eventually they will emulate the policy of the japanese and the swiss by purchasing common stocks in china where the purse strings have been kept tight during the past year the pboc has already ridden to the rescue flooding the domestic banking system with 173bln of additional liquidity it seems the process of saving the stock market from the dismal vicissitudes of a global economic slow down has already begun growth down profits down stocks up it sounds absurd but that is the gerrymandered nature of the current marketplace it is comforting to know the central banks will not have to face the music alone they can rely upon the usual allies as they endeavour to keep the everything bubble aloft which allies the corporate executives of publically listed companies faced with the dilemma of expanding capital expenditure in the teeth of an economic slowdown which might turn into a recession the leaders of publically listed corporations can be relied upon to do the honourable thing pay themselves in stock options and buyback more stock at some point this global ponzi scheme will inflect exhaust implode but until that moment arrives it would be unwise to step off the gravy train the difficulty of staying aboard of course is the same one as always the markets climb a wall of fear if there is any good news amid the tragic covid 19 pandemic it is that the january correction has prompted some of the weaker hands in the stock market to fold when markets consolidate on a high plateau should they then turn down the patient investor may be afforded time to exit this price action is vastly preferable to the hyperbolic rise followed by the sharp decline an altogether more cathartic and less agreeable dénouement other themes and menes as those of you who have been reading my letters for a while will know i have been bullish on the us equity market for several years that has worked well i have also been bullish on emerging markets in general and asia in particular over a similar number of years a less rewarding investment with the benefit of hindsight i should have been more tactical looking ahead asian economies will continue to grow but their stock markets may disappoint due to the uncertainty of the us administrations trade agenda the us will continue to benefit from low interest rates and technological investment together with buy backs mergers and privatisations elsewhere i see opportunity within europe as governments spend on green infrastructure and other climate conscious projects esg investing gains more advocates daily socially responsible institutions will garner assets from socially responsible investors while socially responsible governments will award contracts to those companies whose behaviour is ethically sound it is a virtuous circle of morally commendable albeit not necessarily economically logical behaviour the uk lags behind europe on environmental issues but support for business and three years of deferred capital investment makes it an appealing destination for investment as i explained last december in the beginning of the end of uncertainty for the uk conclusions returning once more to my title the facts always change but unless the covid 19 pandemic should escalate dramatically the broad investment themes appear largely unchanged central banks still weld awesome power to drive asset prices although this increasingly fails to feed through to the real economy the chart below shows the diminishing power of the credit multiplier effect japan began their monetary experiment roughly a decade earlier than the rest of the developed world source allianz refinitiv like an addictive drug the more the monetary stimulus the more the patient needs in order to achieve the same high the direct financial effect of lower interest rates is a lowering of bond yields lower yields spur capital flows into higher yielding credit instruments and equities however low rates also signal an official fear of recession this in turn prompts a reticence to lend on the part of banking intermediaries the real economy remains cut off from the credit fix it needs asset prices keep rising economic growth keeps stalling the rich get richer and the poor get deeper into debt breaking the market addiction to cheap credit is key to unravelling this colossal misallocation of resources a trend which has been in train since the 1980 s if not before the prospect of reserving course on subsidised credit is politically unpalatable asset owners especially indebted ones will suffer greatly if interest rates should rise they will vote accordingly the alternative is more of the same profligate policy mix which has suspended reality for the past decade from an investment perspective the facts have not yet changed and i have yet to change my mind

the call over to jeff for his opening remarks jeff jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer thank you ken our fourth quarter adjusted results were as we expected with sales flat to last year operating income of 205 million or 8 4 of sales and eps of 2 25 for the year our sales were 10 billion adjusted operating income was 938 million or 9 4 of sales and eps was 10 04 our cash generation remained strong with operating and free cash flow for the quarter of about 440 million and 300 million for the year operating and free cash flow were about 1 4 billion and 870 million our leverage is approaching historical lows which provides us the flexibility to pursue additional opportunities in the period we bought back approximately 23 million of stock for a total of 375 million since authorized we anticipated our business as we anticipated our business remained challenged by soft demand greater competition and reduced production volume in the us markets continued to be influenced by the strong dollar and the impact of lvt on other product categories consumer confidence remained high and lower us interest rates are positively influencing new and existing home sales us tariffs on clickable lvt from china were ascended in the fourth quarter and market pricing has declined for these products imports of ceramic tile from china dropped off substantially in the fourth quarter and shipments from other countries have not offset which we believe is due to soft demand and a reduction in us ceramic inventories competition has increased in our global markets impacting our pricing and mix as we leverage higher investments in sales and marketing to drive growth many countries where we operate are stimulating their economies with lower interest rates to encourage greater consumer spending and economic growth this year in the near term we still anticipate continued pressure in our markets and product categories throughout the period we implemented changes to increase sales and reduce costs we ve enhanced our lvt manufacturing in the us and europe and realigned our us carpet operations we have decreased our ceramic production and inventories and are taking out a wood flooring plant in the united states and in europe we are reducing the complexity of our operations improving processes to reduce costs and increasing automation to improve efficiencies we continue to improve the productivity and volume of our new lvt us countertop russian sheet vinyl and european carpet tile investments our acquisitions in australian and brazil are installing state of the art equipment that will expand their product portfolios we are introducing new design and performance innovations to enhance our market position and broaden our customer base to promote both new and existing products we re making higher levels of sales and marketing investments for a review of our financial performance during the period i ll turn the call over to glenn glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you jeff and good morning everyone moving right into our financial performance and year over year bridges as jeff shared in the fourth quarter total company net sales were 2 4 billion down 1 compared to prior year as reported and off approximately 2 on a constant basis which we define as adjusted for fx and days for the full year 2019 total company net sales were flat compared to 2018 as reported and up 2 on a constant basis organic growth in the legacy businesses was down 3 in the fourth quarter versus prior year on a constant basis and down 2 for the full year compared to 2018 also on a constant basis in terms of earnings the company s adjusted operating income was 205 million in the fourth quarter or 8 4 off 140 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year largely due to weaker volume and price mix only partially offset by improved productivity including lower start up costs with that said the company s year over year decline in margins improved on a sequential basis by 100 basis points which now represents four consecutive quarters of improvement bridging from the prior year fourth quarter adjusted operating earnings were impacted by number one lower overall volume of 10 million largely in our global ceramic and flooring north america segments and associated market related downtime costs of 4 million all taken in global ceramics to match our supply with our demand number two a modest increase in inflation of 3 million due to higher wages and benefits partially offset by lower raw materials number three an erosion of price mix of 24 million largely in our flooring rest of the world segment following easing input costs and 11 million higher spending in sg a and other due to investments in sales talent and marketing to drive sales moving to the positive offset productivity including lower start up costs swung positive by 16 million versus last year due to better utilization and non repeating one time items for the full year adjusted operating income was 938 million or 9 4 of sales off 250 basis points from prior year staying at the enterprise level adjusted sg a per net sales was 19 1 in the quarter excluding unusual items up 180 basis points year over year due to higher sales marketing and merchandising expenses to roll out new products and to grow in new markets inflation acquisition lower volume and one time charges also impacted the quarter for the full year adjusted sg a was 18 4 of sales up 100 basis points year over year and just to be clear relative to the rollback of tariffs on clickable lvt product from china prior to tariffs we had already raised inventory significantly and have since reduced purchases in 2019 as we reduced inventory and ramped up our us production we also have purchased from other countries in this period so the total gross rebate amounted to 13 5 million which is in our guidance spread over three quarters and largely offset by inventory value on hand special and unusual items in the fourth quarter consisted of a 50 million charge for restructuring and integration costs of which most was non cash and divided relatively evenly among completing us carpet realignment and rightsizing the company s wood manufacturing footprints in flooring north america and flooring rest of the world as well as a 136 million one time tax benefit associated with the consolidation of business activities in europe within a single operating entity to improve management and increase efficiencies also reducing the company s tax rate somewhat in 2019 for the full year total restructuring and integration charges taken for actions in flooring north america and flooring rest of the world were 111 million of which approximately 41 million was cash and as we have said the cash cost associated with carpet restructuring of approximately 30 million will be recovered as operational savings as lower cost pass through inventory in the first half of this year reaching full run rate in the third quarter adjusted ebitda was 363 million or 15 before interest expense of 11 million for the full year adjusted ebitda was 1 5 billion or 15 3 the effective tax rate on a non gaap basis was 18 9 in the fourth quarter and 20 6 for the full year of 19 finally adjusted net earnings per share was 2 25 in the quarter down from 2 53 or 11 versus last year and for the full year adjusted net earnings per share was 10 04 down from 12 33 versus 2018 now let me turn to the segments and i m only going to speak to the fourth quarter here the global ceramic segment delivered net sales of 858 million flat versus prior year as reported or a decrease of 1 5 on a constant basis looking at only at our legacy businesses sales decreased approximately 4 on a constant basis operating income on an adjusted basis was 54 million or 6 3 of net sales down from a 10 1 margin last year primarily due to increased competition and weaker demand in the us coupled with higher inflation so compared to last year at the segment level inflation was 16 million higher driven by higher wages and materials and benefits volume was off 14 million inclusive of 4 million of downtime sales marketing and other costs were up 5 million price mix slipped 4 million and this was all partially offset by improved productivity and lower start up costs of 6 million fx in the quarter was neutral let s move to flooring north america the business showed better overall performance with sales of 936 million down 4 versus last year as reported and down 5 on a constant basis as continued weakness in soft surfaces were partially offset by continued growth in lvt operating income on an adjusted basis was 69 million or 7 4 of net sales in the fourth quarter bridging from last year volume was down 17 million versus last year and accounted for the majority of the deficit price mix lagged prior year by approximately 6 million raw material cost decreases offset increases in wages and benefits keeping inflation flat and productivity less reduced start up costs was bettered by 6 million moving to flooring rest of the world the segment had a solid quarter with sales of 630 million up 2 6 versus last year as reported and 3 7 on a constant basis looking just at the legacy business sales were up 1 5 on a constant basis adjusted operating income came in at 89 million or 14 2 of sales in the quarter an increase of 140 basis points versus last year in a very competitive environment mainly as a result of increased volume going to the bridge volume was better by 18 million price mix lift by 15 million but was largely offset by relief in overall inflation of 11 million driven by lower input costs productivity including lower start up costs was 3 million and investments in sales product marketing and other were 6 million higher in the quarter fx was again neutral for the quarter finally at the corporate level expenses and eliminations drove an operating loss of 8 million with a full year cost of 40 million speaking now to the balance sheet receivables ended the quarter at 1 5 billion with days sales outstanding up due to changes in geographic and channel mix inventories ended the quarter at approximately 2 3 billion or 134 days higher in days versus prior year by approximately six days but relatively flat in dollars as we continued to adjust our production to match our sales fixed assets for the quarter ended at 4 7 billion and capital expenditures of 140 million in the period lower than depreciation and amortization which was 154 million so for the full year capex was at 545 million lower than our d a of 576 million as we efficiently managed our q4 project spend in each of our segments total debt was 2 6 billion at the end of the quarter down approximately 200 million versus the third quarter with leverage declining to 1 6 times debt to adjusted ebitda wrapping up the balance sheet is strong and getting stronger with free cash flow of 300 million in the quarter totaling 873 million in 2019 capping off a very solid year at overall cash generation so with that chris i ll turn it over to you w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic thanks glenn in our global ceramic segment most of our markets faced a combination of soft demand and excess industry capacity that is compressing market prices and margins during the quarter our us ceramic business remained under pressure from lvt taking share and high industry inventories from ceramic purchases ahead of tariffs additionally to align our own inventory levels we meaningfully reduced production in our north american ceramic plants which increased our cost we have started to see some trends that should benefit our business in 2020 compared to the prior year fourth quarter total us ceramic imports declined 17 with chinese ceramic imports falling 90 lower interest rates and improving new and existing home sales should also benefit the market this year to improve our sales we are rolling out multiple new products and adding sales representatives and design consultants in major markets our new collections aimed at replacing imports are gaining momentum to increase productivity and reduce cost for our customers we have streamlined ordering processes and made picking up orders at our service centers faster and easier we continue to enhance our showrooms and galleries to better communicate the beauty and performance of our ceramic products during the fourth quarter we initiated manufacturing of our new click tile in multiple sizes and designs a proprietary product has been tested in both residential and commercial applications and has received positive reviews for faster and less expensive installation that is able to be walked on the same day we are launching click tile at our trade show this quarter and have already received commitments from major customers we are expanding our mosaic and wall tile offerings to meet growing demand for these categories our quartz countertop sales continued to increase as we ramp up the productivity and throughput at our new tennessee plant we are developing more sophisticated visuals to enhance our manufactured quartz collections and improve our margins sales of our large porcelain slabs from europe are growing and we are increasing the sales of dal tile branded lvt products in mexico the economy continued to face headwinds due to uncertainty around the us trade with the overall construction activity declining in the fourth quarter we are gaining share by expanding our brands distribution and product offerings with larger sizes porcelain products and more comprehensive wall tile collection we are increasing our participation in the commercial markets and enlarging our base of stores that exclusively sell our products despite a soft economy in brazil we had good sales growth during the period due to our strong brand and product offering in december we initiated production on a new porcelain tile line that produces larger sizes to expand our premium offering to increase our sales in other south american countries we are updating our showrooms and expanding distribution the southern european economies remained slow impacting our primary ceramic markets and industry pricing in this environment we increased our volume even as lagging consumer confidence reduced demand in the larger retail remodeling channel we are expanding our activities in the commercial channels as well as outdoor products to extend our style leadership we are introducing new premium products with the surface structures aligned with the printed design to create more realistic visuals our medium priced products

plants by product type to optimize our cost and improve our competitive position in russia we grew our ceramic sales in a soft market our growth was driven by our unique business model that includes the industry s most comprehensive premium offering a national distribution network owned and franchise retail stores and the strongest project specification organization in the industry to further strengthen our position in 2020 we expect to expand the stores that exclusively sell our products to more than 400 locations across the country to support our growth we are starting up additional porcelain production to make super large sizes and a new plant to produce coordinated premium sanitary ware in our flooring north america segment we have executed many initiatives to align the business with the present market conditions we faced a challenging market with lvt growth continuing to impact sales of other product categories as expected our pricing and mix remained under pressure as customers traded down and lower production levels raised the cost lower raw material costs during the period were offset by a more competitive environment we streamlined our infrastructure by closing three plants consolidating high cost operations and reducing wood manufacturing the effects of these actions will increase and flow through the inventory with full cost benefit in the third period to reduce costs we have implemented numerous process improvements executed machine modifications and increased our recycled polyester production we are leveraging automation and equipment advances to produce comparable volumes with the smaller manufacturing footprint in the period our residential carpet sales performed best in the new home construction and multifamily channels our new

and features we are introducing new collections for both the residential and commercial markets our expanded premium pergo and karastan collections have been well received at trade shows due to their leading visuals and styling the virus in china is postponing some production start ups and it could potentially disrupt some lvt service depending on when shipments resume sales of our waterproof laminate products are expanding across most channels and we anticipate continued market growth due to their realistic appearance durability and ease of installation the detailed visuals and performance features of our premium laminate collections are increasingly being used as alternatives for both wood and lvt to support higher laminate sales we are upgrading our hdf board production to increase capacity and reduce cost our flooring rest of world segment continued to deliver strong results in the period the segment s business is less exposed to those european countries which are having more economic difficulties across this segment our investments in product innovation cost improvements acquisitions and new businesses strengthened our results we are outperforming the european laminate market with our focus on premium products that are more realistic with unique features sales of our new laminate collection are ramping up quickly due to an enhanced level of sophistication in the period we absorbed higher marketing cost to support this introduction we announced the consolidation of our wood manufacturing to our facility in malaysia which will improve our cost and flexibility to better service our customers our lvt sales grew as our new manufacturing productivity significantly improved to further enhance our plant performance we are implementing specific initiatives to improve throughput material cost and waste to utilize our growing capacity we are introducing new rigid collections that are being well received in the retail diy and commercial

should continue to improve with ongoing cash generation and we remain focused on delivering long term value to our shareholders we ll now be glad to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you and our first question today comes from the line of philip ng from jefferies your line is open philip ng jefferies analyst good morning jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer good morning philip ng jefferies analyst your comments on lbt in europe sounded pretty promising on the manufacturing front so i m just curious are you making money with that line yet and with the success you re seeing on the manufacturing front out there are you still on track to breakeven in north america early 2020 jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer in europe we have three lines the two old ones are operating as we expect and are doing well the third one is not at the level we would like it to but it s improving and we expect it to be profitable as we go through the year as well as the us line philip ng jefferies analyst okay any more color in terms of the timing on the us line in terms of getting profitable w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic it s going to happen during the year philip ng jefferies analyst okay and then just one last one for me on the cash flow glenn you were kind enough to give us free cash flow guidance last year any color on how we should think about 2020 some of the big moving pieces whether it s working capital capex and then just given your balance sheet is in really good shape and cash flow still quite strong are you guys open to buying back more stock glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer let me speak to the first part of that and i ll just say that we had a great cash flow year and we expect cash flow to remain strong into next year and the ability to improve our balance sheet is apparent philip ng jefferies analyst a word about on buybacks glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer on buybacks jeff jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the buybacks we have 125 million left we ll continue buying against it and we ll evaluate it when we use it up philip ng jefferies analyst okay all right thanks a lot operator and our next question comes from the line of michael rehaut from jp morgan your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer good morning mike michael rehaut jp morgan analyst thanks good morning everyone first question i appreciate the kind of directional guidance for the year in terms of your outlook for improved results with acceleration in the back half i was curious as to what that assumes from a top line perspective either by segment or on a consolidated basis but just trying to get a sense of how you re thinking about sales growth for the year and if also there would be an acceleration in the back half there jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer yes i appreciate you like more detailed information but we give quarter guidance and we give you a direction but we don t detail the rest of it and we re not going to do it now michael rehaut jp morgan analyst all right i had to try i guess but appreciate that i guess secondly you ve increased or you continue to take action around some of the restructuring and this is kind of an ongoing story as you continue to adjust the conditions we ve heard about the consolidation of the carpet operations going back to be the first half of 2019 i think initially the expectations were around some of those benefits coming through in the back half of 19 and obviously as you shut those plants down we would presume that there is some amount of cost benefit on the onset so just trying to understand how those costs are flowing through or at least the cost savings are flowing through you highlighted the fact that there is things that are in inventory that continue to need to be worked through but at the same time i would have thought that some of those cost benefits might have come even in the back half of 2019 jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer like we said mike really we finished the carpet restructuring largely in the back half of 2019 and due to the timing of implementation and the inventory flow through of the costs we re talking about a full run rate impact in the third quarter yeah there is a slow ramp up but the full impact that s meaningful will be closer to the start of the third quarter michael rehaut jp morgan analyst okay great thanks very much operator our next question comes from the line of mike dahl from rbc capital markets your line is open michael dahl rbc capital markets analyst hi thanks for taking my questions and for all the details so far first question glenn thanks for outlining the lvt rebates i guess just asking more specifically so i guess the 0 15 roughly in terms of benefits for the year you said spread over three quarters how much is included in the first quarter glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer the first quarter is the lion s share but it s over three quarters it started in the first jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer it s offsetting the inventories we have high inventories that you have with long supply chains and so the majority of it s going to offset the price decreases that we ve already implemented and as the inventory flows through they match up glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer it s in our guidance it s spread over three quarters and like i said and like jeff saying it s largely offset by the inventory value on hand michael dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay that s helpful and just the second question following up on that would be just given the price declines following the exclusions you re saying it s offsetting the rebates in the first few quarters but on a go forward basis since the rebates kind of go away the price declines i guess don t necessarily how should we think about the net effect beyond the initial quarter or two where you have the offset from the rebates glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer i think the way we need to think about it is they are roughly offsetting jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer there is not there is not there is a large since we raised the inventory prior to the tariffs the inventory that most of the inventory we sold in the year came from old pieces and we still have large inventories of what we ve been purchasing through the period as it and so it s offsetting that michael dahl rbc capital markets analyst right i guess sorry just where i was going with that if market pricing has reset lower are you saying that it s only impacting the legacy inventory or is this a go forward impact from lower market pricing as well jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the market pricing has gone down on clickable lvt and i don t see any reason it s going to change michael dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer and the products we re buying have gone down too so the new prices are in line with the new selling prices and costs are aligned glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer so to the extent we re buying it it s pretty much offset michael dahl rbc capital markets analyst right right got it ok thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john baugh from stifel your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer hey john john baugh stifel nicolaus analyst thank you and good morning two quick questions one do you have a rough guess on revenue or sales basis what your market share of the us lvt market is jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer yes but we haven t we don t give out specific details on product categories john baugh stifel nicolaus analyst okay would you have a guess jeff as to when you see out into the future reaching parity or any kind of rough idea timeline jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i don t understand the question john baugh stifel nicolaus analyst well i presume your share of us lvt sales is lower than your share sort of of the flooring market in general so my question is when would you see mohawk in lvt whether it s imported or made in the us sort of match up the shares of carpet ceramic laminate all put together jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer it s continuing to increase but i don t have a date when the two match up john baugh stifel nicolaus analyst okay secondly really quickly you mentioned imports of ceramic from around the world into the us around 17 in q4 could you just remind us sort of on a normal typical year how much import as a percentage of the us consumption thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer imports is a huge part of the ceramic market maybe 70 75 it s a huge part john baugh stifel nicolaus analyst great thank you very much good luck glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks john operator our next question comes from the line of justin speer from zelman associates your line is open justin speer zelman associates analyst appreciate it just wanted to start just to get a sense from you because the removal of the click lvt tariff was fairly recent but i think we understand the deflationary aspect of that in the near term but how does that affect demand for lvt and what s your view for price and demand for the non lvt categories in the fourth quarter and what s expected in the first quarter kind of high level jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer there are no details of that available today our expectation our guess is that lvt has approximately about a 3 5 billion part of the industry it s growing we think that the growth rate is slowing as the base gets bigger as we go through it s impacting the growth rate of the other products within it as you go through so i m not sure we have the details that you re looking for justin speer zelman associates analyst okay so i would just keep our eye on that but i guess within your guidance as you unpack that there is obviously some conservatism around maybe production rates slowing and then the other element is a variable in sg a investment so sg a was up about 9 5 in the fourth quarter up 7 for the full year i m just trying to get a sense for what your sg a investment will be in 2020 recognizing that you have some cost tailwinds from restructuring efforts but you are also investing in the business so just trying to get a sense for how much sg a will be up or down next year glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer well 2020 will be higher due to the full year impact of our investments we do expect higher sales in the second half that s the target of these investments we will evaluate as we go through the year and we ll adjust if necessary depending on the sales justin speer zelman associates analyst excellent an the last question for me is just i didn t catch it but on the ceramic tile bridge what was the price mix and what was the productivity and start up cost elements of the bridge jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer yes repeat the question justin speer zelman associates analyst the bridge the ebit bridge that you gave i didn t hear price mix or the productivity elements of the ceramic tile jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer on the ceramic tile so on ceramic the price mix was slipped by 4 million justin speer zelman associates analyst down by 4 million jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer price mix slipped by 4 million and overall productivity and lower start ups costs offset that that was 6 million justin speer zelman associates analyst perfect thank you guys jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer so a little more comment on the sg a in the us we re expanding the commercial sales forces we re building markets for quartz countertops roofing and lvt in europe we re developing a new commercial sales organization to sell lvt vinyl and carpet tile we ve invested in regional distributors which we purchased our distribution and different pieces which all the costs going into sg a was offset by higher sales and margins and russia we ve talked about increasing stores so there s a lot of activities of which those are only some of justin speer zelman associates analyst so these are growth investments and just ultimately you re so you re not pulling in the range you re digging into invest to grow and ultimately you think that ll really manifest itself in growth better growth in the second half above market growth do you think jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i mean the markets we re investing to expand the areas which we think we can expand and we ll monitor as we go through the year and we also have all the new product categories and new the new businesses you have to put the sales people in before you get the sales for them and the marketing monies justin speer zelman associates analyst that makes sense thank you operator and due to time constraints and to allow everyone to ask a question going further please allow yourself one question our next question comes from the line of matthew bouley from barclays your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer hey matt matthew bouley barclays analyst hey thank you for taking my questions or question can you just provide a little more color on the comment you made around the how the virus in china is impacting the start up of lvt production and how that s flowing to you guys because obviously you re ramping your own capacity i guess the question is how reliant is mohawk on this start up capacity in china for year 2020 plants thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the information is less than perfect at this point they go on holiday for the new year then the people come back so the people are not coming back at the rate they would normally come back there are some operations have started some are in partial things and some haven t started at all and the question is how is all that going to line up and when they re going to start nobody has a clear view of what it s going to be given we have inventories in line we can last a while before it has any impact on the business and we re having monitor it to see what s going to happen in our business we do buy products from other countries and we manufacture ourselves so it has less impact on us than the rest of the industry but the whole industry has the potential of a slower service depending upon what happens matthew bouley barclays analyst great thanks for the details jeff operator and our next question comes from the line of susan maklari from goldman sachs your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer hi susan susan maklari goldman sachs analyst good morning i wondered if you could talk a little bit about how you re thinking of inflation and raw materials as we go through the year i know that you said it was a 3 million benefit as it related to the consolidated business in the fourth quarter but how are you thinking about that as we look to 2020 jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the raw material prices in general mostly the oil related products have come down at the same time there is more aggressive pricing in the marketplace and we re assuming that the market prices are going to continue to reflect the decreases mostly in the commodity categories and we re going to continue to participate in aggressive manner we ll have to see how competition reacts in some of the other places we had in europe for instance we had prices on our insulation boards come down dramatically but so have the prices of the products in each so we re assuming given the excess capacities in the world today that the changes will be reflected in market prices susan maklari goldman sachs analyst okay thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of seldon clarke from deutsche bank your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer good morning seldon clarke deutsche bank analyst hey thanks for the question just given all the moving parts with your various product rollouts and investments in sg a and just how the timing of these investments relate to your production ramp when should we expect to see some operating leverage show up on the sg a side jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer in the second half we re expecting to see some benefits from the actions we re taking and we will keep reevaluating them and depending upon how the markets change we will continue to adjust seldon clarke deutsche bank analyst and are those operating leverage are those savings tied to operating leverage or purely cost kind of 30 million you re targeting glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer the 30 million of restructuring is more about cost jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer you re tying the restructuring piece with the marketing investments they are separate seldon clarke deutsche bank analyst right so i m just trying to ask like when you should start to see some operating leverage on the sg a side jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer we re expecting to see most more of the benefits about in the third quarter in the second half we keep saying seldon clarke deutsche bank analyst got it ok appreciate the question thanks operator our next question comes from the line of tim wojs from baird your line is open tim wojs baird analyst hey guys good morning jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer good morning tim wojs baird analyst just a clarification so sg a is up and is expected to be up over the next few quarters as you re investing in to grow sales but the gross profit was actually up in q4 for the first time in i think six or seven quarters so should we expect that that gross profit can actually grow a little bit and you re reinvesting that in sg a now and that s really what s driving some of the year over year ebit margin compression is that the right way to look at it jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer you answer what he wants glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer i think we stated broadly we expect 2020 to improve over this year our overall results back end weighted to the second half and that s broad based it s based on our initiatives and the pass through of the costs so sg a is a function of that and ultimately the trend should continue tim wojs baird analyst okay jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer on the cost side we re expecting the restructuring pieces we ve done to benefit at the same time the increased volume through the new plants should reduce the cost and help the margins in those also tim wojs baird analyst okay okay that sounds good and then just sneaking another one in what s the cost inflation outlook in ceramic glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer again we ve talked about that several times in ceramic and that s really overseas that is largely some raw material but energy costs that are driven by the eastern european facilities and fixed government pricing jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think in europe we expect maybe a little relief on some of the energy increases this year tim wojs baird analyst okay okay thanks operator our next question comes from the line of keith hughes from suntrust your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer hi keith keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks questions on north america ceramic in light of the fall in imports as you had identified is that i guess my question is where does the channel inventory stand now when do you think that will be more balanced i know it s been out of over inventory for sometimes jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer keith we don t know we don t have the data to see the inventory exactly what we know is that the imports which is a huge piece of the market came down 17 in the quarter and the imports from china dropped off altogether so we expect that it s a combination of inventories in this channel coming down and softness in the market keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst is this still something that s going to affect the first half jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer it s just hard to tell because keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hard to tell jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer all we can really see is the amount of inventory coming in to the country but we don t have a sense yet exactly the size of the inventory in the channel keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst i understand thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of michael wood from nomura instinet your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer good morning michael wood nomura instinet analyst hi good morning just wanted to talk about that ceramics import data if i look at it historically it is down considerably fourth quarter year over year although it s still higher than the fourth quarter in 17 and 16 so i m just curious how you re looking at that level of imports and how you re thinking where it should be i mean is this a level a healthy amount of import activity currently that we can sustain jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer well what we believe is that as you got into 2019 and when the tariffs were announced on the chinese product prior to those going to effect there was we believe a significant increase in pre buys related to that in addition as they replace the chinese inventory with other countries you had a combination of chinese inventories in the system plus new products that they were purchasing to replace it which elevated those inventories and sort of we believe gave a sort of a thoughts view of how much the industry was growing we don t know exactly last year but we think it probably declined 3 to 5 would be but it s just a guess michael wood nomura instinet analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of truman patterson from wells fargo your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer hi truman hi good morning guys and thanks for taking my question appreciate it the question for me the capacity that you all have coming online previously earlier last year you said you had about 1 2 billion coming online in 2019 and 2020 could you just give us an update of how much is coming online in 2020 and possibly 2021 remind us which products and categories and then just one item for clarification the lvt rebate if i m hearing you correctly in the first quarter it will probably be somewhere around maybe 0 10 benefit to eps glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer well again what we said is that s the total rebate which will be largely offset by inventory and lower pricing so again it s immaterial but it s in the guidance truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay and then the capacity jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the new plants are they the different pieces we have lvt which is still ramping up that will ramp up all through this year we have the russian sheet vinyl plant which is running it s positively helping the business now but it still has it s only used about 30 of the capacity as we push it into the marketplace we have the carpet tile business which we re developing an entire commercial sales organization which is also going to sell vinyl and lvt in europe so it s ramping up it takes a while to develop the customers and pieces we put in a new capacity in brazil to put in higher end products we have capacity in eastern europe to make low end ceramic which expands our market there is ramping up we have the quartz plant in the united states that s running about three shifts today but it s building inventory and also pushing it in over time that would go to four shifts and the productivity and inventories the productivity and throughput will go up and all of them we have to get the mix aligned because you start out selling more lower quality products to get more volume through the plants and it s going to take time to develop those as we go through so they re all working through they system at different rates truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay thank you is that still about 1 2 billion that you re bringing online over the next couple of years jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i mean part of it s already on so what s happening is some of the upside is getting offset by decreases in our legacy businesses so the legacy businesses have declines and it s offsetting some of the gains in the new pieces truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay okay thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of kathryn thompson from thompson research group your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer hi kat brian biros thompson research group analyst this is actually brian biros on for kathryn thank you for taking my question i wanted to ask a follow up on the coronavirus and i guess the supply chain impact trg industry contacts are telling us that the supply chain has not really yet been meaningfully impacted but if the manufacturing stoppages are extended another three to four weeks that could then impact shipments about three to five months from now actually wanted to see if you guys think that logic makes sense and maybe any color on what you re hearing from manufacturers from either vietnam or south korea on the impact to their supply chain jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i think that s close to what we said we said that right now it s difficult to say how fast it s going to come up that there are huge inventories in the chain over different times that it depends on each piece so typically there is anywhere from four to seven months of inventory through the channels and the stuff coming through and in that you have some that have low parts and some that have high parts across the industry so depending upon what it is and each piece and how fast the part comes up it depends on the time there could be people on the channel with less than that and they could be impacted with a few weeks worth of delays the non chinese production and the surrounding countries some of it or a significant part of it also uses inputs coming out of china so if the inputs don t come up it could affect those also so at this point it s really difficult to know what s going to happen and the impact it depends on the inventory levels of any individual skus at this point as most people when they buy from there there is the chinese new year where they shut down so you have the product that was bought in anticipation of that still flowing across the water coming in and so it still comes back to how fast it s going to pick up and what the timing of the new production is going to production coming up and nobody has any idea brian biros thompson research group analyst got it thanks for the color operator our next question comes from the line of john lovallo from bank of america your line is open jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer hi john john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys thank you for fitting me in here i just want to make sure that i understand your outlook seems to imply year over year operating margin expansion at least in 3q and 4q is that correct glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer yes john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks operator and our final question today comes from the line of laura champine from loop capital your line is open laura champine loop capital analyst thanks for taking my question if we look at your new production of lvt in the us how competitively do you think you ll be able to price that product relative to chinese competition and how does that influence your ability to get close to full capacity by the end of the year jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer we think when it s fully optimized that we ll be able to compete with the world marketplaces at the same time our goal isn t to sell all commodity product our goal is to sell value added products that have a higher average mix which will help which will allow us to meet the return goals that we have laura champine loop capital analyst got it thank you operator i would now like to turn the call back over to mr lorberbaum for closing remarks jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer while reacting to the market conditions we see excess capacities in the market continuing and we ll have to continue to react to competition in the marketplaces as they evolve there are a lot of indicators that many of the markets around the world are expecting the economies to get better and improve we have a lot of a lot going on to increase the utilization of our new plants which we think will help the second half as the throughputs go up which will allow the cost to come down and also the mix to improve over time we think we re doing the right things to react to the market and invest in the categories to increase our business level

eurozone japan the united kingdom and the united states should reveal how businesses outside of china have been affected by the outbreak with the risk that runaway equity markets may be handed a tough reality check in other data australian employment and canadian and uk retail sales will be watched closely while in japan fourth quarter gdp numbers are likely to renew pressure on policymakers for additional stimulus measures australian labour market under spotlight australia s labour market will be scrutinized over the next week as quarterly wage growth figures are due on wednesday and the latest employment report is out on thursday with the reserve bank of australia looking increasingly reluctant to make deeper cuts to interest rates the labour market indicators will test policymakers questionable economic optimism apart from the devastating bushfires that so far do not appear to have notably dented growth australian businesses have also had to grapple with the coronavirus epidemic which is bound to disrupt trade with china australia s biggest trading partner the australian dollar has bounced off 11 year lows on hopes that the outbreak may be slowing but any evidence that the spread is far from receding could pull the currency to fresh lows investors will also be keeping an eye on the manufacturing and services pmis for february due on friday to get a better sense of how the various headwinds may be affecting the australian economy as well as on the minutes of the rba s february meeting to be published on tuesday japan s economy likely contracted in q4 despite a year long slump in exports japan posted impressive growth rates for the first three quarters of 2019 however growth is expected to have taken a huge hit in the final three months of 2019 as consumer spending which had been supporting the economy until the october sales tax hike crumbled while the protracted trade war continued to wreak havoc for exporters the gdp report on monday is expected to show the economy shrunk by 0 9 on a quarterly basis and by 3 7 on an annualized basis which would mark the biggest fall in output since the second quarter of 2014 when the sales tax was last raised revised industrial production figures for december are also due on monday and next to come under the radar will be december machinery orders and export numbers for january on wednesday the flurry of data will continue on friday with the consumer price index for january and the jibun flash manufacturing pmi for february a rebound in exports in january is possible as early data suggests there was a worldwide upswing in manufacturing activity at the start of the year however the manufacturing pmi could show conditions deteriorated again in february a negative set of releases are likely to weigh on risk appetite especially if the data elsewhere is also not very encouraging and this would only mean increased safe haven demand for the japanese yen eurozone pmis could spell more trouble for battered euro the flash pmi readings by ihs markit will be the highlight of the european calendar amid doubts about the green shots of recovery in the euro area eurozone manufacturing pmi has been steadily recovering since october and picked up some speed in january however the rebound could be cut short by the virus outbreak and so friday s pmis for both the manufacturing and services sectors will be very important for detecting any shift in the outlook for the eurozone economy also out the same day are the final inflation prints for january and ahead of friday s data the zew economic sentiment index will be watched out of germany on tuesday and the european central bank s meeting minutes for january might attract some attention on thursday the euro is at risk of accelerating its declines if next week s figures do not provide any reason for optimism euro dollar tumbled to a 33 month low of 1 0826 this week on the back of bleak industrial output numbers which have coincided with upbeat indicators from the us unless there s a change in the contrasting picture the pair is likely to remain pressured to the downside busy week in the uk over in the uk the flash pmis will be just as crucial as the virus fallout could create a fresh headache for british businesses just as they are getting back on their feet from last year s brexit chaos before the pmi release though there will be a string of other data that will shed light on how the uk economy is performing jobs figures are up first on tuesday and after last month s surprise jump in employment growth investors will be looking to see if a similar momentum was maintained in the three months to december wage growth will be closely monitored too given the recent weakness in consumer spending on wednesday it will be the turn of january inflation numbers before attention moves to the latest retail sales data on thursday retail sales in the uk have not grown since july of last year as households turned more cautious amidst the political turmoil generated by brexit a bounce in retail sales in january would suggest the decisive election outcome in december went some way in restoring confidence among consumers but a bigger reassurance for markets that growth is returning to normal would be positive pmi readings on friday both the manufacturing and services pmis rebounded sharply in january and a broadening recovery in february would reinforce the view that the uk s soft patch is over it would also further dampen expectations of a rate cut this year likely benefiting the pound sterling already got a boost this week on speculation that the unexpected resignation of the uk s finance minister will pave the way for looser fiscal policy helping cable recover from 2½ month lows few economic drivers for the dollar it will be somewhat of a muted seven days in the us with mostly second tier releases making up the schedule the week will get off to a quiet start as markets will be closed on monday for president s day and the empire state manufacturing index for february the first of several business surveys next week will make the rounds on tuesday housing numbers will dominate on wednesday with building permits and housing starts for january on the agenda along with the latest producer price index on thursday the philly fed manufacturing index will provide another glimpse into the state of the manufacturing sector in february and on friday the flash pmis and existing home sales will wrap up the week although the ihs markit pmis do not carry the same weight as the ism pmis they could nevertheless move the greenback in an otherwise lacklustre week especially if there is a global trend in the pmis of worsening economic activity in february as a result of the coronavirus not as likely to see much of a market response will be the federal reserve s minutes of their january meeting due on wednesday following chairman powell s testimony in congress this week the minutes will be seen as somewhat out of date and will probably be ignored by traders inflation and retail sales coming up in canada moving north of the border to canada inflation and retail sales numbers will be eyed on wednesday and friday respectively manufacturing sales on tuesday will also be viewed but the data is at best only anticipated to trigger knee jerk reactions in the canadian dollar as investors pare back their expectations of a rate cut in the coming months bank of canada governor stephen poloz struck a neutral tone in remarks this week further dashing expectations of a near term rate reduction however the loonie is still vulnerable to downside moves if oil prices fail to stabilize from their recent falls and investors will be watching carefully how well the coronavirus is contained and whether opec and its allies decide to go ahead with additional production cuts

reserve started cutting interest rates in july the fed lowered rates three times before freezing the benchmark federal funds rate at a range of 1 5 1 75 in november the market is reportedly expecting multiple cuts in 2020 that along with similarly dovish policies among other central banks a record 17 trillion of negative yielding sovereign bonds and fresh safe haven demand due to tensions with iran and a lack of progress on trade talks to name two key issues powered precious metals to new heights spot gold and silver prices both peaked in early september at a respective 1 552 00 oz and 19 67 oz taking a long term view of silver and gold prices reveals that the precious metals move in almost identical patterns over the last year gold and silver have each gained about 25 trough to peak over the last five years gold gained 45 to silver s 40 charting the metals back to 2010 the correlation is tight when gold goes up it almost always takes silver with it it s actually fascinating to examine these charts closely at face value the red lines appear to show a very similar pattern the spike in both gold and silver prices happened in 2011 when gold shot up to a record 1 900 an ounce and silver approached 50 oz but in fact silver s streak occurred in april five months before gold s big run this contradicts the prevailing wisdom that silver prices follow gold prices silver and gold trade fairly closely for the next nine years but diverge towards the end of the charts notice the column between jan 19 and feb 20 at the start of 2019 gold turns sharply upward for a whole year even touching 1 600 very recently silver still lags gold silver ratio silver price gold price the gold to silver ratio is simply the amount of silver one can buy with an ounce of gold to find the ratio divide the current gold price by the price of silver studying the three charts tells me i need to position myself in silver and silver stocks on june 12 the gold silver ratio hit a 26 year high by breaking through the 90 ounce mark meaning it took over 90 ounces of silver to purchase one ounce of gold the higher the number the more undervalued is silver or to put it another way the farther gold prices are pulling away from silver prices the gold silver ratio tells precious metals investors which is under valued or over valued silver or gold at the current ratio of 88 1 a trader who has an ounce of gold could sell his gold for 88 ounces of silver compared to the historical average of 56 silver ounces to one gold ounce historically then silver is right now extremely under priced compared to gold incidentally the 2019 gold silver ratio of 86 1 ranks among the highest 2 of all time dating back to 1687 there have been only two years since the us government removed the dollar from the gold peg 1991 and 1992 that there were higher ratios if silver is still so under valued we got to thinking what would it take for silver prices to rise to the levels of nearly a decade ago what were the silver market conditions in 2011 that could reveal clues as to where silver is going in 2020 this article attempts to answer these questions 2011 boom and bust there are numerous suppositions as to why silver prices climbed 175 in one year before suddenly falling off a cliff silver plummeted over 25 in two days many observers looked to investment banks like jp morgan suspected of manipulating the silver market which at the time was known to be shorting silver even though prices kept rising conspiracy theorists recalled what happened to warren buffet s ill fated silver squeeze in the 1990s that propelled the price up 80 before crashing dovish monetary policy at the us federal reserve was another reason to be bullish on precious metals in early 2011 three years after the great recession the us economy was still reeling from the mortgage crisis and collapse of lehman brothers confidence in the us economy was at a record low the eurozone was in trouble with greece ireland portugal italy and spain all reporting financial problems the fed announced a third round of quantitative easing and reaffirmed it would hold interest rates at zero for at least two years in august 2011 the swiss national bank stunned financial markets by promising to print the swiss franc in unlimited quantities as necessary to maintain a peg between the franc and the euro resulting in a flood of investments out of the franc and into other safe haven currencies or precious metals elsewhere in europe central banks remained committed to resolving the debt crisis by even more borrowing the result of all of these economic factors including a belief that the dollar was under siege was for investors to seek safe haven assets like gold and silver a more intricate reasoning for silver s rise involved the use of silver in solar panels this theory begins with the belief that industrial demand for silver was surging in 2011 due in part to the photovoltaic industry consuming silver in much higher quantities than previously supply wasn t able to keep up leaving a shortfall this it turns out wasn t quite true while the industry did experience massive growth between 2008 and 2011 silver demand rose 338 it barely registered as a demand driver according to bullionvault the silver market was also thought to be tight due to a shortage of high purity bars required for the silver paste that goes into solar panels these 0 9999 fine silver bars are less common than the regular 0 999 bars so when the supply of high purity bars ran low corresponding with the hike in the silver price a cause and effect was assumed there was in fact a shortage of 0 9999 bars but the supply of raw material mined silver remained well stocked between 2003 and 2012 the silver market was in a significant surplus six times bullionvault notes whatever the reason or reasons for its jump silver s surprising journey to 49 stopped abruptly in mid september 2011 initiated by then fed chairman ben bernanke s decision not to proceed with more quantitative easing money metals exchange explains what happened next disappointed long traders began selling their contracts as prices fell the margin calls began forcing weak hands to sell then major u s and asian exchanges increased margin requirements the result of these rapid fire events was a near term rout in the paper prices for gold and silver the precious metal plunged from a peak of 49 an ounce to under 40 within a week silver s biggest three day plunge in 28 years silver investors and traders know the metal to be thinly traded and therefore volatile but the scope of the correction raised eyebrows some traders blamed the unwinding of the long silver short dollar hedge for the scale of the correction the telegraph quotes the president of the precious metals trading firm dillon gage saying us investors bought silver and gold as a way to hedge against further erosion in the dollar s buying power conspiracy theorists appeared to be validated when a rumor circulated about massive selling out of george soros s hedge fund in the following weeks a lawsuit was filed against jp morgan and hsbc alleging market manipulation however both the cftc and a new york appeals court found no indications of collusion or criminal abuse of the silver market gold silver ratio as indicator wouldn t it be great if we had a tried and true forecasting tool that could tell us when silver and gold prices are going to take off of course possessing such a thing would stand to make us a lot of money sadly we don t what we do have is the gold silver ratio and the knowledge that the precious metals usually move in the same direction although silver historically leaps faster and higher than gold as mentioned at the top the current gold silver ratio of 88 1 is near historic highs for the ratio to drop either gold needs to fall or silver to rise the question silver investors want answered is when are rising silver prices going to bring the ratio down to a more reasonable level that reflects the bullish fundamentals for silver we get some help here from a may 2019 column in kitco the author notices that since 2011 instead of trailing along with gold silver keeps getting cheaper and cheaper relative to gold so what gives we don t know the answer to why silver investors aren t acting on the flashing red neon buy now sign indicated by the high gold silver ratio but according to a commodities analyst article on seeking alpha the ratio is one of the most reliable buy indicators for silver whenever it is above 80 ie now all of the charts above confirm silver mines ltd managing director anthony mclure confirms this reportedly telling the denver gold forum last september that the higher than normal ratio is often the precursor to a bull run peter schiff in a recent column states that because silver is despite its many industrial uses still a monetary metal it tends to track relatively consistently with gold over time when gold goes up it almost always takes silver with it furthermore it may well mean the silver gold ratio will shrink again as it did in the years after the 08 crash historically during a bull market in gold silver outperforms if this holds true that ratio will close conclusion the silver market today is obviously quite different from the one in 2011 that saw silver prices jump to an all time high of 49 an ounce but could it run that far again we believe so consider industrial demand for silver particularly photovoltaics is heading up and should get another lift if and when the trade war with china is put to rest investment demand for silver also looks solid with no end in sight to the low interest rate policy direction of central banks add higher demand to shrinking supply lower grades and less silver by product credits from falling lead and zinc mine production we see a floor forming under silver prices the 88 1 gold silver ratio is very high by historical standards this is a warning to investors that at any time the ratio could correct either meaning a move up in silver prices or a move down in gold prices gold is holding up very well despite a phase 1 trade deal with china a continued strong dollar and higher sovereign bond yields in the us than elsewhere at aoth we do not believe the gold price is going to fall quite the opposite peter schiff states silver has hit an all time high of 49 per ounce twice in january 1980 and then again in april 2011 if you adjust that 49 high for inflation you re looking at a price of around 150 per ounce in other words silver has a long way to run up as one analyst put it with the long term downside potential of silver very low versus its current valuation the risk reward is one of the best investments on the planet we don t know what will be the catalyst that makes silver prices leap again like it did in 2011 or when it will happen but one thing is for sure when silver runs volatility will be high it will likely spike fast without warning probably much higher than gold we wouldn t want you to miss it rick mills please check back for new articles and updates at commoditytrademantra com

in its latest global economic prospects the world bank has downgraded its estimate for the global growth from 3 in 2018 to a possible 2 4 in 2019 as a result the african continent is experiencing a slowdown with growth in the sub saharan african region downgraded from 2 6 in 2018 to an possible 2 4 in 2019 looking at the economic trade and investment data growth within the african continent as a whole remains quite resilient in the face of all the current global geopolitical risks many african economies particularly the smaller ones are in fact slowly but surely moving forward with the world bank forecasting that growth in the sub saharan african region will increase to 2 9 in 2020 however there are in fact many dangers lurking ahead that can have a major negative impact on the overall african growth at its peak trade between the us and africa reached 129 3 billion in 2011 and has since then declined to reach an average of above 50 billion annually according to data from the international trade centre the shale oil production boom in texas and north dakota has now made america the world s top oil producer and exporter surpassing saudi arabia and russia its average production of 17 87 million barrels daily represents 18 of the global oil production as a consequence the us does not need to import as much oil as previously from angola nigeria and other oil producing african countries despite the fact that african trade with the us is not as significant as with its other trade partners american politics as well as the economic and foreign policies from president donald trump and his administration can potentially have a significant impact on the continent in 2020 since his inauguration trump has shown the world that he will not hesitate to take unilateral actions that were previously considered unimaginable and impossible for an american president to do advertisement his trade wars against china and american allies like canada europe japan and south korea have instilled enormous uncertainties in the world resulting in a global slowdown for now president trump re negotiated the trade agreement with canada and mexico and declared a temporary truce with china with a phase one trade deal but he may again pressure the federal reserve to further cut rates to boost the american economy and re ignite his trade war rhetoric to fire up his supporters for his re election bid these will in turn affect global growth and africa trump has neither any interest in multilateralism nor to be involved in global affairs nor to maintain the american global leadership under his america first policies not only is america turning inwards but is also becoming more nationalistic and protectionist as well as following solely its own self interests trump s foreign policies may seem erratic to the world but for his supporters his overseas trips and executive actions are either meant to portray that he is a great leader on the world stage or to distract them from his domestic political woes these actions definitely have major consequences for instance his middle east foreign policies and unilateral decision to contain iran create uncertainty and volatility in crude oil prices moreover confronting china in the south china sea as well as mismanaging geopolitical issues in the korean peninsula the middle east and elsewhere can potentially lead to a major conflict that will lead to a further slump in the global economy all these will inflict indirect consequences on african countries china versus america and the coronavirus outbreak with the ongoing bruising trade war between china and america both countries managed to agree on a phase one trade deal at the beginning of the year this is not the end the tussle between china and america will continue on even beyond this current administration as a result with many of its exports towards the us still facing significant tariffs the chinese economy is slowing down china is the largest trade partner of africa with 162 6 billion worth of goods traded in 2018 over the past years china has invested heavily in africa and has significant investment stock within the continent during the forum on china africa cooperation in 2018 china pledged another 60 billion of financing to africa with the belt and road initiative china is not only linking africa to the world but also helping in some major infrastructure development within the continent with a slowing down economy and declining exports towards america the chinese demand for african commodities will drop putting downward pressure on global commodity prices this will affect copper exports from zambia and the democratic republic of the congo iron ore from south africa crude oil from angola and nigeria as well as many other hard and soft commodities from other african countries to make matters worse china is battling the recent coronavirus outbreak by taking drastic measures this will not only further affect the chinese economy but the aftermath may be more serious for the global economy in the coming months china is now the second biggest economy with deep and complex links within the world economy any economic crisis in china will eventually provoke a chain reaction that will hit the world hard in the short term with many of the high spending chinese tourists prevented from travelling and put in quarantine especially during the lunar new year holidays their tourism dollars will not be earned by many foreign countries and businesses except for the ethiopian airlines many other african airlines such as air mauritius egyptair kenya airways and rwandair have currently suspended their numerous flights towards mainland china this will have a significant impact on their future profits with declining revenue and increasing operational costs the aftereffect will also be on business activities across all sectors with the movement of business people being disrupted in addition many african hotels and resorts as well as other tourism related businesses will eventually be affected by this coronavirus outbreak in china the eu trade with africa reached a peak of us 411 2 billion in 2012 and dropped by 35 2 in 2016 since then trade has not yet reached its former peak but little by little it is improving to reach us 345 5 billion in 2018 the world bank has projected a gloomy outlook for the eurozone area forecasting that its economic slowdown will continue on and will barely grow by 1 in 2020 as a group the eu is the top trade partner of the african continent any economic slowdown within the eu will affect its economic and trade ties with africa by the end of 2018 the former european central bank ecb chief mario draghi declared that the ecb would stop its 2 6 trillion quantitative easing yet seven months later the central bank had to cut rates into the negative territory and re start its economic stimulus with a monthly purchase of 20 billion worth of bonds to support the flagging eurozone economy germany europe s largest economic engine is facing major headwinds last year it narrowly avoided a technical recession in the third quarter and overall barely grew in 2019 as for france with president emmanuel macron pushing for economic and pension reforms it has been facing the yellow vests movement since 2018 and major strikes since last december besides in 2020 the eu will have to potentially battle vigorously a trade war with america the main targets of president trump s trade war with europe france and germany are major economic and trade partners of many african countries and to top it all off brexit after all the hustle and bustle britain under the leadership of prime minister boris johnson is now finally out of the eu however during the transition period till december 31st 2020 the uk will not only have to follow the eu rules but also negotiate another trade agreement with the eu it will be indeed near impossible to have a formal free trade agreement within 11 months with the uk being a major location for the trading and transformation of african commodities the future post brexit status of the uk within europe and globally will eventually have a repercussion on africa lastly in spite of the fact that the uk is a major trade partner for many african countries the future of any africa uk trade agreement still remains unclear to mitigate these major geopolitical risks african countries need to continue building and strengthening new economic and trade partnerships with other countries african countries can also create more opportunities with better regional economic integration so as to leverage the huge potential of their local domestic markets while the economic growth within the african continent remains resilient 2020 will still present many challenges that will directly or indirectly affect it therefore carefully navigating through these rough seas is vital to keep fuelling the african growth in the near future richard li is a partner with steel advisory partners a management consulting firm this article was originally published on howwemadeitinafrica com like this like loading
the preliminary pmis for february will take centre stage next week as they will provide the first insight into the possible impact of the coronavirus on the global economy the flash releases in the eurozone japan the united kingdom and the united states should reveal how businesses outside of china have been affected by the outbreak with the risk that runaway equity markets may be handed a tough reality check in other data australian employment and canadian and uk retail sales will be watched closely while in japan fourth quarter gdp numbers are likely to renew pressure on policymakers for additional stimulus measures australian labour market under spotlight australia s labour market will be scrutinized over the next week as quarterly wage growth figures are due on wednesday and the latest employment report is out on thursday with the reserve bank of australia looking increasingly reluctant to make deeper cuts to interest rates the labour market indicators will test policymakers questionable economic optimism apart from the devastating bushfires that so far do not appear to have notably dented growth australian businesses have also had to grapple with the coronavirus epidemic which is bound to disrupt trade with china australia s biggest trading partner the australian dollar has bounced off 11 year lows on hopes that the outbreak may be slowing but any evidence that the spread is far from receding could pull the currency to fresh lows investors will also be keeping an eye on the manufacturing and services pmis for february due on friday to get a better sense of how the various headwinds may be affecting the australian economy as well as on the minutes of the rba s february meeting to be published on tuesday japan s economy likely contracted in q4 despite a year long slump in exports japan posted impressive growth rates for the first three quarters of 2019 however growth is expected to have taken a huge hit in the final three months of 2019 as consumer spending which had been supporting the economy until the october sales tax hike crumbled while the protracted trade war continued to wreak havoc for exporters the gdp report on monday is expected to show the economy shrunk by 0 9 on a quarterly basis and by 3 7 on an annualized basis which would mark the biggest fall in output since the second quarter of 2014 when the sales tax was last raised revised industrial production figures for december are also due on monday and next to come under the radar will be december machinery orders and export numbers for january on wednesday the flurry of data will continue on friday with the consumer price index for january and the jibun flash manufacturing pmi for february a rebound in exports in january is possible as early data suggests there was a worldwide upswing in manufacturing activity at the start of the year however the manufacturing pmi could show conditions deteriorated again in february a negative set of releases are likely to weigh on risk appetite especially if the data elsewhere is also not very encouraging and this would only mean increased safe haven demand for the japanese yen eurozone pmis could spell more trouble for battered euro the flash pmi readings by ihs markit will be the highlight of the european calendar amid doubts about the green shots of recovery in the euro area eurozone manufacturing pmi has been steadily recovering since october and picked up some speed in january however the rebound could be cut short by the virus outbreak and so friday s pmis for both the manufacturing and services sectors will be very important for detecting any shift in the outlook for the eurozone economy also out the same day are the final inflation prints for january and ahead of friday s data the zew economic sentiment index will be watched out of germany on tuesday and the european central bank s meeting minutes for january might attract some attention on thursday the euro is at risk of accelerating its declines if next week s figures do not provide any reason for optimism euro dollar tumbled to a 33 month low of 1 0826 this week on the back of bleak industrial output numbers which have coincided with upbeat indicators from the us unless there s a change in the contrasting picture the pair is likely to remain pressured to the downside busy week in the uk over in the uk the flash pmis will be just as crucial as the virus fallout could create a fresh headache for british businesses just as they are getting back on their feet from last year s brexit chaos before the pmi release though there will be a string of other data that will shed light on how the uk economy is performing jobs figures are up first on tuesday and after last month s surprise jump in employment growth investors will be looking to see if a similar momentum was maintained in the three months to december wage growth will be closely monitored too given the recent weakness in consumer spending on wednesday it will be the turn of january inflation numbers before attention moves to the latest retail sales data on thursday retail sales in the uk have not grown since july of last year as households turned more cautious amidst the political turmoil generated by brexit a bounce in retail sales in january would suggest the decisive election outcome in december went some way in restoring confidence among consumers but a bigger reassurance for markets that growth is returning to normal would be positive pmi readings on friday both the manufacturing and services pmis rebounded sharply in january and a broadening recovery in february would reinforce the view that the uk s soft patch is over it would also further dampen expectations of a rate cut this year likely benefiting the pound sterling already got a boost this week on speculation that the unexpected resignation of the uk s finance minister will pave the way for looser fiscal policy helping cable recover from 2½ month lows few economic drivers for the dollar it will be somewhat of a muted seven days in the us with mostly second tier releases making up the schedule the week will get off to a quiet start as markets will be closed on monday for president s day and the empire state manufacturing index for february the first of several business surveys next week will make the rounds on tuesday housing numbers will dominate on wednesday with building permits and housing starts for january on the agenda along with the latest producer price index on thursday the philly fed manufacturing index will provide another glimpse into the state of the manufacturing sector in february and on friday the flash pmis and existing home sales will wrap up the week although the ihs markit pmis do not carry the same weight as the ism pmis they could nevertheless move the greenback in an otherwise lacklustre week especially if there is a global trend in the pmis of worsening economic activity in february as a result of the coronavirus not as likely to see much of a market response will be the federal reserve s minutes of their january meeting due on wednesday following chairman powell s testimony in congress this week the minutes will be seen as somewhat out of date and will probably be ignored by traders inflation and retail sales coming up in canada moving north of the border to canada inflation and retail sales numbers will be eyed on wednesday and friday respectively manufacturing sales on tuesday will also be viewed but the data is at best only anticipated to trigger knee jerk reactions in the canadian dollar as investors pare back their expectations of a rate cut in the coming months bank of canada governor stephen poloz struck a neutral tone in remarks this week further dashing expectations of a near term rate reduction however the loonie is still vulnerable to downside moves if oil prices fail to stabilize from their recent falls and investors will be watching carefully how well the coronavirus is contained and whether opec and its allies decide to go ahead with additional production cuts
please make sure these dispatches reach as many readers as possible share with kin friends and workmates and ask them to do likewise in ellen brown s brilliant new article mexico s amlo shows how it s done the researcher and national banking advocate made the powerful point that the only way to properly fight the neo liberal order is for nations of the west to follow the lead of mexico s current president lopez obrador who recently announced the creation of a new network of national banks of which over 3238 branches will be in operation by 2021 obrador s stated aim is to have 13 000 branches built across mexico which would far outnumber the total number of all private banks and will also provide a vital tool for the economic liberation of mexico this act is nothing short of heresy in the corridors of the neoliberal priesthood of our modern age the economic foundation upon which today s globalized world are premised assert that nation states may not participate in the marketplace no price controls no protective tariffs no bank regulation and certainly no national banks following this gospel nations are permitted to do war and promote various forms of population control but nothing that pollutes the purity of the supposedly free market of course simply utilizing national banking practices by themselves is not a full solution a fascist regime can of course use national banks for destructive ends just as a democratic republic can use them for positive ends and as we have seen over the years the financial oligarchy has no problem supporting fascist regimes such as hitler s germany or mussolini s italy nor do they have any problem supporting national keynesian initiatives so long as they are done under an anti human green new deal frame work so what makes president obrador s current efforts different as brown states in her paper the new president has held to his campaign promises in 2019 his first year in office he did what donald trump pledged to do drain the swamp purging the government of technocrats and institutions he considered corrupt profligate or impeding the transformation of mexico after 36 years of failed market focused neoliberal policies other accomplishments have included substantially increasing the minimum wage while cutting top government salaries and oversize pensions making small loans and grants directly to farmers guaranteeing crop prices for key agricultural crops launching programs to benefit youth the disabled and the elderly and initiating a 44 billion infrastructure plan lópez obrador s goal he says is to construct a new paradigm in economic policy that improves human welfare not just increases gross domestic product if you haven t figured it out the answer is morality what gave the establishment of modern nation states their power and legitimacy in the wake of the golden renaissance was the fact that they are premised upon the common good of the people against the interests of private oligarchs and elite families those feudal orders dominated by hereditary institutions during most of human history placed the natural order upside down with the welfare of the talking cows aka peasants granted to them by the fancy of the master class of land lords under a true sovereign nation state elected leaders derive their legitimacy and support of the people through their mandate to defend the inalienable rights of people though internal improvements which increase the socio physical spiritual well being of the people this used to be recognised in past ages as an elementary idea of natural law which saw the laws of morality as intertwined into the fabric of objective reality as the laws of gravity and electricity ben franklin s electric insight into economics it is here no coincidence that the leading proponent of national banking and productive credit in america was also the leading scientist who trumped all elite scientific minds of europe when he discovered the principle of electricity in 1752 benjamin franklin and his vast network of leading collaborators across europe and america never saw a distinction between subjective moral sciences and objective a moral physics the foundational documents and also the first national banking system of america upon which other republics in south and central america modelled themselves in the coming years were based upon this idea of natural law this insight was the basis for franklin s 1727 opus on the necessity for a paper currency where franklin argued that value was not located in gold or silver or land or even demand per se but rather in the creative powers of a people the consolidation of america s revolutionary war debt incurred by each of the 13 colonies into a unified federal credit transformed the unpayable debt into a national blessing as ben franklin s protégé alexander hamilton first treasury secretary laid out in his famous reports on a national bank and on manufactures in 1791 in opposition to the early free traders and monetarists who wished america would end its protective tariff stay agrarian and allow britain to maintain its global monopoly on industry hamilton and franklin understood this would undo the entire revolutionary cause resulting in america s eventual re absorption back into the empire although slandered by generations of anti american propaganda as a rothschild tool hamilton was in fact a great patriot who argued that once the new federal debt was consolidated the behaviour of the debt would be turned from a passive burdenwhich held the nation under water into an active fuel of investments into infrastructure and manufacturing by doing this the nation was able to transform from an agricultural slave society of cash cropping into a full spectrum society capable of producing for itself and trading surplus finished goods to other nations in its first 40 years this program allowed america s population to quadruple overcoming all malthusian limits to growth unfortunately starting with the 1804 killing of alexander hamilton at the hands of aaron burr the father of today s wall street banking syndicates much of america s history has been contaminated by either slave loving traitors who attacked national banking such as presidents van buren andrew jackson and polk or great statesmen who too often died in office before their efforts to revive the constitution could be consolidated in this list we find presidents harrison 1840 taylor 1851 lincoln 1865 garfield 1880 mckinley 1901 harding 1923 fdr 1945 jfk 1963 mexico and america by 1865 lincoln s use of national banking practices the greenback was instrumental in saving the union from british orchestrated civil war although his assassination hampered this momentum to full industrial reconstruction of the south during this time britain french and spanish hapsburg empires had initiated parallel wars to destroy the newly emerging mexican republic then led by lincoln admiring president benito juarez first with the 1858 1860 war of reform and then 1862 1867 french invasion in spite of this existential challenge juarez succeeded in driving out the imperialists with political and military support from lincoln patriots in america while also imposing tariffs which encouraged the build up of industry liberating mexico from its status as cash cropping exporter social and educational reforms elevating the health and welfare of the people grew enormously under juarez s leadership although lincoln republicans supported mexico s sovereign in opposition to foreign empires using a healthy interpretation of the monroe doctrine the death of mckinley in 1902 saw a grievous abuse of the monroe doctrine which too often became an imperial hammer to subdue banana republics as seen under the brutal leadership of teddy roosevelt franklin roosevelt was the first president to push back against the pro empire wall street crowd since mckinley s murder which he brought in with the good neighbor policy stating in the field of world policy i would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and because he does so respects the rights of others the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors fdr broke from his puppet predecessors by supporting mexico s rights to control its own oil and resources after president cárdenas expropriated foreign oil holdings and also vastly expanded credit from the us export import bank to fund massive mexican infrastructure projects with a focus on water energy and transport this served as one of the earliest international extensions of the new deal which fdr intended would liberate all nations of the earth from colonialism franklin roosevelt inspires mexico s amlo upon his election in 2018 president obrador announced the first phase of his new deal with an every young person to work program inspired by fdr which he described saying i have had this idea since i read how president franklin delano roosevelt pulled the united states out of the 1930s crisis what did he do in a tremendous economic crisis he decided to put the whole u s people to work and he decided to put young people to work and he paid them a dollar a day for every young person but his idea was full employment that is a job for everyone that idea stuck in my head because roosevelt lifted the united states out of the crisis and for me he was therefore if not the best president one of the best that the united states has had franklin delano roosevelt by that action by that decision now we are going to do something similar all young people to work under nafta mexico was kept down by acting as cheap labor market to do the work once done by high paid americans and canadians this policy ultimately hurt mexico since free trade s obsession with low costs resulted in keeping quality of life and production dismally low the formula low prices low paid workers better slaves weakened nations is as true today as it was 250 years ago when the british empire commissioned adam smith to write his 1776 wealth of nations obrador s efforts are moving in the right direction however the 13 000 national bank branches which he intends to have built will have to go beyond merely sending money to the poor as the plan is currently constituted and he knows it responding to the monetarist priests howling at the sacrilege of national banking obrador stated we re going to speak with those from the bank of méxico respecting the autonomy of the bank of méxico we have to educate them because for them this is an anachronism even sacrilege because they have other ideas but we ve arrived here after telling the people that the neoliberal economic policy was going to change thus taking over responsibility from the usurious private banking network and mexican central bank which have converted mexico into an indebted colony of crime and despair since the overthrow of president portillo in 1982 is a vital next step in the fight luckily china has made great strides in this direction which will likely be of a great assist to mexico to this point brown ended her report with the following astute analysis today the best model for that approach is china which funds infrastructure by borrowing from its own state owned banks like all banks they create loans as bank credit on their books which is then repaid with the proceeds of the projects created with the loans there is no need to tap up the central bank or rich investors or the tax base government banks can create money on their books just as central banks and private banks do for mexico however using its public banks as china does would be something for the future if at all meanwhile amlo has been a trailblazer in showing how a national public banking system can be initiated quickly and efficiently the key it seems is just to have the political will along with massive support from the public the legislature local business leaders and the military the irony here is that the american system of national banking productive credit and protective tariffs which were innovated by alexander hamilton and applied by every great leader from harrison to lincoln to mckinley to fdr both internally and across to international allies in mexico is now most clearly embodied by the country which few people associate with america the peoples republic of china while china uses its debt as an active asset to invest into great long term infrastructure projects which thus extinguish the original debt while increasing the productive powers of labor america s private central banking system under the federal reserve merely creates debt for speculation and turning poor americans into slaves just look at the 14 trillion the treasury printed to bail out failing speculators in 2008 2010 or look at the 9 trillion printed by the fed to do the same nothing was invested in the real economy during this time what a different world we could have created had this money been invested into a new non green new deal of the 21st century such as china s belt and road initiative has ushered in nafta s long awaited death is a start as are obrador s vital reforms however a fight needs to still occur before a north american belt and road initiative can finally break colonized nations including the usa out from the clutches of the financial oligarchy and their self imploding deep state managers now be sure to share this article with friends kin and workmates fighting the empire starts when you neutralise its shameless lies

heroin junkie peddling stolen documents to journalists and fbi agents add to that a big client with a sketchy financial history who suddenly becomes president of the united states and you ve got the makings of a blockbuster indeed it must have occurred to david enrich an enterprising business reporter for the wall street journal and the new york times that he couldn t have made up a more intriguing tale than the story he uncovered at deutsche bank the result dark towers is a real life account that will confirm every suspicion you have about the greed and incompetence at the heart of

conservative culture and rush headlong into the more risky and lucrative areas of anglo american finance derivatives asset backed securities junk bond underwriting and proprietary trading before long trading and fee driven service businesses would overtake traditional corporate lending and account for a majority of deutsche bank s revenue and profits besides becoming the world s largest bank with

relationship with donald trump who by the mid 1990s had stiffed so many lenders over the years as a real estate developer that no other bank would have anything to do with him an initial loan of 125 million in 1998 to rehabilitate an office building at 40 wall street was followed by 900 million more for the gm building on fifth avenue and a tower across from the united nations and when trump was on the verge of defaulting on loans used to buy his failing hotels and casinos in atlantic city deutsche bank came to the rescue by peddling 484 million in junk bonds to investors bonds on which trump defaulted within a year advertisement normally such a default would have been enough to scare away even the most risk tolerant lenders but within months deutsche bank s real estate division was again providing trump with a 640 million loan needed to build a new chicago hotel while its team in moscow was steering russian investors to trump projects in hawaii and mexico the relationship hit a low point in 2009 when trump announced he had no intention of repaying his loan on the chicago hotel claiming that the unfolding financial crisis was an act of god that freed him of his obligation when deutsche bank sued to get its money back trump countersued preposterously accusing the bank of predatory lending practices the matter was finally settled with a two year extension on the loan and a vow by the bank s real estate lenders never to do business with trump again but two years later trump somehow sweet talked his way into deutsche s private banking division which over the next several years provided him with 350 million in personal loans to cover projects in chicago miami and washington share this article share the fact that one arm of deutsche refused to do business with trump and another arm considered him a marquee client was a perfect illustration of the bank s dysfunction enrich writes whatever financial risks the bank might have taken with its marquee client however would soon pale compared with the regulatory and reputational risks it took on when trump won the 2016 election even now the supreme court is considering whether the bank must turn over records from its trump files to the house of representatives trump sued to block the bank from complying with the house subpoena advertisement all of this certainly provides material for a book with both popular and professional appeal but in the end enrich can t quite pull it off part of the problem is that the demands of constructing a compelling dramatic narrative lead him to ignore too much about the bank s operations its financial performance and what else was happening in the industry to put these dramatic events in context and make it a credible business history enrich organizes the book around the career of one banker bill broeksmit and a handful of colleagues who were involved in some but not all of the bank s risky and unsavory activities broeksmit s suicide provides the dramatic opening scene for the book and the search by his troubled stepson for the story behind the act takes up the final third bringing it to an unresolved ending we are meant to conclude that broeksmit took his life because his repeated efforts to prevent deutsche bank s excesses had failed but in the end the stories of the bank and the banker do not track each other in a way that feels true and convincing enrich certainly did a tremendous amount of reporting relying on internal documents public records and scores of mostly off the record interviews that are only occasionally footnoted and by the end the reader is left with a clear impression that the people running the world s largest bank were all fools and knaves some on the record conversation with them would have either confirmed such a conclusion or provided the author and readers with a more complete and nuanced picture advertisement the biggest shortcoming of dark towers however is that while it raises provocative questions about deutsche bank and trump it never quite answers them was it incompetence or corruption that caused american and european regulators to do nothing about the bank s excessive leverage and mispricing of assets was trump s relationship with justin kennedy head of deutsche bank s real estate lending division a factor in the decision of kennedy s father justice anthony kennedy to retire from the supreme court and trump s decision to appoint one of his former clerks brett kavanaugh to replace him did deutsche bank help russian oligarchs launder money through trump s projects why did the u s criminal investigation of the bank s russian money laundering suddenly go quiet after trump s election although it might have taken months of additional reporting to nail down the answers to these questions dark towers would have been better for it instead we are left to surmise that where there is smoke there must also be fire dark towers deutsche bank donald trump and an epic trail of destruction by david enrich

enbridge commented al monaco president and chief executive officer of enbridge our low risk pipeline utility model continued to deliver strong financial results and we advanced our strategic priorities on many fronts each of our core businesses delivered solid results in 2019 that translated into full year dcf per share at the top end of our guidance range the liquids mainline system achieved record annual throughput our gas pipelines were highly utilized and we re capturing synergies through the amalgamation of our ontario utility businesses in addition to strong business performance we placed a further 9 billion of new projects into service including the canadian segment of the line 3 replacement our focus on optimizing our base business and executing on our secured growth program continues to drive highly predictable and growing cash flows which resulted in exceptional annual dividend growth for our shareholders of 10 in 2019 and 9 8 in 2020 despite strong utilization and financial performance across our businesses we experienced a major incident on our natural gas system in kentucky the safety of our systems is always our number one priority and we re re doubling our efforts to ensure our pipelines continue to be the safest in the industry in the liquids pipeline segment we delivered on our plan for 100 kbpd of throughput optimizations on the mainline system by the end of 2019 we re planning for a further 50 kbpd of mainline optimizations and we re moving forward with a 50 kbpd expansion of the express pipeline in 2020 these actions will provide wcsb producers with at least 200 kbpd of much needed additional pipeline capacity on the u s portion of our line 3 replacement project on february 3 the mpuc approved the feis and reinstated the certificate of need and route permit this important decision by the mpuc reflects the most comprehensive review of a pipeline project in minnesota history and reaffirms the need for the pipeline to be replaced we ll continue to work closely with state and federal permitting agencies to secure all necessary permits prior to commencing construction in addition following almost two years of extensive negotiation with our shippers we filed the mainline contract offering with the canada energy regulator cer the priority access offering is in direct response to what our shippers have asked us for and balances their diverse needs ultimately contracting the mainline will provide all shippers with priority access at competitive tolls and supports further improvement in netbacks for wcsb producers most notably it secures long term demand for canadian crude oil while ensuring that all interested shippers can participate in a fair and transparent open season process for example we ve made this offering accessible to smaller producers by reducing the minimum volume required to contract on the system and introducing a requirements contract with very attractive terms we expect the cer will conduct a thorough review of our application which will include input from enbridge and the industry importantly we included in our application 13 letters from the shippers representing well over 70 percent of the mainline volumes to demonstrate the support we have for the offering we ve also been advancing our liquids strategy to extend our integrated value chain from western canada down to the u s gulf coast we re moving ahead with developing a terminal at jones creek texas which will be fully integrated with our seaway pipeline system and will provide connectivity and services to local refineries as well as export facilities we ve also secured an option to purchase an ownership interest in an offshore vlcc capable oil export terminal further advancing our energy export strategy in the u s gulf coast our gas transmission and midstream business is awaiting a decision from the ferc on a settlement agreement on the texas eastern rate case and are entering rate proceedings on several other pipelines this year these are important milestones as they will allow us to rebase our rates and set us up for recovery of future modernization costs also in gas transmission and midstream we ve again advanced our lng supply strategy by leveraging our incumbent position in the u s gulf coast with the announcement of the agreements to supply both the annova lng facility and the rio grande lng facility along with acquiring the rio bravo pipeline development project finally in the fourth quarter we closed the second phase of the divestiture of our canadian midstream assets which completes our 8 billion asset sale program these non core asset sales have further strengthened our balance sheet and focused our business on our low risk pipeline utility model

release gaap earnings attributable to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased by 343 million or 0 23 per share compared with the same period in 2018 the period over period comparability of earnings attributable to common shareholders was impacted by certain unusual infrequent factors or other non operating factors which are noted in the reconciliation schedule included in appendix a of this news release adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter 2019 increased by 62 million the increase was primarily driven by strong operating results across many of the company s business units and from new projects placed into service in 2019 partially offset by weaker performance in energy services due to the narrowing of certain location and quality differentials on a per share basis adjusted earnings decreased by 0 04 per share compared with the same period in 2018 reflecting the same operating factors noted above partially offset by a higher share count which reflected common shares issued by the company to buy in the public interests in its sponsored vehicles during the fourth quarter of 2018 adjusted earnings for the year ended 2019 increased by 773 million compared with the year ended 2018 the increase is primarily due to strong operating results across many of the company s business units as well as new projects placed into service in 2019 and in late 2018 these factors were partially offset by the disposition of certain gas transmission and midstream assets which included the provincially regulated portion of the canadian natural gas gathering and processing assets sold on october 1 2018 as well as the disposition of midcoast operating l p sold on august 1 2018 dcf for the fourth quarter was 2 051 million an increase of 188 million over the comparable prior period in 2018 while dcf for the year ended 2019 was 9 224 million which is an increase of 1 606 million over 2018 the increased dcf in 2019 for both the fourth quarter and full year over the comparable periods in 2018 was driven largely by the operating factors noted above as well as lower distributions to noncontrolling interests following the completion of the company s buy in of the publicly held interest in its sponsored vehicles detailed segmented financial information and analysis can be found below under adjusted ebitda by segments project execution update over the course of 2019 the company placed 9 billion of secured growth projects into service including 7 billion in the fourth quarter these projects further strengthen enbridge s

replacement project that will enhance the safety and reliability of enbridge s liquids mainline system the company placed the canadian segment of the line 3 replacement into service on december 1 2019 with an interim surcharge of us 0 20 per barrel this safety driven maintenance project reflects the importance of protecting the environment and ensuring the continued safe and reliable operations of our canadian mainline system well into the future the capital cost for the canadian portion of line 3 replacement project came in slightly below budget in minnesota the department of commerce issued a feis on december 9 and the mpuc gathered public comment through january 16 2020 on february 3 2020 the mpuc approved the adequacy of the feis and reinstated the certificate of need and route permit clearing the way for construction of the pipeline to commence following the issuance of required permits the state and federal environmental permitting agencies have continued to advance their work including the initiation of public consultation processes in parallel with the ongoing mpuc process depending on the final in service date there is a risk that the project may exceed the company s total cost estimate of 9 billion for the combined line 3 replacement project however at this time the company does not anticipate any capital cost impacts that would be material to enbridge s financial position and outlook other business updates mainline contracting on december 19 2019 the company submitted an application to the cer to implement term contracts on the liquids canadian mainline system the application for contracted and uncommitted service included the associated terms conditions and tolls of each service which would be offered in an open season following approval by the cer the tolls and services will replace the current competitive toll settlement cts that is in place until june 30 2021 if a replacement agreement is not in place by that time the cts tolls will continue on an interim basis the application that the company filed is the result of two years of extensive negotiations with a diverse group of shippers and has been designed to align the interests of its shippers and enbridge shippers representing well over 70 of the current mainline system throughput have filed letters supporting the application with the cer demonstrating the strong shipper backing for the offering the application highlights benefits of the mainline contract offering for both shippers and the public including the following secures long term demand for wcsb heavy and light barrels in premium markets supports the best netbacks for wcsb producers competitive and stable tolls for customers and flexibility for shippers of all types and sizes to participate by offering both a traditional take or pay and producer and refiner requirements contracts on january 16 2020 the cer issued a letter inviting comments from interested persons to identify issues to be considered

release fourth quarter 2019 dcf increased 188 million compared with the same period of 2018 key performance drivers of quarter over quarter growth included adjusted ebitda reflected strong operating performance increased asset utilization and contributions from assets placed into service in late 2018 and through 2019 offset by the absence of contributions from the sale of assets in the gas transmission and midstream segment during 2018 as well as lower ebitda from energy services crude operations due to narrowing of certain location and quality differentials during the fourth quarter lower distributions to noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests following the completion of enbridge s buy in of the publicly held interests in its sponsored vehicles which were completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 higher cash distributions in excess of equity earnings from equity investments primarily due to higher distributions as a result of strong performance as well as new equity investments placed into service including the valley crossing pipeline the nexus gas transmission pipeline and the big foot pipeline dcf increased 1 606 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 due to the same factors discussed above as well as increased adjusted ebitda contributions from energy services for the year 2019 when

this news release adjusted earnings increased 62 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with the same period in 2018 growth in adjusted earnings was driven by the same factors impacting business performance and adjusted ebitda as discussed under distributable cash flow above partially offset by the following factors higher depreciation and amortization expense as a result of new assets placed into service net of depreciation expense no longer recorded for assets which were classified as assets held for sale or sold during second half of 2018 higher interest expense due to the absence of capitalized interest related to assets that were placed into service in late 2018 and 2019 lower income taxes due to lower adjusted earnings before tax for the fourth quarter of 2019 when compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased 0 04 compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase in adjusted earnings noted above was more than offset on a per share basis by the issuance during the fourth quarter of 2018 of approximately 297 million common shares to acquire in separate transactions all of the outstanding equity securities of the company s sponsored vehicles not beneficially owned by enbridge for the year ended december 31 2019 adjusted earnings increased 773 million over the same period in 2018 the increase is primarily driven by the increased adjusted ebitda from strong asset performance as well as lower distributions to noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests following the completion of enbridge s buy in of the publicly held interests in its sponsored vehicles as discussed under distributable cash flow above the increase to adjusted earnings was offset by increased income tax expense in part due to higher earnings before tax and a higher effective income tax rate the period over period increase in the effective income tax rate is partly due to the buy in of the u s master limited partnerships mlp enbridge energy partners l p and spectra energy partners lp which resulted in the company being taxed on 100 of the mlp earnings rather than the company s proportionate share of their earnings adjusted earnings per share for the year of 2019 are the same as in 2018 as a result of the increased adjusted earnings discussed above being offset on a per share basis by the increase in common shares issued to acquire the outstanding equity securities of the company s sponsored vehicles also discussed above adjusted ebitda by segments adjusted ebitda by

company is named enbridge gas inc egi post amalgamation the financial results of egi reflect the combined performance of the two legacy utility operations gas distribution and storage adjusted ebitda will typically follow a seasonal profile it is generally highest in the first and fourth quarters of the year reflecting greater volumetric demand during the heating season and lowest in the third quarter as there is generally less volumetric demand during the summer the magnitude of the seasonal ebitda fluctuations will vary from year to year reflecting the impact of colder or warmer than normal weather on distribution volumes gas distribution and storage adjusted ebitda increased 29 million for the fourth quarter 2019 compared with the same period of 2018 key quarter over quarter performance drivers included egi adjusted ebitda increased due to higher distribution charges primarily resulting from increases in distribution rates and customer base synergies realized from the amalgamation of egd and union gas as well as the absence of earnings sharing in 2019 which was recognized in 2018 under egd s previous incentive rate structure these contributions were partially offset due to warmer weather in egi s franchise areas in the fourth quarter which led to lower utilization as well as the effects of the accelerated capital cost allowance deductions reflected as a pass through to customers consistent with the ontario energy board s prescribed deferral account treatment other gas distribution and storage adjusted ebitda decreased due to closing of the sale of enbridge gas new brunswick on october 1 2019 and st lawrence gas company inc on november 1 2019 gas distribution and storage adjusted ebitda increased 93 million for the year ended 2019 compared with

singapore america is winning like never before us president donald trump said at the 2020 annual meeting of the world economic forum in davos as exhibit one he offered the trade agreement with china signed on jan 15 2020 in his state of the union speech on feb 5 he positioned the trade deal as a win over china s massive theft of american jobs as trade agreements go this one is remarkably one sided with china making the bulk of commitments the agreement contains a total of 105 commitments by china china shall compared to 88 joint commitments parties shall and only five commitments by the united states the united states shall in most clauses the united states simply affirms that its existing policies already meet the requirements in the agreement china has calculated signing benefits it so why did china sign on the dotted line first the agreement commits china to steps that solidify already ongoing reforms in intellectual property ip protection technology transfer and the financial sector the reforms committed are already in place but tying these to an agreement with the us can reinforce their urgency domestically these changes are to china s long term benefit they will further improve china s business environment make it a more attractive place to invest in new technologies and over time improve the efficiency of investments made by a more diverse financial sector

sec filings i will now turn the call over to michael collins michael collins chairman and chief executive officer thank you noah and thanks to everyone joining the call today i m very pleased with the bank s achievements in 2019 and the strides we have taken toward being the leading independent offshore bank and trust company during the past year we successfully pursued our acquisition growth strategy that is focused on our established footprint in key jurisdictions which include bermuda the cayman islands and the channel islands in addition we have a well established high net worth lending business in the u k primarily focused on central london we support these businesses with lower cost service centers in canada and mauritius which provide us with ongoing expense leverage and expanded talent pool and as we continue to move forward the client service proposition i wanted to acknowledge the resilience of our cayman team and infrastructure two weeks ago there was a magnitude 7 7 earthquake very close to cayman while serious i am thankful to say that there were no serious injuries and minimal damage within 24 hours we are back to business as usual due to our strong business resilient framework turning now to slide 4 butterfield reported strong annual net income of 177 1 million and record core operating income of 197 9 million these earnings translate to annual core return on average tangible common equity of 23 4 nim of 2 86 for the year was down primarily due to the acquisition of the channel islands which was accretive to net interest income despite being nim dilutive our focus on lowering costs and improving efficiency resulted in a core efficiency ratio of 62 2 these efforts to moderate expense growth are particularly important in a lower interest rate environment and at a time when we are integrating a large acquisition i m also encouraged by the growth in our loan book this year which increased 27 due to our newly acquired business in the channel islands new bermuda and cayman sovereign loans and our continued growth in the central london mortgage book our interest rate sensitivity has also moderated to a level that is more in line with u s regional bank peers due to increased fixed rate exposure in ginnie mae s and customer loans we consider capital management an important value driver with the majority of the bank s earnings supporting quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases we continue to return excess capital to shareholders while also considering accretive acquisition targets although we are not likely to consider any significant acquisitions until the latter part of 2020 or into next year while we fully integrate our recent channel islands deal i will now turn the call over to michael schrum to provide commentary on the fourth quarter results michael schrum group chief financial officer thank you michael during the fourth quarter we reported net income of 43 9 million or 0 82 per share and 46 2 million or 0 87 per share on a core basis butterfield s core return on tangible equity was 21 1 the fourth quarter results benefited from our larger balance sheet growth in non interest income and a higher net interest margin deposit costs fell by 4 basis points compared to the prior quarter to 50 basis points contributing to a nim of 2 59 the board of directors continue to express confidence in our earnings profile with the approval of a 0 44 per common share quarterly dividend which is around a 5 annual yield of the current share price in addition to the dividend butterfield currently has an approved share repurchase program of up to 3 5 million common shares on slide 7 we provide a summary of net interest income and nim net interest income was flat in the quarter while nim increased 7 basis points compared to the last quarter due to an improved asset mix with increased volumes from loans the average balance sheet of loans in the quarter increased by 351 million or 8 while lower yielding cash and short term investments fell by 643 million or 14 we ve continued the process of monitoring the customer flows from the abn deal in the channel islands and expect to gradually improve productivity through deployment from cash into additional investment securities looking now at slide 8 on slide 8 we provide an overview of average customer deposit balances by location currency and contractual nature as of december 31 2019 total deposits were at 12 4 billion down approximately 221 million compared to the prior quarter u s dollars represent 70 of deposits with sterling at 20 and other which is primarily made up of euros at 10 we ve been successfully repricing euro deposits which is in line with our integration model resulting in a modest attrition in euro balances in the channel items overall the cost of deposits has dropped 4 basis points to 50 basis points with term deposit costs falling 10 basis points to 1 38 and demand deposit costs down 3 basis points to 25 basis points each compared to the prior quarter turning now to slide 9 fee income was up 6 6 in the fourth quarter due to the full quarter of contribution from the channel islands acquisition and increased seasonal merchant acquiring volumes which tends to occur in the fourth quarter each year card services contributed 6 4 million to the 14 million of banking non interest income in the fourth quarter the fee income ratio increased during the quarter to 37 from 35 in the prior quarter the significant contribution from fee income as a percentage of butterfield s total revenues contributes stable and capital efficient earnings and we believe this is a positive differentiator relative to us retail banking peers on slide 7 we provide an overview of core non interest expenses which have increased during the quarter to 91 6 million from 84 million in the prior quarter expense control remains a priority for management while the fourth quarter included some specific client focused investments and programs which will reduce or disappear once full operational integration of abn is achieved this is still expected late in the second quarter of 2020 the fourth quarter includes costs associated with the expansion of group service centers in preparation for our call center migration plan for the second quarter of 2020 acquisition related integration and compliance review expenses and professional services as well as investment in our exciting new camana bay branch in the cayman islands and the launch of butterfield s global rebranding initiative we continue to expect expenses to return to around the 88 million per quarter level following the full operational integration in the channel islands in the second quarter of 2020 looking now at slide 11 we provide a summary of capital levels balanced capital management remains a key focus and we continue to manage to our target levels our tce to ta ratio of 6 3 is within our target range of 6 to 6 5 we believe that the current dividend payout ratio of 52 8 is sustainable and contemplates continued share repurchases and the potential to make further accretive acquisitions turning now to slide 12 and a discussion of the balance sheet as we had anticipated butterfield total assets reduced to 13 9 billion from 14 2 billion at the end of the prior quarter as we continue to reduce euro balances in the channel islands while the balance sheet is smaller our earning assets have grown due to increased lending to the governments of bermuda and the cayman islands as well as growth in our central london mortgage book we continue to maintain a consistent and conservative underwriting profile additionally balance sheet values that are reported in us dollars benefited from a favorable sterling exchange rate at the year end on slide 13 we demonstrate the low credit risk in our investment portfolio with 99 of investments in aaa rated us government guaranteed mortgage backed securities our loan book is comprised of 62 of residential mortgages with three quarters of residential loans below 70 ltv as at december 31 2019 non accrual loans have continued to trend lower with the net charge offs ratio at 2 basis points we ve completed our cecl adoption models and have determined the transitional adjustment to the total allowance for credit losses to be 7 8 million as of january 1 2020 as discussed last quarter this is within the expected range and consistent with the expected ranges of outcomes been communicated by other us banks on slide 14 we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis during the fourth quarter butterfield s asset sensitivity reduced significantly as we increased fixed rate assets with a large new fixed rate sovereign loan in the cayman islands and added london fixed rate mortgages additionally with a more stable long term us rates outlook this quarter the duration of the existing mortgage backed securities portfolio extended by three months to four years we believe the current levels of interest rate sensitivity should provide improved earning stability and protect value for the franchise and shareholders in future years i will now turn the call back to michael collins michael collins chairman and chief executive officer thank you michael the fourth quarter was a solid finish to the year the integration of the channel islands acquisition is proceeding well and i continue to be impressed with the high quality of clients and new colleagues we gain with the deal we anticipate the new business to be fully integrated by the end of the second quarter of 2020 in the interim we are exploring potential acquisition targets and will continue to pursue m a opportunities which exceed our financial geographic and business mix acquisition requirements expense levels were higher than our targeted run rate this quarter but we anticipate costs to normalize and the investment we made toward the business this quarter will benefit the bank in the fullness of time we expect to buy back shares subject to market conditions and believe the current quarterly cash dividend rate is an appropriate way to continue rewarding shareholders after more than a month into 2020 i am confident that we are well positioned for continued profitable growth we have footholds in the markets where we can most effectively help clients create wealth and build relationships there are markets in which we have a long history and established right to compete for lending banking trust high net worth clients and long term affiliations with financial intermediaries over the past year our balance sheet has become more evenly distributed across bermuda cayman and the channel islands we see opportunities in all of our locations with the channel islands likely to have the greatest opportunity for growth either organically or by further acquisitions thank you and with that we d be happy to take your questions operator questions and answers operator our first question comes from arren cyganovich with citi arren cyganovich citigroup analyst hi thanks i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about where the deposit attrition is today and the pace that you expect going forward from the abn acquisition michael schrum group chief financial officer yeah good morning aaron thanks it s michael schrum so we re broadly in line with the announced acquisition model in terms of the attrition obviously the balance sheet also benefited from a very strong sterling rate at the end of the year so that boosted our balance sheet values in dollar terms by about 150 million i would say we re sort of halfway through that process we probably have 300 million to 400 million still sort of what we would call at risk deposits primarily euros again in in abn as i mentioned just a moment ago about 10 of deposits are now in other currencies and those are primarily euros those customer relationships tend to be linked with other currency deposits and so we re looking quite carefully at those but broadly in line with where we announced the model arren cyganovich citigroup analyst okay and then you give us an idea of run rate expense did you say what you expect for run rate fee income now that you ve had the combined entity how that should look on a kind of quarter to quarter basis i know the fourth quarter tends to be higher from seasonal card issues but just kind of an idea of what the fees should be looking like michael schrum group chief financial officer yeah so i think the fourth quarter was fairly representative except for the merchant acquiring volumes and some seasonality in card usage primarily associated with christmas shopping as well as it s the high season for tourism in cayman so it s probably about a 1 4 million 1 9 million delta in the quarter that s coming from that but other than that the third quarter was fairly representative in terms of the first full quarter impact of abn obviously we re hoping to that that creates a base for growth as well arren cyganovich citigroup analyst thank you operator our next question comes from david feaster with raymond james david feaster raymond james analyst hey good morning guys just wanted to follow up on the expenses so i guess for the first quarter would the fourth quarter i guess ex one time items of like 90 million be a good starting point for the first quarter and then are you said 88 million in the second quarter going on michael schrum group chief financial officer yeah thanks dave i m happy to give a bit more color around expenses obviously we have some non core expenses this quarter which primarily relates to staff exit costs as part of the program to align staffing levels of the abn to the go forward so that was pretty much done last quarter but in terms of the core expense run rate as we look at some of the programs that we ve been running out the brand rollout which primarily is around the new trademarks new logo new customer forms credit cards branded materials etc primarily booked in marketing in the quarter is probably high by about 1 million there will be some elements of that program that will continue for the full year as with adopting a phased approach so we re telling we are not replacing current credit cards that are still valid but on renewal they will be replaced to kind of try and protect some of the burn rate on on that property new signage we had some expanded space in halifax service center in anticipation of onboarding the call centers which we had a partial impact this quarter of running multiple call centers but that transition will flip over some of it this quarter and some of it next quarter and then we have some moves in bermuda as well again property related for the new branch that we re refreshing here in bermuda again that will be a fully rebranded branch as part of that we are just opening a new branch in camana bay this week it looks fantastic it should attract a lot of the mid market corporate and private client footfall traffic in cayman islands and finally we had some office moves in guernsey as well to collocate some of the rm teams in one building following abn so again that s property it s probably elevated this quarter and these ones sort of recur fully certainly in the next quarter as elements of that will come through but that was probably almost 1 million there in terms of elevated expense levels the accelerated customer reviews of the abn book so we ve taken the view that within a year we ll look at all high and medium risks again these are core expenses but we d expect completion again of that in 2q 2020 it s going pretty well that s about 0 5 million in professional services there and then finally we also worked on the integration for the abn it upgrade so we re upgrading the system for our current customers in anticipation to having one banking system across the channel islands so about 0 5 million there salaries and it again that completes in q2 and then obviously we had some consultant fees in the fourth quarter as well we had some purchase price allocation fees professional services fees the review of the loan book quite detailed to look for any impairments there and that was probably 0 5 million so that was completed it was in q4 and that s kind of it for the quarter in terms of what i would call out there i think over time we are targeting flat year on year ex abn in core expenses so we expect to revert to the approximate 88 million run rate over the next couple of quarters but probably not fully seen until q3 this year so it will kind of gradually phase down as some of these programs phase out essentially michael collins chairman and chief executive officer so david it s michael collins i think i would just give you an example so the call center in halifax so we have 140 people all in in halifax today so it s ramped up very quickly we just got a full call center sort of working ready to go there and we still have our bermuda and cayman call centers so we really have three call centers where we were going to have one and then the other part of the expenses is really investments in brand and client functionality so we re launching our new online banking for corporates in bermuda and cayman so they re all good investments but it was a bit choppy this quarter david feaster raymond james analyst yeah that makes sense and i guess looking out to 2021 i know it s a bit fuzzy but just as i think about it given inflationary pressures combined with the decreasing amortization expense that we talked about last quarter from the butterfield platform do you think we can get back to the 86 million to 87 million run rate that you had discussed last quarter michael schrum group chief financial officer yeah absolutely i think if you consider the amortization just on its own the full year impact of that is almost 10 million being phased in starting at the end of this year i mean it s always a bit tricky with we don t know what the government is going to do in terms of taxes there are new budgets coming up but certainly that s what we that s what we would foresee as we sit here today david feaster raymond james analyst okay terrific and then that was great color could you just talk about your thoughts on capital deployment what are your priorities here you mentioned the buyback in additional m a but how do you think about each of those independently and how are m a conversations and i guess would you be willing to go toward the low end of your tce target toward that 6 level michael schrum group chief financial officer yes great question and certainly a very good dialog with the board and we continue to have that every quarter with the board again the board keeps reiterating where to have a balanced capital allocation so it was first and foremost supporting a healthy and sustainable dividend rates which approximates 50 payout ratio through the cycle so we ve been a bit low on that ratio coming up the rate curve we are now a little bit more mature so we ve had a number of years where we ve increased dividend quite rapidly and we re now at that 50 we re integrating a large new bank so the sort of stable earnings profile of that and the organic growth profile of that is a bit up you know as we are repricing some of those secondly we favor certainly buybacks at the moment and we have a bigger authorization out there which look attractive the sort of 20 roe and a single digit forward pe valuation point thirdly selective m a and organic growth support we want to continue to support core markets that we operate in so the three primary banking markets as well as look at m a opportunities we re sort of currently at the middle of the target tce range we were just at around 6 following the abn deal and we have been certainly above the target range prior to the acquisition of m a so it s kind of a target range that we re sitting in the middle of right now the dividend rate as i said is discussed and improved every quarter especially given the abn integration at the moment and so overall this supports to strategy which remains really focused on growth in tangible book value over the long term michael collins chairman and chief executive officer yeah in terms of m a i would just add that we re still going to focus on finishing our integration of abn in q2 really with the system conversion so that s still the focus we will continue to focus on bank and trust company acquisitions but really only in our existing jurisdictions probably with an enhanced focus on obviously the channel islands where we re growing well and also singapore where we ve got a great new trust company but we need to get some scale there we actually have passed on a couple of smaller trust opportunities recently so we re continuing to have discussions and look but it s got to be it s got to really fit all of our criteria and so we ll keep focusing on it but it s abn at this point david feaster raymond james analyst okay thanks guys operator our next question comes from alex twerdahl with piper sandler alex twerdahl piper sandler analyst hey good morning michael collins chairman and chief executive officer hey good morning alex alex twerdahl piper sandler analyst first i want to drill in a little bit more to the loan growth that we saw in the fourth quarter it was a bit of a surprise it seems to me like i mean i guess first maybe you can break out how much of it was uk mortgage and how much of it was the loans to the governments in bermuda and cayman michael collins chairman and chief executive officer okay so it s michael collins i would say the two bermuda and cayman sovereign loans are really specific transactions that are unlikely to be repeated so as we said we increased from q3 to q4 about 10 27 year on year so we d do about 5 1 billion bermuda was about 100 million of that so there was a 200 million bermuda government facility that was really bridge financing to a new bond issue we took 100 million of that hsbc bermuda took a 100 million it s only a one year term floating rate at about 4 25 cayman was a great opportunity 180 million loan 15 years fixed at 3 25 obviously both zero risk weighted so from a risk adjusted perspective really really great opportunities for us but the bermuda one will come off pretty quickly they may come back to us in the future but it s really sort of one off stuff the cayman is 15 years so that will stay with us butterfield mortgages had a really good quarter as brexit the brexit outcome became more clear so that was about basically about the same sort of quantum as the other two so we would never really sort of characterize ourselves as a loan growth story or our strategy is still not to do any out of market lending even as rates decline so that s still the focus but we did get a little bit lucky this year but part of it will come off so really helpful but i would say that it s going to be relatively flat this year maybe a little bit up alex twerdahl piper sandler analyst and then the uk mortgage i think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that we are mostly putting on a fixed rate today is that correct and isn t that compared to floating our variable rate uk mortgages which is kind of the traditional product for you guys michael schrum group chief financial officer yes so the uk market sorry it s michael schrum so the uk market sort of flips between floating and fixed as you know the three to five year io typically structures and they ve been leaning more toward the fixed rate product now so in terms of overall on a portfolio basis we now have approximating 10 fixed rate loans on the books bermuda and cayman have also been somewhat successful in getting more fixed rate product on the balance sheet and obviously the cayman facility is a real helper in terms of asset sensitivity as well alex twerdahl piper sandler analyst and then in terms of when you look at the balance sheet and the complexion of of the sterling denominated deposits relative to sort of capacity to add additional mortgages in the uk is there still capacity on the balance sheet for them michael schrum group chief financial officer yeah absolutely so we re at about 1 billion today between the between the abn mortgages and the bml mortgages booked through bml about 20 of our balance sheet is in sterling today of customer deposits so depend a little bit on the attrition there if some of them go from the abn book repricing but certainly there is ample cash short term investment sitting in sterling today and that would obviously be very helpful to get some good loans on the books alex twerdahl piper sandler analyst okay yes so i mean certainly loan growth is going to be nim accretive especially relative to cash and securities but just kind of thinking about the other pieces of the margin here deposits those repricing down a cds during the quarter kind of as you weight sort of what s going on in the books with euro denominated deposits continuing to run off and potential additional opportunities to reprice lower cds how are you thinking about your cost of deposits for the first couple of quarters and next year and then maybe you can kind of wrap it all together and kind of give us some suggestions on how we should think about the trajectory of the nim assuming the yield curve kind of stays relatively similar to what it looks like today michael schrum group chief financial officer yeah great question alex thanks i mean i m just going to focus on the sort of bigger levers here so obviously there s a lot going on with the multi currency and the repricing of the euro deposits but essentially we have that 25 basis points in the bermuda mortgages coming through obviously that s a downdraft on on nim in q1 this year so we have priced with a 90 day lag the term deposits rates will continue to reset at lower rates as they roll over approximately 90 of term deposits or cds roll over automatically and with the rate reductions that we ve already done following the market adjustments we would expect for those to partly offset that downdraft in nim demand deposits that s going to improve slightly but it will depend on little bit on the attrition levels in the abn book there s not much more that we can do in terms of cost of deposits in the bermuda and cayman market so generally i mean overall even with the securities side i would say flattish i mean plus minus a handful of basis points in the next couple of quarters and then as we start to season the deposits in during the second half we would expect a more meaningful improvement in overall nim subject to obviously what the market is doing at that time but you know that seasoning could translate on a full year basis into sort of a 70 basis points on 500 million to 700 million depending on where we land on total deposits level for a full year effect at the current market rates so hopefully that gives you sense sort of how we are thinking about it alex twerdahl piper sandler analyst great thank you for taking my questions michael schrum group chief financial officer thanks alex operator our next question comes from timur braziler with wells fargo securities timur braziler wells fargo securities analyst hi good morning michael collins chairman and chief executive officer good morning timur timur braziler wells fargo securities analyst just circling back on alex s question on the loan book this year it was low double digit kind of organic loan growth last year i think loan growth surprised to the upside relative to expectations it seems like there is still room in the uk resi book i guess what gives you pause the future loan growth and what drives the expectation for balances to be flat here given some of these tailwinds that we ve seen michael collins chairman and chief executive officer yes so i would say that number one gating factor is as i said we re not going to do out of market lending which is bermuda cayman potentially the channel islands if we go down that route and certainly central london which was the portion of our old bank that we kept so we understand that market and funded out of the channel islands with sterling so that s the number one gating factor i would say bermuda economically is relatively flat right now so not a huge amount of loan demand out there on the residential or corporate side cayman actually is growing quite well the economy is really growing at a 3 clip year on year so it will grow with gdp and with the economy so i think there is some organic growth opportunities in cayman over time butterfield mortgages ltd has done a great job and i think with brexit clearing up and having a better sense of where that s going that will continue so i think there is opportunities to grow in london and a little bit in cayman with gdp but again i would just stress that the two sovereign transactions were very specific i think butterfield mortgages had a big bump because brexit was kind of clearing up and and corbyn didn t get elected probably more importantly so i think that s pretty clear but we keep saying it s not a loan growth story because i think if we said it were loan growth story that would actually imply that we d be lending out of market which is not something we re willing to do from a risk perspective and we re in very small jurisdictions so we do get lucky occasionally when you get big sovereign facilities but we will generally grow with gdp in bermuda which is flat cayman maybe 3 and i would think that london will do well but we might have had a bump in q4 because of the brexit clarity so that s how i d describe it timur braziler wells fargo securities analyst okay that s helpful and then as you look at the channel islands do you foresee a lending opportunity there as you kind of fill in that business and if so where do you think butterfield could fit into the lending picture there michael collins chairman and chief executive officer well i mean i think we re looking at it obviously both our bank in guernsey has been a corporate financial intermediary bank as is our new bank in jersey so that s our expertise in the channel islands i would say over time as we get more and more comfortable with the environment there there is an opportunity over time that we could end up maybe looking a little bit more like bermuda and cayman where we would focus on residential lending and maybe some more fund lending financial intermediaries which we re doing a bit now but on the retail side we are potentially having a look at it the one most mportant factor is we re still 62 of our loan book across the group is residential mortgages and the other 38 actually is still kind of commercial lending but it s all secured by property and so it s very much like residential mortgage so that wouldn t change so if we re able to replicate that what we ve done in bermuda and cayman with the reasonable deposit rates financial intermediary deposits funding higher margin residential mortgages it s something we will look at but i would stress that that will take time as we get more comfortable with the market timur braziler wells fargo securities analyst okay that s helpful and then just one last one for me looking at the pound sterling portion of the acquired deposits i guess what s the plan for those it seems like much of the focus thus far has been on the euro based deposits and that s what we ve seen much of the attrition in but as we look at the pound sterling deposits is the plan still to reduce those balances as you go through those accounts or is the strong demand for uk mortgages likely to result in those staying on balance sheet michael schrum group chief financial officer great question so i think the first thing is we are focused on the euro balances we like the sterling deposits we have uk gilts there are sovereign exposures that are highly rated similar to the ginnie portfolio that we have in dollars as long as we can make a nice turn and create some create roe on a regulatory capital basis effectively that remains a priority for us obviously loan growth is being supported by the funding in the sterling and i think we certainly have more runway there so we are not the attrition in the sterling was really as a result potentially of having multi currency depositors where we are repricing the euro deposits and that s the exercise that we are going through at the moment timur so not exactly clear where it s going to ultimately land but i think we are suddenly very fond of sterling deposits timur braziler wells fargo securities analyst okay and then as you look at the original deposit attrition guidance the 35 to 40 of the acquired book is that seeming conservative at this point or do you think that it will still get there as we go through the course of 20 michael schrum group chief financial officer yeah i mean that s sort of remember the book is also moving all the time so we have normal commercial movements and we ve actually won some pretty good business in guernsey so seeing good opportunities for deposit growth both in the what was the existing butterfield bank and the combined entity now that we re a bigger market share in the guernsey market but we re still on target for the deposit attrition the early parts were easier to some extent and that they were primarily only euro depositors and multi currency depositors obviously we want to handle with care and make sure that we are understanding their requirements and needs for banking with us a lot of them have custody relationship fx relationships as well so that s the exercise we are going through at the moment but i think the best our best estimate is still the guidance that was put out timur braziler wells fargo securities analyst okay great thank you operator our next question comes from will nance with goldman sachs will nance goldman sachs analyst hey guys good morning maybe i have a follow up on the earlier question on the margin thanks for all the moving pieces just on the securities yield the yields held up quite nicely this quarter and i guess just given what s happened with the yield curve over the past several weeks can you just give us a sense for where the kind of new money yield is on securities and how to think about the pace of deployment of liquidity into the securities portfolio over the next 12 months michael schrum group chief financial officer yeah so last quarter actually we didn t really invest we just rolled over existing maturities don t have the i don t have it here right here with me but essentially we also got some extension obviously in the book to some slower prepayment speeds in the book so that helped and the reason why we didn t deploy this quarter was we had these lending opportunities which obviously was a better use of funds i would say the primary focus obviously on reinvesting in existing maturities and that s what s driving this slightly improved market rate outlook this quarter is helping our asset sensitivity in that regard and as we look into the second half of this year we should see the afs and htm book starting to expand or getting that cash put to work essentially that s underpinning the customer deposits in the abn book you should expect the pace of that similar to when we did the 2016 acquisition of hsbc here in bermuda where we had about 1 6 billion of deposits and we sort of typically target sort of end up targeting between 40 and 65 of deposits so we get the cash balances back to just really a treasury management function and then that gets slathered out over a period of sort of nine to 12 quarters and we continue to monitor flows to ensure that obviously we maintain conservative liquidity buffers for ourselves during that time so that could result in a deployment in the second half of this year at about 200 million a quarter over the subsequent sort of eight quarters will nance goldman sachs analyst got it that s very helpful and then just maybe high level one on business in the channel islands can you just talk about the reception to butterfield in the market versus some of the other competitors there and i guess how are you thinking about the ability to win new business do you feel like you need to do more acquisitions in the market have early kind of conversations with clients been encouraging and just like how are you thinking about the growth opportunities there both organically and inorganically michael collins chairman and chief executive officer well we are the first new bank in jersey in a number of decades so i think the initial reception was quite good i think both guernsey and jersey are experiencing a situation where there is a lot of indigenous banks and subsidiaries tied to uk banks that are actually kind of getting out of the market so having a bank in guernsey with a 10 or 15 market share and a new bank in jersey with a small market share but the first in decades the reception has been great i think what always interests us is that when we take on a new bank or take on new clients that are institutional they actually get pretty comfortable with our credit quality occasionally if a client has 200 million or 300 million with us some of that just from a size perspective but i think when they kind of dig into our public information and being listed in new york actually for a small bank like us helps a lot there s tons of information out there they get very comfortable so we lost very few clients abn clients just based on the fact we re not abn we are a much smaller bank so that s a lot of the work but the reception has been great i think the premise still hold there is a dislocation in the market a lot of sellers very few buyers so i think if we just continue to focus on making sure abn is a success our relationships with both the guernsey financial services commission jersey financial services commission are both very good that s hugely important so we want to make sure abn is a success and continue to wait for more dislocation in the market and we ve really balance our exposures across the three jurisdictions which was one of the strategic goals of ours and now really it s about organic growth and maybe sort of layering on another acquisition when people get out so we are the only bank or one of the few banks that visibly is really really committed to that market and i think it shows because clients don t want to move around i mean ever when they are just trying to set up an account at any bank today its like pulling teeth so it s important to have stability and i think we show that because we want to be in the market and clients understand that will nance goldman sachs analyst got it thank you for taking my questions michael collins chairman and chief executive officer thanks will operator and our next question will be from michael perito with kbw michael perito kbw analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question a lot of my a lot of my questions have been kind of asked and answered already i just want to clarify a couple items just on expense and margins just to make sure i kind of heard all the comments right because i got on the call little bit late so i apologize about that but just i guess first on expenses so i mean is it correct to think that the so the 91 6 million core in the fourth quarter that will step down modestly in the first half of the year but the 88 million really will take hold in the third quarter is that correct michael schrum group chief financial officer yeah that s how we re thinking about it some of the programs like the property movements and some of the marketing expenses associated with the brand rollout will continue at a modest pace throughout the year but some of the other programs roll off during the first and second quarter of this year michael perito kbw analyst okay and then on the margin i think the outlook was from this 259 million level for somewhat stability near term before some of the the leveraging of the balance sheet that you guys have spoken to takes it hopefully higher but what does that kind of assume around the 100 million bridge financing with the bermuda sovereign i mean does that assume that that stays for the next 12 months and then rolls out probably actually there would be some modest step down just given the potential mix shift when that loan rolls off michael schrum group chief financial officer yeah good question but again it s 100 million at 4 25 so its max 1 or 2 basis points in a 5 billion portfolio well i mean it s yeah so we are the way we sort of look at it it s more up to what s happening in the market really at this point as opposed to what we are doing in terms of the forward nim it s going to be kind of plus minus 5 basis points in the first couple of quarters and then obviously the leverage will start to happen in second half michael perito kbw analyst okay great and then just two last ones one mike would you say you guys have greater appetite for longer duration assets maybe relative to six 12 months ago just given kind of the state of the us yield curve is as we think about you guys deploying the cash are you comfortable may be seeing a little bit longer duration on the securities that you guys buy given there s really not much global outlook for increasing rates at this point or how are you guys thinking about that dynamic michael schrum group chief financial officer yeah i mean i think again we ve been sort of fairly consistent in terms of we ve always targeting a duration of around we have behaviorized deposits out six years at the moment based on our history that could be longer so if i think about the investment book being part of that and that was to some extent dependent on the loan growth as well so a 50 million 15 year fixed rate loan is obviously a big draw on funding the liquidity of the bank as well to the cayman islands government but i would say we target around the five year it has been shorter because we ve been seasoning in deposits from prior acquisitions so the db acquisition that s done gets seasoned in prior to that we have the hsbc acquisition so we ve always been a little bit shy of our target really on the investment book but i would say we re continuing we favor ginnie s explicitly guaranteed issuances convexity instruments that give us that kind of our bell curve on the balance sheet and then we have to be conservative at the short end obviously because we manage our own treasury positions between the different banking balance sheets so i would say it hasn t really changed given the rate outlook it s the step we are continuing to do what we said we were going to do michael perito kbw analyst okay and then just lastly i was wondering if you could expand a little bit more on the new banking center at cayman is that in because that has been a market where you guys have been optimistic about the growth for some time do you think this branch will help you reach kind of a new geographic portion of that market can you talk i guess just a little bit more broadly about kind of the decision to make this expansion and what you expect some of the benefits will be in a market i know you guys have already seen some nice growth in michael collins chairman and chief executive officer yeah so we just got back from cayman on tuesday night we had a cayman bank subsidiary board meeting and we opened the camana bay branch and i think the most important part is camana bay for people that know cayman is a pretty new development that s residential its corporate it s hospitality restaurants sort of built from scratch so it s got scale it s sort of reached a critical mass in terms of development over the last 10 years so i think our timing is pretty perfect the other canadian banks scotia rbc are both there and it was sort of the one area that we hadn t sort of developed i d say we re the largest bank in cayman we ve been there 50 years we are really considered the local bank i think for most camanians and i think not having a branch at camana bay kind of stood out it also gave us an opportunity to really visibly launch our new brand so it s a very different look and we re getting a lot of great comments about it i think it s good for the cayman employees as the bank continues to grow there but most importantly cayman is doing well so whether it s tourism or funding corporations or building it actually is growing quite rapidly relative to some of our other jurisdictions and we really want to invest our capital in places that appear to have gdp that s growing north population has increased from about 60 000 to about 68 000 so it s pretty much an open economy and just spending a couple days down there it feels like it really is booming so we re just investing our capital in places where we think we have opportunities to grow michael schrum group chief financial officer yeah mike and for the facility it s primarily a retail branch but one of the access points that we were missing in cayman is a lot of the nexus of the mid market corporate business so the fund admin companies the captive insurance companies have moved their offices to camana bay and so this facility really allows us to have meeting rooms for meeting with clients like aon and marsh so that corporate banking folks can get out there and have a meeting room with them and i think we ll continue to certainly keep that market share as well as increase our retail market share over time michael perito kbw analyst awesome thank you guys for those comments and clarifications appreciate it michael collins chairman and chief executive officer thanks mike operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to noah fields for any closing remarks noah fields vice president investor relations thank you eislee and thanks to everyone for dialing in today we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter have a great day

by claudio katz caracas dec 17 the following is from a lecture the author an argentine marxist economist and political analyst gave at the reception for the 12th liberator award for critical thinking 2019 it was given for his book la teoría de la dependencia 50 años después theory of dependency 50 years later simón bolívar is known as the liberator translation by michael otto thank you very much to all the friends and compañeros who created and who sustain the liberator award with such tenacity and effort thank you for your work for your conviction and for your perseverance this prize only exists because of that will and that determination and congratulations to the organizers for valuing free thinking and critical conceptions for prioritizing the research that exposes the roots of injustice and for considering the studies that explain how neoliberalism imperialism and capitalism operate for these reasons i am honored to receive this award which is a recognition of the social commitment of researchers those who take the side of the welfare of the great masses of the people very few countries and institutions dare to promote awards of this kind convening organizing and awarding this distinction is an act of courage and a challenge to the cultural media and academic apparatus of the ruling classes i also congratulate them for again presenting this award while dealing with gigantic difficulties at a time of so much political dispute in latin america we are going through a decisive moment either the right wing with its coup mongers will advance and thereby maintain neoliberal rules and u s imperialist domination or the opposite pole will be strengthened that of the masses progressive and left wing collective struggle either the fascists and their repressive forces will win or the people who are resisting in the streets on the whole continent will assert their power that is why i want to dedicate this award to the brothers and sisters who were murdered in el alto bolivia to the young people who lost their eyes in chile and to the demonstrators who were beaten up in colombia and haiti to marielle franco from brazil to berta cáceres from honduras to santiago maldonado from argentina this award is for them the effects of neoliberalism the book that i am presenting forms part of the great battle of ideas being waged against the ruling groups with this motivation i was interested in revisiting the theory of dependency which in the 1960s and 1970s was a very original and fruitful school of latin american thought the marxist theory of dependency was developed by ruy mauro marini theotonio dos santos and vania bambirra and reached great prominence in the 1970s it explained the underdevelopment of latin america as due to the loss of resources caused by the subordinate international position of our region in the it especially highlighted the enormous transfers of value overseas that generate commercial financial and technological dependence in recent decades neoliberalism has dramatically updated those pillars of the theory of dependence in the past the specialization in raw material exports was a serious problem but now dependence on primarización is overwhelming it has consolidated the dominant role of exporting crops to the detriment of supplying the needs of the local population it has encouraged open pit mining multiplied environmental calamities and intensified the extraction of all the various forms of fossil fuels the profile of operations centered in agriculture mining and energy increased latin america s vulnerability to international price fluctuations for raw materials for that reason in recent years we have again suffered the consequences of the stagnation of the prices for oil copper and soybeans neoliberalism also contributed to the decline of industry in a region affected by the new geography of globalization and the displacement of factory production to the east it promoted a precocious deindustrialization which is much worse than the offshoring faced by the main economies of the western capitalist countries in south america traditional industry is in sharp decline and brazil s industrial apparatus has lost the magnitude it had in the 1980s in argentina the surgery was brutally implemented with the massive elimination of jobs in central america what rules is specialization in the primary links of the global value chain this arrangement eliminates any hope of taking part in the more complex activities of that network for these reasons latin america occupies a marginal place in the technological revolution with a manufacturing sector in decline the region is unable to take part in that digital transformation the neoliberals are keeping quiet about that adverse situation and even many heterodox thinkers are merely giving generic praise to the new knowledge economy forgetting that universe requires industries services and growth in the face of so many platitudes the theory of dependency reminds us that if we continue to reproduce our dependent peripheral integration we will continue being marginalized by the information revolution the scourge of debt neoliberalism has also recreated the old nightmare of debt we had a breather in the past decade due to the rise in prices of raw materials and the resulting influx of dollars but that respite is over and we again face the scourge of debt under the oppressive supervision of the and the investment banks macri has left us argentinians in a virtual state of default while in ecuador the indigenous movement rebelled against the adjustment demanded by the bankers in puerto rico the debt burden was a determining factor in the great popular mobilization that brought down the governor in chile the drama of the debt is evident in the daily life of all families who face unpayable loans to finance education health or retirement the crises in latin america are so acute because of that choking financial combination the crises are due to the strangulation caused by the external sector trade imbalances and capital flight they derive from the great impact of overproduction on raw material prices which precipitates dramatic situations of inflation or devaluation in addition the crises accentuate the decrease in purchasing power and the low income level of the population the seriousness of current latin american dependency is also verified by the terrible deterioration of social indicators neoliberalism has multiplied unemployment labor informality and the pauperization of the middle class and has torn apart the social fabric of the region for that reason massive emigration toward the north is increasing small agricultural property is deteriorating and criminality is expanding this social dismemberment results from the terrible increase in inequality that s why chile exploded demolishing all the myths of the model the capitalists praised to the skies now it can be seen that chile is no paradise of growth it is an inferno of social inequality it is therefore clear that neoliberalism has fostered all the old inequalities that were studied by the theory of dependency that conception enables us to understand the latin american reality exploitation and drainage of value in my book i try not only to update but also to renew a key conception of our cultural history it jumps into view that the globalized digital financialized and precarious capitalism of our period is very different from its equivalent in the past and those changes can be studied using two legacies of dependency theory there is a tradition that highlights the importance of exploitation in the great changes that have occurred in the system this tradition describes capitalism s offensive against the workers to weaken unions and demolish workers victories it highlights how the transnational corporations take advantage of the great reserves of low paid and disciplined labor power in the asian region in order to reinforce the division between formal and informal workers that approach analyzes how the segmentation of wage labor was generalized and how the compensation of a workforce below the value of its labor power permeated the developed economies another more significant perspective studies the great drain of resources suffered by dependent economies it investigates how the dependent industrial cycle was intensified blocking the processes of accumulation and it contrasts what happened in latin america with what happened in the asian region my work deepens this line of inquiry and explains why unlike the asian region latin america suffers from acute drainage of the value generated in the region that disparity explains for example the contrasting trajectories of south korea and brazil the loss of resources is particularly intense in the agro mining sector due to the use of extractive methods that deteriorate the environment erode the soil pollute the water supply poison the rivers and destroy communities those processes of accumulation by dispossession lead for example to the burning of the amazon to cultivate soybeans and expand cattle ranching as the enormous profit generated by those activities is transferred overseas our region is squandering its resources latin america never takes advantage of the good times when the prices of raw materials are high and we invariably suffer during lean periods when export earnings are low globalization has aggravated that disadvantage by modifying the world s industrial structure which accentuates our dependency once again this reality slaps down the naïve beliefs in a prosperous and freely chosen path to capitalist development supposedly within the reach of any country at any time latin america s economy was surviving on the old keynesian model of import substitution and strong domestic markets but that model has been displaced by a capitalist internationalization which prioritizes the availability and low cost of the labor force in asia because of these severe handicaps the three models of profit management generated within latin america have faced acute limitations neoliberal economic policies guided by fantasies of comparative advantage and the free circulation of capital simply accentuated the erosion of that surplus neodevelopmentalists tried to capture part of the profit using models of state regulation but they formed alliances with agribusiness and high finance which frustrated the use of that surplus for reindustrialization a third and more radical kind of strategy with greater state control and greater redistribution of income became a target of hostile concentrated capital in some cases governments made serious errors in applying economic policy in other cases they created jobs increased consumption and reduced poverty but they failed to forge the political basis that was needed to sustain the model i believe that the theory of dependency allows us to understand this variety of economic scenarios within the common framework of underdeveloped capitalism ll blown imperialism dependency theory has also been very fruitful in complementary fields of the economy it especially points out to us the geopolitical preeminence of imperialism mindful of how the great powers dominate by using force we latin americans have suffered many times from such imperialist intervention which has dramatically intervened in the middle east or africa in recent decades of course besides using force the capitalist class also maintains its hegemony through other mechanisms such as ideology consent tradition and deception and the current evaluation of international relations in terms of unipolarity bipolarity or multipolarity is also very pertinent but imperialism persists as a dominant fact of life since capitalism could not persist without armies military bases and cyber wars the theory of dependency highlights that evidence as opposed to conventional political thinking which invariably hides the coercive foundation of north american geopolitical military preponderance the dependency tradition also studied subimperialism to evaluate the oppressive role of certain regional powers i believe this is an important concept for certain parts of asia and the middle east but it has little significance today in the scenario of latin america conversely it is most relevant to observe how u s imperialism has strengthened its grip on our region as the united states lost ground on the world chessboard after having commanded the first period of globalization donald trump seeks to regain territory with bilateral demands insults and aggressions of all kinds we don t know if he will use the pentagon and the marines to reconquer economic primacy trump makes many threats without taking equivalent military action and at times he seems aware of the limits of the empire he commands so far he has not achieved any of his objectives against other state powers and he faces enormous internal opposition from congress the judicial system and african americans to deal with that scenario trump is very aggressive toward latin america he seeks to showcase imperial power in the hemisphere in order to begin the recovery of the preeminence it has lost on a global scale that is why he increases the presence of the pentagon maintains his harassment of venezuela resumes the embargo against cuba and conspires to capture the bolivian lithium reserves he also imposed new demands for patents in the renewal of the free trade agreement with mexico he recently raised tariffs on brazilian exports simply because of rumors of a possible free trade agreement between brazil and china i believe that we should ignite all the warning flares when trump sends out some imperial message as when he is despising the caribbean peoples insulting the mexicans or building the wall we have to blow the whistle when he praises the army s intervention against the people of bolivia reinforces u s bases in colombia weighs deployment of the southern command or appropriates an affiliate of pdvsa but the most important thing is our response on the ground and on that plane we have seen how the people of venezuela have known how to disrupt all the conspiracies they have shown that it is possible to stop the attacks of imperialism with determination courage and bravery the right wing and fascism another area of great current relevance to the theory of dependency is the analysis of authoritarian regimes in latin america in the 1960s and 1970s that conception studied the peculiarities of dictatorships and the models of counterinsurgency evaluating the similarities and differences with fascism using that approach the theorists exposed the old error of hypotheses that deny the possibility of fascism in the peripheral countries that point of view forgot that latin america suffered from particular forms of dependent fascism which reached their apogee in the cold war and not in the 1930s these aspects were reflected in pinochetism and uribism at present bolsonaro embodies many powerful features of that strand which in my opinion has little immediate viability but beyond these assessments it is clear that the right wing has erupted once again in latin america it leads a conservative restoration that seeks the greatest revenge against the progressive cycle it repeats the classic script of all reactionaries who hate the left wing and imagine crude continental conspiracies allegedly designed by cuba or venezuela unlike those in europe latin american right wingers do not so much demonize emigration they masquerade as avengers for justice and resort to punitive demagogy promising magic solutions to the plague of crime they deliver hypocritical speeches about corruption and flood social networks with intrigues and fake news but they are so servile to neoliberalism that they forget their old nationalist verbiage as we ve seen in bolivia honduras paraguay and brazil that right wing is shamelessly oriented toward coups it fosters institutional coups and utilizes legal action to outlaw progressive leaders furthermore the right wing propagates mass media slanders which are fabricated by the intelligence services and it often relies on religious fanaticism to create fears and to destroy solidarity since this right wing which operates through the organization of american states and the lima group lacks autonomy and simply obeys orders from washington the anti fascist struggle in latin america is in fact a battle against imperialism these two faces of the same popular resistance against the enemies of our peoples constitute another enduring message from the theorists of dependency theoretical links a final observation on the position of the marxist theory of dependence in critical thinking let s remember that it was located at the opposite pole of fernando henrique cardoso s conventional version this thinker first rejected the contradiction between dependency and development then postulated development associated with transnational corporations and finally adopted all the dogmas of neoliberalism i believe that marini dos santos and bambirra always sought to extend their conception beyond latin america and that comprehensive view was confirmed in recent applications such as the use of dependency models to interpret the debt crisis in greece their concept has also been used to explain how the euro is a monetary association which imposes value transfers from the periphery to the center of europe i think that such a widespread application of the theory of dependency is inspired by the writings of the mature marx who reevaluated the national struggle while imagining transitions to socialism from communal forms it is also based on the later analyses of the classical and post war marxists who wrote about the mechanisms of the drain of resources and the appropriation of the surplus of the periphery it is also necessary to note the harmony with contemporary thinkers who explained the reasons for the dependence of asia and africa or the connection with authors who in recent years have theorized the dynamic of accumulation by dispossession and the new imperial logic dictated by mobile global overproduction in all those cases we can see how the dependency theory matured always in fruitful conceptual encounters an important case was the connection with world system theory to understand how underdevelopment is recreated with the stratifications imposed by the international division of labor this same kind of confluence with endogenous marxism made it possible to complement the analysis of the external extraction of resources with studies of internal obstructions to development in summary i believe that if we persist in this tradition that enriches theoretical connections we will be able to overcome the condition of being simple cultivators of dependency theory and in that way we will be able to mature and correct mistakes collectively facing the challenges of a political context very different from the one that reigned in the 1970s this new scenario should lead us to revise our conceptions in the light of the real problems of the popular movement and the left profiles and tributes i conclude this presentation with a tribute to three recently deceased figures of the theory of dependency samir amin theotonio dos santos and immanuel wallerstein all three shared the profile of the intellectual who aspires to reunify the social sciences without imposing the primacy of one discipline over another all three favored an all around approach and sought different paths to avoid academic confinement for these reasons this award is also for them it is a recognition to the memory and the great work of those who guided the development of the theory of dependency i am sure they would be very happy to notice how their work is read and studied as a weapon of struggle in the university in the street and in the militancy joined with the masses they aspired to build a future of equality and justice their goal was a society with neither exploiters nor exploited masses and we have the responsibility to make that ideal a reality so again thank you all very much for coming to this presentation of thinkers comrades and friends
zimbabwe finance minister mthuli ncube has told parliament that he is aware that the country is slowly re dollarising but he reiterated that there is no going back on the local currency instead the country will soon be introducing bigger denomination notes he had been asked by hatfield legislator tapiwa mashakada how he was going to vaccinate against the re dollarising of the economy which was now a reality mashakada a member of the opposition movement for democratic change was economic planning minister during the inclusive government which ran the country between 2009 and 2013 my question is minister i see you are introducing higher denominations of bond notes which is a signal that there is no going back on the use of the domestic currency he said on wednesday what is your attitude to the re dollarisation of the economy people are re dollarising retailers are re dollarising everyone the real estate sectors are re dollarising people are charging us dollars if you search hon members pockets they have got us dollars and not bond notes how do you vaccinate against the re dollarisation of the economy which is now a reality he asked ncube said he was aware of what was happening but there would be no reverse on the mono currency we are aware of what is going on of course it is illegal they must desist from doing it also we are aware of the other conundrum which is the speed of injection of zimbabwe dollars into the economy he said the speed is governed by our prudence that we should not flood the economy with the zimbabwe dollar cash we have to be prudent we have to exchange rtgs dollar for the new zimbabwe dollar so that we keep the amount of money in circulation the same we do not want an excessive growth in money supply which will then cause currency volatility and push up inflation so that prudence makes us to do things carefully and slowly but in the meantime the economy still needs cash we can understand what is going on but we are determined that we have to enforce the mono currency in terms of transactions we also recognise that we are in transition and that transition will take time but we are injecting the domestic cash to make sure that transition can be speeded up zimbabwe re introduced its local currency last year after a decade of using a basket of multi currencies but while the south african rand initially dominated the market the united states dollar soon took over mdc members including former finance minister tendai biti are for re dollarisation but ncube argues that there is no way the country s economy can recover and grow using the us dollar because it is not competitive ncube is however fighting a tough battle because of a skeptical public that has no confidence in the current administration and the local currency the public has every right to be pessimistic because some have lost the bulk of their savings if not their entire savings twice within 10 years yesterday the social media was rife with reports that the reserve bank of zimbabwe would liberalise the interbank rate with some reports saying the local currency which is currently trading at about 18 1 would fall to 35 1 today the old mutual implied rate used mostly by investors in fact plunged to 42 1 omir is the difference in price of the old mutual stock price on the london ad harare stock exchanges the rbz dismissed the reports saying the disinformation was meant to destabilize the exchange rate 86 views
bloomberg mexico s central bank is projected to cut its key interest rate by a quarter point for a fifth straight decision as stagnant growth prompts officials to lower the highest inflation adjusted borrowing costs among the world s biggest economies banco de mexico will reduce rates to 7 on thursday according to the median forecast in a bloomberg survey prospects for faster half point cuts dimmed after one board member advocating a more aggressive reduction changed his mind in december and inflation accelerated investors have slashed mexico s 2020 growth estimates after the economy contracted last year according to preliminary data even after reducing the key rate by one percentage point last year mexico has the highest real rate among group of 20 nations meaning there s plenty of space to cut but core inflation which excludes more volatile food and energy prices and has been a recent focus for the central bank quickened in january and remains above policy makers 3 goal that means policy makers will likely continue a measured approach to easing in the face of a rebound in inflation the central bank has to appear cautious and prudent that they re cutting but not going out of their way to ease aggressively said alonso cervera chief latin america economist at credit suisse group ag in mexico city click here to read additional reports and research from bloomberg economics policy makers have been lowering rates since august as declining oil output and uncertainty over president andres manuel lopez obrador s policies stalled the economy central bank governor alejandro diaz de leon said in a year end interview that the board could act on monetary policy again this month if inflation and internal and external risks remained low peso strength mexico s peso has provided one point of stability often used by investors to bet on emerging markets due to its abundant liquidity the currency last week touched the strongest level in nearly a year and a half the main attraction has been the better yield on peso denominated debt due to mexico s higher borrowing costs the peso has been the best performing major currency against the dollar in 2020 despite global concern about the spread of coronavirus given mexico s relatively high real rates coupled with economic weakness analysts expect the central bank to slash borrowing costs by another half point in the rest of 2020 following thursday s decision ending the year at 6 5 jpmorgan chase co expects additional quarter point cuts at the next policy meetings in march and may inflation risks despite the economic slack some consumer price risks persist aside from its concern over core inflation the central bank expects the headline number which accelerated to 3 24 in january to average 3 5 in the first quarter before slowing to 3 by year end what our economist says we believe the central bank is still cautious and only will want to go by 25 points instead of 50 points core inflation remains quite resilient despite increasing economic slack felipe hernandez latin america economist for bloomberg economics full research click here in minutes of its december meeting some central bank board members said that a 20 boost to mexico s minimum wage at the start of the year will make it hard for policy makers to reach their inflation target going forward they also said that it could hurt the labor market just as the economy struggles after both of lopez obrador s central bank appointees voted for half point rate cuts in september and october only gerardo esquivel supported a more drastic cut in december creating a 4 1 vote thursday s decision may be unanimous with all five members supporting a quarter point cut said gabriel casillas chief economist at grupo financiero banorte sab the nation s largely publicly traded bank one important change in the board s bias was jonathan heath moving to 25 basis point cuts casillas said given recent statements and tweets by gerardo esquivel we may see the first unanimous decision since before the rate reductions started in august to contact the reporter on this story eric martin in mexico city at emartin21 bloomberg net to contact the editors responsible for this story juan pablo spinetto at jspinetto bloomberg net robert jameson matthew malinowski for more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg com subscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source 2020 bloomberg l p
the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measure of simon kuznets who developed gdp 1934 at the risk of restating the obvious production should result in a product the producer can recognize that s the case even for intangible products artists know their songs even if hearing a pirate copy this also applies to a country s aggregate production i e gross domestic product of course we can t expect the government to count every single widget we make nor should we want them to the collection process would be pretty intrusive but they should be able to make a reasonably close estimate yet we have no such estimate as i explained last week we use gdp because we have nothing better but it misses a lot business government and especially federal reserve policymakers look at gdp when they make important decisions is it any wonder that flawed data leads to flawed policies today we ll extend the gdp discussion looking at where these numbers originate what they miss and what the fed in particular does with them as you ll see we need better data but it s not at all clear fed officials would use such data correctly even if they had it sam zell chairman of equity group investments where are the biggest opportunities of the 2020s one of forbes 100 greatest living business minds will share his views on the economy investing and the global landscape on stage this may find out what s on sam zell s mind at the sic 2020 gdp comes from the commerce department s bureau of economic analysis compiling it is a giant difficult never ending task one the bea staff takes seriously from time to time we hear stories about political interference but i think that unlikely too many people are involved to keep any such efforts secret the bea has a handy colorful two page sheet on its website that explains today s gdp in big letters here is how they define it source bea as they explain it gdp is the total market value of the goods and services produced within the us each year seem simple it s not those seemingly simple terms hide enormous complexity several centuries ago there was a big debate about what production meant the classical economists had little concept of manufacturing to them it was all about land and mainly agriculture this physiocrat philosophy originated in france assuming wealth derived solely from land and agriculture the physiocrats thought merchants and manufacturers simply shuffled the fruits of agriculture and contributed little to the overall economy the first industrial revolution pretty much put that theory to rest that worked fine for a few centuries until we started producing ephemeral yet valuable things like social networks for which consumers paid with their attention instead of their money unsurprisingly with the advent of the information and digital society there is yet another debate on what is the measure of true value and wealth more on that later bea wrestles with thousands of such questions some are harder to quantify than others the answers go into the master formula c i g nx gdp or as bea explains it source bea that first category pce is both a component of gdp and the fed s preferred inflation measure they have been trying and failing to get its annual change up to 2 business investment has also been lagging in part because pce growth has not been enough to require new production capacity government spending has done the opposite of lag instead growing at a rapid and accelerating pace and as i noted last week there was considerable debate about whether including government spending was simply double counting as at one time back in the dark ages government spending correlated directly with taxation some argue not unreasonably that government spending is actually a drag on total gdp when properly measured net exports is another way of looking at the trade deficit our imported goods subtract from gdp but if they cost less than domestic alternatives can give consumers and businesses more money to spend which boosts gdp so exports help but imports don t necessarily hurt like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name this is required email this is required subscribe for free recaptcha this formula made at least some sense when they began using it in the 1940s now less so but if you are a federal reserve governor charged with generating economic growth those are the knobs you can turn ditto if you are a president or member of congress most everything they all do from tax and trade policy to interest rates to stimulus spending aims to change one or more of these gdp inputs as bea s graphic shows gdp is the market value of the goods and services we produce that s fine as far as it goes usually it suffices but it presumes a markets exist and b they can identify a fair and accurate value that is increasingly not so for instance what is the market value of google maps facebook or wikipedia all are free to consumers they have no market value yet they re clearly valuable this is a big problem for gdp here are mit economists erik brynjolfsson and avinash collis writing in harvard business review last year gdp is often used as a proxy for how the economy is doing to look at it you would think it is a relatively precise number that signals every quarter whether the economy is growing or shrinking if it goes out to two decimal points how can it not be precise note sarcasm however gdp captures only the monetary value of all final goods produced in the economy because it measures only how much we pay for things not how much we benefit consumer s economic well being may not be correlated with gdp in fact it sometimes falls when gdp goes up and vice versa and that is especially true for the individual as we will see the good news is that economics does provide a way at least in theory to measure consumer well being that measure is called consumer surplus which is the difference between the maximum a consumer would be willing to pay for a good or service and its price if you would have spent as much as 100 for a shirt but paid only 40 then you have a 60 consumer surplus to understand why gdp can be a misleading proxy for economic well being consider encyclopedia britannica and wikipedia britannica used to cost several thousand dollars meaning its customers considered it to be worth at least that amount wikipedia a free service supported by donations which i encourage has far more articles at comparable quality than britannica ever did measured by consumer spending the industry is shrinking the print encyclopedia went out of business in 2012 as consumers abandoned it but measured by benefits consumers have never been better off that all makes sense but what can we do about it brynjolfsson et al did a series of experiments in which they asked people how much money they would want in order to give up facebook or wikipedia or other hard to measure free services the answers varied but they were able to calculate averages which were surprisingly high us consumers would want about 500 annually to give up facebook quite a bit more than facebook generates in ad revenue that means facebook alone would have added 0 11 percentage points per year to us gdp from 2004 through 2017 add the consumer surplus for other free services and we could be undercounting growth by a full percentage point annually that doesn t mean facebook or google are our economic saviors the point is that our prime economic growth measure gdp is missing an enormous amount of value simply because it doesn t fit the formula this has consequences central bankers in the us and elsewhere are not oblivious to these measurement problems they know their data is flawed even as they call their policies data dependent jerome powell discussed these same issues in a speech last october 7 called data dependent monetary policy in an evolving economy that was the same speech you may recall in which he casually mentioned the fed would begin injecting new reserves to deal with the then unfolding repo crisis i said at the time it didn t inspire confidence and indeed they are still pumping now months later powell argued the fed can do its job even with imperfect data he described some of the challenges i did above even giving brynjolfsson a couple of footnotes the advance of technology has long presented measurement challenges in 1987 nobel prize winning economist robert solow quipped that you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics in the second half of the 1990s this measurement puzzle was at the heart of monetary policymaking chairman alan greenspan famously argued that the united states was experiencing the dawn of a new economy and that potential and actual output were likely understated in official statistics where others saw capacity constraints and incipient inflation greenspan saw a productivity boom that would leave room for very low unemployment without inflation pressures in light of the uncertainty it faced the federal open market committee fomc judged that the appropriate risk management approach called for refraining from interest rate increases unless and until there were clearer signs of rising inflation under this policy unemployment fell near record lows without rising inflation and later revisions to gdp measurement showed appreciably faster productivity growth this episode illustrates a key challenge to making data dependent policy in real time good decisions require good data but the data in hand are seldom as good as we would like sound decision making therefore requires the application of good judgment and a healthy dose of risk management fair enough to paraphrase donald rumsfeld you go to the fomc with the data you have not the data you want but powell doesn t seem to get this idea of market pricing when the market is interest rates he said this the federal reserve sets two overnight interest rates the interest rate paid on banks reserve balances and the rate on our reverse repurchase agreements we use these two administered rates to keep a market determined rate the federal funds rate within a target range set by the fomc think about his last sentence federal funds is a market determined rate that must stay in the range the fomc decrees that is nonsense if fed funds has to stay within a range powell s committee sets it isn t market determined it is fomc determined with a little bit of wiggle room the amount of which is also fomc determined and the fomc determines it using data powell himself says is seldom as good as we would like see the problem here s the real question if they did have good data would powell and other central bankers use it count me dubious they like their flexibility too much they proclaim themselves data dependent then use the data s flaws to justify doing whatever they really want and that data has an agenda as an example it looks like judy shelton is running into trouble getting confirmed for the fed mainstream economists don t like her perhaps because she says things like this from friday s wsj the increasing financialization of gross domestic product is unhealthy because the growing size and profitability of the finance sector comes at the expense of the rest of the economy and increases income inequality the kind of economic growth that increases living standards across all income levels occurs under conditions of monetary and financial stability yet another way that the fed looking at the data distorts the economy and gdp because the data they look at is helping wall street not those who are struggling day to day here s annie lowrey writing in the atlantic viewing the economy through a cost of living paradigm helps explain why roughly two in five american adults would struggle to come up with 400 in an emergency so many years after the great recession ended it helps explain why one in five adults is unable to pay the current month s bills in full it demonstrates why a surprise furnace repair bill parking ticket court fee or medical expense remains ruinous for so many american families despite all the wealth this country has generated fully one in three households is classified as financially fragile like what you re reading get this free

federal reserve makes national monetary policy just as national average inflation probably doesn t reflect your personal situation the nation s average gdp doesn t reflect individual situations i have written about this in the past especially in my exchanges with ray dalio viewed through income and affordability lenses there are multiple americas with different needs different companies and regions would probably prefer a tad bit more nuance in interest rate policy gdp or any other national average simply can t capture all the variation in a country as large as the us that greatly reduces its analytical value here s guggenheim cio scott minerd on the problem of measuring economic growth from 1961 through 1966 average annual us gross domestic product gdp grew about 5 percent while the unemployment rate averaged 4 8 percent and inflation was under 2 percent knowing just these data points you would never get a sense of the economic and social inequities that led to 1967 s long hot summer of race riots in 2006 and 2007 most investors and policymakers missed the signs that the engine of economic growth associated with rapid house price appreciation would prove to be the source of global financial disaster economic historians will recognize 1966 as the beginning of a 16 year secular bear market stock benchmarks didn t recover until 1982 and on an inflation adjusted basis not until 1992 note that in the chart below from my friends at real investment advice there were four recessions during that period now we have just gone through the first decade in us history without a recession they also note the new york fed recession probability is getting uncomfortably high source real investment advice i have said repeatedly for the last three or four years that i don t expect recession within 12 months you can t really see much further than that in the data barring some exogenous shock from outside the us i usually cite europe and china as the main possibilities my 2020 forecast was for slower growth but no recession but now we may be getting that exogenous shock via china s coronavirus good friend and fishing buddy david kotok of cumberland advisors has long been a keen epidemic watcher it s kind of his personal thing he was all over sars ebola zika and others now he says what we all know china is lying about the data china cannot be trusted on any statistic we have suspected that for years with plenty of evidence now we have absolute proof it is literally impossible for epidemiologists even without government pressure to accurately know the number of deaths caused by the virus until after the fact they can make guesses but they do it without good data in this case it seems they were making politically pressured lowball guesses and now are trying to catch up the best bet is to ignore the statistics and watch what the chinese government does from private sources i have read quite chilling accounts of wartime like policies absolute lockdowns my friend dr mike roizen says that s the right thing to do this virus is not sars it is transmittable well before you have symptoms and there is now very credible evidence the virus can survive up to 12 days outside the body say on a hospital table or in an apartment building the expectations that factories will reopen soon may not be met and while the deaths are truly tragic the coronavirus is clearly going to have an economic impact too my favorite china bull now believes it probable china gdp will drop significantly this quarter note 15 of us foreign trade is with china europe and others are also being impacted which will affect our exports to them please understand i am not calling for a recession at this time but the potential for an exogenous shock is higher now than at any time in the last 10 years hopefully modern medicine will come up with a vaccine quickly there is reason to be hopeful on that front possible vaccines are already in animal trials in both the us and china but the economic impact won t wait we should also understand something else about the recovery it s tough to administer stimulus policies to areas that are in military lockdown but the moment this virus is under control china will likely go into the greatest stimulus campaign of the century i know that s saying a lot it will impact global markets it won t surprise me to see the fed proactively cut rates and for the ecb and other central banks to inject even more liquidity as they say stay tuned we ve just seen how complex the concept of gdp is and it s not the only one nearly everything in the realm of economics and finance is complex and often complicated which is not the same thing that s why i read so much understanding how all the threads of the tapestry fit together is not an easy task

you for joining us and we re calling in from our sioux falls office where the temperatures have rocketed up over the last couple of hours and it s now a positive 2 degrees fahrenheit well i ll start as always with some recent highlights net income for 2019 was 202 1 million that s a 5 1 million or 2 6 increase compared to last year diluted eps was 3 98 a 0 06 or 1 5 increase compared to last year non gaap adjusted eps was 3 42 and that s a 0 03 or a 9 increase compared to 2018 the board declared a quarterly dividend of 0 60 per share that s a 4 3 increase and that s payable march 31st to shareholders of record as of march 13th late last year we issued a carbon reduction vision for our electric portfolio in montana we re targeting a 90 reduction in carbon intensity by 2045 starting from a 2010 baseline in december we also announced our transaction to acquire an incremental 25 or 185 megawatts of colstrip unit 4 from puget sound energy for 1 in february just this month we filed a request for approval of the colstrip acquisition with the montana commission in december that commission the montana commission issued a final order approving our electric rate case settlement and this month we ve also issued an all source competitive solicitation or request for proposals for up to 220 megawatts of peaking and flexible capacity to be available for commercial operation in early 2023 and with that i ll turn it over to our cfo brian bird to walk through our financial results brian b bird chief financial officer thanks bob on slide 4 shows our summary of financial results the takeaway there as bob talked about net income 202 1 million a 5 1 million or 2 6 improvement on a year over year basis again on the details but generally the 2 3 improvement in gross margin that increase was a higher increase than our operating expenses of about 1 resulting in operating income improvement about 4 that ultimately drove our good results for the year on a year over year basis turning to slide 5 in terms of gross margin gross margin of 939 9 million a 20 8 million improvement or 2 3 if you look into the major drivers there i would talk about two things that really from 2018 the tax cuts and jobs act impact benefit this year 22 1 million versus the 18 amount that s offset also with a better electric qualifying facilities liability adjustment in 2018 so kind of taking those two offsetting one another what really drove the results to a great extent we had good retail volumes on the gas side and electric retail volumes we also saw some benefit from our rate increased 4 4 million this year for a nine month period an improvement in our electric supply cost recovery offsetting that to degree we did see some reduction in our electric transmission revenues during the year and also stepped out our natural gas production rates that total change in gross margin those items that impact net income was 20 2 million in addition things that flow through trackers like property tax and production tax credits netted to a 0 6 million increase in gross margin again netting to a total of 20 8 million increase in gross margin moving forward to weather on page 6 upper right just to summarize we did estimate overall favorable weather in 19 resulted in a 7 3 million pre tax benefit as compared to normal and a 6 million benefit compared to 2018 the calendar months and the weather maps for reach month were very very telling all of the favorable weather benefit for the year really came in the first quarter really cold february and march helped drive the favorable results it really impacted the gas side of our business when you look at the second and third quarter we didn t have much cooling load at all a matter of fact it s net unfavorable weather if you will during that time period and then the fourth quarter though october was cold it certainly didn t do enough to offset a pretty mild december and so again net net the first quarter drove our favorable weather results for the year moving on to page 7 in terms of operating expenses operating expenses as a total 663 million up 10 1 million or 1 5 so keeping operating expenses low the two primary benefits there is property taxes appeared to level off certainly level up in 19 we hope to see that as a trend going forward certainly no certainty of that but certainly a good step in the right direction to see those leveling off of 0 6 million or 0 4 also the depreciation depletion actually down 1 6 million or down approximately 1 the reason there being obviously we ve had increased depreciation as we continue to invest in our assets but the 9 million improvement in depreciation rates as a result of the rate case settlement as the primary driver for the reduction on a net basis in in terms of operating general administrative expenses we ve shared in the past that we did and opened the first strings a bit if you will from on our expenses we did note throughout the year we are going to be spending more on hazard trees and made really good progress on that during the year we did through both our generation and our t d business increased maintenance expenses across the board labor was up a bit during the year and then legal technology and benefits other primary increases in og a you may note that last quarter on a year to date basis we did have a quite a big large other there were questions associated with that we did in the fourth quarter break that out a bit more so people could see that that change there in those items impacting net income from an og a perspective 17 3 million when you take a look at items that certainly are in the og a category but are offset elsewhere in the p l 7 8 million pension some operating expenses recover to trackers and then 2 3 million in non employee directors deferred comp both the pension and deferred comp item you ll see in a moment offset in other income those changes were a decreased og a of 6 2 million for a net increase in og a of 11 1 million on the next page 8 operating income 276 9 million up 10 6 million or 4 below that interest expense up primarily due to higher borrowings to 3 1 million other income as i just spoke the main decrease is really netting the pension item and the deferred comp item i just spoke to in og a but also that was also partly offset by 1 6 million a higher capitalization of afudc the net there that from an income before tax of 182 2 million 3 9 million increase or 2 2 and then following that we did have a slightly higher income tax benefit on a year over year basis i ll speak to that in a moment to explain that difference giving to the net income i spoke earlier of 5 1 million improvement on page 9 income tax itself the two biggest drivers we had a release of an unrecognized tax benefit in 2019 of 22 8 million that was offset by the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act excess deferred taxes in 2018 of 19 8 million that 3 million difference is the primary difference other things like the slight improvement in pre tax income also drove the net result of an income tax benefit incremental benefit of 1 2 million for the year moving onto the balance sheet that much to really say here on page 10 obviously continue to see improvement in shareholders equity but ratio of debt to total capitalization continued to see a downward trend as we continue to shore up our credit metrics and always keyed in on our ffo to debt try and make sure we maintain our bbb flat unsecured credit ratings moving onto the cash flow statement on page 11 we did see a fall off in cash provided by operating activities of approximately 85 million on a year over year basis in the red box to the right we really identify five things that drove that we did have an under selection under collection of supply cost during the year not only to be a higher supply costs but our method now to collecting those are on an annual basis versus a monthly basis and as a result of the pcam settlement that add some aspects to do with it as well but that under supply we are now collecting in 2020 so we do expect to see a bit better cash flow certainly on a year over year basis the tax cuts and jobs act we had that settlement that we had in 18 actual refunds to customers didn t start occurring until into 19 there is the 20 5 million there and then the change year over year in terms of people providing deposits for generation interconnections was actually net refund 22 1 million for the year those are the three biggest drivers of the 85 3 million moving forward on to page 12 from an adjusted non gaap earnings perspective i think people who follow the company come to understand this page on the far to the far left to the far right really is the gaap numbers for 19 and far right gaap for 18 and then we work toward a non gaap numbers for both 19 and 18 the middle and the rest you can compare those starting from the far left diluted eps of 3 98 on a gaap basis we had two adjustments this year we took out 0 11 of favorable weather and we backed out 0 45 associated with the unrecognized tax benefit getting us to 3 42 on a relative on a comparison basis last year s gaap number in 18 392 we have three items that we backed out of that number 0 02 of favorable weather 0 26 associated with qf liability adjustment 0 25 associated with tcja netting to a 339 3 39 non gaap eps in the 2018 a 0 03 improvement or just under 1 in the comparing the middle columns through the p l gross margin up about 3 also operating expense is up about 3 even though property taxes and depreciation actually depreciate slightly down we did have a higher amount in og a and we planned to spend more we talked about hazard trees we talked about some other categories of incremental spend we wanted to have in 19 that though considering that improvement in gross margin increase in operating expenses at 2 8 improvement in operating income and net ultimately in a 2 2 increase in net income on a non gaap moving forward to page 13 diluted earnings per share over this time period you see it from both a gaap perspective and a non gaap perspective on a non gaap basis our eps has grown on an average over 5 from 2013 to 2019 we ll tell you that we do also show in 2020 column our guidance range of 3 45 to 3 60 per diluted share we do note here really the three assumptions normal weather we give you a consolidated income tax rate of 2 benefit to 3 tax increase based upon pre tax income and then diluted shares outstanding of 50 9 million lastly regarding our 6 to 9 total return long term look one thing i would mention here is we do see our capital spend now getting up in 2020 in 2021 to 400 million should be able to sustain that level on a going forward basis i d expect this to move toward the middle of that 6 to 9 total return total share of the return range again assuming reasonable recovery moving forward 2019 non gaap to 2020 eps bridge to the right i mentioned the 3 45 to 3 60 range how do we get there starting at 3 40 to 3 42 share we show kind of some low and high points to get to that range what are some of the drivers on gross margin certainly we expect the 1 plus of organic growth we expect higher industrial and commercial loads we expect some improvement in transmission revenues we are and we expect to get a full year benefit from the rate case and then lastly we had a wet year from an irrigation perspective in 19 we expect to see some improvement in irrigation revenues in 2020 that should help on the gross margin side and og a expense decreases really across the board we re looking at the business trying to maintain cost control in 2020 after kind of as i said releasing some of the first strings in 19 certainly tightening up here again in 20 we ve made great progress on hazard trees in 19 expect to spend a little lees in that category in 2020 and that range of 0 11 to 0 14 those are the two big drivers for improvement between gross margin increase and og a decrease thinking property tax depreciation and interest expense for a growing company we expect to see those it each increasing year over year other income with the south dakota generation and increased capital spend we ll speak to in a moment we re expecting a bit more afudc on a year over year basis and lastly we continue to focus on repairs tax deductions and expected incremental tax benefit associated with that that nets us to 3 45 to 3 63 with up to a range from zero to 0 03 of potential dilution from equity needs likely late 2020 to possibly early 2021 we see a net range of 3 45 to 3 60 when take in consideration our mid point of that a 3 53 when you look at the dividend we announced today and annualize that that s 2 40 if you compare that to 2 40 to the midpoint of the range or just provide a 3 53 that s about a 68 dividend payout lastly on this page i ll speak to taxes so it s good news and regarding that we did expect to be going through our nols in 2020 now that s 2021 and as a result of pushing that back a year with ami credits and ptc credits being available now into 2023 that used to be 2022 to reduce cash taxes and lastly we anticipate our effective tax rate to reach approximately 10 by 2023 and with that i ll pass back to bob robert c rowe president and chief executive officer thanks brian i ll start with a couple of words about our carbon statement in montana and as you know that s targeted 90 reduction in carbon intensity by 2045 as compared to a 2010 baseline in the baseline is the result of effectively that s been colstrip unit 4 was able to be fully dedicated to serve our customers the first resource that we had in montana after going through deregulation and divestiture of the montana power days as you know we are already over 60 carbon free on a delivered basis in montana and that compares to 28 average nationwide this is a montana specific statement although it s notable that in south dakota we are i think about 32 carbon free right now we refer to this is really no bs kind of a carbon statements are not a lot of qualifications to it it s driven by continued renewables coming on an actually very soon we ll have more wind on our montana system then we have hydro and we ll have more wind or hydro and then we have colstrip even after we close on the additional acquisition at colstrip energy efficiency continues to be important thermal resources will be very important in meeting our customers demands in montana dispatchable resources but the frequency the range of dispatch at this point to diminish as other resources come online toward the end of the decade we expect there are thermal resources that will be retired so this is a glide path it s also worth noting that this really is linked to the same modeling assumptions as in our resource plan and just like the resource plan this will be updated on a regular basis and that will allow us to capture changes in economics changes in technology changes in public policy one of the things i m particularly excited about that will help us achieve this vision is working with a group of communities that have their own sustainability goals sustainability programs in montana to help them craft and implement solutions that makes sense for them while also recognizing our legal obligations to all of our customers that will be a great opportunity to work directly with our customers turning then to the announced acquisition of 25 of colstrip unit 4 on december 9th we executed a purchase and sale agreement to acquire puget sound energy s 25 ownership in unit 4 it s 185 megawatts that would bring our total ownership at colstrip to 407 megawatts or 55 of unit 4 and as i mentioned even without additional acquisition we will have both more hydro and more wind on our system brand deep into his pockets and find a 1 to pay for the resource very importantly puget sound will retain responsibility for its current pro rata ownership share for environmental of pension liabilities as well as for ultimate closing costs in tandem we will enter into a purchase power agreement under which we will sell 90 megawatts back to puget for five years indexed to the mid sea index but with a floor of costs and our proposal is to essentially put the profits from that ppa into a trust to pre fund pretty meaningful down payment on an eventual closing costs for unit for us we think that s far sighted and responsible recognizing that all assets do have useful lives we filed for approval of the transaction in its various parts with the montana commission they are being responsible and setting a schedule interventions are due in the first few days march and we certainly don t see any reason why the transaction couldn t be reviewed and approved by the end of the year which we think is an important and being able to implement the elements of the proposal and start achieving those benefits for our customers and as you know we are uniquely exposed to prices in the western power market 46 reserve margin deficit at peak concerns about that meaning deep requirements are now a primary focus in western united states and even sharper focus in the pacific northwest and an acute focus in our montana operation again because in part of the legacy of supply new regulation so i mean this is very important and addressing about a quarter of our customers exposure to peak turning onto the south dakota and the montana electric plants first south dakota it s been a straightforward and efficient process we published our plan in the fall of 2018 really focused on modernizing our fleet to address reliability flexibility and particularly to maintain our compliance with southwest power pool requirements to be able to participate on behalf of our customers as effectively as possible in spp so we identified 90 megawatts of existing generation that should be retired and replaced over the next 10 years but we were running out of tecate then on april 15th 2019 we issued a request for proposals for 60 megawatts of flexible capacity resources to begin serving our south dakota customers by the end of 2021 is a very robust process again administered by a third party lots of interest in the process a good variety of submissions as a result of the competitive process we do expect to construct and own natural gas fired reciprocal reciprocating internal combustion engines or rice units at a brownfield site in huron and then dependent on manufacturer selection we anticipate between 55 megawatts and 60 megawatts of new capacity should be online by late 2021 at a total investment of about 80 million and the election proposal is subject to execution of construction contracts and then obtaining the applicable environmental and construction permits so that south dakota we re very excited to see that move forward turning to the montana plan there the focus was on developing resources that will address the really dramatically changing energy landscape in montana and in the west to meet our customers needs in a reliable and in affordable fashion as i referenced just a moment ago we are severely exposed at peak right now we re about 630 megawatts short of our peak needs and that s in a market in which traditional resources are shuttering and original market that isn t where providers are and planners are increasingly concerned about loss of loan probability in the not terribly distant future right now we are at market on behalf of our customers and being at market at peak with a skinny set of resources is not a very good place to be for our customers we forecast that our portfolio will be about 725 megawatts short in just five years considering expiring contracts and then just very modest increase in customer demand so this month we ve issued a competitive all source rfp for up to 280 megawatts of flexible peaking capacity to be available for commercial operation in early 2023 as the node indicates the rfp is opened to all types of resources provided that they can meet our needs for peak and flexible capacity there will be an independent evaluator to administer and then to evaluate proposals and the successful project or projects should be selected by the first quarter of next year and then we expect to kind of wash rinse and repeat and run a subsequent process in a future year turning to some other matters on the regulatory front as you know in december the commission issued a final order most importantly approving the electric rate case settlement in our montana case effective april 1st 2019 and that would result in an annual increase to electric revenue of about 6 5 million based on a 9 65 roe and the capital structure as we had proposed and then a 9 3 million decrease in depreciation expenses several parties have filed petitions for reconsideration of various parts of the order particularly a request for reconsideration by the montana consumer council concerning the decoupling or infrastructure funding mechanism that had been proposed by natural resources defense council and that we re very strongly supported we expect that the request for reconsideration will be acted on in the first quarter parallel in may of last year we submitted a filing to ferc for our montana transmission assets in june ferc issued an order accepting the filing granting interim rates effective july 1st of course subject to refund and then establishing settlement procedures and terminating our related tax cuts and jobs act filing settlement judge has been appointed and then settlement negotiations and conferences are active we expect to submit a compliance filing with the montana commission based upon eventual resolution of the ferc case with an adjustment and proposed credit back to our montana retail rates we re continuing to invest in our transmission and distribution infrastructure and this has been sometimes this work is not as visible but is incredibly important fulfilling our responsibilities to our customers that includes continuing work on a comprehensive staged approach to infrastructure addressing safety capacity reliability really modernizing the system we ve been talking about that our progress along those lines actually since i ve been at northwestern on the natural gas side pipeline investments or integrity verification pipeline and hazardous materials on a lot of good work there and then grid modernization continues to be our focus we d like to talk about deployment have the speed to value learning what works and then making decisions that are sensible for our system and for our customers one of the neat things actually just over the last couple of weeks we ve been on a multi year process to create a distribution operation control center and that started with geo coding elements in the field acquiring spectrum attaching communications to devices in the field that went live just in the last couple of weeks in the days after go live we had wins in montana actually had top of loan peak at big sky that hit 155 miles now we had several hundred outages it was truly the most challenging shake down crews that the distribution operations center could have had they are folks in customer care and then particularly our people in the field all this did an extraordinary job the functionality of the doc is going to continue to improve increase over the next several years as we continue to turn on more technology and make investments there but a couple of minutes on that just because it s an example of how investments that we consider to be very important but that can be invisible to our customers ultimately really make a huge huge difference as you know we re planning to enter the western energy imbalance market in april of 2021 based on our experience in the southwest power pool out of south dakota that will produce some real benefits for our montana customers we ll allow more efficient use of intermittent resources greater power grid reliability but then circling back to the montana rfp we have to have resources to be able to participate in that market as we ve talked about before we continue to monitor costs including labor benefits property tax valuations we consider ourselves i think objectively to be one of the most efficient companies in our peer group and really and post up well on most measures against companies larger than us last thing i ll draw your attention to is our capital investment forecast and what you see here over a five year period is 1 8 billion of total capital we anticipate financing this with a combination of cash flows from operations aided by nols through 2021 first mortgage bonds equity issuances based on what we know now any equity issuance would be late 2020 early 2021 and would be size to maintain and predict and protect our current credit ratings the significant potential significant capital investments that are not in these projections or negative regulatory actions could necessitate additional equity just a couple of things to highlight based on the results of the south dakota rfp this does include 80 million of incremental investment for our south dakota generation in 2020 and 2021 but does not include any investment identified it for generation capacity in montana and those depending on the results of an rfp could be in excess of 200 million over the next five years one thing i would highlight as you ve heard us say before as we work through any five year period we identify more projects that are important to serve our customers and indeed if you just look at the period 2020 through 2023 in this bar graph they re about actually 222 million of investment more than you would have seen last year and that s a result of the additional 80 million in generation in south dakota also an important montana electric transmission initiative some additional funding in montana ami gas transmission work in montana work at a billings substation ongoing upgrades to the hydro system and then like so many other utilities the investment in the sap s4 hana project so the point being that as you work through the five years again you identify the work that s most valuable and important to continuing to be able to serve our customers with that we are open for questions questions and answers operator thank you we ll take our first question from mike weinstein with credit suisse mike weinstein credit suisse analyst hi bob brian brian b bird chief financial officer hey mike mike weinstein credit suisse analyst hey could you talk a little bit more about why the rfp i guess final decision would be in the first quarter of 2021 you know what are the what s the extra i guess time required for that robert c rowe president and chief executive officer it s going to be a very thorough process or through the pre qualification process there will probably be several stages of evaluation so we believe in our supply folks most importantly believe that s a realistic and prudent schedule brian b bird chief financial officer yes our expectation is that by this call next year we d be giving you an outcome mike weinstein credit suisse analyst got you and have there been any other changes to the process there or is it the same process just seeing more time with it robert c rowe president and chief executive officer we are following the process outlined in legislation passed last year in montana so that does include several steps that otherwise we wouldn t have and the legislation actually isn t in place but for example there we filed the rfp with the commission before releasing it for submission so that s one extra step that does come in mind under the statute that we ll be taking effect this year mike weinstein credit suisse analyst right and i mean is the delay coming from you guys you initiate you re saying that you need more time it s not that somebody else is saying they need more time like the legislature or the commission itself or robert c rowe president and chief executive officer no i would not i did use the word delay at all this as a reasonable schedule to work through brian b bird chief financial officer we we might have been aggressive on the front end in terms of fully understanding the time period but working with the independent party revised our time period mike weinstein credit suisse analyst okay got it hey i was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about the energy imbalance market i think bob you mentioned that the additional assets are required to join that and you re planning on joining in next year is there any timeline that you have for additional assets that might need to be built i mean what are we talking about here is it any significant investments that are required robert c rowe president and chief executive officer those would be the assets that come out of the rfp mike weinstein credit suisse analyst okay so you need to see that before the before you can join robert c rowe president and chief executive officer no we re actively going through the steps to join right now it s a very significant undertaking to get in place all the systems hardware software people to be able to participate in the market and that s a joint undertaking of our transmission department and our supply department mike weinstein credit suisse analyst any brian b bird chief financial officer mike i just add the capacity that we plan to build through 2025 certainly meets our needs from an im perspective we are others obviously through ppa depending on the outcome of rfps but anything we don t have during the time that we re in ami up until until the end of 2025 we ll have to enter into contracts in order to achieve that mike weinstein credit suisse analyst got it are there any transmission assets required then you ll be built or any additional upgrades there robert c rowe president and chief executive officer not specifically for this i mentioned we do have a couple of transmission project under way mike weinstein credit suisse analyst right all right thank you robert c rowe president and chief executive officer thank you brian b bird chief financial officer thanks mike operator we ll take our next question from julien dumoulin smith with bank of america julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey team how are you brian bob robert c rowe president and chief executive officer julien how are you julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst can you hear me robert c rowe president and chief executive officer yes julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst good pleasure absolutely good to hear from you so just following up on where mike was taking a second ago timing of equity here you specifically talked about this upside 200 million you also put in the slides here 2020 2021 are you waiting to get some clarity about that process before kind of the deciding definitively on equity needs and also when you talk about equity here is that a definitive block equity or you think about like an atm process or something like that brian b bird chief financial officer i put two answers to your first question bob walk through the 222 million of incremental capital from the last time we talk from the slide and when i talked about it on the last call i was specifically talking to the 80 million not the full 222 and talked about having a need the latter half of 2020 or into 2021 that s still the case but again we just need to size that debt according to needs and from a rating agency perspective again ffo to debt perspective so that s and really answering your first question your second question we ve used atms in the past like them that s certainly a possibility but we ll evaluate other options as well julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst right so basically the whatever comes out of this current process in montana that would be incremental later on as you say in the slides so that s not going to dictate the timing whether 20 or to early 21 right etc brian b bird chief financial officer no that s a that s a fair point julien i think we ll need some equity prior to it outcome i think in terms of certainly building out anything if we re fortunate enough to be successful in montana that would be certainly beyond the end of 2020 early 2021 time period so that might be hopefully that s an incremental amount of equity we re raising at sometime in the future beyond it julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it excellent and then brian did you say you expect to move to the middle of the 6 to 9 tsr range and then to the extent which i heard that right can you clarify how you think about like a base year or anything like that sorry i don t mean to read more into it than is necessary but i also heard it so i just want to make sure i heard it right here brian b bird chief financial officer i appreciate you gave me an opportunity to clarify it again i the main thing here is we in 2020 and 2021 we re at we re now at about 400 million of capital investment if we re able to sustain that type of increase if you will to 400 every year i think you d see our eps growth rate improve again assuming reasonable recovery and thus you d see eps plus a dividend yield moving us more to the center of that 6 to 9 range is that make sense julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst excellent absolutely no thank you i appreciate it that s important sorry quick last little detail here maybe this is a bob question when you think about colstrip and the various owners how do you think about consolidating up further your ownership in that plants beyond what s contemplated today broad based robert c rowe president and chief executive officer through the rfp we are looking for flexible dispatchable capacity that would complement our other resources including the psc portion of colstrip so i think what we re looking for again is something that would in terms of serving our retail customers something that would be complementary with a big emphasis on flexibility dispatchability particularly on an intra hour basis and then beyond that i ll just see what s proposed in the rfp julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay is that differently you don t have a need for baseload coal like colstrip robert c rowe president and chief executive officer i m comfortable with what we ve acquired and beyond that we ll just see what comes in the rfp but our focus is flexibility dispatchability and risk management i would add julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst absolutely thank you very much for the clarification robert c rowe president and chief executive officer thank you operator we ll take our next question from shar pourreza with guggenheim partners shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst hey guys robert c rowe president and chief executive officer shar how are you doing shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst not good not too bad let me can i just follow up on julien s question i guess putting in a different way if you are presented with a similar structure as you received with puget would you take on additional interest in colstrip especially as the partners kind of decarbonize robert c rowe president and chief executive officer what i would shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst can you hear me brian b bird chief financial officer yes robert c rowe president and chief executive officer and as we re focused on resources that are complementary to the resources we have now in terms of ability to be flexible operate on an intra hour basis and then manage to diversify our risk as well and then if you can read into that if you like shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst okay got it and then obviously you did you ve got the colstrip deal you issued the rfp for additional generation any sense on sort of the timing and the composition of the next rfp as you think about the duration of your peaking needs robert c rowe president and chief executive officer no i think we ll work through this rfp see what comes out the other end focus on implementing that and based on conditions at that time which will be obviously different in terms of size of the need the economics the technology that s available but given the exposure that our customers have right now i don t think we can wait terribly long the first thing is we get through this process whenever the results are get those resources engaged to serve our customers shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst got it and then lastly it s helpful is you sort of highlighted the complaint around the fcrm pilot program is there any just remind us if there is a statutory deadline i know you expect a decision but is there a statutory deadline for montana psc to issue a decision on the petitions and then brian this is maybe a little bit for you even if you sort of get a scenario where there is a 25 basis point reduction in the earnings and the roe is there sort of an earnings impact given the fact that you do under earn in montana brian b bird chief financial officer yes first of all i think just to clarify that we spoke about earlier i think just the mcc is the only party that as far reconsideration associated with the fcrm and the 25 basis point everyone else i shouldn t say everywhere else but most parties it s certainly comment on that certainly support moving forward that without any impact on the roe and we hope that s where the commission will come down again in that regard so i m pretty confident we ll get there but we ll see i think the other thing i d say is it would be an impact of course to our earnings and regardless if we re earning or under earning i think it s going to have an impact if in fact we re deemed in anyway not an roe perspective and so i just leave it at that shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst got it got it i m sorry robert c rowe president and chief executive officer so is the proposal i thought was maybe the best decoupling our fixed cost proposal i ve seen anywhere and was an extremely forward looking step by the montana commission i think that testimony really eviscerated any kind of an argument for an roe adjustment but then beyond that said if you really think this is something to look at that s something that can be evaluated as part of the subsequent study so i certainly hope the commission sticks to its guns and there were a number of very good responsive fleeting from other interveners opposing the request for reconsideration shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst got it thanks guys that was helpful brian b bird chief financial officer i think one thing too in terms of the timing i think we re going to need to get an outcome pretty soon on that because we re supposed to implement that program by july 1 and so we hope to hear something relatively soon on that robert c rowe president and chief executive officer just one more little footnote following on to implementation of the order there was also good action by the commission approving what we re referring to is our green pricing stipulation so bobby scrapple our vice president for customer care and quite a good group of stakeholders are actively working on approaches to develop green products that our customers actually want to buy and we think that s very responsive to what we re hearing from both large and small customers and from some of our cities operator we ll take our next question from jonathan reeder with wells fargo jonathan reeder wells fargo securities analyst hey good afternoon gentlemen just kind of following up on that comment there bob in your prepared remarks it kind of sounded like in the rfp based on some of the desire for kind of green products that we might expect some renewables to maybe clear this first rfp i mean is that kind of fair robert c rowe president and chief executive officer very honestly we don t know what will come out the other end and what will ultimately be expected given the number of parties who are bidding in i expect we ll see some real diversity in proposals and as we think about our resource needs we think about it really as a pyramid and that s the base long duration dispatchable resources and then building up the pyramid dispatchable resource at a shorter duration so that potentially creates an opportunity to acquire some diverse resources through the process but the foundational need is going to really be long duration dispatchable resources jonathan reeder wells fargo securities analyst okay that s helpful and then brian just to confirm the ffo to debt ratio that you guys still target that s 15 brian b bird chief financial officer we target 15 i think the clearing is really 14 we d like to have some cushion in our ffo to debt jonathan reeder wells fargo securities analyst okay and then lastly the higher p d capex spend that s now in your budget how does that impact the potential cadence of rate case filings as well as any rate affordability concerns for your customers brian b bird chief financial officer great question jonathan i think twofold we ll obviously as that spend and that was a 223 million that bob talked about that s spread across those four years i would say this it could move things accelerate things a little quicker as said in the past that we expect to file bit more frequently certainly than we have in the past and we ll let you know that in april in terms of our timeline if you will at least for 2020 if there s any filings i think the other thing too is we expect during this time period particularly when we get into eim that s going to help reduce any bill headwind in any time we think about our long range plans we re trying to increase the customers at less than inflation robert c rowe president and chief executive officer the one thing i d add to that is of the 222 million part of it is south dakota part of its montana part of its electric part of its gas so on any one business segment the increased capital is just that much more modest jonathan reeder wells fargo securities analyst yes no i would like you guys to kind of spread it across the field pretty well so okay thanks so much that s all for me brian b bird chief financial officer thanks jonathan operator we ll take our next question from vedula murti with avon capital vedula murti avon capital analyst good afternoon brian b bird chief financial officer good afternoon robert c rowe president and chief executive officer good afternoon vedula murti avon capital analyst in terms of the pending rfp here in montana do you have is there a rate in the past that it s been difficult for you to be able to come up with self on proposals that managed to be able to effectively compete or be able to cross the finish line with the montana psc and the independent evaluator getting tough dakota you were able with the brownfield site to have a unique situation where it actually did work that way in this current rfp do you have any particular new opportunities or advantages that could produce perhaps a better outcome or the likelihood of a self on option more so than maybe it s been then has been in the past robert c rowe president and chief executive officer could you point me to the rfp you re referring to i m kind of a blank vedula murti avon capital analyst the once in the past where you wanted to have your self owned options and you haven t been able to get the psc or whoever to validate having your self owned phone options in montana robert c rowe president and chief executive officer i truly can t think of an example what i wonder if you re referring to coming out of the 2015 plan we undertook an rfp and we would drew it because of noise at the commission really unrelated if you recall that was when commissioner at the time came up with a reasonable idea that qf contracts ought to be limited to 15 years but that under a notion of symmetry resources coming out of the rfp whether owned by us or anybody else also ought to be limited to a 15 year period so as a result of that separate action by the commission we ultimately ended up withdrawing the rfp because we requested 20 year proposals i wonder could that be what you re thinking of vedula murti avon capital analyst yes perhaps in this case i guess maybe just maybe ask a little differently then given your success in south dakota are there do you feel like in this new process or things that you have advantages in terms of what you will be able to propose that may perhaps increase the probability of being successful at least in terms of part of solicitation in addition does the colstrip acquisition per dollar actually perhaps influence at all you know the self own viewpoint given you re not going to be able to fine tune too much more capacity for dollar robert c rowe president and chief executive officer certainly i agree with that statement i think we will participate in the rfp obviously we think we are good at building and operating resources and we think there are real customer benefits to having us do that so we re going to participate but the proposals from all parties will be evaluated on a neutral basis by a third party really through a blind process in terms of relationship to colstrip either the relationship i would see is that we did at least defer about a quarter of our customers exposure through that very cost effective transaction we think that was the right thing to do for our customers and also we think that was a pretty progressive move in terms of thinking about eventual closing costs and creating a situation where the ultimate decision about disposition of unit 4 is going to be based either on the economics at that unit or on a public policy decision in montana and not somewhere on the coast but i beyond that i really don t see a relationship between colstrip and the rfp brian do you say brian b bird chief financial officer no i think we obviously know the service territory that we operate in and have built resources and ask for pre approval and received approval on resources we put into our portfolio in the past and we plan to compete that s all i guess i d add bob vedula murti avon capital analyst okay and i want to make sure i clarify one thing that this as julien asked the question in terms of you know when you re running and make sure i understand this probably the 400 if you were to sustain a 400 million capital expenditure level when we re talking about the midpoint of the 6 to 9 given that you re at a 3 yield the inference is that the 400 million cap at a 400 million capex run rate but that would imply about a 4 5 earnings cagr as part of that as part of that as your 6 to 9 is that fair brian b bird chief financial officer that is the approximate math if you use that 3 flat dividend yield correct and i think the reason for sharing that is historically we have said in the past in light of the lower growth and investment in some of the outcomes we had been receiving we expect it to be in the lower end of that 6 to 9 range that we re certainly pleased in terms of being able to invest capital including the 80 million that we re investing in south dakota and bob pointed out projects that we throughout our service territories both electric and gas certainly to our customers benefit but that higher level of investment allow us to move up within that range vedula murti avon capital analyst and also to clarify also the equity question given the timing you laid out toward early 2021 which also lines up with the outcome of the rfp process in montana is there any reason not to simply wait to find out what that outcome is in terms of figuring out whether it d be an atm program or maybe whatever the sizing is and that type of thing as opposed and with the agencies do you feel like you have time to perpetuate that if you have an idea of what the outcome is brian b bird chief financial officer yes i think it s a fair question i think obviously one of the benefits of an atm program you could size that if in fact you let s say you weighted into the first quarter and you knew an outcome from that you could certainly size that and utilize that over time it s certainly something to think about we just wanted to make sure we gave people the impression of the timing that around an equity raise and so something certain to think about vedula vedula murti avon capital analyst okay and just in terms if we re running at a 400 million capex program given your cash flow profile in order to keep maintain a balanced capital structure should we be thinking at that point in time that something in the 100 million to 200 million kind of area is what would be required to maintain the capital structure brian b bird chief financial officer vedula i think people all run their various models and i think they probably have in their miles on ffo to debt calculation for us that s what we re really trying to get you to do is from your perspective in a modeling perspective for you to size that equity we re not going to provide you what we believe that is at this point in time vedula murti avon capital analyst all right thank you operator we ll take our next question from brian russo with sidoti brian russo sidoti company analyst hi good afternoon brian b bird chief financial officer hey brian brian russo sidoti company analyst hey just on slide 38 the rate base and authorized returns just remind us your thought process here you re currently earning on 3 4 billion of rate base but your actual estimated rate base if you kind of true it up outside the historical test years is 3 8 billion is that the way to look at so that delta will that was roughly 400 million will be need to be recovered in future rate cases brian b bird chief financial officer that s correct the 3 8 million is a future rate case perspective if it all happened on a particular date today we would be earning on the 3 8 million 7 3 million currently earning on the 3 4 million today brian russo sidoti company analyst okay so and the timing of these upcoming rate cases is to be determined and like you said maybe after your first quarter call in april brian b bird chief financial officer that s when we give you an indication what we plan to do in 2020 brian russo sidoti company analyst and in south dakota for recovery of the peaker plant are you going to pursue the general rate case route or file for a tracking mechanism brian b bird chief financial officer yes we re going to pursue that the rate case brian i think the timing of that will determine whether we can get a known and measurable adjustments so the timing of that will also require us to have some conversation with the commission and regardless while we re making an investment in that and we i said we don t have a rate case we certainly would have afudc during that time period brian russo sidoti company analyst okay so would this be like a one off rate case or would you seek recovery of the difference between 606 6 million and 557 3 million which was authorized back in december of 15 million plus the 80 million for the peaker is that at a brian b bird chief financial officer i think it would be all in it would be all in and and potentially if it was primarily as you can see from the schedule you re looking at it s primarily on the electric side where we have that need and obviously the generation units on the electric side so if we have a rate case from a south dakota electric perspective we re not just going to do the 80 million of investment in the plants it s going to be for all of our south dakota electric business brian russo sidoti company analyst got it and then just to clarify remind us the peaker plant in south dakota being built in huron south dakota was that is that at an existing generation facility or is it just that some sort of industrial site that has easier access to transmission brian b bird chief financial officer that is our site site brian russo sidoti company analyst it s your site okay got it brian b bird chief financial officer correct brian russo sidoti company analyst thank you very much brian b bird chief financial officer thanks brian operator we have no more questions in the queue at this time robert c rowe president and chief executive officer okay great thank you all very much for your interest and support we ll see quite a few of you over the next two months and hopefully be visiting with all of you in april take care operator duration 66 minutes call participants

in 2019 that continue to improve the corporation and position it for the future including received canadian technical standard order tso approval for a cursor control device enabling ftg to begin production of this product under development over the past 3 years on july 15 2019 ftg successfully closed the acquisition of colonial circuits inc in fredericksburg virginia achieved sales from colonial of approximately 3 6m from july to november began the certification process for the colonial facility to the aerospace as9100 certification with completion planned for early 2020 opening up significant new market opportunities for that site worked with key suppliers to achieve material cost savings for the colonial site in line with costs at other existing ftg sites in november ftg reached agreement with its represented staff at ftg aerospace toronto the contract is for four years with improvements in benefits and wages in line with typical collective agreements in ontario this year for ftg overall sales increased by 3 2m or 3 0 from 109 4m in 2018 to 112 7m in 2019 adjusting for the revenue recognition impact of 5m from the c919 program in q1 2018 the increase in sales is 8 2m or 7 9 in q4 ftg was the subject of a cyber attack that impacted all sites in north america except the recently acquired business in fredericksburg virginia the affected sites lost production from a few days to a few weeks this impacted the 2019 sales in the quarter and the year as deliveries were delayed beyond year end the acquisition of ftg circuits fredericksburg business which closed july 15 2019 contributed 3 6m to 2019 sales also contributing to the growth was the weakening of the canadian dollar by 3 8 cents in 2019 compared to the prior year which added approximately 3m to annual sales ftg s china sites were not impacted by the cyber attack in q4 they are however being impacted by measures taken by the chinese government in q1 2020 to control the spread of the corona virus outbreak and are expected to lose approximately 10 days of production in the quarter q4 2019 sales of 27 1m were 0 9m lower than q4 2018 net of the contribution of 2 4m from the acquisition of the ftg circuits fredericksburg business in september 2019 ftg was the subject of a cyber attack which impacted ftg s systems across north america overall lost production was approximately 10 of normal quarterly sales also in q4 2019 compared to q4 2018 shipments of products for the simulator market were down temporarily by approximately 3m as previous orders were completed and new orders could not be assembled until the arrival of longer lead components simulator related revenues are expected to rebound in the second half of 2020 the circuits segment sales were 71 4m up 7 4m or 11 5 in 2019 versus 2018 in q4 sales were 18 6m compared to 17 4m in q4 last year in q4 2019 sales were impacted by the cyber attack but offset by the incremental 2 4m in sales from the acquired business in virginia for the aerospace segment sales in 2019 were 41 2m compared to 45 3m last year 2018 had the 5m one time adjustment in program revenue in q4 2019 sales were 8 4m compared to 10 7m in q4 2018 the drop in q4 2019 is due partly to the cyber attack as well as a drop in simulator activity of 3m year over year the drop in simulator activity is the result the conclusion of existing orders and a gap in shipments until longer lead components arrive simulator revenues are expected to rebound in the second half of 2020 as the backlog in simulator work at year end was over 8 0m gross margins in 2019 were 30 3m or 26 9 compared to 25 3m or 23 1 in 2018 the benefit of increased sales was combined with improving operational efficiency across the company the cyber attack in q4 2019 negatively

argentina s move to delay a us 1 4 billion local bond payment this week hardly made a ripple in the broader world of global investing with most outsiders seeing it as a sideshow detached from the real drama surrounding the looming default on the country s billions of dollars of foreign obligations not so for franklin templeton and star money manager michael hasenstab the firm owned about a quarter of the notes as of december according to data compiled by bloomberg it s just the latest mishap to befall hasenstab s foray into south america s second biggest economy where outsize bets have helped make his us 26 billion templeton global bond fund among the worst performing funds of its kind over the past year as prices for argentina notes plunged franklin templeton funds held argentine bonds with a face value of at least us 4 3 billion according to the latest filings compiled by bloomberg there are signs things might soon get worse collapse late wednesday economy minister martín guzmán told investors to brace for a painful debt restructuring as the government seeks to put its finances back on track after a crippling currency crisis and deep recession he proclaimed those expecting friendly terms are misguided pushing benchmark bonds down to 45 cents on the dollar and that officials won t allow foreign investment firms to set the guidelines on macroeconomic policy it s necessary to have a deep debt restructuring he indicated at a congressional hearing it s clear that there s going to be frustration on the part of bondholders hasenstab s flagship templeton global bond fund has lost investors three percent over the past year worse than 88 percent of peers according to data compiled by bloomberg while the global fund has several big bets in argentina the nation represented just 1 4 percent of the portfolio according to the most recent holdings data its performance has also been dragged down by an errant bet that treasuries were due for a severe drop in the us 9 5 billion templeton emerging markets bond fund which lagged behind 98 percent of peers in the past year argentina comprises 5 6 percent of the total holdings franklin templeton declined to comment on the firm s investments in argentina or the performance of its funds hasenstab first amped up his bets on argentina in 2016 when he bought local bonds on expectations the country would turn an economic corner instead the economy is expected to contract for the third straight year in 2020 with inflation above 50 percent high unemployment and a third of the population living below the poverty line the peso has plunged 70 percent since the end of 2017 the worst performance among some 140 currencies tracked by bloomberg return on investment hasenstab s penchant for sticking to his guns during turbulence that would cause other investors to run for the exit may not have served him well he added to his bet in the country in 2018 when other institutional investors were fleeing buying us 2 3 billion in peso denominated securities after a currency crisis sparked the government to seek a record credit line with the international monetary fund however argentine bonds and other assets continued to flounder and then cratered in august after president alberto fernández defeated pro market leader mauricio macri in august s paso primary elections by a far wider margin than any poll had forecast argentina s overseas bonds have declined 46 percent since the end of 2017 only notes from venezuela and lebanon have fared worse during that span of course just a few years ago hasenstab was a high flying star in the bond world known for taking huge positions on risky debt in ireland hungary and ukraine and wringing out value from restructurings in the decade through 2013 the global bond fund ranked no 4 in returns among 113 us based fixed income funds tracked by bloomberg assets under management across all his funds grew to us 190 billion at the time from less than us 2 billion in 2001 i m comfortable going through periods of pain sweat and tears knowing there s a reward at the end hasenstab pointed in a 2016 interview unloading one potential problem created when hasenstab stakes out a large position in a country is that it can be hard to unload the debt quickly because the number of buyers who would be interested in taking on huge positions is limited franklin templeton is one of the biggest foreign investors in argentina its peers include big names like blackrock inc and fidelity which are forming a bondholder committee ahead of the country s debt talks it isn t at all clear that there will be much of a reward for investing in argentina if and when the country comes to a restructuring agreement with creditors guzmán intends to provide a formal offer by the second week of march and finish talks by the end of that month a timeline many economists say is very tight lots of investors got caught up in the excitement that surrounded argentina a few years ago after macri took over as president and reached a deal to settle a decade old dispute with creditors according to siobhan morden the head of latin america fixed income strategy at amherst pierpont you can talk for hours about how small mistakes became big mistakes but back then there was clearly optimism she said in an interview if you re a large creditor with a long position in argentina you don t have many options at this point that said argentina should pre negotiate with these large holders if they want to successfully restructure their debt by scott squires bloomberg

industrial property in carlton georgia a six building 509 000 square foot industrial portfolio in five separate markets extended the lease for our 40 000 square foot tenant in mason ohio through 2030 executed a 36 000 square foot 10 year lease in fridley minnesota office property and completed a public offering of 6 625 series e perpetual preferred stock subsequent to the end of the quarter we acquired a 65 000 square foot industrial property in indianapolis acquired a 327 000 square foot three building industrial portfolio in houston st louis and charlotte and our due diligence to acquire a 504 000 square foot industrial property in chatsworth georgia executed a lease amendment to extend a 100 000 square foot tenant in denver colorado through 2026 and extended the lease for a 78 000 square foot office tenant in springfield missouri also through 2026 as we noted on our third quarter call our investment strategy is emphasizing an increase in our portfolio s industrial allocation which we believe will improve our property operating efficiencies reduce capital expenditure levels and potentially result in improved valuation over time to that end our industrial allocation was 33 on january 1 2019 and has increased to 38 by year end from april 2019 through january 2020 our investment volume was approximately 160 million all of which were industrial properties providing further evidence of that commitment to increase the industrial allocation and our intent is to continue to overweight industrial acquisitions market conditions permitting of course in the developed submarkets of our targeted locations our primary focus has been and will be acquisition candidates ranging in size from 50 000 square feet to 300 000 square feet during the quarter our investment in asset management activities continued to generate positive momentum for our operations we acquired nine properties all industrial equating to 62 4 million in investment volume the transactions included a 212 000 square foot property in indianapolis for 8 2 million with a lease expiration date of april 2033 and a gaap cap rate of 7 8 a 241 000 square foot property in jackson tennessee for 9 million with a lease expiration date of august 2029 and a gaap cap rate of 7 4 a 117 000 square foot property in atlanta submarket for 8 million with a lease expiration date of december 2031 and a gaap cap rate of 7 4 and a six building 509 000 square foot portfolio in five markets throughout the south and southwest for 37 2 million with a lease expiration date of december 2029 and a gaap cap rate of 7 2 subsequent to quarter end we acquired a 65 000 square foot industrial property in indianapolis the acquisition price was 5 3 million and the gaap cap rate is 7 2 this acquisition was also a partial upreit transaction for us we also executed a 20 year sale leaseback transaction with a tenant occupying three industrial buildings in houston st louis and charlotte the acquisition price was 34 6 million and the gaap cap rate is 7 6 and we are currently in due diligence to acquire a 504 000 square foot cross dock facility for 30 3 million the property is located at northwest georgia inland port served by a class 1 railroad this distribution center ships raw materials to three manufacturing facilities operated by the tenant we expect this property to close in early to mid march pending successful completion of due diligence our asset management team continued to deliver on improving our same store operations from a lease renewal standpoint our midwest team executed a 40 000 square foot lease amendment for our office tenant in mason ohio which will extend the lease on two thirds of the space through june of 2030 our south central team extended the lease for our 78 000 square foot springfield missouri office tenant through 2026 and our mountain west team extended the lease for a 100 000 square foot denver office tenant through september of 2026 these combined efforts serve to increase the weighted average lease term on our entire portfolio and from an operation standpoint our asset management team is implementing energy savings improvements at three office locations in ohio and indiana these programs require no capital expenditures by gladstone lower energy consumption in the states upgrade building equipment and lower going forward operating costs for our tenants we plan to implement these energy savings projects at other locations as appropriate anticipating that many on the call are interested in lease expirations through 2020 i wanted to summarize the team s thoughts in our current activities during 2020 we have eight leases expiring representing 8 8 million of annual straight line rent 5 8 million of this total expires during the second half of the year three tenants have formally notified us that they are vacating the premises at the end of march and the end of june respectively and we are actively marketing those spaces now we have leased 50 of one of the buildings for a 10 year lease term with occupancy commencing upon the existing lease expiration date and we have active prospects for the other spaces as well we have leased 50 of excuse me i have already referenced the 40 000 square foot lease extension of our mason ohio tenant earlier and will not expand upon that at this time in addition we have lease amendments out for signature with our raleigh north carolina tenant who occupies two adjacent properties 100 of a 58 000 square foot office building and 20 of a 115 000 square foot industrial building the amendments will extend the office lease for five years and the industrial lease for one year gm will not renew their lease at our austin texas property at the end of august we have begun actively marketing the building and have prospects ranging from one third to as much as the entire 320 000 square foot space we have a website for the property marketing materials for prospects and floor plans illustrated on architectural boards set up in the lobby to assist us as we conduct property tours i think it s interesting to note that our gaap rent at the property of 14 50 per square foot compares favorably in the submarket with current space offerings in the low to mid 20 per square foot on a triple net basis and for the balance of the expiring tenants we are in active conversations with them and are hopeful of positive outcomes either relating to new leases or renewals market conditions are worthy of some comment national research firms have noted that investment sales volume was down for the third quarter versus the prior year s volume and are estimating a similar result for the fourth quarter completing the 11th year of this cycle the researchers estimate that both pricing and investment sales volume may be peaking possibly with the exception of industrial in addition we have noticed there is an apparent buyer seller disconnect in the office sector as evidenced by several notable properties returning to market after being under contract now with that information in mind significant capital is still available on the sidelines with considerable interest in u s real estate our team will continue to monitor market conditions and actively investigate accretive opportunities that promote our measured growth strategy and as it relates to growth opportunities investment sales listings have moderated but continue to be strong our current pipeline of acquisition candidates is approximately 260 million in volume representing 17 properties 15 of which are industrial of this total approximately 50 million is either in the letter of intent or due diligence stage and the balance is under initial review so in summary our fourth quarter activities continued our acquisition and leasing success refinanced maturing mortgages issued equity through our preferred series e issuance as well as common equity issuance through our atm program and collectively positions us well to pursue growth opportunities now let s turn it over to mike for a report on the financial results mike sodo chief financial officer good morning i ll start by reviewing our operating results for the fourth quarter of 2019 all per share numbers i reference are based on fully diluted weighted average common shares ffo adjusted for comparability and core ffo available to common stockholders were 0 39 and 0 40 per share respectively for the fourth quarter and 1 55 and 1 58 per share respectively for the year this performance demonstrates the accretive yet prudent growth that the company has completed in recent years as well as the performance of the in place portfolio in addition to these accretive deals our same store cash rent continues to grow at 2 on an annualized basis with the number of years of improving the balance sheet behind us including deleveraging the portfolio and with substantial acquisitions both at the end of 2019 and early part of 2020 we re excited about the prospects to grow profitability for our shareholders as well as increasing the industrial allocation of the portfolio these new investments will provide significant contribution to the company s performance and aspirations for core ffo growth in 2020 and beyond our fourth quarter results reflect an increase in total operating revenues to 29 4 million including 60 000 in lease termination and contraction revenue as compared to total operating expenses of 22 5 million for the period we continue to enhance our strong balance sheet as we grow our assets and focus on decreasing our leverage we ve reduced our debt to gross assets by nearly 15 to 46 over the past five years through refinancing maturing debt and financing new acquisitions at lower leverage levels we believe that we are 1 to 2 away from our target leverage level which means that nearly all raised equity will go toward accretive acquisitions we continue to primarily use long term mortgage debt to make acquisitions as we grow through disciplined investments we ll also look to expand our unsecured property pool with additional high quality assets over time we expect this will increase our financing alternatives as we continue to manage our balance sheet we ve repaid 61 million of debt over the past 24 months often with new long term variable rate mortgages at interest rates equal to the one month libor plus a spread ranging from 2 5 to 2 75 we have placed interest rate caps on all new variable rate loans we also added some of these properties to our unencumbered pool under our line of credit whether in advance of permanent debt placement disposition or in an effort to provide more flexibility in the future by increasing the size of our total unencumbered assets as bob mentioned and was discussed last call during the fourth quarter we did successfully issue our new series e 6 625 perpetual preferred on october 4 totaling 69 million outstanding with significant institutional and retail support this execution allowed us to redeem our previously existing series a and series b preferred stock which on a weighted basis were nearly 100 basis points above the new series e from a coupon perspective we expect that this will further contribute to profitability in 2020 and beyond we ve also been extremely active in issuing our common stock using our atm program it s of note that we changed atm sales agents in december with goldman sachs stifel and baird now leading this program during the fourth quarter and net of issuance costs we opportunistically raised 24 million through common stock sales in addition we ve also raised an incremental 28 million already in 2020 this meaningful and extremely cost efficient means of raising capital demonstrates both the performance of our new sales agents as well as increased investor demand for our stock we believe these capital markets transactions continue to speak to the growth of the company and balance sheet enhancements that have been achieved as well as the long term prospects for further prosperity with incremental bank backing going forward and access to more efficient capital looking at our debt profile 2020 and 2021 loan maturities are very manageable with only 20 million and 27 million coming due respectively a number of these loans have extension options we ve continued to proactively manage and improve our liquidity and maturity profile over time depending on several factors including the tenant s credit property type location terms of the lease leverage and the amount and term of the loan we re generally seeing all in rates on new debt ranging from the mid to high 3 range we continue to minimize our exposure to rising interest rates with over 90 of our existing debt being fixed rate or hedged to fixed through interest rate swaps and caps as of today we have 4 million in cash and 35 million of availability under our line of credit with our current availability and access to our atm programs we believe that we have significant incremental flexibility to fund our current operations properties we re underwriting and any known upcoming improvements at our properties we encourage you to also review our quarterly financial supplement posted on our website which provides more detailed financial and portfolio information for the quarter we feel good about continuing to execute our business plan through 2020 and beyond as we continue to increase our high quality asset base and continue to improve our metrics we re focused on maintaining our high occupancy with strong credit in real estate institutional ownership of our stock increased by 17 since the beginning of 2016 to 57 as of december 31 bob and i continue to be very active in meeting with current and potential investors portfolio managers coverage analysts investment banks and the like we look forward to establishing new relationships as the company moves forward to its next chapter regarding our common stock dividend in january the board voted to increase the monthly distribution to 0 12515 per share for january february and march while this is a modest increase it s noteworthy as this is the first dividend increase that we ve had in over 10 years we believe that this is an attractive yield for a well managed reit like ours and continues to provide excellent investment opportunity for those pursuing stable monthly income we ve now paid 180 consecutive common stock dividends we went through the great recession without reducing or suspending these payments and now i ll turn the program back to david david gladstone chairman and chief executive officer okay that was a good report mike and also a good one from bob and michael licalsi it s a very very nice quarter we heard a lot today and the numbers of the transaction we acquired the industrial properties with credit tenants and initiated series e preferred stock in october it s just been a bang up quarter one of the best that we had since starting the company the team is growing this portfolio at a good pace doing a great job managing the balance sheet we continue to believe we have a promising list of potential quality properties that we can acquire the pipeline looks good the middle market of the business like many of our tenants is doing fine today and our tenants are paying their rents the economy is excellent today it s the best i ve seen in my entire career and of course the team s making acquisitions for this company they re just first class purchases and we re financing these long term leases with long term mortgages we like to match the book as they say this should help us weather any kind of downturn that s coming close and i don t think there s anything in sight right now our stock closed wednesday at 21 94 the distribution yield is about 6 8 many of the reits that are out there trading there s about 190 of them trade at a much lower yield so it makes room for us to for the price of the stock to go up and of course our yield hopefully will stay the same as we continue to grow the business we started to increase the dividends just to keep up with inflation and while the increase for the quarter was small it s a beginning of our goal of keeping up with inflation and buying keeping your buying power the same or stronger okay let me stop here and joelle if you ll come on we ll get some questions from the people that are listening in questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from gaurav mehta with national securities your line is now open gaurav mehta national securities analyst yeah thanks good morning robert cutlip president good morning mike sodo chief financial officer good morning gaurav mehta national securities analyst first question that i have is on acquisitions so if i look at your 4q run rate you guys acquired 62 million of assets 1q is around like 65 million including the assets under due diligence that you mentioned i mean as we think about 2020 is that 60 million 65 million is like the right run rate to look at or do you think that the volume will slow down later in the year robert cutlip president i think it will slow down gaurav i believe we think that and mike and i have discussed with the acquisition team and market conditions and we should be able to achieve north of 150 million that s kind of our goal but no i don t see a run rate of 65 million a quarter i we went into a very very good let s say window of opportunity with these assets and so when you look at having 260 million in our pipeline that s a little bit lower than it has been in the past so coming out of the shoot with 40 million in the first month and having where we are i feel very good about achieving our goal of 150 million and it could be north of that but we re not going to be on a run rate of 60 million to 70 million a quarter no gaurav mehta national securities analyst okay and i think bob in your prepared remarks you talked about buyer seller disconnect on the office sector side maybe you can provide some color on what s driving that robert cutlip president it s interesting we re at the point in the cycle where in my opinion the smart sellers are recognizing that if their properties are long in the tooth or they need capital expenditures why not sell it and instead of putting more capital in the building and just take their proceeds and reinvest and so a number of the properties we have looked at have had significant capex requirements deferred maintenance and we re not in the business of doing that our goal and our objective and really our strategy for our teams is in the first three years of operation we don t want to put any capital in the building doesn t make sense so that s where we re seeing some disconnect we had a property come back to us which we ultimately elected not to pursue we were not the preferred buyer but it came back and that was one of the issues so we re just very vigilant about it capital expenditures for offices and office properties as you know are extremely high vis a vis industrial and so that s why our emphasis has shifted a bit to the industrial side we still are looking for office but we just think it s a bit more difficult right now gaurav mehta national securities analyst okay and then lastly on the occupancy side you dipped to 97 in 4q and as you think about your lease expirations in 2020 i mean how should we think about year to year occupancy expectations going forward robert cutlip president well we ve always prided ourselves in staying above 96 occupied i think we will be able to maintain that of course the white elephant in the room and being transparent is our tenant there in austin gm fortunately as i indicated we re seeing very very strong prospects with rental rates much higher than what gm is paying us right now so i feel we re very encouraged that we re going to stay in that high 90 occupancy gaurav mehta national securities analyst okay thank you that s all i had robert cutlip president thank you david gladstone chairman and chief executive officer next question please operator thank you our next question comes from barry oxford with d a davidson your line is now open barry oxford d a davidson analyst great great bob along the same lines when you were talking about buildings with low capex and stuff when you have a tenant vacate do you look at the possibility of selling that asset robert cutlip president that is correct we will do that and particularly if it s if it happens to be in what i would consider to be a non core location or the configuration is such that we would have to expend more dollars than we think is appropriate and in the past we have done that as i think we ve reported we ve exited a lot of single tenant let s say single property non core buildings over the last three years to four years and we ll continue to do that but yes we look very much at the configuration we look at the location and we look at the redeployment into our let s say target markets barry oxford d a davidson analyst okay great switching gears just a little bit when you re using the upreit structure you have an atm in place how do you see using the upreit and the atm in 2020 mike sodo chief financial officer i ll peel that one barry barry oxford d a davidson analyst yes go ahead mike sodo chief financial officer with respect to the atm as we ve messaged fairly consistently our sweet spot of deals that are generally south of 30 million we intend on utilizing our atm in almost solely on the common side that s what we ve done over the last 18 months to source the equity requisite to that and that s with us underwriting deals call it in the 50 to 52 leverage level i think it s worthy of note the atm activity we had in the three months the prior three months in a 12 week period we issued north of 52 million of equity via atm which is by far the most we ve ever been able to do in that short a span so it gives me confidence that i can raise the capital for those traditional acquisitions i caveat that with if we contemplate larger individual assets or portfolios that tip above 30 million we may need to contemplate going to the overnight markets we may need to also contemplate going to the overnight markets if individual deals that on their own are smaller but they all stack up on the calendar in the same way so it will likely be a blend but a majority of equity will be raised by atm and then possibly an overnight at some point subject to deal flow with respect to the upreit format and structure and offer we love that obviously having the upreit be live it is the most efficient way for us to issue capital i will say since we started issuing op units some time ago it is a dialogue we have with all prospective sellers and we will continue to contemplate that but to be fair to it the vast majority of our proceeds have not been an op structure but i would theorize that there will be a couple more deals during this year that they take some or all op units barry oxford d a davidson analyst great and mike and then on the debt side as we move forward into 2020 how are you thinking about unsecured debt mike sodo chief financial officer long term aspirations but we re in a place where we are taking looking at things with the conservative lens today barry as david mentioned we want to match the book we know if you had a crystal ball and it told us what was going to happen from a macroeconomic perspective i would love to see it but with us being where we are in the cycle we are being very conservative over time we do continue to have aspirations to get to those unsecured pockets of debt capital being private placement corporate unsecured etc but we will be prudent in the way we walk in that direction barry oxford d a davidson analyst great thanks guys appreciate it mike sodo chief financial officer thanks barry david gladstone chairman and chief executive officer next question operator thank you our next question comes from rob stevenson with janney your line is now open rob stevenson janney analyst thank you so david you won t have to hear me ask when the board is going to increase the dividend this quarter but one question on the dividend though coverage is obviously much better than it s been in the past how are you guys thinking about office dispositions as you triangulate earnings growth the dividend and the need for equity to fund acquisitions i mean at this point are dispositions of office assets more or less likely going forward robert cutlip president i ll address that initially david may want to add to it but i think when we look at dispositions it s not so much whether it s office or industrial yes we want to increase our industrial allocation it s whether or not this property is in one of our target markets and whether or not the configuration is such that it would be difficult to release the property and so office is probably a higher probability because as everybody knows if the tenant moves out your tenant improvement costs your capex because of equipment replacement etc etc is much higher so i would say that if i had to handicap it i would say probably a two thirds office one third industrial we have a property in syracuse new york right now that we have released it s an industrial property has a very excellent tenant in it but we re not going to be in syracuse from a portfolio standpoint so as an opportunity presents itself and we can redeploy that industrial those industrial proceeds we will do so david gladstone chairman and chief executive officer it s always a fine line that we walk through rob in terms of trying to determine which asset to keep and which to let go bob and his team have identified 20 markets that they like they want to stay in those 20 markets they ve got good coverage there and got good knowledge of what the market s like and so the old way of doing business here was if it looked like it was a great tenant and it was in a could be in timbuktu and we d still take the deal we ve gone away from that we re much more identifying markets and making sure that we can find tenants for anything that comes up so right now i d say there s no push to sell off any of the buildings right now and but time you never know somebody comes along and likes that one we get calls from brokers all the time saying would you sell us a so and so building and in some of those instances the answer is yes but no defined push to push all of the rental properties out the door to somebody else rob stevenson janney analyst okay and then bob i appreciate the color on the various leases that are expiring in the renewal status what are we talking about in terms of the annual revenue from the known move outs i mean gm alone is 4 of your revenue how much is the rest combined on a rough basis just trying to get a feel for how much revenue is at risk if the all of these vacated and you had some extended period of downtime in terms of the overall financial impact robert cutlip president well let s let me we indicated that we had like about 8 8 million expiring this year right now inclusive of the leases out for signature we ve taken care of about 1 4 million of that already and so i m looking at probably exclusive of gm another 2 7 million that we ve got to take care of this year and with that in mind i feel very good with the exception of one property in minneapolis which is a single storey property it s about 1 4 million in straight line rent it s a good property but there s no transaction velocity there so if i had to handicap it exclusive of gm i would say that my risk is somewhere between 1 4 million and 1 8 million but that can change because as you know market conditions can vary i m cautiously optimistic about gm but it s like anything else right now the austin market is on fire and a lot of companies are wanting to relocate there and we have we just received our most recent market update on that property and we have four new prospects that are in excess of 100 000 square feet in the market right now so we have a total of approximately six that have are kind of what i would call kicking the tires but as you know and i know market conditions could go flat quickly so sense of urgency is there with the team i think we have a great marketing team there our leadership buzz and e j and perry finney are doing a great job in aggressively doing that but bottom line that s what i believe is our really biggest exposure gm plus that maybe 1 4 million to 1 6 million rob stevenson janney analyst where what submarket is the gm asset in and how much capex do you think you would need to retenant that robert cutlip president it s in the parmer corridor which is a very very strong corridor where oracle paypal all of them are there across the street from us is an excellent mixed use development actually that was is being developed and has been developed by the company who sold the property to us i think it varies depending upon the tenant improvements and the costs are going to vary in austin today being brutally honest their rents the rents are in as i indicated in the low to mid 20s cash basis going in versus where we are at that point but the tenant improvements depending upon the length of the term vary anywhere from 30 to as high as 80 a square foot that have been done and that s significant i don t believe we will be going that high with our property and the reason being is i ve walked it a number of times it s excellent creative office if it turns out to be a single tenant i think we will be at the low to mid range of that if it does go to multi tenant then we ll be to the mid to the higher range there s no doubt about it rob stevenson janney analyst okay and then you cut out when you were talking about the acquisition for the georgia inland port property how what is the dollar value there and sort of cap rate and you said i think i heard mid march close robert cutlip president yeah it s a mid march close it s a little over 30 million of acquisition price over 500 000 square feet as i can recall and the cap rate is just south of 7 rob stevenson janney analyst okay and then mike could you talk about the 1 8 million impairment charge during the quarter is that just one asset and where was that mike sodo chief financial officer sure rob yeah that s a legacy asset office asset that is in the suburbs of charlotte north carolina it is an asset that gladstone commercial bought in 2004 it s something that has been vacant went vacant in 2019 and we have been contemplating either release scenarios or sales scenarios in short we were approached by the identified prospective buyer subject to a culmination of due diligence late 2019 they ve offered us a price that we like like bob mentioned office buildings from a release perspective tend to have significant ti or capex requirements we have no appetite for that with this asset so nothing is guaranteed but we look forward to selling the asset and redeploying the capital rob stevenson janney analyst okay and then last one for me i know it s been talked about on prior calls but any new or incremental thoughts by management or the board these days on the likelihood and or timing of internalization david gladstone chairman and chief executive officer no we right now i feel very good about our cost structure at our size right now having us be externally advised makes all the sense in the world because of the shared costs that we have i m sure it will always come up by the board and by david over the next probably two years to three years but right now we feel very good about our current structure and our cost relating thereto because i think we re really aligned with the shareholders the way our cost structure is setup right now rob stevenson janney analyst okay thanks guys robert cutlip president thanks rob david gladstone chairman and chief executive officer next question operator thank you our next question comes from henry coffey with wedbush securities your line is now open henry coffey wedbush securities analyst yes good morning everyone and thanks for taking my questions i know you don t like to give guidance and barry s questions and your answers were very helpful around this subject but is there a lot of earnings sensitivity here in your view of a couple of pennies it just doesn t seem like a big number and i m also looking at the fact that your sort of two year lease renewal was 13 14 last year now it s 15 16 so it s not a big challenge and i don t know if you can put some numbers to it or maybe you re not comfortable going there mike sodo chief financial officer yeah henry i ll feel this and we re not comfortable putting out formal numbers generically i ll speak the kind of performance of 2019 and our aspirations for 20 and beyond as everyone on this call knows core ffo was relatively flat in 2019 after a breakout year in 2018 a number of things play into that i d say big picture takeaways are that we continued our deleveraging efforts deleveraging the portfolio by 1 point so we continue to issue equity and underwriting newer deals at lower leverage levels as well as closing half of the entire 2019 activity in november and december and specifically of that call it north of 60 million we closed during that time period approximately 90 of that closed on the back half of december so there was effectively no participation in 2019 earnings we wake up on january 1 having those assets now in our portfolio fully contributing to ffo as well as core ffo our aspirations here is we have leverage almost in the right place with 1 points to 2 points over time to be done our aspirations are to maintain occupancy continue to grow by north of 150 million a year and manage the debt stack efficiently as well as tapping the equity capital markets our hope is here we can get to a point in time where on an annualized basis we can demonstrate 1 5 to 3 growth in core ffo on an annualized basis and again that s all caveated based upon what happens with the macro economy as well as our performance but that is our goal henry coffey wedbush securities analyst the missouri index is lower than it s been since reagan s day so i think it s difficult to think of a negative outcome on the economy though it s always out there but it looks like you re in pretty good shape it is just a question of how much growth do we get in the second half of 2019 david gladstone chairman and chief executive officer well that s that and as well as what s the terms and conditions in which these guys are competing as you know we re not in the big transactions we re dealing mostly with middle market sized tenants and there s a lot of those you have to like potato chips you got to eat a lot of them to make it work but these guys are good at putting together deals and closing and diligence and all of that so i think we re going to be strong throughout this year and again it s all depend on something bad happening like the coronavirus speeding up in the united states and people becoming very conservative in their business outlook so right now we re riding the wave and it s great to move along at this pace you tell us which way the economy is going and we will tell you what we re going to do henry coffey wedbush securities analyst super thank you david david gladstone chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome next question please operator thank you our next question comes from john massocca with ladenburg your line is now open john massocca ladenburg analyst good morning david gladstone chairman and chief executive officer good morning john how are you john massocca ladenburg analyst not bad so just kind of touching on acquisitions again i mean given what s kind of very tangibly in the pipeline and you talked about carlton and then you ve already closed year to date i m just wondering why the 150 million is kind of a number out there and maybe why it seems like if that is the number then there s almost like kind of a bit of a slowdown you re expecting kind of the midpoint of the year is it something or is it just the lumpiness of the business or is there some bigger macro dynamic that s driving kind of a significant amount of deal flow here from the end of last year to kind of the beginning of this year and then maybe a more conservative outlook going forward robert cutlip president well i think if i take a look at our size as well john from 2012 to 2018 we averaged about 105 million as we were growing to get to 1 billion in assets in a prior life once we got to that point and we had more float we had more institutional coverage we had actually just a lot more shares and more demand for the stock we were able to jump it to 150 million to 175 million and i think that s kind of what we re looking at here we may have a blowout year where we do over 200 million but by the same token our whole approach to the business is a measured growth strategy and we ve got to make sure that we achieve and mike keeps us on the straight and narrow that we re getting 125 basis points to 150 basis points overall cost of capital which you know varies during the year and so for us to say we can do 150 basis points to 175 basis points i really like that number which really means we re growing at double continuing to grow at double digits once we get to 2 billion to 2 5 billion that number will probably jump up well above 200 million john massocca ladenburg analyst okay but if we do stay in that number then it should be kind of a front end loaded year just given both georgia and what you already closed robert cutlip president yeah it could be but i will tell you our acquisitions team is not stopping it s if we identify and we ve been fortunate in the pricing from about 5 million to 25 million to 30 million that we can be very very competitive on the industrial side as i indicated earlier in my comments it s been very difficult for us to find office properties that make sense right now mike sodo chief financial officer but the math s right john i mean to the extent we close the acquisition in march we will have done north of 70 million likely before march 15 so clearly that implies based upon a target of 150 million to 175 million that it will be front end loaded john massocca ladenburg analyst okay robert cutlip president and i like that because it puts some wind at our back going through the year from an ffo per share standpoint john massocca ladenburg analyst okay and then switching to kind of the in place portfolio leasing commissions jumped a little bit in 4q if my math is right i m sorry tenant improvements how do you kind of expect tenant improvements and leasing commissions to trend really at the beginning of this year you announced a lot of kind of releasing activity obviously gm is going to be its own thing and we ve talked a lot about that but maybe outside of that how should we expect kind of leasing commissions and tis to trend this year robert cutlip president well let me for the deals that we have done let me go through and tell you what we are spending the mason ohio property no tis but they can spend money but it is amortized over the term of the lease so that s a positive if we look at our indianapolis property where our existing tenant extended their lease through 2031 and then took another 9 000 square feet that ti which they re going to be spending this year is about 6 a square foot on the 76 000 square feet the salt lake city property where we did about we did a 6 600 square foot new deal that s 9 per square foot then i m going to tell you because we are always transparent the deal that we did in minneapolis to replace the tenant who is moving out at the end of march that lease was for 35 000 square feet and the tenant improvements is 40 but then viasat excuse me the tenant out in denver that we just extended their lease through 2026 the tenant improvements there is 15 and then the 78 000 square foot renewal that we just did in springfield missouri was 5 so with the exception of that one tenant in minneapolis which is a very difficult market and a lot of this includes some capex to demise it into a multi tenant building i feel that our numbers are fairly decent particularly when i look at the denver property and i look at the springfield missouri property both of which are office properties as is the property in mason ohio so that s kind of actuals mike you might want to add mike sodo chief financial officer sure yeah and john you re right capex and ti during the fourth quarter was 1 6 million for the entire year it was only 2 3 million from a leasing commission perspective it was 300 000 but that was pretty much run rate with 1 2 million for 2019 bob has given you the specifics on a property by property basis and explicitly talked about gm i would say from a big picture perspective and putting gm aside our all in capex ti leasing commission expectations for 2020 are in the call it 5 million to 7 million range john massocca ladenburg analyst very helpful that s it for me thank you very much david gladstone chairman and chief executive officer next question operator thank you our next question comes from craig kucera with b riley fbr your line is now open craig kucera b riley fbr analyst hi good morning guys david gladstone chairman and chief executive officer good morning craig kucera b riley fbr analyst i had to hop off and jumped back on so i apologize if you covered this but i do want to circle back to gm i think in the past you thought that if they didn t renew the worst case would be that it might take about six months to release the asset and then you will get a higher rent is that still your thought process here robert cutlip president i m not going to make a commitment on if i said that in the past that is an error and i ll be openly honest about it i mean in this market you never know we are hopeful that we will have some leasing in that property before the end of the year what s encouraging craig is that there s a number of prospects from 100 000 square feet to over 300 000 square feet in the market and there are only two existing properties that have that much square footage available unless you want to build a new facility which is going to take 2 years to 2 5 years so with the number of prospects that are out there i am cautiously optimistic that we re going to have some prospects we did send a proposal out to one tenant for the entire building whether or not that is going to come to fruition i have no idea i mean it s not a challenging market because there s a lot of activity in austin but i would be extremely happy if we did it in six months i do believe with the activity we re going to have we re going to have success before the end of the year craig kucera b riley fbr analyst okay great and one more for me did you cover which assets you re looking to sell this quarter robert cutlip president we did but very briefly craig it s a vacant office asset in the suburbs of charlotte north carolina we ve owned the asset since 2004 we expect that to close in the first quarter we ll be redeploying those assets those dollars into pending acquisitions craig kucera b riley fbr analyst got it and just one more for me a question about eastern metal supply it looks like they have a number of other locations are they potentially a future source of additional acquisitions or do you think you re probably full with that tenant as we stand today robert cutlip president i think we re full with them from the standpoint we it s an excellent three building complex in markets that we want to expand into and fortunately our leader on the acquisition side buzz cooper this is his second acquisition with the seller of the property so it could be that we may not be with eastern metal supply but we could have an opportunity with one of their other companies that they want to do a sale leaseback on craig kucera b riley fbr analyst okay great thanks robert cutlip president thanks craig david gladstone chairman and chief executive officer okay operator thank you i m not showing david gladstone chairman and chief executive officer are there questions operator i m not showing any further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back over to david gladstone for any further remarks david

robert c rowe president and chief executive officer good afternoon thank you for joining us and we re calling in from our sioux falls office where the temperatures have rocketed up over the last couple of hours and it s now a positive 2 degrees fahrenheit well i ll start as always with some recent highlights net income for 2019 was 202 1 million that s a 5 1 million or 2 6 increase compared to last year diluted eps was 3 98 a 0 06 or 1 5 increase compared to last year non gaap adjusted eps was 3 42 and that s a 0 03 or a 9 increase compared to 2018 the board declared a quarterly dividend of 0 60 per share that s a 4 3 increase and that s payable march 31st to shareholders of record as of march 13th late last year we issued a carbon reduction vision for our electric portfolio in montana we re targeting a 90 reduction in carbon intensity by 2045 starting from a 2010 baseline in december we also announced our transaction to acquire an incremental 25 or 185 megawatts of colstrip unit 4 from puget sound energy for 1 in february just this month we filed a request for approval of the colstrip acquisition with the montana commission in december that commission the montana commission issued a final order approving our electric rate case settlement and this month we ve also issued an all source competitive solicitation or request for proposals for up to 220 megawatts of peaking and flexible capacity to be available for commercial operation in early 2023 and with that i ll turn it over to our cfo brian bird to walk through our financial results brian b bird chief financial officer thanks bob on slide 4 shows our summary of financial results the takeaway there as bob talked about net income 202 1 million a 5 1 million or 2 6 improvement on a year over year basis again on the details but generally the 2 3 improvement in gross margin that increase was a higher increase than our operating expenses of about 1 resulting in operating income improvement about 4 that ultimately drove our good results for the year on a year over year basis turning to slide 5 in terms of gross margin gross margin of 939 9 million a 20 8 million improvement or 2 3 if you look into the major drivers there i would talk about two things that really from 2018 the tax cuts and jobs act impact benefit this year 22 1 million versus the 18 amount that s offset also with a better electric qualifying facilities liability adjustment in 2018 so kind of taking those two offsetting one another what really drove the results to a great extent we had good retail volumes on the gas side and electric retail volumes we also saw some benefit from our rate increased 4 4 million this year for a nine month period an improvement in our electric supply cost recovery offsetting that to degree we did see some reduction in our electric transmission revenues during the year and also stepped out our natural gas production rates that total change in gross margin those items that impact net income was 20 2 million in addition things that flow through trackers like property tax and production tax credits netted to a 0 6 million increase in gross margin again netting to a total of 20 8 million increase in gross margin moving forward to weather on page 6 upper right just to summarize we did estimate overall favorable weather in 19 resulted in a 7 3 million pre tax benefit as compared to normal and a 6 million benefit compared to 2018 the calendar months and the weather maps for reach month were very very telling all of the favorable weather benefit for the year really came in the first quarter really cold february and march helped drive the favorable results it really impacted the gas side of our business when you look at the second and third quarter we didn t have much cooling load at all a matter of fact it s net unfavorable weather if you will during that time period and then the fourth quarter though october was cold it certainly didn t do enough to offset a pretty mild december and so again net net the first quarter drove our favorable weather results for the year moving on to page 7 in terms of operating expenses operating expenses as a total 663 million up 10 1 million or 1 5 so keeping operating expenses low the two primary benefits there is property taxes appeared to level off certainly level up in 19 we hope to see that as a trend going forward certainly no certainty of that but certainly a good step in the right direction to see those leveling off of 0 6 million or 0 4 also the depreciation depletion actually down 1 6 million or down approximately 1 the reason there being obviously we ve had increased depreciation as we continue to invest in our assets but the 9 million improvement in depreciation rates as a result of the rate case settlement as the primary driver for the reduction on a net basis in in terms of operating general administrative expenses we ve shared in the past that we did and opened the first strings a bit if you will from on our expenses we did note throughout the year we are going to be spending more on hazard trees and made really good progress on that during the year we did through both our generation and our t d business increased maintenance expenses across the board labor was up a bit during the year and then legal technology and benefits other primary increases in og a you may note that last quarter on a year to date basis we did have a quite a big large other there were questions associated with that we did in the fourth quarter break that out a bit more so people could see that that change there in those items impacting net income from an og a perspective 17 3 million when you take a look at items that certainly are in the og a category but are offset elsewhere in the p l 7 8 million pension some operating expenses recover to trackers and then 2 3 million in non employee directors deferred comp both the pension and deferred comp item you ll see in a moment offset in other income those changes were a decreased og a of 6 2 million for a net increase in og a of 11 1 million on the next page 8 operating income 276 9 million up 10 6 million or 4 below that interest expense up primarily due to higher borrowings to 3 1 million other income as i just spoke the main decrease is really netting the pension item and the deferred comp item i just spoke to in og a but also that was also partly offset by 1 6 million a higher capitalization of afudc the net there that from an income before tax of 182 2 million 3 9 million increase or 2 2 and then following that we did have a slightly higher income tax benefit on a year over year basis i ll speak to that in a moment to explain that difference giving to the net income i spoke earlier of 5 1 million improvement on page 9 income tax itself the two biggest drivers we had a release of an unrecognized tax benefit in 2019 of 22 8 million that was offset by the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act excess deferred taxes in 2018 of 19 8 million that 3 million difference is the primary difference other things like the slight improvement in pre tax income also drove the net result of an income tax benefit incremental benefit of 1 2 million for the year moving onto the balance sheet that much to really say here on page 10 obviously continue to see improvement in shareholders equity but ratio of debt to total capitalization continued to see a downward trend as we continue to shore up our credit metrics and always keyed in on our ffo to debt try and make sure we maintain our bbb flat unsecured credit ratings moving onto the cash flow statement on page 11 we did see a fall off in cash provided by operating activities of approximately 85 million on a year over year basis in the red box to the right we really identify five things that drove that we did have an under selection under collection of supply cost during the year not only to be a higher supply costs but our method now to collecting those are on an annual basis versus a monthly basis and as a result of the pcam settlement that add some aspects to do with it as well but that under supply we are now collecting in 2020 so we do expect to see a bit better cash flow certainly on a year over year basis the tax cuts and jobs act we had that settlement that we had in 18 actual refunds to customers didn t start occurring until into 19 there is the 20 5 million there and then the change year over year in terms of people providing deposits for generation interconnections was actually net refund 22 1 million for the year those are the three biggest drivers of the 85 3 million moving forward on to page 12 from an adjusted non gaap earnings perspective i think people who follow the company come to understand this page on the far to the far left to the far right really is the gaap numbers for 19 and far right gaap for 18 and then we work toward a non gaap numbers for both 19 and 18 the middle and the rest you can compare those starting from the far left diluted eps of 3 98 on a gaap basis we had two adjustments this year we took out 0 11 of favorable weather and we backed out 0 45 associated with the unrecognized tax benefit getting us to 3 42 on a relative on a comparison basis last year s gaap number in 18 392 we have three items that we backed out of that number 0 02 of favorable weather 0 26 associated with qf liability adjustment 0 25 associated with tcja netting to a 339 3 39 non gaap eps in the 2018 a 0 03 improvement or just under 1 in the comparing the middle columns through the p l gross margin up about 3 also operating expense is up about 3 even though property taxes and depreciation actually depreciate slightly down we did have a higher amount in og a and we planned to spend more we talked about hazard trees we talked about some other categories of incremental spend we wanted to have in 19 that though considering that improvement in gross margin increase in operating expenses at 2 8 improvement in operating income and net ultimately in a 2 2 increase in net income on a non gaap moving forward to page 13 diluted earnings per share over this time period you see it from both a gaap perspective and a non gaap perspective on a non gaap basis our eps has grown on an average over 5 from 2013 to 2019 we ll tell you that we do also show in 2020 column our guidance range of 3 45 to 3 60 per diluted share we do note here really the three assumptions normal weather we give you a consolidated income tax rate of 2 benefit to 3 tax increase based upon pre tax income and then diluted shares outstanding of 50 9 million lastly regarding our 6 to 9 total return long term look one thing i would mention here is we do see our capital spend now getting up in 2020 in 2021 to 400 million should be able to sustain that level on a going forward basis i d expect this to move toward the middle of that 6 to 9 total return total share of the return range again assuming reasonable recovery moving forward 2019 non gaap to 2020 eps bridge to the right i mentioned the 3 45 to 3 60 range how do we get there starting at 3 40 to 3 42 share we show kind of some low and high points to get to that range what are some of the drivers on gross margin certainly we expect the 1 plus of organic growth we expect higher industrial and commercial loads we expect some improvement in transmission revenues we are and we expect to get a full year benefit from the rate case and then lastly we had a wet year from an irrigation perspective in 19 we expect to see some improvement in irrigation revenues in 2020 that should help on the gross margin side and og a expense decreases really across the board we re looking at the business trying to maintain cost control in 2020 after kind of as i said releasing some of the first strings in 19 certainly tightening up here again in 20 we ve made great progress on hazard trees in 19 expect to spend a little lees in that category in 2020 and that range of 0 11 to 0 14 those are the two big drivers for improvement between gross margin increase and og a decrease thinking property tax depreciation and interest expense for a growing company we expect to see those it each increasing year over year other income with the south dakota generation and increased capital spend we ll speak to in a moment we re expecting a bit more afudc on a year over year basis and lastly we continue to focus on repairs tax deductions and expected incremental tax benefit associated with that that nets us to 3 45 to 3 63 with up to a range from zero to 0 03 of potential dilution from equity needs likely late 2020 to possibly early 2021 we see a net range of 3 45 to 3 60 when take in consideration our mid point of that a 3 53 when you look at the dividend we announced today and annualize that that s 2 40 if you compare that to 2 40 to the midpoint of the range or just provide a 3 53 that s about a 68 dividend payout lastly on this page i ll speak to taxes so it s good news and regarding that we did expect to be going through our nols in 2020 now that s 2021 and as a result of pushing that back a year with ami credits and ptc credits being available now into 2023 that used to be 2022 to reduce cash taxes and lastly we anticipate our effective tax rate to reach approximately 10 by 2023 and with that i ll pass back to bob robert c rowe president and chief executive officer thanks brian i ll start with a couple of words about our carbon statement in montana and as you know that s targeted 90 reduction in carbon intensity by 2045 as compared to a 2010 baseline in the baseline is the result of effectively that s been colstrip unit 4 was able to be fully dedicated to serve our customers the first resource that we had in montana after going through deregulation and divestiture of the montana power days as you know we are already over 60 carbon free on a delivered basis in montana and that compares to 28 average nationwide this is a montana specific statement although it s notable that in south dakota we are i think about 32 carbon free right now we refer to this is really no bs kind of a carbon statements are not a lot of qualifications to it it s driven by continued renewables coming on an actually very soon we ll have more wind on our montana system then we have hydro and we ll have more wind or hydro and then we have colstrip even after we close on the additional acquisition at colstrip energy efficiency continues to be important thermal resources will be very important in meeting our customers demands in montana dispatchable resources but the frequency the range of dispatch at this point to diminish as other resources come online toward the end of the decade we expect there are thermal resources that will be retired so this is a glide path it s also worth noting that this really is linked to the same modeling assumptions as in our resource plan and just like the resource plan this will be updated on a regular basis and that will allow us to capture changes in economics changes in technology changes in public policy one of the things i m particularly excited about that will help us achieve this vision is working with a group of communities that have their own sustainability goals sustainability programs in montana to help them craft and implement solutions that makes sense for them while also recognizing our legal obligations to all of our customers that will be a great opportunity to work directly with our customers turning then to the announced acquisition of 25 of colstrip unit 4 on december 9th we executed a purchase and sale agreement to acquire puget sound energy s 25 ownership in unit 4 it s 185 megawatts that would bring our total ownership at colstrip to 407 megawatts or 55 of unit 4 and as i mentioned even without additional acquisition we will have both more hydro and more wind on our system brand deep into his pockets and find a 1 to pay for the resource very importantly puget sound will retain responsibility for its current pro rata ownership share for environmental of pension liabilities as well as for ultimate closing costs in tandem we will enter into a purchase power agreement under which we will sell 90 megawatts back to puget for five years indexed to the mid sea index but with a floor of costs and our proposal is to essentially put the profits from that ppa into a trust to pre fund pretty meaningful down payment on an eventual closing costs for unit for us we think that s far sighted and responsible recognizing that all assets do have useful lives we filed for approval of the transaction in its various parts with the montana commission they are being responsible and setting a schedule interventions are due in the first few days march and we certainly don t see any reason why the transaction couldn t be reviewed and approved by the end of the year which we think is an important and being able to implement the elements of the proposal and start achieving those benefits for our customers and as you know we are uniquely exposed to prices in the western power market 46 reserve margin deficit at peak concerns about that meaning deep requirements are now a primary focus in western united states and even sharper focus in the pacific northwest and an acute focus in our montana operation again because in part of the legacy of supply new regulation so i mean this is very important and addressing about a quarter of our customers exposure to peak turning onto the south dakota and the montana electric plants first south dakota it s been a straightforward and efficient process we published our plan in the fall of 2018 really focused on modernizing our fleet to address reliability flexibility and particularly to maintain our compliance with southwest power pool requirements to be able to participate on behalf of our customers as effectively as possible in spp so we identified 90 megawatts of existing generation that should be retired and replaced over the next 10 years but we were running out of tecate then on april 15th 2019 we issued a request for proposals for 60 megawatts of flexible capacity resources to begin serving our south dakota customers by the end of 2021 is a very robust process again administered by a third party lots of interest in the process a good variety of submissions as a result of the competitive process we do expect to construct and own natural gas fired reciprocal reciprocating internal combustion engines or rice units at a brownfield site in huron and then dependent on manufacturer selection we anticipate between 55 megawatts and 60 megawatts of new capacity should be online by late 2021 at a total investment of about 80 million and the election proposal is subject to execution of construction contracts and then obtaining the applicable environmental and construction permits so that south dakota we re very excited to see that move forward turning to the montana plan there the focus was on developing resources that will address the really dramatically changing energy landscape in montana and in the west to meet our customers needs in a reliable and in affordable fashion as i referenced just a moment ago we are severely exposed at peak right now we re about 630 megawatts short of our peak needs and that s in a market in which traditional resources are shuttering and original market that isn t where providers are and planners are increasingly concerned about loss of loan probability in the not terribly distant future right now we are at market on behalf of our customers and being at market at peak with a skinny set of resources is not a very good place to be for our customers we forecast that our portfolio will be about 725 megawatts short in just five years considering expiring contracts and then just very modest increase in customer demand so this month we ve issued a competitive all source rfp for up to 280 megawatts of flexible peaking capacity to be available for commercial operation in early 2023 as the node indicates the rfp is opened to all types of resources provided that they can meet our needs for peak and flexible capacity there will be an independent evaluator to administer and then to evaluate proposals and the successful project or projects should be selected by the first quarter of next year and then we expect to kind of wash rinse and repeat and run a subsequent process in a future year turning to some other matters on the regulatory front as you know in december the commission issued a final order most importantly approving the electric rate case settlement in our montana case effective april 1st 2019 and that would result in an annual increase to electric revenue of about 6 5 million based on a 9 65 roe and the capital structure as we had proposed and then a 9 3 million decrease in depreciation expenses several parties have filed petitions for reconsideration of various parts of the order particularly a request for reconsideration by the montana consumer council concerning the decoupling or infrastructure funding mechanism that had been proposed by natural resources defense council and that we re very strongly supported we expect that the request for reconsideration will be acted on in the first quarter parallel in may of last year we submitted a filing to ferc for our montana transmission assets in june ferc issued an order accepting the filing granting interim rates effective july 1st of course subject to refund and then establishing settlement procedures and terminating our related tax cuts and jobs act filing settlement judge has been appointed and then settlement negotiations and conferences are active we expect to submit a compliance filing with the montana commission based upon eventual resolution of the ferc case with an adjustment and proposed credit back to our montana retail rates we re continuing to invest in our transmission and distribution infrastructure and this has been sometimes this work is not as visible but is incredibly important fulfilling our responsibilities to our customers that includes continuing work on a comprehensive staged approach to infrastructure addressing safety capacity reliability really modernizing the system we ve been talking about that our progress along those lines actually since i ve been at northwestern on the natural gas side pipeline investments or integrity verification pipeline and hazardous materials on a lot of good work there and then grid modernization continues to be our focus we d like to talk about deployment have the speed to value learning what works and then making decisions that are sensible for our system and for our customers one of the neat things actually just over the last couple of weeks we ve been on a multi year process to create a distribution operation control center and that started with geo coding elements in the field acquiring spectrum attaching communications to devices in the field that went live just in the last couple of weeks in the days after go live we had wins in montana actually had top of loan peak at big sky that hit 155 miles now we had several hundred outages it was truly the most challenging shake down crews that the distribution operations center could have had they are folks in customer care and then particularly our people in the field all this did an extraordinary job the functionality of the doc is going to continue to improve increase over the next several years as we continue to turn on more technology and make investments there but a couple of minutes on that just because it s an example of how investments that we consider to be very important but that can be invisible to our customers ultimately really make a huge huge difference as you know we re planning to enter the western energy imbalance market in april of 2021 based on our experience in the southwest power pool out of south dakota that will produce some real benefits for our montana customers we ll allow more efficient use of intermittent resources greater power grid reliability but then circling back to the montana rfp we have to have resources to be able to participate in that market as we ve talked about before we continue to monitor costs including labor benefits property tax valuations we consider ourselves i think objectively to be one of the most efficient companies in our peer group and really and post up well on most measures against companies larger than us last thing i ll draw your attention to is our capital investment forecast and what you see here over a five year period is 1 8 billion of total capital we anticipate financing this with a combination of cash flows from operations aided by nols through 2021 first mortgage bonds equity issuances based on what we know now any equity issuance would be late 2020 early 2021 and would be size to maintain and predict and protect our current credit ratings the significant potential significant capital investments that are not in these projections or negative regulatory actions could necessitate additional equity just a couple of things to highlight based on the results of the south dakota rfp this does include 80 million of incremental investment for our south dakota generation in 2020 and 2021 but does not include any investment identified it for generation capacity in montana and those depending on the results of an rfp could be in excess of 200 million over the next five years one thing i would highlight as you ve heard us say before as we work through any five year period we identify more projects that are important to serve our customers and indeed if you just look at the period 2020 through 2023 in this bar graph they re about actually 222 million of investment more than you would have seen last year and that s a result of the additional 80 million in generation in south dakota also an important montana electric transmission initiative some additional funding in montana ami gas transmission work in montana work at a billings substation ongoing upgrades to the hydro system and then like so many other utilities the investment in the sap s4 hana project so the point being that as you work through the five years again you identify the work that s most valuable and important to continuing to be able to serve our customers with that we are open for questions questions and answers operator thank you we ll take our first question from mike weinstein with credit suisse mike weinstein credit suisse analyst hi bob brian brian b bird chief financial officer hey mike mike weinstein credit suisse analyst hey could you talk a little bit more about why the rfp i guess final decision would be in the first quarter of 2021 you know what are the what s the extra i guess time required for that robert c rowe president and chief executive officer it s going to be a very thorough process or through the pre qualification process there will probably be several stages of evaluation so we believe in our supply folks most importantly believe that s a realistic and prudent schedule brian b bird chief financial officer yes our expectation is that by this call next year we d be giving you an outcome mike weinstein credit suisse analyst got you and have there been any other changes to the process there or is it the same process just seeing more time with it robert c rowe president and chief executive officer we are following the process outlined in legislation passed last year in montana so that does include several steps that otherwise we wouldn t have and the legislation actually isn t in place but for example there we filed the rfp with the commission before releasing it for submission so that s one extra step that does come in mind under the statute that we ll be taking effect this year mike weinstein credit suisse analyst right and i mean is the delay coming from you guys you initiate you re saying that you need more time it s not that somebody else is saying they need more time like the legislature or the commission itself or robert c rowe president and chief executive officer no i would not i did use the word delay at all this as a reasonable schedule to work through brian b bird chief financial officer we we might have been aggressive on the front end in terms of fully understanding the time period but working with the independent party revised our time period mike weinstein credit suisse analyst okay got it hey i was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about the energy imbalance market i think bob you mentioned that the additional assets are required to join that and you re planning on joining in next year is there any timeline that you have for additional assets that might need to be built i mean what are we talking about here is it any significant investments that are required robert c rowe president and chief executive officer those would be the assets that come out of the rfp mike weinstein credit suisse analyst okay so you need to see that before the before you can join robert c rowe president and chief executive officer no we re actively going through the steps to join right now it s a very significant undertaking to get in place all the systems hardware software people to be able to participate in the market and that s a joint undertaking of our transmission department and our supply department mike weinstein credit suisse analyst any brian b bird chief financial officer mike i just add the capacity that we plan to build through 2025 certainly meets our needs from an im perspective we are others obviously through ppa depending on the outcome of rfps but anything we don t have during the time that we re in ami up until until the end of 2025 we ll have to enter into contracts in order to achieve that mike weinstein credit suisse analyst got it are there any transmission assets required then you ll be built or any additional upgrades there robert c rowe president and chief executive officer not specifically for this i mentioned we do have a couple of transmission project under way mike weinstein credit suisse analyst right all right thank you robert c rowe president and chief executive officer thank you brian b bird chief financial officer thanks mike operator we ll take our next question from julien dumoulin smith with bank of america julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey team how are you brian bob robert c rowe president and chief executive officer julien how are you julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst can you hear me robert c rowe president and chief executive officer yes julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst good pleasure absolutely good to hear from you so just following up on where mike was taking a second ago timing of equity here you specifically talked about this upside 200 million you also put in the slides here 2020 2021 are you waiting to get some clarity about that process before kind of the deciding definitively on equity needs and also when you talk about equity here is that a definitive block equity or you think about like an atm process or something like that brian b bird chief financial officer i put two answers to your first question bob walk through the 222 million of incremental capital from the last time we talk from the slide and when i talked about it on the last call i was specifically talking to the 80 million not the full 222 and talked about having a need the latter half of 2020 or into 2021 that s still the case but again we just need to size that debt according to needs and from a rating agency perspective again ffo to debt perspective so that s and really answering your first question your second question we ve used atms in the past like them that s certainly a possibility but we ll evaluate other options as well julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst right so basically the whatever comes out of this current process in montana that would be incremental later on as you say in the slides so that s not going to dictate the timing whether 20 or to early 21 right etc brian b bird chief financial officer no that s a that s a fair point julien i think we ll need some equity prior to it outcome i think in terms of certainly building out anything if we re fortunate enough to be successful in montana that would be certainly beyond the end of 2020 early 2021 time period so that might be hopefully that s an incremental amount of equity we re raising at sometime in the future beyond it julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it excellent and then brian did you say you expect to move to the middle of the 6 to 9 tsr range and then to the extent which i heard that right can you clarify how you think about like a base year or anything like that sorry i don t mean to read more into it than is necessary but i also heard it so i just want to make sure i heard it right here brian b bird chief financial officer i appreciate you gave me an opportunity to clarify it again i the main thing here is we in 2020 and 2021 we re at we re now at about 400 million of capital investment if we re able to sustain that type of increase if you will to 400 every year i think you d see our eps growth rate improve again assuming reasonable recovery and thus you d see eps plus a dividend yield moving us more to the center of that 6 to 9 range is that make sense julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst excellent absolutely no thank you i appreciate it that s important sorry quick last little detail here maybe this is a bob question when you think about colstrip and the various owners how do you think about consolidating up further your ownership in that plants beyond what s contemplated today broad based robert c rowe president and chief executive officer through the rfp we are looking for flexible dispatchable capacity that would complement our other resources including the psc portion of colstrip so i think what we re looking for again is something that would in terms of serving our retail customers something that would be complementary with a big emphasis on flexibility dispatchability particularly on an intra hour basis and then beyond that i ll just see what s proposed in the rfp julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay is that differently you don t have a need for baseload coal like colstrip robert c rowe president and chief executive officer i m comfortable with what we ve acquired and beyond that we ll just see what comes in the rfp but our focus is flexibility dispatchability and risk management i would add julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst absolutely thank you very much for the clarification robert c rowe president and chief executive officer thank you operator we ll take our next question from shar pourreza with guggenheim partners shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst hey guys robert c rowe president and chief executive officer shar how are you doing shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst not good not too bad let me can i just follow up on julien s question i guess putting in a different way if you are presented with a similar structure as you received with puget would you take on additional interest in colstrip especially as the partners kind of decarbonize robert c rowe president and chief executive officer what i would shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst can you hear me brian b bird chief financial officer yes robert c rowe president and chief executive officer and as we re focused on resources that are complementary to the resources we have now in terms of ability to be flexible operate on an intra hour basis and then manage to diversify our risk as well and then if you can read into that if you like shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst okay got it and then obviously you did you ve got the colstrip deal you issued the rfp for additional generation any sense on sort of the timing and the composition of the next rfp as you think about the duration of your peaking needs robert c rowe president and chief executive officer no i think we ll work through this rfp see what comes out the other end focus on implementing that and based on conditions at that time which will be obviously different in terms of size of the need the economics the technology that s available but given the exposure that our customers have right now i don t think we can wait terribly long the first thing is we get through this process whenever the results are get those resources engaged to serve our customers shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst got it and then lastly it s helpful is you sort of highlighted the complaint around the fcrm pilot program is there any just remind us if there is a statutory deadline i know you expect a decision but is there a statutory deadline for montana psc to issue a decision on the petitions and then brian this is maybe a little bit for you even if you sort of get a scenario where there is a 25 basis point reduction in the earnings and the roe is there sort of an earnings impact given the fact that you do under earn in montana brian b bird chief financial officer yes first of all i think just to clarify that we spoke about earlier i think just the mcc is the only party that as far reconsideration associated with the fcrm and the 25 basis point everyone else i shouldn t say everywhere else but most parties it s certainly comment on that certainly support moving forward that without any impact on the roe and we hope that s where the commission will come down again in that regard so i m pretty confident we ll get there but we ll see i think the other thing i d say is it would be an impact of course to our earnings and regardless if we re earning or under earning i think it s going to have an impact if in fact we re deemed in anyway not an roe perspective and so i just leave it at that shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst got it got it i m sorry robert c rowe president and chief executive officer so is the proposal i thought was maybe the best decoupling our fixed cost proposal i ve seen anywhere and was an extremely forward looking step by the montana commission i think that testimony really eviscerated any kind of an argument for an roe adjustment but then beyond that said if you really think this is something to look at that s something that can be evaluated as part of the subsequent study so i certainly hope the commission sticks to its guns and there were a number of very good responsive fleeting from other interveners opposing the request for reconsideration shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst got it thanks guys that was helpful brian b bird chief financial officer i think one thing too in terms of the timing i think we re going to need to get an outcome pretty soon on that because we re supposed to implement that program by july 1 and so we hope to hear something relatively soon on that robert c rowe president and chief executive officer just one more little footnote following on to implementation of the order there was also good action by the commission approving what we re referring to is our green pricing stipulation so bobby scrapple our vice president for customer care and quite a good group of stakeholders are actively working on approaches to develop green products that our customers actually want to buy and we think that s very responsive to what we re hearing from both large and small customers and from some of our cities operator we ll take our next question from jonathan reeder with wells fargo jonathan reeder wells fargo securities analyst hey good afternoon gentlemen just kind of following up on that comment there bob in your prepared remarks it kind of sounded like in the rfp based on some of the desire for kind of green products that we might expect some renewables to maybe clear this first rfp i mean is that kind of fair robert c rowe president and chief executive officer very honestly we don t know what will come out the other end and what will ultimately be expected given the number of parties who are bidding in i expect we ll see some real diversity in proposals and as we think about our resource needs we think about it really as a pyramid and that s the base long duration dispatchable resources and then building up the pyramid dispatchable resource at a shorter duration so that potentially creates an opportunity to acquire some diverse resources through the process but the foundational need is going to really be long duration dispatchable resources jonathan reeder wells fargo securities analyst okay that s helpful and then brian just to confirm the ffo to debt ratio that you guys still target that s 15 brian b bird chief financial officer we target 15 i think the clearing is really 14 we d like to have some cushion in our ffo to debt jonathan reeder wells fargo securities analyst okay and then lastly the higher p d capex spend that s now in your budget how does that impact the potential cadence of rate case filings as well as any rate affordability concerns for your customers brian b bird chief financial officer great question jonathan i think twofold we ll obviously as that spend and that was a 223 million that bob talked about that s spread across those four years i would say this it could move things accelerate things a little quicker as said in the past that we expect to file bit more frequently certainly than we have in the past and we ll let you know that in april in terms of our timeline if you will at least for 2020 if there s any filings i think the other thing too is we expect during this time period particularly when we get into eim that s going to help reduce any bill headwind in any time we think about our long range plans we re trying to increase the customers at less than inflation robert c rowe president and chief executive officer the one thing i d add to that is of the 222 million part of it is south dakota part of its montana part of its electric part of its gas so on any one business segment the increased capital is just that much more modest jonathan reeder wells fargo securities analyst yes no i would like you guys to kind of spread it across the field pretty well so okay thanks so much that s all for me brian b bird chief financial officer thanks jonathan operator we ll take our next question from vedula murti with avon capital vedula murti avon capital analyst good afternoon brian b bird chief financial officer good afternoon robert c rowe president and chief executive officer good afternoon vedula murti avon capital analyst in terms of the pending rfp here in montana do you have is there a rate in the past that it s been difficult for you to be able to come up with self on proposals that managed to be able to effectively compete or be able to cross the finish line with the montana psc and the independent evaluator getting tough dakota you were able with the brownfield site to have a unique situation where it actually did work that way in this current rfp do you have any particular new opportunities or advantages that could produce perhaps a better outcome or the likelihood of a self on option more so than maybe it s been then has been in the past robert c rowe president and chief executive officer could you point me to the rfp you re referring to i m kind of a blank vedula murti avon capital analyst the once in the past where you wanted to have your self owned options and you haven t been able to get the psc or whoever to validate having your self owned phone options in montana robert c rowe president and chief executive officer i truly can t think of an example what i wonder if you re referring to coming out of the 2015 plan we undertook an rfp and we would drew it because of noise at the commission really unrelated if you recall that was when commissioner at the time came up with a reasonable idea that qf contracts ought to be limited to 15 years but that under a notion of symmetry resources coming out of the rfp whether owned by us or anybody else also ought to be limited to a 15 year period so as a result of that separate action by the commission we ultimately ended up withdrawing the rfp because we requested 20 year proposals i wonder could that be what you re thinking of vedula murti avon capital analyst yes perhaps in this case i guess maybe just maybe ask a little differently then given your success in south dakota are there do you feel like in this new process or things that you have advantages in terms of what you will be able to propose that may perhaps increase the probability of being successful at least in terms of part of solicitation in addition does the colstrip acquisition per dollar actually perhaps influence at all you know the self own viewpoint given you re not going to be able to fine tune too much more capacity for dollar robert c rowe president and chief executive officer certainly i agree with that statement i think we will participate in the rfp obviously we think we are good at building and operating resources and we think there are real customer benefits to having us do that so we re going to participate but the proposals from all parties will be evaluated on a neutral basis by a third party really through a blind process in terms of relationship to colstrip either the relationship i would see is that we did at least defer about a quarter of our customers exposure through that very cost effective transaction we think that was the right thing to do for our customers and also we think that was a pretty progressive move in terms of thinking about eventual closing costs and creating a situation where the ultimate decision about disposition of unit 4 is going to be based either on the economics at that unit or on a public policy decision in montana and not somewhere on the coast but i beyond that i really don t see a relationship between colstrip and the rfp brian do you say brian b bird chief financial officer no i think we obviously know the service territory that we operate in and have built resources and ask for pre approval and received approval on resources we put into our portfolio in the past and we plan to compete that s all i guess i d add bob vedula murti avon capital analyst okay and i want to make sure i clarify one thing that this as julien asked the question in terms of you know when you re running and make sure i understand this probably the 400 if you were to sustain a 400 million capital expenditure level when we re talking about the midpoint of the 6 to 9 given that you re at a 3 yield the inference is that the 400 million cap at a 400 million capex run rate but that would imply about a 4 5 earnings cagr as part of that as part of that as your 6 to 9 is that fair brian b bird chief financial officer that is the approximate math if you use that 3 flat dividend yield correct and i think the reason for sharing that is historically we have said in the past in light of the lower growth and investment in some of the outcomes we had been receiving we expect it to be in the lower end of that 6 to 9 range that we re certainly pleased in terms of being able to invest capital including the 80 million that we re investing in south dakota and bob pointed out projects that we throughout our service territories both electric and gas certainly to our customers benefit but that higher level of investment allow us to move up within that range vedula murti avon capital analyst and also to clarify also the equity question given the timing you laid out toward early 2021 which also lines up with the outcome of the rfp process in montana is there any reason not to simply wait to find out what that outcome is in terms of figuring out whether it d be an atm program or maybe whatever the sizing is and that type of thing as opposed and with the agencies do you feel like you have time to perpetuate that if you have an idea of what the outcome is brian b bird chief financial officer yes i think it s a fair question i think obviously one of the benefits of an atm program you could size that if in fact you let s say you weighted into the first quarter and you knew an outcome from that you could certainly size that and utilize that over time it s certainly something to think about we just wanted to make sure we gave people the impression of the timing that around an equity raise and so something certain to think about vedula vedula murti avon capital analyst okay and just in terms if we re running at a 400 million capex program given your cash flow profile in order to keep maintain a balanced capital structure should we be thinking at that point in time that something in the 100 million to 200 million kind of area is what would be required to maintain the capital structure brian b bird chief financial officer vedula i think people all run their various models and i think they probably have in their miles on ffo to debt calculation for us that s what we re really trying to get you to do is from your perspective in a modeling perspective for you to size that equity we re not going to provide you what we believe that is at this point in time vedula murti avon capital analyst all right thank you operator we ll take our next question from brian russo with sidoti brian russo sidoti company analyst hi good afternoon brian b bird chief financial officer hey brian brian russo sidoti company analyst hey just on slide 38 the rate base and authorized returns just remind us your thought process here you re currently earning on 3 4 billion of rate base but your actual estimated rate base if you kind of true it up outside the historical test years is 3 8 billion is that the way to look at so that delta will that was roughly 400 million will be need to be recovered in future rate cases brian b bird chief financial officer that s correct the 3 8 million is a future rate case perspective if it all happened on a particular date today we would be earning on the 3 8 million 7 3 million currently earning on the 3 4 million today brian russo sidoti company analyst okay so and the timing of these upcoming rate cases is to be determined and like you said maybe after your first quarter call in april brian b bird chief financial officer that s when we give you an indication what we plan to do in 2020 brian russo sidoti company analyst and in south dakota for recovery of the peaker plant are you going to pursue the general rate case route or file for a tracking mechanism brian b bird chief financial officer yes we re going to pursue that the rate case brian i think the timing of that will determine whether we can get a known and measurable adjustments so the timing of that will also require us to have some conversation with the commission and regardless while we re making an investment in that and we i said we don t have a rate case we certainly would have afudc during that time period brian russo sidoti company analyst okay so would this be like a one off rate case or would you seek recovery of the difference between 606 6 million and 557 3 million which was authorized back in december of 15 million plus the 80 million for the peaker is that at a brian b bird chief financial officer i think it would be all in it would be all in and and potentially if it was primarily as you can see from the schedule you re looking at it s primarily on the electric side where we have that need and obviously the generation units on the electric side so if we have a rate case from a south dakota electric perspective we re not just going to do the 80 million of investment in the plants it s going to be for all of our south dakota electric business brian russo sidoti company analyst got it and then just to clarify remind us the peaker plant in south dakota being built in huron south dakota was that is that at an existing generation facility or is it just that some sort of industrial site that has easier access to transmission brian b bird chief financial officer that is our site site brian russo sidoti company analyst it s your site okay got it brian b bird chief financial officer correct brian russo sidoti company analyst thank you very much brian b bird chief financial officer thanks brian operator we have no more questions in the queue at this time robert c rowe president and chief executive officer okay great thank you all very much for your interest and support we ll see quite a few

call is being recorded a replay of the call will be available on our website for two weeks following the call i m now pleased to turn the call over to cris gaut our chief executive officer c christopher gaut chief executive officer thanks bill and by the way we are welcoming bill austin back to forum he is now our vp of corporate development and investor relations good morning everyone when i assumed the role of ceo a little over one year ago i laid out a plan that would focus on three things and those are generating strong free cash flow to reduce net debt emphasizing our winning products to improve on our market position and third improving operating and cost efficiency 2019 was certainly a challenging year for our industry and for the oilfield equipment sector however i believe our team has done an admirable job on these objectives i would like to report on our 2019 progress in each of these areas forum generated 90 million of free cash flow during the year representing a greater than 70 annualized free cash flow yield on our current equity market capitalization and a greater than 120 conversion rate of ebitda to cash over the year we reduced our net debt by 130 million through a combination of strong free cash flow and divestitures of noncore assets we ended the year with net debt of 342 million 58 million of cash from the balance sheet and an undrawn revolver the second objective is focusing on our winning products which are those that provide critical value to our customers and remain in high demand even in a constrained spending environment and secondly have strong brand recognition and margin potential now more than ever our customers are demanding products that enable them to achieve greater efficiencies we expect this trend to continue as the industry focuses on improving returns as a result we are expanding and improving our highly engineered products that outperform the competition in areas like artificial lift intervention and hydraulic fracturing these products create value for our customers by reducing the cost of setup and cycle time at the well site increasing the effectiveness of our customers assets and even increasing the oil production rate we fully expect market interest for these products to be high during 2020 despite reluctance by our customers to spend let me give you an example of how this focus on winning products is working for us we have developed a suite of products in the artificial lift area that significantly improve the operating life of downhole electric submersible pumps by addressing problems with solids and gas in the production stream these high margin products we have developed deliver real value for the operator in terms of reduced lease operating expense less downtime and better production rates sales of these artificial lift products increased each quarter during 2019 and are now up over 50 since the fourth quarter of 2018 regarding the third objective improving operating and cost efficiency we made significant strides in 2019 by reducing our cost structure some examples include consolidating facilities removing layers of management reducing professional fees and generally limiting discretionary spending this has resulted in a 20 reduction in sg a in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year in addition we have implemented process efficiencies that have reduced our direct costs which lyle will be talking about in a few minutes continued progress on these three objectives will set the company up for long term success as we look ahead we expect a low level of customer activity and great reluctance to spend that we saw in the fourth quarter to continue in the first quarter of 2020 in addition concerns about the coronavirus and its potential impact on the chinese and global economy are creating uncertainty about the demand for oil which would have implications for the demand of forum s products as a result for the first quarter of 2020 we expect our ebitda to be approximately flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 but with some downside exposure to this forecast if there is not a fairly swift recovery in china from the coronavirus oilfield activity is off to a slow start in 2020 due to low oil and gas prices and constrained spending budgets in subsequent quarters we expect international activity to accelerate and cannibalization and destocking in north american market to run its course as drilling and completion activity stabilizes this will drive improved orders and revenue for forum over the course of the year again this forecast is subject to a recovery of the chinese economy fairly soon on that basis we expect our full year 2020 ebitda to be in the range of 60 million to 70 million given our capital light business model and continued conversion of excess inventory into cash we expect a very high rate of conversion of ebitda to cash to continue in 2020 regardless to the environment we will manage forum for the market as it exists and focus on our key objectives now let me ask pablo to take you through our results and financial position pablo pablo g mercado senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you cris good morning as cris mentioned 2019 was marked by a significant decrease in drilling and completions activity and a reluctance to spend by our customers particularly in the fourth quarter our total revenue for the year was 957 million down 10 from 2018 adjusted ebitda was 73 million or 8 of revenue down 24 million from 2018 despite the declining activity throughout the year forum generated strong free cash flow of 90 million in 2019 and exceeded our target of reaching a 100 million free cash flow run rate in the second half of the year our fourth quarter revenue was 200 million down 40 million sequentially due to the reduced capital and operating spend as being by our customers resulting from budget exhaustion and their mandate to preserve cash however we did see an inflection in our bookings driven by new orders for international projects our book to bill ratio was above one for the first time in several quarters with improvement in all three segments our adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter was 11 million or 5 of revenue down 11 million from the third quarter this was in line with our expectations despite the lower revenue as we continue to reduce our costs throughout the organization i would also note that our adjusted ebitda does not add back 4 million of noncash equity based compensation net loss for the quarter was 12 million or 0 11 per diluted share excluding 3 million or 0 02 per share of special items adjusted net loss was 0 09 per diluted share special items for the quarter on a pre tax basis included a gain on disposition of assets of 2 million other charges primarily for discontinued products of 4 million and an 8 million foreign exchange loss we provided a reconciliation table of these special items in our earnings release for your reference i will now summarize our segment results on a sequential basis in our drilling downhole segment orders were 74 million an 8 decrease from the third quarter resulting from significantly constrained customer spending particularly for drilling and well construction consumable products in the u s market segment revenue was 78 million a 10 million or 11 sequential decrease due to deferrals of the equipment receipts by our customers for the first quarter and a lower demand for consumable products adjusted ebitda for the segment was 9 million in the fourth quarter a sequential decrease of 3 million approximately half of the decrease was related to the third quarter divestiture of our equity interest in ashtead in our completions segment orders decreased 10 to 58 million segment revenue was also 58 million a sequential decrease of 12 million or 17 due to the severe slowdown in the u s onshore completions market in addition our pressure pumping customers continued to cannibalize our idle fleet and destock their consumables several also retired assets which will be healthy for utilization levels and ultimately for equipment buying patterns adjusted ebitda for the segment was 5 million a 6 million sequential decrease resulting from the loss of operating leverage due to lower volumes and lower cost recovery compared to the third quarter production segment orders were 70 million a sequential increase of 26 primarily due to two large international orders for desalinization equipment and significant orders for well site production equipment for deliveries throughout 2020 these strong orders were partially offset by a decrease in orders for valves as distribution customers continue to destock their inventories to reduce working capital at year end segment revenue was 65 million a 20 decrease primarily due to lower sales of valves and to a lesser extent lower deliveries of surface production equipment as exploration and production budgets were exhausted adjusted ebitda for the segment was 3 million down 3 million sequentially due to the loss of operating leverage despite cost reductions and unfavorable sales mix i will now discuss some additional details about our financial results and financial position at the forum level our free cash flow after net capital expenditures in the fourth quarter was very strong at 26 million aided by strong collections of receivables the 90 million of free cash flow that we generated in 2019 represents a conversion of ebitda to cash in excess of 120 we expect to continue to deliver a high conversion of ebitda to cash in 2020 as in 2019 cash flow will be lower in the first quarter due to the timing of annual payments on higher material receipts our program to reduce excess inventory yielded meaningful results in both the fourth quarter and throughout 2019 we decreased our inventory position by 29 million in the fourth quarter and 64 million for the year we expect the monetization of excess inventory to continue in 2020 and beyond also in the fourth quarter we closed on a small noncore asset divestiture which generated 4 million of cash proceeds as a result and in combination with our free cash flow we reduced net debt by 29 million in the fourth quarter we ended the year with 58 million of cash from the balance sheet and undrawn revolver and liquidity of 287 million our primary use of free cash flow in 2020 will be to continue to reduce net debt we re also working to address the maturity of our 400 million of bonds due in the fourth quarter of 2021 potential solutions could include arrangements with existing bondholders and or raising new money due to the sensitive nature of these discussions we cannot say more on this topic at this time our net capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were 3 million bringing our total capital expenditures for the year to 15 million we re a capital light business and we expect our total capital expenditures for 2020 to be around the same maintenance level as in 2019 our reported diluted share count for the quarter was 110 million shares interest and depreciation and amortization were 7 million and 15 million respectively in the fourth quarter we expect these expenses to remain at similar levels in the first quarter adjusted corporate expenses were 6 million in the fourth quarter and we expect them to be approximately 7 million in the first quarter due to higher payroll tax and full accruals for incentive compensation and medical insurance both our corporate expenses and total sg a were down more than the 10 revenue decline in 2019 we will continue to have some tax expense despite an overall net loss as we re not recognizing tax benefits in loss making jurisdictions but continue to recognize tax expense for some international jurisdictions with income once we turn profitable in the loss making jurisdictions we will have a relatively low tax rate as we begin to use our net operating losses for more information about our financial results please review the earnings release on our website now let me turn the call over to lyle to discuss some key operating initiatives d lyle williams jr senior vice president operations thank you pablo hello everyone in the fourth quarter we saw another significant reduction in inventory of 29 million following the 26 million reduction in the third quarter for the year we decreased our inventory by 64 million or 13 which is a very good movement in the right direction as cris mentioned inventory monetization remains an opportunity and focus area for generating incremental cash flow we will improve our inventory turns by following the strategies that helped us reduce inventory in 2019 these include improve improving inventory planning partnering with our suppliers on consigned inventory and streamlining our operations using lean techniques we are also liquidating slower moving inventories and discontinuing some margin dilutive subproduct areas in addition to monetizing inventory these actions will improve customer responsiveness by reducing our manufacturing lead times for example our drilling downhole team has improved plant operations by leveraging lean techniques to virtually connect distribution locations back to our vendors and by implementing metrics to quickly adjust their performance on the cost management front we also made progress in the fourth quarter despite a 16 sequential decline in revenue our gross margins remained fairly constant because of our variable cost structure operations management was able to flex cost downward quickly to match reductions in activity while retaining ample capacity to serve future customer demands we will continue our focus on managing cost controlling what we can in this volatile market we re not only focused on managing cost but also on growing our revenues through a number of avenues revenues from outside the u s continued to grow in importance with roughly 1 3 of total revenue in the fourth quarter coming from outside the u s we expect non u s revenues to continue growth into 2020 as our large service company customers pull through our well construction and intervention products including casing hardware coil tubing and wireline and related pressure control equipment in the fourth quarter we received a large order for edge electrostatic desalting equipment from the middle east and we have recently trained local forum employees for recertification of our drilling and intervention capital equipment in that region we also expect market share gains from some of our new differentiated products cris has already discussed our growing artificial lift offerings in addition our new pressure pumping products are garnering attention earlier this month at the spe hydraulic fracturing technology conference we launched our 3 300 horsepower frac power end and our innovative high pressure hose both of these products work with our full offering of pressure pumping hardware to address some of our customers biggest challenges while simplifying setup and increasing safety at the job site a very topical subject is the coronavirus and its potential impact let me address that for forum we currently source components and finished products for a number of our product lines directly from china china is also an increasingly important sales market for our products and we have recently expanded sales of our well intervention products into the country forum many of our suppliers and even financial institutions closed operations in response to regulations imposed by the chinese government furthermore these government mandated shutdowns have also impacted seaports and airports which may cause transportation delay the situation on the ground is changing daily so we will continue to monitor these events as they unfold i am thankful to be able to report that our china based employees are all healthy and taking proper precautions to protect themselves and their families in the past year tariffs and now the coronavirus have been headwinds to our supply chain efforts in china we are pleased with how our chinese supply chain partners have worked with us to overcome these challenges let me turn the call back over to cris for closing remarks c christopher gaut chief executive officer thanks lyle we are proud of our team s hard work in achieving fourth quarter results overall business remains tough and we appreciate all the efforts we continue to believe that under investment deferred maintenance and cannibalization of equipment by our customers in the u s onshore market is not sustainable having said that forum s balanced portfolio in international and offshore markets as well as our exposure to non upstream markets is a positive for forum and we expect the percentage of our revenue coming from those markets to grow going forward we will continue to focus on the things we can control which include working capital and managing our costs in order to drive free cash flow we will also continue to focus on our winning products which we can grow even in challenging markets thank you for your interest and at this point we will open the line for questions annie let s take the first question questions and answers operator we have a question from the line of sean meakim from jpmorgan your line is open sean meakim jpmorgan analyst hi good morning c christopher gaut chief executive officer hi sean sean meakim jpmorgan analyst so could we maybe just start with your expectations for free cash in 2020 and maybe try to characterize the range of outcomes i recognize some of the uncertainty in china so let s just say that the 60 million to 70 million ebitda range holds do you expect working capital especially inventory to be a source of cash again how would you bracket the outcomes on free cash maybe in dollar terms or conversion rates or relative to what you generated in 2019 just looking to get your range of outcomes on free cash c christopher gaut chief executive officer yes so the biggest driver of our ability to reduce our inventory is the level of cost of goods sold what we can sell so if we see a pickup in demand we have the goods on the shelf and we can turn them to cash so to the extent our revenue or cost of goods sold is lower that is more difficult to the extent things pick up and we continue to build orders from here that will be a positive relative to our conversion of ebitda to cash we expect that to continue to be at a very high rate and our goal is 100 conversion of ebitda to cash sean meakim jpmorgan analyst okay got it that s helpful thank you and then looking at the success you re having with the artificial lift products could we talk about how much of that is north american driven versus international opportunities just given the applications can be quite different and then just on the other tangential products that you could develop to solve similar problems for e ps related to esp and are there other ways in which we can drive related type of revenue growth c christopher gaut chief executive officer yes so i mean to be clear particularly for those who aren t as familiar with forum s product line we re selling accessories around artificial lift and electric submersible pump and rod lifts etc so we sell downhole products that help prevent sand from clogging up esps our gas guard product that breaks up gas slugs which are very difficult on all types of artificial lift pumps to your question sean to date we have seen tremendous demand and acceptance of these products with more and more customers for the u s land market we re at the early stages of expanding those products to international markets we are seeing good interest and beginning to see good orders internationally particularly in the middle east where esps are used quite a bit and in latin america and so again we see that as a source of the international growth that we were talking about another area of the accessories we have for artificial lift products are the variety of the protectors that we offer that go on the production liner to protect the cables power cables and injection lines and that is another high margin high demand product offering and as we re seeing more offshore products i m sorry offshore activity and more high value wells drilled for example in the gulf of mexico we re seeing uptake there too so yes to date it s been primarily a u s market but as offshore and international grows it s not just our other drilling and legacy downhole products where we re seeing an increase in demand but in these artificial lift products as well d lyle williams jr senior vice president operations sean we re also participating a little more on the gas lift side as well through the coiled line pipe product that we developed as part of our coiled tubing product offering and diversifying into that part of the market so these are kind of gas injection lines going back to the well from the gathering stations c christopher gaut chief executive officer and the depression stations yes sean meakim jpmorgan analyst got it great thank you very much c christopher gaut chief executive officer thanks operator we have another question from the line of george o leary from tph corporation your line is open george o leary tph corporation analyst morning guys c christopher gaut chief executive officer morning george o leary tph corporation analyst congrats on the free cash flow and i think the goal of 100 conversion of ebitda was nice to hear as well as you think about 2020 and the incremental leverage you have to reduce net debt is there anything left to do on the divestiture front and just how does that market look today or bid asks really wide or are there incremental opportunities for you to go the divestiture out to reduce net debt pablo g mercado senior vice president and chief financial officer george it s pablo so yes we did move the needle a bit through divestitures in 2019 of 40 million plus of sale proceeds of really some products that didn t generate a lot in the way of ebitda or cash flow for us so while we were successful doing that and continuing to look at the portfolio for opportunities to turn noncash flow generating assets into cash the m a market is difficult there are not a lot of buyers out there so i wouldn t put yes i wouldn t say we have a goal out there of doing that but continue to evaluate opportunities george o leary tph corporation analyst great that s helpful and then you ve mentioned some products or sub product that you guys will no longer be looking to sell moving forward i wonder if you guys could provide some examples of those and what business unit those may be associated with d lyle williams jr senior vice president operations george this is lyle so one of the things that we did in the fourth quarter particularly in our valves business was evaluate some minor product offerings that we had that as pablo mentioned weren t cash contributing and we ceased those just ceased operations of selling those we re able to divert the resources that we had dedicated those to some of our higher margin and our better performing products in the valves business pablo g mercado senior vice president and chief financial officer so we out some of the things that we were offering there and some of the other areas as well but as we look to move more toward the winning products and things that got good customer demand and a bit more differentiated that s where we re putting more of the resources george o leary tph corporation analyst okay great that s helpful and then just one more from me just on the trajectory of free cash flow in the 2020 time frame i think pablo you mentioned that cash flow would be lower in the first quarter which is one seasonally normal and then two just starting off at a very low level of activity in north america in particular so that makes some sense is it any way you could frame the magnitude of kind of free cash flow compression sequentially quarter on quarter you still think you could convert 100 of that ebitda to free cash flow in the first or should we look for free cash flow conversion to be better in the second and third quarters of the year pablo g mercado senior vice president and chief financial officer yes george that s a reasonable expectation what you described as kind of that one times conversion kind of throughout the year obviously there ll be some variability but that s reasonable for the first quarter the reason as you mentioned a little bit seasonal if you look at the first quarter last year it was lower than the ramp up we had in the back half of the year for the reasons i mentioned on the prepared remarks we also have pretty good collections we had some payments that came a bit early in the fourth quarter so therefore they re not there in the first quarter george o leary tph corporation analyst right great thanks guys i ll turn it back over c christopher gaut chief executive officer thanks george operator we do have another question from the line of chase mulvehill from the bank of america your line is open chase mulvehill bank of america analyst hi good morning c christopher gaut chief executive officer hi chase chase mulvehill bank of america analyst hi i guess i want to come back to the guidance the annual guidance for 60 million to 70 million of ebitda for this year could you maybe just kind of help us understand just kind of the framework behind that and especially kind of when we think about u s activity maybe it s e p capex that you want to talk to or something like that d lyle williams jr senior vice president operations yes i think the bigger the macro obviously we can talk about oil price supply demand but the drivers for us that are key the direction in the rig count the rig count is going up and we re putting more rigs to work they need to be reoutfitted and that s a positive on the frac side we feel that at this point there s been a lot of destocking of consumable products and although there may be more frac units that go into attrition or are retired our view is largely those are not in operating condition at any rate and in order if one were to try to put those back there would need to be money spent on those and we re at a point now with the destocking of consumable products that it s more hand to mouth we ve seen it leveling off i think in demand there but as there s a need to continue to maintain that equipment keep it working and if there s any increase in units going back to work those would be positives for demand for our products so those would be some of the main some macro or drivers for our business the increasing use of artificial lift we ve already addressed international 30 of our revenue is international and we expect that to be a growing portion over time the offshore and subsea market is another positive we re seeing more discussions and bids going on there that we re working hard to turn into orders and also while mentioned the process industry projects that we won in the fourth quarter we re seeing an increase in a number of those that projects that are being talked about very good margin lumpier bigger projects and we re hoping of landing more of those as well chase mulvehill bank of america analyst okay all right and on the completions side if i looked at margins and decrementals there in the fourth quarter realizing that revenues were down a decent chunk you had some pretty hefty decrementals as we kind of move forward i don t know if you want to kind of talk a little bit about incrementals as you start revenues improve or maybe kind of over the next few quarters where you think absolute level of margins can go for this segment c christopher gaut chief executive officer yes i mean that s it s a good margin segment for us we were hurt in the transition from q3 to q4 by some cost recovery issues but we don t see that being a factor from fourth quarter to first quarter so the gross margin contribution on an incremental basis is high in our completions business so they have increase in sales there would clearly be accretive to our overall results some of our intervention products that are doing well since as our e line our wireline cable we ve got some very good technology there some new products coming out great margins of course a coiled tubing coiled tubing pipe that we sell very good product line very good margins and as completions are done in the particularly in the first half of the year as e p companies want to kind of get ahead on their production goals for the year that should be good for those product lines chase mulvehill bank of america analyst okay understood if i squeeze one more in if we look out for 2020 and it kind of looks like maybe revenues have kind of stabilized and you might kind of work them higher from here but on the cost side could you talk about what you re doing to kind of focus on cost and to take more cost out of the business c christopher gaut chief executive officer we ve worked hard on sg a in recent periods and i think we ve made great progress there and really thinned out the organization another step that we re doing is in improving our direct costs and our manufacturing costs and maybe lyle you can talk about some of the things we re doing in that regard d lyle williams jr senior vice president operations sure sure we talked a little bit in prepared remarks about the efficiency of our focus on lean operations and what those do as far as not just reducing cost but also improving our responsiveness to our customers we ve got a good solid organization working on supply chain so working on material cost materials are a large component of our cost of goods sold so continuing that focus of developing our supply chain and increasing those i think as we think about footprint and what we have from an operational perspective cris mentioned sg a we ve also done a good job of optimizing that footprint in getting production into the right operating places right operating locations and manufacturing locations to be as efficient as we can so some really good progress that s been made there more ground to cover but the team and the team has done a great job of implementing those while being responsive to the change in market demand c christopher gaut chief executive officer the tariffs have also been a burden for us chase and that seems to be not getting worse at this point they feel a little bit better but we re also making progress on our remediation efforts in that regard but those are a burden but we re doing a better job of addressing those which goes right to our costs chase mulvehill bank of america analyst all right understood all right thanks chris thanks lyle i ll turn it back over c christopher gaut chief executive officer thanks very much well we appreciate your attention and interest in forum and we ll talk to everybody next quarter thanks very much goodbye operator duration 41 minutes call participants bill austin vice president

chairman and ceo stated our fourth quarter results were as we expected with sales flat to last year and very strong cash generation operating and free cash flow for the quarter were 440 million and 300 million respectively for the full year operating and free cash flow were about 1 4 billion and 870 million respectively our leverage is approaching historical lows which provides us with the flexibility to pursue additional opportunities under our stock repurchase program we bought approximately 23 million in the fourth quarter for a total of about 375 million since the inception of the buyback program as we anticipated our businesses remained challenged by soft demand greater competition and reduced production volume in the u s markets continued to be influenced by the strong dollar the impact of lvt on other products and positive trends in housing that should be a tailwind competition has increased in our global markets impacting our pricing and mix as we leverage investments in sales and marketing to drive growth many countries where we operate are stimulating their economies with lower interest rates to encourage greater consumer spending and economic growth this year in the near term we still anticipate that most of our markets will have continued pressure in our product categories throughout the period we implemented changes to increase sales and reduce costs we have enhanced our lvt manufacturing in the u s and europe and realigned our u s carpet operations we have decreased our ceramic production and inventories and are taking out wood flooring plants in the u s and europe we are reducing the complexity of our operations enhancing processes to reduce costs and increasing automation to improve efficiencies we continue to improve the productivity and volume of our new lvt u s countertop russian sheet vinyl and european carpet tile investments our acquisitions in australia and brazil are installing state of the art equipment that will expand their product portfolios we are introducing new design and performance innovations to enhance our market positions and broaden our customer base to promote both new and existing products we are making higher levels of sales and marketing investments for the quarter our global ceramic segment sales were flat as reported and decreased 1 5 on a constant currency and days basis the segment s operating margin was 6 as reported declining year over year primarily due to inflation and lower production rates partially offset by productivity most of the segment s markets faced soft demand and excess industry capacity that is compressing market prices and margins our u s ceramic business remained under pressure from lvt taking share and high industry inventories from ceramic purchases ahead of tariffs to align our own inventory levels we meaningfully reduced production in our north american ceramic plants which increased our costs to improve sales we are rolling out multiple new products and adding sales representatives and design consultants in major markets we have begun manufacturing our proprietary new click tile in multiple sizes and designs and we have already received commitments from major customers our quartz countertop sales increased as we ramped up productivity at our new plant in mexico we continued to gain market share by expanding our brands distribution and product offering with larger sizes porcelain products and a more comprehensive wall tile collection in brazil we had good sales growth in the period and initiated a new porcelain line to create larger sizes for our premium collections the southern european economies remain slow impacting our primary ceramic markets and industry pricing in europe we increased our volume and are expanding our activities in the commercial and outdoor channels in russia we grew our sales in a soft market and we are starting up additional porcelain production to make super large sizes as well as a new plant to produce coordinated premium sanitary ware during the quarter our flooring north america segment s sales decreased 4 as reported and 5 on a constant days basis with an operating margin of 3 as reported and 7 excluding restructuring and other charges operating income for the segment declined primarily due to lower volume price and mix we have executed many initiatives to align the business with the present conditions including closing three plants consolidating high cost operations and reducing wood manufacturing the effects of these actions will increase and flow through inventory with full cost benefit in the third quarter of 2020 in the quarter our residential carpet sales performed best in the new home construction and multi family channels we are leveraging our strengths in design and fiber technology to deliver differentiated new collections in both premium and value carpet categories to create greater value for our commercial customers and improve our cost we invested in new design capabilities proprietary carpet tile backings and material manufacturing we have increased the production and speeds of our lvt operations and ongoing initiatives will further improve formulations and throughput during the period u s tariffs on click lvt were removed and the market has adjusted pricing to reflect this change to expand our price points and highlight our unique visuals and features we are introducing new rigid and flexible lvt collections for both residential and commercial markets the virus in china is postponing the start up of some production and could potentially disrupt some lvt service depending on when product shipments resume sales of our water proof laminate products are expanding and we anticipate continued growth due to their realistic appearance durability and ease of installation to support higher laminate sales we are upgrading our hdf board production to expand capacity and improve our costs for the quarter our flooring rest of the world segment s sales increased 3 as reported and 4 on a constant currency and days basis the segment s operating margin was 13 as reported and 14 excluding restructuring and other charges due to volume growth reduced start up cost and lower inflation partially offset by price and mix across the segment our investments in product innovation cost improvements acquisitions and new businesses strengthened our results we are outperforming the european laminate market and sales of our new signature collection are ramping up quickly due to an enhanced level of sophistication we announced the consolidation of wood manufacturing to our facility in malaysia which will improve our costs and increase our flexibility to better satisfy our customers our lvt sales grew as our manufacturing productivity significantly improved our new rigid collections are being well received and our next generation of flexible lvt provides our most realistic wood and stone visuals our panels and insulation businesses had good results in a more competitive environment in australia and new zealand our soft and hard surface sales grew in a difficult environment and we are launching many new carpet collections to enhance our offering market conditions remain challenging across most of our businesses and geographies in response we are adjusting our business strategies enhancing our product offering and restructuring operations we are increasing our investments in sales and marketing expanding our commercial participation and enhancing both our premium and value collections to broaden our distribution into new channels and geographies we are bringing many new product innovations and categories to market our new lvt countertop sheet vinyl and carpet tile plants are improving their productivity as we invest to expand our customer base and sales volume as our lvt manufacturing capacity grows with higher speeds and efficiencies we are enhancing design and features and increasing sales of our rigid and flexible offerings we are limiting the traditional inventory build that we typically do in the first quarter as we manage our production with market demand taking all of this into account our eps guidance for the first quarter of 2020 is 1 90 to 2 00 excluding any one time charges lvt growth in the u s exchange rates and excess global capacity continue as headwinds for our businesses we are executing specific initiatives to adapt to shifting consumer preferences changing markets and competitive pressures for the full year of 2020 we expect that our actions to increase sales and distribution reduce costs and enhance utilization of our new plants will deliver improved year over year results with our performance accelerating during the second half of the year our

margin was 6 as reported declining year over year primarily due to inflation and lower production rates partially offset by productivity most of the segment s markets faced soft demand and excess

fourth quarter and our 2020 outlook 2019 was an important year of inflection for newell we made significant strides against the five pillars of the turnaround plan which include returning the company to sustainable and profitable core sales growth expanding operating margins through productivity and overhead savings accelerating cash conversion cycle through working capital transformation strengthening the portfolio of brands and businesses in which we compete and build out a winning team i ll start with the last bit a winning team because i firmly believe that the most important foundation for a successful turnaround and for enabling a company to return to its full potential is to build the right leadership team newell has dedicated and passionate employees who want to win with the right leadership in place we can maximize their potential and drive better outcomes through clarity of direction removing barriers and focusing the right people on the right things we re also optimizing our organizational structure we believe that given the diverse nature of our products and categories it is important to have dedicated front facing go to market business units with the requisite domain expertise headed by business unit ceos who are strong drivers of sustainable profitable revenue growth and expense at leveraging consumer insights and customer relationships to drive meaningful innovation at the same time we expect them to be superb collaborators to support the enterprise in attaining back end synergies and efficiencies by leveraging newell s scale we do not want to be an overly centralized organization nor do we want to be a commonwealth of independent states we will differentiate our brands through a business unit structure and synergize through enterprise efficiencies to that end we are announcing two new senior leaders today first mike mcdermott who joined us recently to lead our commercial business as business units ceo including rubbermaid commercial products and mapa spontex mike has had a stellar career most recently at bass pro shops where he was president omni channel retail and before that as executive vice president and chief customer officer at lowe s he was also head of sales for ge appliances and led product innovation mike is an inspirational leader with great people skills and impressive categories expertise he has spent the last few weeks meeting with his new team and immersing himself in that business we are thrilled to have him on board we also announced the imminent arrival of kris malkoski who will be joining newell brands next week as business unit ceo of our food business which includes the rubbermaid food sistema ball jars and foodsaver brands kris joins us with extensive experience in the food and housewares category having served as ceo of the americas for arc international a french glassware company and before that at is world kitchen where she was president global business and chief commercial officer with responsibility of their global housewares business including brands such as pyrex corningware and corelle kris got her deed at procter gamble where she had an illustrious career for 14 years she is a strong p l leader with relevant experience and a terrific track record of driving innovation we re excited to have her join us and build on the recent momentum in this important business we re in the late stages of a search for a ceo for our outdoor business and naming a chief customer officer we ve also brought in strong leaders in several key positions at the business unit level and in the functions in fact since joining newell about a year ago kris has totally revamped the finance function having brought in a new chief accounting officer a new head of tax accounting a new head of supply chain finance and a new head of global business services in 2019 you can see that with all of these changes it really is a new newell the first pillar of our turnaround returning the company to sustainable profitable core sales growth remains a top priority our 2019 core sales trajectory showed steady improvement this year with four of our eight business units delivering positive growth in 2019 those businesses are connected home security writing home fragrance and baby we re also excited that the food business grew high single digits in q4 reversing two quarters of declines and we are optimistic about its prospects in 2020 kudos to these teams for their hard work we generated double digit growth in e commerce and we delivered and returned to growth in our international markets where core sales grew low single digits versus a low single digit decline in 2018 we ve begun to revamp the company s innovation process with insights from the newly developed multi year product roadmaps helping to repopulating and strengthen the innovation pipeline this process takes time and there is clearly much work to be done particularly in our more challenged businesses including outdoor recreation and appliances cookware we also overhaul our marketing approach to introduce omni channel focus and a digital first mind set across the organization with the goal of ensuring a seamless interaction between our brands and consumers across all channels where they shop although still nascent we have started to build out our social and digital marketing capability and we are beginning to leverage machine learning and ai tools in parts of the organization moving on to the second strategic priority of expanding operating margin through productivity and overhead cost savings during 2019 we expanded our normalized operating margins by 50 basis points through productivity and disciplined pricing actions to overcome inflation and tariffs we also made good progress on complexity reduction initiatives including reducing skus by 27 implementing four sap conversions and consolidating seven distribution centers and two manufacturing plants with more to come on that front in 2020 in relation to the third pillar strengthening the portfolio at the end of 2019 we completed the sale of u s playing cards which brought the company s two year divestiture program to a close i d like to thank brad turner our general counsel and jason mullins svp of mergers acquisitions and their teams for their exemplary work on this initiative during 2019 we also made the decisive choice to retain the rubbermaid commercial products mapa spontex and quickie businesses which we expect to be additive to the value creation formula as part of our ongoing portfolio the fourth pillar of our turnaround plan centers around improving the company s cash conversion cycle through more efficient working capital management the team under kris leadership did a tremendous job on that front in 2019 reducing our cash conversion cycle by more than 10 days on a like for like basis operating cash flow improved 54 during 2019 to more than 1 billion let me repeat that more than 1 billion with free cash flow productivity over 100 a significant achievement for the organization and importantly this enabled us to continue to pay down our debt achieving a 4 0 leverage ratio as we closed the year and making progress in de risking our balance sheet in 2019 we pivoted from transformation to turnaround and made good progress on many fronts i want to thank our business unit heads functional heads their teams and all 30 000 employees for the resilience and notable results 2020 is a true foundational year for the turnaround we ll have the right management team in place a more stable organization clarity of direction and a clear set of priorities we have two critical goals first continue to accelerate cash generation and reduce debt and two stop revenue declines and lay the foundation to restore long term profitable growth we will achieve these goals by focusing on five critical priorities first put in place a consumer customer focused collaborative leadership team with domain expertise to galvanize the organization and create a culture of winning in the marketplace second obsessively focus on cash flow through working capital improvements and debt reduction to achieve our long term target of 3 times net debt to continuing operations normalized ebitda third stop revenue declines by scaling existing and new innovations c closing distribution gaps optimizing marketing mix turbocharging online channels and reenergizing tale categories four improve operating margins by reducing complexity including sku reduction addressing e o standardizing it systems and controlling overheads and fifth launching a major new productivity program to capture the gross margin opportunity we ve laid out which we re calling project fuel fuel stands for finding untapped efficiencies and leverage this major initiative will focus on product value engineering automation improving plant operational efficiency etc across all business units and the enterprise the new leadership team at newell is committed to achieving these goals and being laser focused on executing against the five priorities however in all candour getting to revenue growth will take some time and will be challenging because four of our businesses are still in decline i m confident that the new business unit ceos in place and recent momentum in food and commercial will get back on track our two big challenges are appliances and outdoor revving up the innovation pipeline and instilling customer confidence will not happen overnight hence 2020 will be more of a foundational year for these businesses and there will still be a downward drag for their enterprise i m more optimistic about our ability to improve operating margins in the near term due to a head start in 2019 and i m enthusiastic about cash flow becoming a true hallmark of newell and to heighten our chances of success on both cash flow and margins let me now unveil my secret weapon i m excited to announce a significant expansion of responsibility for chris peterson i m appointing him as president business operations in addition to his current role as chief financial officer chris has done a great job in 2019 laying out a turnaround framework and galvanizing the organization to reduce complexity i also fondly refer to him as our cash flow guru he and i are partnering very well in the turnaround of the company and both of us are cash flow junkies given the critical importance of project fuel and improving operating margins i have requested chris to take on oversight of both supply chain and procurement dennis senovich our chief supply chain officer and steve nikolopoulos our chief procurement officer will both report to chris in addition he will be responsible for investor relations as well as it in his role as president business operations chris will work on eliminating all aspect of complexity in newell and position the company as an efficient enterprise by taking advantage of our almost 10 billion in scale i have absolute conviction that the new newell will drive shareholder value i am fixated on returning this company to one that fulfills our promises to our employees our customers our consumers and our shareholders i look forward to keeping you updated on our progress i ll now turn it over to chris christopher peterson chief financial officer president business operations thanks ravi and good morning everyone i m really excited about the new role and continuing to work with all of our employees to drive our turnaround plans including the simplification and cost agenda the fourth quarter capped off a strong year of progress on the turnaround plan with results ahead of plan across all key metrics the decisive and strategic choices we took over the past 12 months to turn newell brands around and drive shareholder value are clearly working and we are focused on building on this momentum before discussing the q4 results and outlook i want to recap the company s full year 2019 results for 2019 core sales growth increased by 330 basis points from a 5 2 decline in 2018 to a 1 9 decline in 2019 gross productivity improvement and overhead reductions more than offset higher advertising spending inflation foreign exchange and tariffs driving a 50 basis point year over year expansion and normalized operating margin operating cash flow improved more than 50 to over 1 billion with free cash flow more than doubling versus year ago to 779 million we made significant progress on complexity reduction as we took out more than 27 of our skus or approximately 28 000 skus during the year we implemented four successful sap conversions we significantly simplified the it infrastructure by rationalizing more than 2 700 applications and integrating 24 helpdesks into a single platform we shut down more than 60 unprofitable direct to consumer websites we eliminated 46 consumer service locations we consolidated the company s real estate footprint by closing or reducing space in 21 office sites we relocated the corporate headquarters back to atlanta we streamlined the supply chain by closing seven distribution centers and two manufacturing plants and we completed the divestiture program now let s move on to q4 results net sales decreased 3 1 versus last year to 2 6 billion due to unfavorable foreign exchange and a 1 5 decline in core sales core sales growth was better than expected driven by stronger than expected growth in food and writing four business units writing baby home fragrance and food delivered positive core sales growth with e commerce continuing its double digit growth trajectory normalized operating margin remained flat year over year at 11 3 which was in line with the company s expectations with the outcome driven by disciplined spending controls productivity initiatives and pricing actions normalized gross margin contracted 70 basis points year over year to 33 5 as productivity and pricing were offset by unfavorable impact from foreign exchange tariffs and inflation overhead cost reduction offset the gross margin pressure in q4 net interest expense came down by more than 33 million year over year reflecting the company s deleveraging progress the normalized tax rate was 23 2 about in line with expectations normalized net income from discontinued operations was 8 million as compared to nearly 164 million a year ago with the year over year decline driven by the absence of pure fishing jostens process solutions and rexair normalized diluted earnings per share from continuing operations improved 33 year over year to 0 40 total company normalized diluted earnings per share came in at 0 42 and exceeded our outlook due to better core sales results now let s move to the segment performance core sales for the learning development segment increased 0 9 in q4 reflecting core sales growth in both baby and writing within baby the 4ever franchise and toddler car seats along with new innovation in the swings category continues to drive pos growth for graco growth in the core writing business more than offset the headwind from weakness in the slime category core sales for the food and commercial segment also increased 0 9 the food business grew nicely in q4 reflecting the benefit from the previously disclosed shift and selling for black friday orders as well as strength in the fresh preserving franchise the commercial division while still under pressure improved sequentially relative to q3 as the team is making progress in rebuilding the momentum note that starting in q4 the commercial business now includes the rubbermaid commercial products mapa spontex and quickie businesses in q4 core sales for the home outdoor living segment declined 2 8 the home fragrance business built on the momentum from the prior quarter during the important holiday period reflecting strength in e commerce emea and the wholesale channel the team opened a new state of the art research and development facility in south deerfield massachusetts which enhances capability and capacity to develop prototype and test new innovations across the entire range of products within the home fragrance portfolio as anticipated the connected home security business declined as a result of sell in timing for the fire safety month promotions which helped q3 core sales for the outdoor recreation business remained in the negative territory lastly core sales for the appliance cookware segment remained soft declining 4 6 similar to what we ve experienced in recent quarters softness in north america more than offset strong results in latin america let s switch gears to cash flow which came in ahead of our expectations due to diligent efforts across the organization to reduce the company s working capital needs operating cash flow improved more than 24 year over year to 620 million during the seasonally most significant quarter of the year this was a remarkable achievement particularly considering the loss contribution from businesses that have been sold during the fourth quarter we used the proceeds from the u s playing cards transaction as well as operating cash flow to reduce the company s debt by over 600 million with plans in place to continue to strengthen the balance sheet in 2020 we exited 2019 with a net debt to continuing operations normalized ebitda leverage ratio of 4 0 times a meaningful improvement versus last year turning to 2020 i want to start by providing some context for our plan in 2020 we are planning another year of sequential progress on top line growth and improvement in operating margin driven by gross productivity improvements and overhead reduction which more than offset the impact of higher advertising and promotion spending commodity and wage inflation tariffs and foreign exchange and we expect to deliver another strong year of cash flow as we continue to drive improvement in our cash conversion cycle the unfortunate outbreak of the coronavirus has taken over recent headlines and we are closely monitoring the situation to first and foremost ensure the safety of our employees as well as plan for business continuity based on what we know today we are pleased that there are no suspected or confirmed coronavirus cases for any direct newell staff while we do not have any significant third party suppliers in the wuhan area our suppliers are experiencing some disruption from slower start up in the factories after the chinese new year break and more restricted travel in the country our current outlook for the first quarter assumes about a 1 headwind on topline from these issues mostly impacting the appliances cookware and outdoor recreation businesses our guidance assumes the impact is temporary and contained to the first quarter our cross functional team will continue to stay close to the situation and implement mitigating actions as necessary specifically our initial outlook for 2012 is the following net sales of 9 4 billion to 9 55 billion with core sales flat to down 2 and a more than 100 basis point headwind from foreign currency closure of underperforming yankee candle retail stores as well as the exit by newell from the north america distribution of uniball writing products normalized operating margin improvement of 10 basis points to 40 basis points to 10 9 to 11 as carryover pricing meaningful productivity gains and tight overhead spending fund increases in a p and capability investments and offset approximately 165 million in inflationary tariff and currency related pressure normalized effective tax rate is expected to be in the mid teens range we expect normalized diluted earnings per share in the range of 1 46 to 1 56 with the diluted share count around 426 million we expect 2020 to be another strong cash flow year and are forecasting cash flow from operations in the 1 0 billion to 1 15 billion range with free cash flow productivity in excess of 100 for the second consecutive year in fact based on newell s strong cash flow generation capability the free cash flow yield based on the current stock price is over 9 looking at q1 specifically we currently expect net sales in the 1 9 billion to 1 95 billion range as core sales are forecasted to be down 3 to 5 largely reflecting timing impacts of order shipments in food related to sap implementation in the prior year and home fragrance pipeline fill related to woodwick wholesale expansion in the prior year as well as the potential incremental headwind from the coronavirus we currently anticipate normalized operating margin to decline 50 basis points to 90 basis points to 5 2 to 5 6 due to an increase in advertising spending versus the prior year given the seasonality of the business q1 is the smallest quarter of the year for newell brands which means that comparisons can be easily skewed the normalized effective tax rate is estimated in the low single digits normalized diluted earnings per share for the company are projected within a 0 05 to 0 08 range with a diluted share count around 425 million in closing we are very excited about the progress we have made on the turnaround strategy in 2019 and we expect to deliver another year of sequential progress in 2020 the leadership team that we are building gives us confidence that we will continue to improve the operating performance of the company and build shareholder value operator let s now begin the q a session questions and answers operator thank you first question comes from lauren lieberman with barclays capital lauren lieberman barclays capital analyst good morning i was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you are thinking about the innovation process and filling up that pipeline if there is things you could talk about in terms of sourcing ideas things you re doing to better understand the consumer landscape i think there has been over the last five years probably an enormous amount of activity in some of your categories from smaller kind of more upstart brands where you might not have thought i wouldn t have necessarily thought that was going to happen in the categories in which newell competes can we talk about the lens through which you re looking to upgrade and evolve the innovation process would be great thanks ravi saligram president and chief executive officer thank you so much lauren for the question first of all you re you hit on something really critical because the super majority of our business is in fact probably all of them are very responsive to innovation and yes in some categories we ve taken our eye off the ball and let some people come up and come out without innovation now the whole point about this i think the first point is we ve got to create a consumer first mindset in the company where the dna fundamentally shifts to say you ve got to understand the consumer journey from beginning to understand and it also is about being on trend understanding what are the trends anticipating them and really being on top of them and part of that is about colors it s about design it s about form but also about real insights where you say hey can you do meaningful innovation the second part of it is we have even so take appliance cookware we have 36 categories there are lot of categories which are small and were ignored for almost a decade and that s where someone will come up and say let s do something so it s important to renovate even your smaller categories they don t have to be magical but you ve got to bring news because news is pretty important and then the third part is once you get that how do you scale these innovations in the marketplace through really focusing on the right marketing mix and saying which ones do you really go after so when you think about it today this year we ve got the year of the pink and i think that theme has done a brilliant job because they got in front of it they realized that the pink category is a large category we have a terrific brand in sharpie that has amazing consumer equity but was not intense so and from that they really drove innovation and it was a cross functional collaboration team they also did it with speed so i really believe it can be done and hence brining in really consumer driven people who have both package goods experience durables experience who understand the gamut of consumer people like my people like chris coming in and i think we will populate the businesses with people who really have done innovation all their lives so i m quite confident it s just a matter of when not if lauren lieberman barclays capital analyst great thank you christopher peterson chief financial officer president business operations the only other point i would lauren the only other point i would add is that we did over the past 12 months put an innovation review process in place which we ve now gone through with each of the divisions and not surprisingly you can see the divisions that we ve returned to core sales growth are the divisions that have the strongest innovation pipeline and i think if you look broadly at the company today our innovation pipeline as we sit here today for the next couple of years is stronger today than where we were 12 months ago and we re not where we need to be fully yet i think we ve got four divisions that we ve talked about that we ve returned new core sales growth this year and we feel very good about their innovation pipelines i think we ve got we re making very good progress on food commercial as ravi had mentioned and i think the two places where we have gaps in the innovation pipeline are appliances outdoor and those are going to take a little longer for us to fully repopulate ravi saligram president and chief executive officer lauren one other thing i d add is you asked about are we going to look outside first to me because we were with the business unit structure had become a little bit of a commonwealth of independent states the collaboration between our r d groups has not been as high so we are going to be creating centers of excellence so for instance our connected home is really good on the internet of things and yet we also need that for something like dymo in writing how do we connect these two groups to exchange best practices secondly we are going to start partnering with firms outside which are doing a lot of innovation work and to get to breakthrough ideas and breakthrough innovations because we can t just say everything is going to come from inside there s a lot of people who are doing things outside and so we re going to look at that when you look at the other thing is strategic shifts brilliant one has been home fragrance where they ve gone from a candle company to a home fragrance company and that shift has allowed us to come out with car air fresheners outdoor candles and so they are really and the collaboration between marketing and r d there is superb nancy o donnell senior vice president investor relations and communications next question please operator our next question comes from olivia tong with bank of america olivia tong bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you and good morning everyone wanted to start on core sales clearly q1 you explained a little bit of the step down relative to q4 but your plan assumes core sales growth potentially by year end so can you talk a little bit about the steps to getting there and what s your view is on price versus volume and also how much more sku rationalization are you anticipating after our 25 reduction this year christopher peterson chief financial officer president business operations yeah so if you look at the core sales guidance and the plan that we have as i mentioned we feel more confident in our innovation pipeline heading into this year than we did this on last year our core sales guidance for the year of flat to down 2 if you look at it on a two year stacked basis is actually a 400 basis point improvement in 2020 versus what the two year stack number would be for 2019 we do get off to a little bit of a slower start in the first quarter which is our seasonally smallest quarter because of the three timing issues that i mentioned which is the sap conversion that we did in the food business april 1st last year that we mentioned on the first quarter call last year the pipeline shipment woodwick as we expanded that into wholesale and the coronavirus impact that i mentioned but we re confident in the year because we can see a stronger pipeline of innovation that we ve got coming for the full year olivia tong bank of america merrill lynch analyst are you looking for incremental acceleration in the businesses that are growing or for more of a turnaround in the brands that aren t currently growing and then ravi as you look further into this portfolio does your outlook assume any potential for any exits of either product lines brands what have you ravi saligram president and chief executive officer yeah so i think look we you always want to leverage or strengths and clearly the businesses that have strength we re going to continue to drive them and they re going to be to two biz the four that have already been mentioned but we are also optimistic about food which did well in q4 as i mentioned i think and now with kris coming on board i think it s really i m very bullish about the food business and our rcp the rubbermaid commercial and mapa spontex were really making the core business of the contractual business is in good shape with good innovation it s the consumer business of that business that we need to address and we are already doing a lot of stuff there now so with mike coming onboard i feel pretty good so that means four plus two so the appliance outdoor we really need to do some work there so i think we ve got to rely on the first four plus the two now recognize in writing we ve got a terrific thing with year of the pink but we have some issues with slime but it s continuing to be a little bit of a drag but i am so confident of all the great things that the writing business is doing that s going to be a very positive thing for us so now let me get to the other issue in terms of how do we we ve got to look at this this is not a one year deal this is not a sprint it s a marathon and i m still confident the appliance cookware business is a good business it is growing we are just losing share and we need to just fix it and i still think the outdoor business is a good business we have made progress now on beverage which actually had some growth and the marmot brand actually had some growth so it s just how the other ones that have been under a little bit of a down drag so overall i feel that we are making good progress and that s why longer term i really and the reason i joined is really because i feel we have great brands and we can improve the trajectory olivia tong bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks ravi thanks chris ravi saligram president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from joe altobello with raymond james joe altobello raymond james associates analyst thanks hey guys good morning so wanted to go back to the two problems children i suppose appliances and outdoor you guys have talked about this morning replenishing the innovation pipeline potentially seeing growth in some of those business down the road here is it purely an innovation issue or are there other issues in the retail channel for example or competitively that are hampering those businesses as well ravi saligram president and chief executive officer so let me take a shot at it and chris can add some thoughts so let s take each one on the outdoor recreation we ve really got three businesses there we got the marmot and exofficio which is the technical apparel business you ve got coleman and then you ve got the beverage business so with contigo and bubba and so on one thing we have done now one of the organizational changes that i ve made is really looking at them as three verticals rather than mush them all together because that s businesses and we ve created a business champion against each of those businesses so that they can really have domain expertise and drive it and we are also getting close to hiring a ceo for the entire business so i feel pretty good and we are now making good strides because it s taken us time but even on coleman on tents so we ve got two new tents that have been accepted at a major retailer and we are now beginning to do refreshes of coolers etc and in beverages we re bringing some innovation looking for distribution gaps so innovation is one part of it but when you have innovation it is scaling those and also looking at distribution and making sure that you are getting into the right distribution and third we ve got to make sure that channel management is very critical like a marmot brand you ve got to make sure that you manage the channels properly because if it s an upscale brand you want to make sure that its identity is kept intact so i think it goes beyond innovation but innovation is the starting point so it s also your marketing and your sales and you do have private label competitors for instance in the tent business we ve got a major retailer who is a big competitor so you ve got to look at it and given some of these are outsourced from the same places how do you compete how do you build the brands so appliance cookware is slightly different we have a lot of categories there and we ve had some companies come in and really take a march on us on the innovation so we ve got to fix that but there is also that business going a lot online so we ve got to figure out how do we be how do we become digital first so those would be couple of data points that i d make to your point anything you want to add chris or christopher peterson chief financial officer president business operations no i think that s it those are the two problem child s and i think we know what needs to be done the only thing i would add is that the categories themselves we believe are attractive because the appliances cookware category is growing and it s clearly responsive to innovation and so we just have to do a better job of providing that innovation that it is connected to from consumer insights with products that represent a superior value equation and do that in a way that s in strong partnership with our retail partners ravi saligram president and chief executive officer so one optimistic note i do want to bring in just recently chris and i toured japan and we met with our japanese outdoor team and it s a sizable business in japan and it s incredible what they ve done it s a premium brand this i m talking about the outdoor business coleman is a wonderful brand and that brand there has been growing for the last decade and even this year it grew and they re very comfortable in japan mind you so it can be done it will be done it s just a matter of when not if joe altobello raymond james associates analyst that s very helpful thank you guys operator our next question comes from bill chappell with suntrust robinson humphrey william chappell suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks good morning ravi saligram president and chief executive officer good morning bill william chappell suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hey one housekeeping chris maybe you could talk a little bit about the tax rate in the first quarter and on in the full year and then kind of how that s sustainable or where that will go eventually and then on a question on home fragrance on the core growth this year the expectations are there any further doors to close or is that largely done and where do you see the distribution gains coming to kind of offset that ravi saligram president and chief executive officer you take the first one christopher peterson chief financial officer president business operations all right i ll start with the tax rate so the tax rate guidance that we gave for both the quarter and for the full year is impacted by discrete tax items so the company has a number of discrete tax items that are opportunities that we are aggressively pursuing you saw that in the results this year and that is factored into our guidance for both the first quarter and for the full year next year if you look at the ultimate going tax rate of the company as we sit here today the tax rate in the u s for the company is about in the mid 20s and our international tax rate is about in the teens and so on a consolidated basis a going tax rate excluding discrete items would be somewhere around 20 but in any given year it could be less or more than that based on the discrete item so that s the current situation with the tax rate ravi saligram president and chief executive officer so on the home fragrance side bill look first of all that team s doing a terrific job and went and did the innovation review with them and they are really firing on all cylinders and they ve been very thoughtful about the retail business in fact i have one of my former colleagues who s an expert at retail go take a look at the retail business and i think they ve been quite thoughtful about it the retail business does serve for us as good brand building and awareness building but they re all located in malls and you know what s happening in malls and the traffic is coming down and so for us i think it s just being pragmatic and making sure we look at each store to say is it profitable or not and if it s not over time when the lease comes up for renewal either we ll renegotiate the lease or terminate it so but the good news is there is a real shift occurring first we re making tremendous inroads with the mass merchants on this and the team has done a super job second our own direct to consumer business is doing superbly well as well so it s a matter of transferring the volume so we ll systematically shut down stores if they re not profitable and if we can t get the lower lease rates but there will be a glide path but as we do that we re going to keep transferring that volume to other channels christopher peterson chief financial officer president business operations yeah specifically we closed 75 stores in 2019 and i would expect in 2020 it ll be probably a similar number of stores that we ll close we don t know exactly the number because what s happening as we go to close stores is in many cases the landlords come back to us and say well if we cut your rent would you stay and so in some cases if the reduction in rent that we re able to achieve turns the store profitable we re agreeing to stay for a short period of time typically not agreeing to leases any longer than 12 months out though william chappell suntrust robinson humphrey analyst got it thanks so much operator our next question comes from kevin grundy with jefferies kevin grundy jefferies analyst thanks good morning everyone ravi saligram president and chief executive officer good morning kevin grundy jefferies analyst quick housekeeping question from me as well and then a larger question on margin investment level so the housekeeping one relates to the coronavirus can you just remind us how much of newell s total business as a percent of sales is currently sourced from china and then the bigger question for both of you is the longer term opportunity for margins and adequacy of investment level so the guidance is 10 basis points to 40 basis points of margin improvement this year chris you ll recall of course at cagny you talked about 200 basis points to 300 basis points of opportunity in gross margin there is 400 basis points to 500 basis points in overheads so there s 600 basis points to 800 basis points opportunity of which i think loosely the expectation was half of that could potentially flow through to earnings so that s all a big wind up for how should investors be thinking about the long term margin opportunity and cadence of that margin improvement for newell ravi are you comfortable with current investment levels and then as you know it s not terribly uncommon for a new ceo to take an earnings reset did you give any thought to that you seem pretty bullish on the portfolio and the opportunity to return to growth could you potentially accelerate that pass by leaning in here a bit more heavily on investment levels this year thanks for all that ravi saligram president and chief executive officer chris why don t you start christopher peterson chief financial officer president business operations so i ll start let me handle coronavirus first so the company has about 40 to 50 of its total business that is sourced i don t know that we ve disclosed specifically how much of that 40 to 50 is from china but it s a significant part of that that comes from china not a 100 but a significant portion i would say china is our largest sourcing country out of that 40 to 50 that being said what we re seeing on coronavirus just to be clear is our suppliers factories have all started up the issue is that the workers in those factories are returning to work a little bit slower than what they typically would have because of travel restrictions and then the movement of goods in the country is a little bit slower because of checkpoints and travel restrictions and so as i mentioned in the prepared remarks we re staying close to it our guidance assumes about a 1 negative impact to core sales in q1 but we don t at the moment contemplate that this will have a material impact to the year because of the timing of when it s occurring assuming that the situation continues to resolve obviously we re not predicting what s happening to the situation but that s our current view on the margin point at cagny last year our reported margins in 2018 were 9 1 this year we ended at 10 8 so our operating margin in 2019 is up 170 basis points from the reported operating margin in 2018 which was the number that i was starting from at cagny of that 170 basis points 50 basis points was like for like operating margin improvement and 120 basis points was because of the mix impact of keeping the rubbermaid commercial products mapa and quickie business so we ve already taken a big step forward on operating margins if you look at the margin guidance for this year of up 10 basis points to 40 basis points i think it reflects broadly what we re talking about which is the contribution from gross productivity and from overhead reduction is significantly higher than the 10 basis points to 40 basis points but we are reinvesting a good portion of those savings back into higher advertising and promotion spend and into capability building investments that we think will set us up to continue to drive momentum going forward ravi saligram president and chief executive officer okay so let me address kevin your question so fair point on typically new ceos want to reset but look this is your i m a third time ceo so not here to prove things sole focus here is to drive shareholder value and get employees and gear it up make newell strong for the future so i think that s really my mo and agenda here so having said that when i look at our portfolio and looking at our challenge ahead i m very pragmatic that we re in a turnaround this is i think i was very clear this is not a transformation and i think chris recognized that and hence it was easy for me to build on it second this is like a big jumbo jet and say it s got eight engines maybe two are out and two we are sort of repairing but you ve got to fly to the destination you can t just say we ll take a break you re in mid air so you recognize there are certain challenges but you ve got to walk and chew gum at the same time so is the level of investments in certain areas what i d like it to be no the most telling one on that is a p i just feel for a consumer company our a p is pretty low and we really need to increase it and we re marginally trying to do that but in the meanwhile with whatever we have we just have to be very smart about how we spend it so that we re optimizing those dollars for the maximum impact behind the biggest innovations we have but over time you ll see us as we start getting efficiencies that we will start reinvesting more in a p so that that ll help us grow but i think it is a pay as you go as opposed to saying let s do an investment now and hey new ceo i ll give you the hockey stick later i don t think we can do that we ve got to be clear hence the importance of project fuel which for me is one of the biggest bets i have personally made as a ceo and which is why my secret weapon is chris to oversee it and because that is going to be one of our biggest things which will flow dollars to operating income but also help us reinvest for the future kevin grundy jefferies analyst okay thank you both look forward to seeing you at cagny next week ravi saligram president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from wendy nicholson with citi investment research wendy nicholson citigroup analyst my first is just a follow up sort of clarification chris on the gross margin is there a specific gross margin goal for 2020 if you could just circle back on that that ll be great and then my second question sort of bigger picture is just in terms of the outlook for core sales growth obviously it s shifted out on the first quarter which is totally fine but i m just trying to get a sense for how much of the improvement in core sales growth do you think comes from regaining some lost distribution that you ve had over the last couple of years is it that you have specific line of sight to new products that you know you will be launching it still sounds like the innovation process is still on the come and so i m just i m trying to get more confident in that core sales growth outlook thanks christopher peterson chief financial officer president business operations yeah thanks wendy on the gross margin point we re not going to guide gross margins specifically we guide operating margin that being said i will say that our plan is for gross margin to move up meaningfully in 2020 versus 2019 based on the project fuel initiative that ravi talked about and that we ve kicked off we ve put a pretty good program in place over the last 18 to 24 months beginning to build capability to go after both procurement savings manufacturing efficiency savings improvements and planning the sku count reduction as i mentioned in the prepared remarks where we ve taken out 28 000 skus this year our starting point when you include rubbermaid commercial mapa and quickie now was 101 000 at the beginning of 2019 we re down to about 73 000 at the end and i think that we ve got a plan to get below 50 000 over the next 12 to 18 months so we ll continue that journey and that drives significant efficiency on the core sales side maybe a way to think about it is if we delivered minus 1 9 core sales growth in 2019 and we re guiding for sequential improvement flat to minus 2 if the four businesses that we grew in 2019 continue at the current rate and the food commercial business improves based on what we ve seen already in the fourth quarter and what we know of the innovation pipeline even if appliances cookware and outdoor rec stay about the same rate of decline in 2020 as 2019 that gets you to the sequential rate of improvement that we re talking about ravi saligram president and chief executive officer and let me add something there which are if you think about some of the key tactical actions that we re taking with the and these are not necessarily in order of priority but yes there is definitely a thrust to improve our distribution particularly in some channels which were relatively not as strong in terms of grocery drug and dollar stores and i mentioned the chief customer officer and we re bringing that person in we re also going to create a vp level for the enterprise as a whole the bus will sell their own but i think for this because we have got opportunities across different categories different businesses so i think that ll certainly be an area we re going to look at online will continue to be an important growth area for us and we were double digits in 2019 and that will continue to be a thrust for us international which turned positive we ll continue to drive that and then clearly we ve got some innovations for 2020 that are in the works that in each of the businesses that we hope will give us some traction wendy nicholson citigroup analyst terrific that s helpful thank you so much operator our next question comes from steve powers with deutsche bank steve powers deutsche bank analyst good morning guys ravi when we last talked you seemed very focused on two things in addition to filling some key positions which seems to be progressing well number one was eradicating complexity across the business and number two was landing on the right operating model for newell balancing the desire for scale and unification against the individual needs of your different businesses you started to address this in your prepared remarks and perhaps we ll hear more next week but could you give us an update on how far developed you consider you re thinking to be on both those two things specifically your confidence that you have line of sight to simplification issues for 2020 chris mentioned sku reduction plans but beyond that and on the organization front is it fixed should we be surprised if the model continues to be tweaked and i m particularly curious like how functions such as r d and e commerce and marketing fit in and whether those are going to be more centralized and more autonomous going forward relative to the past just anything you can offer around that would be great ravi saligram president and chief executive officer sure i think on the complexity side i actually think that chris laid out a really good framework in 2019 and we re executing against it and it is really sku reduction it is reducing obsolete inventory the whole e o side it is about forecast accuracy it is about standardizing systems and it is really about improving our network of plants improving efficiencies lot of it s about automation standardization in many ways newell even though it had a centralized structure for a while this legacy things for each business did its own thing we have hundreds of applications and even with the standardization of sap there are lot of homegrown systems that people have become very fond of we ve got to speak a common language so that s why putting someone in charge who is very good at it like chris and saying hey your job think of him as the chief complexity reduction officer that you ve got to really because without that it s very tough to move forward there re so many even on overheads we can t really move on the next step because there are structural barriers we do so much manual work on our ar and our a p and there s just lot of that and that s why this global business services really going after that is pretty important so i think that complexity i feel pretty good about what we ve got on the bu structure in my mind there is pretty good clarity now so i think with newell the culture was we don t have a dimmer switch we re either completely centralized or we say completely decentralized where the completely decentralized is commonwealth of independent states and everyone declaring udi unilateral declaration of independence or so centralized and bureaucratic no one can move i think we really are getting to a hybrid model i think it s very important that when you have disparate products and categories the bu is the center of attention so we ve got to really focus there and we re creating ceos for that so the marketing sales r d will still be housed there the connecting point is the enterprise for efficiencies but even on r d how do you exchange best practices so the way you do that is not just structure but through becoming very collaborative and that teams are more important than the individual steve powers deutsche bank analyst okay very good thank you operator our next question comes from andrea teixeira with j p morgan andrea teixeira j p morgan analyst thank you good morning so my question is a follow up on your comments about margin so on the bridge to your full year margin outlook the ebit expense about 30 basis points at the midpoint so should we think about the gross margin improvement in 2020 because of this sku rationalization but that will fund more a p and r d or are those two accounts from your comments before it sounds as if you re now going to go up that much this year yet and then use some of those gross margin dollars into rebuilding the structures and in other words creating more capabilities on those areas so how we should be thinking about all the puts and takes between gross margin accretion and ebit expansion thank you christopher peterson chief financial officer president business operations yeah so just on that question i expect the gross margin to grow to improve more than the operating margin in 2020 so if our operating margin is 10 basis points to 40 basis points of improvement i think the gross margin improvement will be ahead of that and then there ll be reinvestment back primarily in a p that mitigates that and we re also driving overhead costs down year over year on a dollar basis so that s effectively the way to think about the components of it andrea teixeira j p morgan analyst yeah the question yeah thank you go ahead ravi saligram president and chief executive officer did you have a quick follow up for chris sorry i didn t mean to cut you off andrea teixeira j p morgan analyst yeah ravi thank you yeah chris so i just wanted to follow up that i i think we re all trying to figure out the order of magnitude right if it s going to be really transformational the a p investment this year or we should be thinking more of a transition here as you highlighted before to make sure that you re not throwing dollars at projects that are not fully baked in is that the way we should be thinking or no you ll have great visibility on the businesses that are working well and you want to make sure those get fully funded christopher peterson chief financial officer president business operations look i think that maybe another way to think about it is as we mentioned our innovation pipeline heading into this year is stronger than our innovation pipeline was heading into the last year but it s not yet fully where we want it to be because of where we are with appliances and outdoor and so with a stronger innovation pipeline our plan calls for us to spend more in advertising and promotion behind it which we think is a good investment but we re probably not spending the full amount that we d like to because we re not going to spend in areas where we don t have strong innovation because that we don t think is a good use of money as i said we re not going to give specific guidance on the components our guidance is on operating margin but conceptually you re going to see the gross margin being stronger than the operating margin advertising and promotion we expect to be up as a percent of sales and then overhead costs we re working and have a plan to reduce overhead dollars and obviously we ll report more as we go throughout the year ravi saligram president and chief executive officer okay so with that thank you all for joining us today we re going to be at cagny so chris and i look forward to seeing many of you there next week for inputs and outputs thank you so much operator thank you everyone a replay of today s call will be available later today on our website at ir newellbrands com duration

measures is included in our press release and posted to our corporate website in our investor relations section now i ll turn the call over to our president and ceo peter arvan peter d arvan president and chief executive officer thank you mark and good morning to everyone on the call 2019 was another solid year for poolcorp overall demand remained healthy and our dealer base optimistic while the weather caused some challenges early in the year the team s focus on execution capacity creation and organic growth drove record sales and profitability while helping our customers be more productive as well for 2019 total sales came in at 3 2 billion this represents a 200 million or 7 increase over 2018 in the fourth quarter our revenue also increased by 7 which was on top of the 6 overall growth we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the 15 growth that we saw in 2017 from a base business perspective sales increased 7 in the fourth quarter bringing the total year base business increase to 5 which is a nice recovery from earlier in the year for reference we reported a 1 base business sales growth in the first quarter and a 4 in the second quarter so through the first half we had posted a 3 gain which highlights the significance of the 5 base business growth for the full year 2019 looking at just the year round market the base business grew by 6 for the quarter and on a full year basis we saw revenues up 5 again poor weather in the first and seasonally significant second quarter weighed heavily on the total year particularly in california and texas where it was colder and wetter than 2018 the resilience of our team and the markets allowed us to make up significant ground as the year went on our dealers are reporting a very solid backlog for 2020 season which is yet another positive sign of the overall market conditions moving on to a few notable end markets we continue to gain traction in the commercial pool area as we saw revenue growth of 8 for the year and 6 for the quarter this was on top of the very strong performance in 2018 where we posted a 13 gain in the fourth quarter and 11 overall looking at major product categories equipment sales and building materials posted another strong quarter buoyed by strong demand and favorable weather in the quarter and the back half of the year we saw 9 growth in equipment sales for the quarter which resulted in 7 growth for the full year building material sales followed with 9 growth for the quarter and for the year this is encouraging further evidence of a healthy market retail and chemical sales which are part of our nondiscretionary demand were both up 4 for the year overall this is encouraging as demand was skewed and delayed until the back half of the year as pools opened later than normal because of the colder and weather in key markets for the fourth quarter chemical sales were up 1 while retail sales overall grew by 4 in europe we saw revenue grow 4 in the fourth quarter bringing the full year growth rate to 12 in local currency the largest markets in europe france spain germany and portugal all remain very solid and we continue to grow and improve our business there the base business in horizon saw revenue grow 9 in the fourth quarter and 5 for the full year demand in key markets for irrigation and building materials remained solid while we continued to drive integration between our two platforms the year to date number was impacted again by the wetter season in texas and california switching to gross profit for the quarter we saw total gross profit dollars increase 1 and 6 on a year to date basis gross margin in the quarter compressed by 170 basis points in both our base business and in total with the major driver being the cost advantage on pre price increase products that we enjoyed last year and certain vendor incentive programs also affected by that buy for the year gross margins remained stable and in line with our long term outlook mark will provide more color on this and other financial topics in his commentary now let me provide commentary on some of the growth and capacity creation activities that the team has been focused on in 2019 we opened nine new locations after opening nine in 2018 and continue to build our pipeline and we expect to add a similar number in 2020 our pool360 sales app and website continued to gain traction as we ended the year up 29 this tool now accounts for 12 of our total revenue we continue to implement our capacity creation plan that includes many facets such as open merchandising improved point of sale technology truck utilization and other supply chain initiatives the programs help us achieve our expense management targets and provide exceptional customer experience further differentiating our value proposition from the competition moving on to operating margin for the year we are pleased to report a 20 basis point improvement in our overall operating margin to 10 7 considering the poor weather that persisted for almost the entire first half in most of our key markets i m very proud of what the team did to support our customers and get as much work done as possible in a very compressed season as for the fourth quarter it turned out largely as we expected given the tough comps from last year looking specifically at our base business we are very pleased with the 40 basis point improvement in operating margin ending the year at 10 9 a good testament to our capacity creation activities and disciplined expense management this helped propel our return on invested capital to 29 3 for 2019 from 27 7 in 2018 looking ahead to 2020 we are anticipating a solid year as noted overall demand is good and contractor backlogs are healthy but persistent capacity constraints inherent to the industry remain considering this and in line with previous guidance we anticipate 6 to 8 base business revenue growth stable gross margins and a 20 to 40 improvement in operating margin for the year we anticipate opening eight to 10 additional locations in key markets and continuing our focus on execution across the business we expect our diluted earnings per share range to be between 6 47 and 6 77 per share including a 6 tax benefit related to the asu 2016 09 which equates to 10 to 15 growth excluding that tax benefit finally before i turn the call over to mark for his commentary i d like to thank our customers our suppliers and our employees for the tremendous support and dedication our team works very hard every day to be the best channel to market and our best channel to market for our suppliers and to provide exceptional service and value to our entire customer base we are very fortunate to have the best team in the industry and we strive every day to be the employer of choice i will now turn the call over to mark joslin chief financial officer for his commentary mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks pete i m happy to say that with 2019 now in our rearview mirror we met the majority of the expectations we communicated to you for both the quarter and the year overall i ll recap a few of those expectations here first our reported eps for the year excluding tax benefits was in the middle of the range we provided on our q3 earnings call and down only 3 from the middle of the range we provided at the start of the year despite the impact from weather in the first half of the year as pete mentioned looking out from our midyear results this was a very good outcome we said throughout the year that our gross margin would be relatively flat on a full year basis which was the case flat for base business and down 10 basis points in total with our acquisitions added in we had a tough gross margin comp in the fourth quarter and because of this said that on our third quarter call that our fourth quarter operating income would be down year over year which it was but only slightly as very good expense management with flat base business operating expenses mitigated the gross margin hit in the quarter for the year we targeted base business operating expense growth of 60 of the rate of gross profit growth and we re right on target with that objective this allowed us to post base business operating margin improvement for the year of 40 basis points which was at the high end of our expected 20 to 40 basis points of base business operating margin improvement one final p l metric i ll quote is our base business contribution margin for the year which was 17 1 this is the ratio of the incremental operating income generated by our incremental revenue and shows the leverage we achieved on our sales growth compared to our 10 9 base business operating margin this is also a good indicator of the continued operating margin growth opportunity we have in the future moving over to the balance sheet and cash flow i ll highlight a couple of things first on the balance sheet our working capital excluding the lease accounting change grew 4 8 for the year compared to our 6 7 sales growth so we had a positive contribution from working capital to our returns as you can see on our statement of cash flows we generated 299 million of cash flow from operations for the year which was 114 of our net income and 180 million more than our 2018 cash flow from operations although we had a little help here from our 2018 inventory pull forward this was a good outcome for us as always working capital management and cash generation will continue to be a focus for us in 2020 given both the solid growth in our earnings and our positive working capital management we re able to increase our return on invested capital to a record 29 3 for the year which was up 160 basis points from our 2018 roic of 27 7 our roic includes the benefit from the asu tax gain but excluding those in both years we still gained 90 basis points of roic improvement so a very good result here i should note that our earnings per share in 2019 as well as our guidance for 2020 largely excludes the benefit from share repurchases in 2019 we repurchased only 149 000 shares at an average price of 148 a share which used just 21 million in cash as a consequence excess cash was used to pay down debt which was 25 lower at the end of the year from the end of 2018 our leverage which is measured on a trailing 12 month debt to ebitda basis finished the year at 1 61 which is approaching the lower end of our preferred 1 5 to two times our belief is that rather than competing with investors for our shares which were up 43 for the year it made sense to be patient and save our debt capacity for the time being until external factors create an opportunity for us to buy in more robustly as you are refining your models for 2020 let me give you some perspectives to keep in mind as pete said we are expecting 6 to 8 base business growth for the year assuming normal weather with greater growth in the first half of the year and particularly in the first quarter given last year s tepid first half results and a bit lower growth in the back half of the year the first quarter may also pull forward some sales from the second quarter as early indicators are that the normal spring early buys may move up from last year resulting in roughly 10 million to 15 million in lower margin sales moving from q2 into q1 on gross margin we look to once again be relatively flat for the year overall with a decline in the first half and more significantly in the first quarter while the back half of the year should be modestly positive i should note that in 2019 there were a couple of forces driving our gross margin comparisons to 2018 both as a result of the pre price increase purchases in 2018 one impact of this was on selling price which provided us with a customer pricing benefit in the first half of the year and was a drag on our margin comparison in the second half of the year due to the tough comp from 2018 recall that our q1 2019 base business gross margin was up 90 basis points and was up 30 basis points in q2 the other impact was from vendor pricing where volume related purchase incentives helped our gross margin in the back half of 2018 but hurt our gross margin throughout 2019 as we were about the benefit of the purchase volumes moved into 2018 as we return to normal purchase volumes in 2020 we expect these vendor incentives to help offset the first half margin challenges leaving us with relatively flat base business gross margin for the year on operating expenses we continue to aim for base business expense growth at 60 of the rate of gross profit growth and although that may not happen every quarter we think that s a reasonable but stretch target for the year having said that we had a couple of benefits on expenses in 2019 which may not recur in 2020 one was the impact of the stronger u s dollar which positively impacted our expense line by 3 million spread throughout the first nine months of the year note that there s an offsetting decline in sales in gp from currency so only a modest negative impact on operating income for the year the other positive expense impact was 3 million in lower incentive based pay in q4 as a result of our flat operating income compared to q4 2018 so we had a 6 million in positive 2019 expense results which we aren t counting on in 2020 another area that could impact our 2020 expense performance is a ramp up in technology investments of roughly an additional 1 million per quarter for a number of projects for these reasons i have labeled our 60 gp growth spending goal a stretch target this year but one which we aim to achieve moving down the p l we had 3 million in higher interest and other nonoperating income for the year which includes the impact of higher debt and interest rates for most of the year as interest rates have moderated and our debt balances have come down this could provide a bit of a tailwind for us in 2020 one other noteworthy comment on our 2019 results was the impact of closing our branch in colombia where we pulled the plug at year end after five years of effort to develop that market the impact from this closure was a 2 million loss with about half of the hit in operating income and the other half a currency hit included in the 3 million i just called out on our interest line this created a 0 05 eps hit for the year and 0 04 of this was in the fourth quarter finally we finished the year with an effective income tax rate excluding the impact of the asu benefit of 25 1 and we expect this to inch up slightly to about 25 5 for 2020 as i look at sell side numbers for 2020 the biggest disconnect from our 2020 guidance appears to be on the tax line and the estimate of our asu impact that concludes my prepared remarks so i ll turn the call back over to our operator to begin our question and answer session questions and answers operator and today s first question comes from david manthey at baird please go ahead david manthey baird analyst all right hi good morning guys mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer morning david manthey baird analyst first off can you discuss any strategic buy programs entering this year that you may have participated in and i guess you gave us the implications for the quarterly gross margin trends but it doesn t feel like there s much of anything but with the gross margin for the year being stable last year expected to be stable this year can you broadly outline the biggest moving parts there in terms of what s pushing it up what s pushing it down to lead you to this net zero area mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer sure sure let me handle that dave so first of all in terms of strategic buy you re really probably referring to what we did in 2018 and the pre price increase purchases and in 2018 as in 2019 we also do our normal seasonal buy in with vendors so we commit to purchases in the fall for delivery at the vendors convenience throughout the fall and into the spring and then we pay for those in the late spring and summer so for 2019 inflation i m sorry for 2020 inflation expectations were a return to normal and that s what we ve seen and so we did our normal kind of fall buy that we ve done in years past and nothing unusual from that perspective in terms of gross margins and the comment about them being flat for the year i provided some kind of highlights in my commentary but just to recap those going back to 2019 first quarter we had the benefit of the pre price increase inventory that we had purchased selling prices increased at the start of the year for all of our customers and so we were able to sell that lower priced inventory in the first quarter and a little bit into the second quarter which gave us a margin benefit which was 90 basis points in the first quarter last year and 30 basis points 20 to 30 in the second quarter at the same time because those purchases that we did were in 2018 instead of 2019 that affected the vendor incentives that we received and those were higher in 2018 and a little bit lower in 2019 and so that impacted our margins overall for 2019 and left us with a flat margin in 2019 considering the big comp difficulty that we had in the fourth quarter so 2020 we have that tough comp in q1 tough comp in q2 we ll benefit from getting back to normal vendor incentives which gives us that flat expectation for the year so a lot of background there so if you have any follow up on that dave let me know but that s how it lays out david manthey baird analyst yes it s very helpful could you also talk about product mix and customer mix and where you re seeing the strength i think you mentioned some of the renovation and construction products you ve got commercial moving up the curve any puts and takes there as it relates to the gross margin for the company maybe offset by the core day to day maintenance and minor repair products peter d arvan president and chief executive officer sure dave i ll take that when i look at our product groups that are growing if you consider that building material for us has been an area of strength over time it continues to build so we had a very good year with building materials last year as i said in my commentary it was up 9 the margin profile on building materials is good of course your cost to handle building materials sometimes can be a little bit more expensive than the lighter boxes commercial is another area that we continue to gain traction in and commercial the margin profile in commercial is going to be a little bit lighter on the very large projects so that is an area that we re continuing to grow and that has a slight impact on our overall margin mix if i think about the chemical portion of our business the that s more of a discretionary or nondiscretionary part of our business that will follow the weather and how often that when the pool opens and how often it gets used and if i think about the inflation that we re looking at this year on chemicals if we have a normal weather year inflation is normal so from a mix perspective i don t look for any overall impact and equipment this year from a margin profile so equipment follows obviously the maintenance and repair and in new construction last year construction we think was down year over year i m sorry the yes the new pool construction we think was down about 3 although the numbers are still preliminary this year assuming a normal year and without having the benefit of price increases on equipment i think our margin profile on that returns back to normal david manthey baird analyst right appreciate the call guys thank you peter d arvan president and chief executive officer jeff thank you operator and our next question today comes from ryan merkel with william blair please go ahead ryan merkel william blair analyst hey thanks so a couple of questions first off sticking with the gross margin in the fourth quarter the decline of 170 basis points how much of that was the price cost goodness not repeating and then how much was lower rebate i think that s what you said mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer ryan i can t break that out precisely or i won t break it out precisely but it was probably 80 is was the tough comp and the smaller piece of it was the incentive piece maybe 90 85 but most significantly was just the tough comp from the year before ryan merkel william blair analyst okay that s really what i was getting at so that kind of gets me there and then i want to get a little more specific on gross margins in 1q 2020 if we can i just want to get a sense of what should the decline be year over year is down 100 basis points sort of the right range you ve got the price cost issue again and then you mentioned the early buy that may move into 1q so i m just trying to think about those two pieces mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean that s a reasonable expectation so the 90 basis points from last year plus the early buy maybe brings it down another 10 to 20 basis points so you re in the neighborhood there ryan merkel william blair analyst okay so the early buy is not that impactful at 10 20 bps mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes that sounds about right ryan merkel william blair analyst okay okay and then i realize i m getting a little picky with this question but 2020 the guidance for 10 to 15 eps growth that s a little below your goal for mid teens i m just trying to figure out what s really the difference is it some of the investment mark that you talked about and then you mentioned a non repeat of some sg a tailwinds just what s different and why isn t it 15 or better because it sounds like an easy weather comp and the market s healthy mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes well one difference first of all ryan is share repurchases which have been stock and trade for us for a number of years and add generally a couple of percent to earnings per share and we re we really didn t have any to speak of in 2019 so no benefit there moving into 2020 from 2019 purchases and at this point we re not anticipating that that will happen we don t generally reflect those in our guidance in any case so that s probably a bigger impact there but yes a little bit of caution on expenses given some investment in nonrecurring that we had nonrecurring benefit that we had last year so and generally we have constraints on industry labor so we think we have good opportunity from a demand standpoint but we have to wait and see how well the contractor base can deal with that given the labor constraints that we and other building industry participants have ryan merkel william blair analyst okay great that s helpful mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer alright operator and our next question today comes from anthony lebiedzinski of sidoti company please go ahead anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst hey guys good morning and thank you for taking the question so just wondering so with the higher capacity that you have just wondering are there any new potentially new product categories that you guys could get into or do you think 2020 sales growth will be more or less kind of more from the same types of product categories that you re in already peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes i ll take that one so when i think about new categories i wouldn t characterize it as new categories as we said during our investor day presentation there is an opportunity with automation so instead of a time clock mechanical time clock to have iot type products that you can see and control your pool from your phone we think there s an opportunity to continue to move from the single speed pumps to variable speed pumps we think that there s some new product opportunities as it relates to some of the green products and if you think about uv systems on pools which contribute to a healthier pool and less chemicals so i wouldn t say that there s a lot of new categories what i would say is that there s a big opportunity with automation because of the 5 5 million in ground pools over three million of them essentially have no automation so what we see in the market is as those pools need to be repaired and maintained that the dealers are starting to offer the automation instead of just a one for one replacement or instead of changing out the halogen light like for like talking to the homeowner about moving that to an led so i don t think it s new categories i just think it is a switch toward higher technology products and if you look at our building material products we re continuing to see growth in outdoor lighting and some of our other hardscapes which are newer for us certainly as compared to the legacy pool products so i think that s what you re going to see driving our growth anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst okay so what s the margin profile of these products that you that pete you just mentioned whether it s automation or led can you give us any color peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes i think it s similar overall i think the margin profile on lighting is very similar when i think about pumps for instance single speed to variable speed probably a little bit lighter on the variable speed than a single speed pump but that s nothing unusual that we haven t seen that trend growing over time and then when i look at the overall automation margin profile on that very similar to the items that it would be replacing anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst got it okay so next year there s some new regulations taking effect that requires variable speed pumps is there any other new regulation that you are aware of that could impact you guys peter d arvan president and chief executive officer no i don t think so and that one on the variable speed pump replacement for all single speed remember that takes effect next year mid july of 2021 and honestly manufacturers are all trying to figure out which pumps they have that could hit the doe specification some of the manufacturers think that they can do it with single speed pumps others are saying no and will have to be switched to variable speed and then of course you have it happens later in the season anyway or midway through the year and then by the time inventories are worked through i really see that as a 2022 play there will be limited impact in 2021 i see it taking effect more in 2022 but honestly i think we ll have a better view of the impact on that as the manufacturers sort through their product portfolio and figure out what they re going to do to meet those regulations anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst got it okay and lastly as far as new sales centers what s kind of the breakdown you guys are thinking for blue versus green for this year peter d arvan president and chief executive officer i think it will be a similar number this year we had one in 2018 we had one new green center we had one in canada blue one in europe and then the rest were in u s blue i would think it s probably going to be a similar profile going into the 2020 season anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst okay thank you and best of luck peter d arvan president and chief executive officer thank you operator and our next question today comes from ken zener with keybanc please go ahead ken zener keybanc analyst hey good morning peter d arvan president and chief executive officer good morning ken zener keybanc analyst glad you re not charging more for those mixed up products as a potential customer of yours peter d arvan president and chief executive officer only for you ken zener keybanc analyst so given your comments about 1q gross margins because of prebuys etc in 2018 since you re addressing the gross margin mark could you talk to if you expect the base operating leverage to degrade by the amount you said in gross margin just so no one s surprised mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes for sure there will be a reduction in operating leverage in the first quarter ken zener keybanc analyst would the ebit change be similar to the gross margin change mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer i will let you model that out ken but it s ken zener keybanc analyst you want to say 50 50 just so we can understand the sg a actions you ll be taking mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer i m not going to comment ken i d have to pull out my model and go through it ken zener keybanc analyst oh boy oh boy mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer i m prepared to but i think you can figure that out ken zener keybanc analyst well there s no reason sg a operating leverage would change at all just because the gross margin s swinging around right i mean in short mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer no for the year no i believe we would expect similar kind of performance as we ve had and as i said we look for 20 to 40 basis points of operating margin improvement that our contribution margins last year was 17 so that s well above our operating margin and it provides a healthy ramp opportunity for us to continue growing operating margins over time ken zener keybanc analyst all right general question peter about the backlog comment i mean with new sales down last year i mean is there anything really changing you keep bringing up labor constraints but there s no new the contribution or the level of backlog in your comments thinking today seems to be very similar to where we were last year which is supporting 6 to 8 base growth i mean is that a simple way to assess it or is it stronger peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes i would tell you that the backlog is good i just attended a bunch of industry shows and dealer meetings in the last month and i will tell you that my sense is is that optimism is very very high with the dealers and i mean and from just my take on it is everybody is upbeat and there is a fair amount or good backlog that everybody is sitting on right now so ken zener keybanc analyst so about financing are people talking about when you re out there with the dealers or folks i mean just give us a context for how much is paid out of cash as opposed to borrowed and is there any easing of credit that any commentary you picked up there mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean i don t see any significant shift in financing kenneth still banks are skewed toward better creditworthy the borrowers and the lower end of the credit spectrum is more challenged so if you look at it from an industry standpoint we had a big middle market business years ago that really never came back after the recession and that really hasn t changed ken zener keybanc analyst then the last area buybacks if you re not buying back and you re not going to necessarily tell us when you re buying back can you give us some more thinking i mean you talked about opportunity can you just expand on that that is a little bit of a i want to say a shift but i mean you guys have pulled back what would at least be a very steady cadence right you re going to invest in the business you re going to do dividends and the rest is coming back to shareholders it seems like it s eased up a little bit please clarify if that interpretation is wrong and what does an opportunity look like i guess i mean if you could expand on that a little bit mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean really ken there s no change in our long term capital allocation strategy always very very consistent over time which is invest everything in the business make acquisitions what we have done and we will continue to do and we think by the way there s good opportunities in this market environment for acquisitions so that will get some attention and then a dividend program which should grow with earnings over time and then excess cash going to share repurchases it just so happens that in the short term with the 43 run up in stock price last year and where we sit today we think that saving some capacity for a time when we re not competing with shareholders is going to be good for us but that s not going to be two three years down the road that should be in the foreseeable future so that s about as specific as i want to get but there s really no change in long term strategy just how we re executing in the short term ken zener keybanc analyst all right thank you very much mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yep thank you beth operator and our next question today comes from blake hirschman with stephens please go ahead blake hirschman stephens analyst good morning guys first off within the top line outlook for 2020 curious to hear how you re thinking about the relative growth between new pool construction because you mentioned i think you said it was down most likely in 2019 if you expect that to come back kind of versus the large and small r r work peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes good question blake as i said the preliminary numbers show that the new pool construction year over year is probably going to be down 2 to 3 and they re still buttoning that up so that s why i cautioned that was a preliminary comment i think that is almost 100 driven by weather and consider that there s only a certain number of buildable days during the year as where weather permits and we lost many of those days in the first half of last year and then there s only a certain amount of labor that can be applied to those projects so i say that demand is very solid for new pools i see nothing that would indicate that there s any softening of demand in for new pools and new construct or remodel so when i think about the mix i think it returns to our normal if you look at us our new pool construction probably makes up 15 to 16 of our total business and reno is another 25 and then you ve got the maintenance and repair the nondiscretionary part makes up the balance and i think that from a mix perspective 2020 is probably going to look an awful lot like that i don t see people saying i m not going to do remodel i m going to do this or that i think it really i think there s general pent up demand for both and i don t see any of the dealers changing their profile of work blake hirschman stephens analyst got it and then i could have missed it but did you guys say what the top four market growth looks like versus the seasonal markets or anything along those lines peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes when we look at the overall i think the top four markets we had relative strength in florida florida was very good arizona had a tough so above the total business arizona was lighter simply because of a very poor first half the back half of arizona was strong texas was probably about in line with the business but again much skewed toward the back half of the year and california stronger in back half than the first half because they were very cold and wet but in california the fourth quarter was specifically in southern california they got a fair amount of rain which kind of dampened things out so they were slightly below the total blake hirschman stephens analyst got it and then just lastly on m a are you guys still pretty focused on green commercial international are those kind of some of the bigger spots that you re looking to expand in now mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer well yes domestic blue as well so we look across all aspects of the business and we see a fairly active market we ve been in 10 years of economic growth so if there s someone out there looking to sell their business now it s probably not a bad time for them in their minds and so we ll see what happens but we think there will be some good opportunities for us blake hirschman stephens analyst got it thanks a lot i ll get back into mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator and our next question today comes from alex maroccia of berenberg please go ahead alex maroccia berenberg analyst hey good morning guys so i m looking at the commercial business right now and you ve stated in the past that it typically grows around 4 a year so how are you beating that market at the moment peter d arvan president and chief executive officer i think we ve invested in salespeople we ve invested in inventory i mean on the commercial business you have to have it s a different expertise because it s largely a bid and spec job for a portion of it on the new construction and then when it comes to maintenance and repair when you have competition pools you have to have it in stock so if there s a competition pool that has a pump go down or a heater go down it s not a question of well who s got the best price it really is a question of hey do you have it in stock so we ve invested in regional inventory to make sure that we have kind of all the important inventory within a reasonable lead time to where the concentration of pools are and like i said we ve invested in talent and i think we ve gotten a lot smarter and a lot better in tackling that business so i think it s just it s share gain based on our investments in people and products alex maroccia berenberg analyst got it and just a follow up on that given that it s about 5 of total sales currently how much larger do you think that could get in the future peter d arvan president and chief executive officer well i think our overall market share on commercial pool we re in the 10 range and if you look at what our overall market share is on the rest of the business that implies that there s a fair amount of room for us to grow so but there s also a portion of that business that we don t participate in that has to do with bulk chemicals so of what we consider the addressable market i think we could easily double the business that we have alex maroccia berenberg analyst okay got it and then second question for me is i m just looking at the inventory number from 2018 and 2019 you re around 22 as a percentage of sales there trying to think of free cash flow for 2020 do you see that inventory number dropping anywhere near the historic 20 or so percent range any time soon mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes in terms of the percent i m not as i would say that the inventory growth should be modest this year we have an opportunity to grow that a little bit less than we have the last couple of years we ve had an impact from acquisitions of course we had an impact this year end from vendors who shipped a bit more on early buys than they normally do now those were on dated terms so it didn t impact cash flow but that helped push up inventory growth a little bit and then we had the big inflation on inventory from 2018 into 2019 so add 4 to the inventory levels for inflation which pushed it up a little bit so given all those factors and really a focus on our part to look at making sure that we re managing that well i don t expect to see the same kind of growth and probably getting back closer to the historic levels that you re talking about alex maroccia berenberg analyst great operator today s next question comes from garik shmois of loop capital please go ahead garik shmois loop capital analyst hey this is jeff stevenson on for garik and yes my first question is just on the 6 to 8 base business forecast anything you could call out on differences between the blue and green businesses as far as expectations for next year peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes good question jeff i think about growth opportunities for both businesses a little bit differently the green business is has a big irrigating component irrigation is tied to new construction and new construction has been relatively strong and continues to look that way so from a base business growth probably the green business growth profile in that area is a little bit better than blue but not significantly different garik shmois loop capital analyst got it no that makes sense and then at your investor day you mentioned that cost inflation will be more modest in 2020 in that kind of 1 to 2 range just wondering is that still a good way to look at it and have there been any changes that you would call out that are more or less than original expectation mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes no i think that s still the way we re viewing things based on the feedback from suppliers and the increases that were announced it looks to be a much more normal year in that regard garik shmois loop capital analyst got it and one last one i know you only called out the first quarter asu tax benefit but just when you look at 2020 is there anything you could call out do you think it could be more front half loaded or anything as far as steady cadence here to help with modeling purposes mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer well we gave some guidance if your parse our comments i think we gave some guidance throughout the p l starting with the top line and the revenue growth expectations greater in the first quarter due to the easier comps we have really first quarter first half with less growth in the back half some early buy from a customer standpoint moving from q2 into q1 gave quite a bit of color on margins on expenses didn t really provide a lot of modeling color other than overall for the year so i think that we ve given about as much or more than we normally do in terms of kind of how the year looks like it s going to shape up at this point so i ll leave it at that i think garik shmois loop capital analyst understood thanks and best of luck mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer i thank you operator and ladies and gentlemen this concludes the question and answer session i d like to turn the call back over to mr arvan for any closing remarks peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes thank you thank you all for joining our call today our next call will be scheduled for april 30 where we ll discuss the

the middle of the tight 101 2 to 105 0 range for 2019 chairman powell s semiannual monetary policy report appearance in the house on tuesday and the senate on wednesday featured his upbeat assessment of the us economy we find the us economy in a very good place wages moving up most at the bottom end of the wage scale it s great to see he said on tuesday we have learned that unemployment can be lower than many had thought without increasing inflation under questioning by the representatives he observed that the risk of recession is low there is no reason why the expansion can t continue there is nothing about this expansion that is unstable or unsustainable trade concerns have diminished the signing and implementation of the usmca agreement will be a positive for the economy in that it removes some uncertainty on trade the chairman has in the past observed that the us china trade pact had reduced tensions between the nations several members mentioned the potential economic effect of the corona virus in china and mr powell temporized we will be watching this carefully what will be the effects on the us economy will they be material we have to resist the temptation to speculate on this the impact on the us economy would have to be persistent for the fed to contemplate a policy change it is very likely that there will be some spillover on the us economy but china s asian neighbors and major trading partners in europe have greater risks the chairman noted that that the global decline in rates has reduced the central bank s ability to affect the economy the current low interest rate environment also means that it would be important for fiscal policy to help support the economy if it weakens he said he also observed that the bank had learned from the recent turmoil in the overnight funding market that the size of its balance sheet needed to ensure smooth function was larger than it had thought however the repo market spike doesn t appear to be a symptom of deeper financial problems he said mr powell s comments offered a number of interesting points on central bank policy and global economics but in the main arena the status of the us economy and potential fed policy it had all been said before on thursday january headline cpi was stronger on the year at 2 5 from 2 3 in december and as came in expected in the core rate at 2 3 initial jobless

please go ahead sir mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you rocco good morning everyone and welcome to our year end 2019 earnings call i would like to remind our listeners that our discussion comments and responses to questions today may include forward looking statements including management s outlook for 2020 and future periods actual results may differ materially from those discussed today information regarding the factors and variables that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results is discussed in our 10 k the latest edition of which will be filed at the end of this month in addition we may make references to non gaap financial measures in our comments a description and reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures is included in our press release and posted to our corporate website in our investor relations section now i ll turn the call over to our president and ceo peter arvan peter d arvan president and chief executive officer thank you mark and good morning to everyone on the call 2019 was another solid year for poolcorp overall demand remained healthy and our dealer base optimistic while the weather caused some challenges early in the year the team s focus on execution capacity creation and organic growth drove record sales and profitability while helping our customers be more productive as well for 2019 total sales came in at 3 2 billion this represents a 200 million or 7 increase over 2018 in the fourth quarter our revenue also increased by 7 which was on top of the 6 overall growth we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the 15 growth that we saw in 2017 from a base business perspective sales increased 7 in the fourth quarter bringing the total year base business increase to 5 which is a nice recovery from earlier in the year for reference we reported a 1 base business sales growth in the first quarter and a 4 in the second quarter so through the first half we had posted a 3 gain which highlights the significance of the 5 base business growth for the full year 2019 looking at just the year round market the base business grew by 6 for the quarter and on a full year basis we saw revenues up 5 again poor weather in the first and seasonally significant second quarter weighed heavily on the total year particularly in california and texas where it was colder and wetter than 2018 the resilience of our team and the markets allowed us to make up significant ground as the year went on our dealers are reporting a very solid backlog for 2020 season which is yet another positive sign of the overall market conditions moving on to a few notable end markets we continue to gain traction in the commercial pool area as we saw revenue growth of 8 for the year and 6 for the quarter this was on top of the very strong performance in 2018 where we posted a 13 gain in the fourth quarter and 11 overall looking at major product categories equipment sales and building materials posted another strong quarter buoyed by strong demand and favorable weather in the quarter and the back half of the year we saw 9 growth in equipment sales for the quarter which resulted in 7 growth for the full year building material sales followed with 9 growth for the quarter and for the year this is encouraging further evidence of a healthy market retail and chemical sales which are part of our nondiscretionary demand were both up 4 for the year overall this is encouraging as demand was skewed and delayed until the back half of the year as pools opened later than normal because of the colder and weather in key markets for the fourth quarter chemical sales were up 1 while retail sales overall grew by 4 in europe we saw revenue grow 4 in the fourth quarter bringing the full year growth rate to 12 in local currency the largest markets in europe france spain germany and portugal all remain very solid and we continue to grow and improve our business there the base business in horizon saw revenue grow 9 in the fourth quarter and 5 for the full year demand in key markets for irrigation and building materials remained solid while we continued to drive integration between our two platforms the year to date number was impacted again by the wetter season in texas and california switching to gross profit for the quarter we saw total gross profit dollars increase 1 and 6 on a year to date basis gross margin in the quarter compressed by 170 basis points in both our base business and in total with the major driver being the cost advantage on pre price increase products that we enjoyed last year and certain vendor incentive programs also affected by that buy for the year gross margins remained stable and in line with our long term outlook mark will provide more color on this and other financial topics in his commentary now let me provide commentary on some of the growth and capacity creation activities that the team has been focused on in 2019 we opened nine new locations after opening nine in 2018 and continue to build our pipeline and we expect to add a similar number in 2020 our pool360 sales app and website continued to gain traction as we ended the year up 29 this tool now accounts for 12 of our total revenue we continue to implement our capacity creation plan that includes many facets such as open merchandising improved point of sale technology truck utilization and other supply chain initiatives the programs help us achieve our expense management targets and provide exceptional customer experience further differentiating our value proposition from the competition moving on to operating margin for the year we are pleased to report a 20 basis point improvement in our overall operating margin to 10 7 considering the poor weather that persisted for almost the entire first half in most of our key markets i m very proud of what the team did to support our customers and get as much work done as possible in a very compressed season as for the fourth quarter it turned out largely as we expected given the tough comps from last year looking specifically at our base business we are very pleased with the 40 basis point improvement in operating margin ending the year at 10 9 a good testament to our capacity creation activities and disciplined expense management this helped propel our return on invested capital to 29 3 for 2019 from 27 7 in 2018 looking ahead to 2020 we are anticipating a solid year as noted overall demand is good and contractor backlogs are healthy but persistent capacity constraints inherent to the industry remain considering this and in line with previous guidance we anticipate 6 to 8 base business revenue growth stable gross margins and a 20 to 40 improvement in operating margin for the year we anticipate opening eight to 10 additional locations in key markets and continuing our focus on execution across the business we expect our diluted earnings per share range to be between 6 47 and 6 77 per share including a 6 tax benefit related to the asu 2016 09 which equates to 10 to 15 growth excluding that tax benefit finally before i turn the call over to mark for his commentary i d like to thank our customers our suppliers and our employees for the tremendous support and dedication our team works very hard every day to be the best channel to market and our best channel to market for our suppliers and to provide exceptional service and value to our entire customer base we are very fortunate to have the best team in the industry and we strive every day to be the employer of choice i will now turn the call over to mark joslin chief financial officer for his commentary mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks pete i m happy to say that with 2019 now in our rearview mirror we met the majority of the expectations we communicated to you for both the quarter and the year overall i ll recap a few of those expectations here first our reported eps for the year excluding tax benefits was in the middle of the range we provided on our q3 earnings call and down only 3 from the middle of the range we provided at the start of the year despite the impact from weather in the first half of the year as pete mentioned looking out from our midyear results this was a very good outcome we said throughout the year that our gross margin would be relatively flat on a full year basis which was the case flat for base business and down 10 basis points in total with our acquisitions added in we had a tough gross margin comp in the fourth quarter and because of this said that on our third quarter call that our fourth quarter operating income would be down year over year which it was but only slightly as very good expense management with flat base business operating expenses mitigated the gross margin hit in the quarter for the year we targeted base business operating expense growth of 60 of the rate of gross profit growth and we re right on target with that objective this allowed us to post base business operating margin improvement for the year of 40 basis points which was at the high end of our expected 20 to 40 basis points of base business operating margin improvement one final p l metric i ll quote is our base business contribution margin for the year which was 17 1 this is the ratio of the incremental operating income generated by our incremental revenue and shows the leverage we achieved on our sales growth compared to our 10 9 base business operating margin this is also a good indicator of the continued operating margin growth opportunity we have in the future moving over to the balance sheet and cash flow i ll highlight a couple of things first on the balance sheet our working capital excluding the lease accounting change grew 4 8 for the year compared to our 6 7 sales growth so we had a positive contribution from working capital to our returns as you can see on our statement of cash flows we generated 299 million of cash flow from operations for the year which was 114 of our net income and 180 million more than our 2018 cash flow from operations although we had a little help here from our 2018 inventory pull forward this was a good outcome for us as always working capital management and cash generation will continue to be a focus for us in 2020 given both the solid growth in our earnings and our positive working capital management we re able to increase our return on invested capital to a record 29 3 for the year which was up 160 basis points from our 2018 roic of 27 7 our roic includes the benefit from the asu tax gain but excluding those in both years we still gained 90 basis points of roic improvement so a very good result here i should note that our earnings per share in 2019 as well as our guidance for 2020 largely excludes the benefit from share repurchases in 2019 we repurchased only 149 000 shares at an average price of 148 a share which used just 21 million in cash as a consequence excess cash was used to pay down debt which was 25 lower at the end of the year from the end of 2018 our leverage which is measured on a trailing 12 month debt to ebitda basis finished the year at 1 61 which is approaching the lower end of our preferred 1 5 to two times our belief is that rather than competing with investors for our shares which were up 43 for the year it made sense to be patient and save our debt capacity for the time being until external factors create an opportunity for us to buy in more robustly as you are refining your models for 2020 let me give you some perspectives to keep in mind as pete said we are expecting 6 to 8 base business growth for the year assuming normal weather with greater growth in the first half of the year and particularly in the first quarter given last year s tepid first half results and a bit lower growth in the back half of the year the first quarter may also pull forward some sales from the second quarter as early indicators are that the normal spring early buys may move up from last year resulting in roughly 10 million to 15 million in lower margin sales moving from q2 into q1 on gross margin we look to once again be relatively flat for the year overall with a decline in the first half and more significantly in the first quarter while the back half of the year should be modestly positive i should note that in 2019 there were a couple of forces driving our gross margin comparisons to 2018 both as a result of the pre price increase purchases in 2018 one impact of this was on selling price which provided us with a customer pricing benefit in the first half of the year and was a drag on our margin comparison in the second half of the year due to the tough comp from 2018 recall that our q1 2019 base business gross margin was up 90 basis points and was up 30 basis points in q2 the other impact was from vendor pricing where volume related purchase incentives helped our gross margin in the back half of 2018 but hurt our gross margin throughout 2019 as we were about the benefit of the purchase volumes moved into 2018 as we return to normal purchase volumes in 2020 we expect these vendor incentives to help offset the first half margin challenges leaving us with relatively flat base business gross margin for the year on operating expenses we continue to aim for base business expense growth at 60 of the rate of gross profit growth and although that may not happen every quarter we think that s a reasonable but stretch target for the year having said that we had a couple of benefits on expenses in 2019 which may not recur in 2020 one was the impact of the stronger u s dollar which positively impacted our expense line by 3 million spread throughout the first nine months of the year note that there s an offsetting decline in sales in gp from currency so only a modest negative impact on operating income for the year the other positive expense impact was 3 million in lower incentive based pay in q4 as a result of our flat operating income compared to q4 2018 so we had a 6 million in positive 2019 expense results which we aren t counting on in 2020 another area that could impact our 2020 expense performance is a ramp up in technology investments of roughly an additional 1 million per quarter for a number of projects for these reasons i have labeled our 60 gp growth spending goal a stretch target this year but one which we aim to achieve moving down the p l we had 3 million in higher interest and other nonoperating income for the year which includes the impact of higher debt and interest rates for most of the year as interest rates have moderated and our debt balances have come down this could provide a bit of a tailwind for us in 2020 one other noteworthy comment on our 2019 results was the impact of closing our branch in colombia where we pulled the plug at year end after five years of effort to develop that market the impact from this closure was a 2 million loss with about half of the hit in operating income and the other half a currency hit included in the 3 million i just called out on our interest line this created a 0 05 eps hit for the year and 0 04 of this was in the fourth quarter finally we finished the year with an effective income tax rate excluding the impact of the asu benefit of 25 1 and we expect this to inch up slightly to about 25 5 for 2020 as i look at sell side numbers for 2020 the biggest disconnect from our 2020 guidance appears to be on the tax line and the estimate of our asu impact that concludes my prepared remarks so i ll turn the call back over to our operator to begin our question and answer session questions and answers operator and today s first question comes from david manthey at baird please go ahead david manthey baird analyst all right hi good morning guys mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer morning david manthey baird analyst first off can you discuss any strategic buy programs entering this year that you may have participated in and i guess you gave us the implications for the quarterly gross margin trends but it doesn t feel like there s much of anything but with the gross margin for the year being stable last year expected to be stable this year can you broadly outline the biggest moving parts there in terms of what s pushing it up what s pushing it down to lead you to this net zero area mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer sure sure let me handle that dave so first of all in terms of strategic buy you re really probably referring to what we did in 2018 and the pre price increase purchases and in 2018 as in 2019 we also do our normal seasonal buy in with vendors so we commit to purchases in the fall for delivery at the vendors convenience throughout the fall and into the spring and then we pay for those in the late spring and summer so for 2019 inflation i m sorry for 2020 inflation expectations were a return to normal and that s what we ve seen and so we did our normal kind of fall buy that we ve done in years past and nothing unusual from that perspective in terms of gross margins and the comment about them being flat for the year i provided some kind of highlights in my commentary but just to recap those going back to 2019 first quarter we had the benefit of the pre price increase inventory that we had purchased selling prices increased at the start of the year for all of our customers and so we were able to sell that lower priced inventory in the first quarter and a little bit into the second quarter which gave us a margin benefit which was 90 basis points in the first quarter last year and 30 basis points 20 to 30 in the second quarter at the same time because those purchases that we did were in 2018 instead of 2019 that affected the vendor incentives that we received and those were higher in 2018 and a little bit lower in 2019 and so that impacted our margins overall for 2019 and left us with a flat margin in 2019 considering the big comp difficulty that we had in the fourth quarter so 2020 we have that tough comp in q1 tough comp in q2 we ll benefit from getting back to normal vendor incentives which gives us that flat expectation for the year so a lot of background there so if you have any follow up on that dave let me know but that s how it lays out david manthey baird analyst yes it s very helpful could you also talk about product mix and customer mix and where you re seeing the strength i think you mentioned some of the renovation and construction products you ve got commercial moving up the curve any puts and takes there as it relates to the gross margin for the company maybe offset by the core day to day maintenance and minor repair products peter d arvan president and chief executive officer sure dave i ll take that when i look at our product groups that are growing if you consider that building material for us has been an area of strength over time it continues to build so we had a very good year with building materials last year as i said in my commentary it was up 9 the margin profile on building materials is good of course your cost to handle building materials sometimes can be a little bit more expensive than the lighter boxes commercial is another area that we continue to gain traction in and commercial the margin profile in commercial is going to be a little bit lighter on the very large projects so that is an area that we re continuing to grow and that has a slight impact on our overall margin mix if i think about the chemical portion of our business the that s more of a discretionary or nondiscretionary part of our business that will follow the weather and how often that when the pool opens and how often it gets used and if i think about the inflation that we re looking at this year on chemicals if we have a normal weather year inflation is normal so from a mix perspective i don t look for any overall impact and equipment this year from a margin profile so equipment follows obviously the maintenance and repair and in new construction last year construction we think was down year over year i m sorry the yes the new pool construction we think was down about 3 although the numbers are still preliminary this year assuming a normal year and without having the benefit of price increases on equipment i think our margin profile on that returns back to normal david manthey baird analyst right appreciate the call guys thank you peter d arvan president and chief executive officer jeff thank you operator and our next question today comes from ryan merkel with william blair please go ahead ryan merkel william blair analyst hey thanks so a couple of questions first off sticking with the gross margin in the fourth quarter the decline of 170 basis points how much of that was the price cost goodness not repeating and then how much was lower rebate i think that s what you said mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer ryan i can t break that out precisely or i won t break it out precisely but it was probably 80 is was the tough comp and the smaller piece of it was the incentive piece maybe 90 85 but most significantly was just the tough comp from the year before ryan merkel william blair analyst okay that s really what i was getting at so that kind of gets me there and then i want to get a little more specific on gross margins in 1q 2020 if we can i just want to get a sense of what should the decline be year over year is down 100 basis points sort of the right range you ve got the price cost issue again and then you mentioned the early buy that may move into 1q so i m just trying to think about those two pieces mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean that s a reasonable expectation so the 90 basis points from last year plus the early buy maybe brings it down another 10 to 20 basis points so you re in the neighborhood there ryan merkel william blair analyst okay so the early buy is not that impactful at 10 20 bps mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes that sounds about right ryan merkel william blair analyst okay okay and then i realize i m getting a little picky with this question but 2020 the guidance for 10 to 15 eps growth that s a little below your goal for mid teens i m just trying to figure out what s really the difference is it some of the investment mark that you talked about and then you mentioned a non repeat of some sg a tailwinds just what s different and why isn t it 15 or better because it sounds like an easy weather comp and the market s healthy mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes well one difference first of all ryan is share repurchases which have been stock and trade for us for a number of years and add generally a couple of percent to earnings per share and we re we really didn t have any to speak of in 2019 so no benefit there moving into 2020 from 2019 purchases and at this point we re not anticipating that that will happen we don t generally reflect those in our guidance in any case so that s probably a bigger impact there but yes a little bit of caution on expenses given some investment in nonrecurring that we had nonrecurring benefit that we had last year so and generally we have constraints on industry labor so we think we have good opportunity from a demand standpoint but we have to wait and see how well the contractor base can deal with that given the labor constraints that we and other building industry participants have ryan merkel william blair analyst okay great that s helpful mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer alright operator and our next question today comes from anthony lebiedzinski of sidoti company please go ahead anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst hey guys good morning and thank you for taking the question so just wondering so with the higher capacity that you have just wondering are there any new potentially new product categories that you guys could get into or do you think 2020 sales growth will be more or less kind of more from the same types of product categories that you re in already peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes i ll take that one so when i think about new categories i wouldn t characterize it as new categories as we said during our investor day presentation there is an opportunity with automation so instead of a time clock mechanical time clock to have iot type products that you can see and control your pool from your phone we think there s an opportunity to continue to move from the single speed pumps to variable speed pumps we think that there s some new product opportunities as it relates to some of the green products and if you think about uv systems on pools which contribute to a healthier pool and less chemicals so i wouldn t say that there s a lot of new categories what i would say is that there s a big opportunity with automation because of the 5 5 million in ground pools over three million of them essentially have no automation so what we see in the market is as those pools need to be repaired and maintained that the dealers are starting to offer the automation instead of just a one for one replacement or instead of changing out the halogen light like for like talking to the homeowner about moving that to an led so i don t think it s new categories i just think it is a switch toward higher technology products and if you look at our building material products we re continuing to see growth in outdoor lighting and some of our other hardscapes which are newer for us certainly as compared to the legacy pool products so i think that s what you re going to see driving our growth anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst okay so what s the margin profile of these products that you that pete you just mentioned whether it s automation or led can you give us any color peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes i think it s similar overall i think the margin profile on lighting is very similar when i think about pumps for instance single speed to variable speed probably a little bit lighter on the variable speed than a single speed pump but that s nothing unusual that we haven t seen that trend growing over time and then when i look at the overall automation margin profile on that very similar to the items that it would be replacing anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst got it okay so next year there s some new regulations taking effect that requires variable speed pumps is there any other new regulation that you are aware of that could impact you guys peter d arvan president and chief executive officer no i don t think so and that one on the variable speed pump replacement for all single speed remember that takes effect next year mid july of 2021 and honestly manufacturers are all trying to figure out which pumps they have that could hit the doe specification some of the manufacturers think that they can do it with single speed pumps others are saying no and will have to be switched to variable speed and then of course you have it happens later in the season anyway or midway through the year and then by the time inventories are worked through i really see that as a 2022 play there will be limited impact in 2021 i see it taking effect more in 2022 but honestly i think we ll have a better view of the impact on that as the manufacturers sort through their product portfolio and figure out what they re going to do to meet those regulations anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst got it okay and lastly as far as new sales centers what s kind of the breakdown you guys are thinking for blue versus green for this year peter d arvan president and chief executive officer i think it will be a similar number this year we had one in 2018 we had one new green center we had one in canada blue one in europe and then the rest were in u s blue i would think it s probably going to be a similar profile going into the 2020 season anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst okay thank you and best of luck peter d arvan president and chief executive officer thank you operator and our next question today comes from ken zener with keybanc please go ahead ken zener keybanc analyst hey good morning peter d arvan president and chief executive officer good morning ken zener keybanc analyst glad you re not charging more for those mixed up products as a potential customer of yours peter d arvan president and chief executive officer only for you ken zener keybanc analyst so given your comments about 1q gross margins because of prebuys etc in 2018 since you re addressing the gross margin mark could you talk to if you expect the base operating leverage to degrade by the amount you said in gross margin just so no one s surprised mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes for sure there will be a reduction in operating leverage in the first quarter ken zener keybanc analyst would the ebit change be similar to the gross margin change mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer i will let you model that out ken but it s ken zener keybanc analyst you want to say 50 50 just so we can understand the sg a actions you ll be taking mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer i m not going to comment ken i d have to pull out my model and go through it ken zener keybanc analyst oh boy oh boy mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer i m prepared to but i think you can figure that out ken zener keybanc analyst well there s no reason sg a operating leverage would change at all just because the gross margin s swinging around right i mean in short mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer no for the year no i believe we would expect similar kind of performance as we ve had and as i said we look for 20 to 40 basis points of operating margin improvement that our contribution margins last year was 17 so that s well above our operating margin and it provides a healthy ramp opportunity for us to continue growing operating margins over time ken zener keybanc analyst all right general question peter about the backlog comment i mean with new sales down last year i mean is there anything really changing you keep bringing up labor constraints but there s no new the contribution or the level of backlog in your comments thinking today seems to be very similar to where we were last year which is supporting 6 to 8 base growth i mean is that a simple way to assess it or is it stronger peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes i would tell you that the backlog is good i just attended a bunch of industry shows and dealer meetings in the last month and i will tell you that my sense is is that optimism is very very high with the dealers and i mean and from just my take on it is everybody is upbeat and there is a fair amount or good backlog that everybody is sitting on right now so ken zener keybanc analyst so about financing are people talking about when you re out there with the dealers or folks i mean just give us a context for how much is paid out of cash as opposed to borrowed and is there any easing of credit that any commentary you picked up there mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean i don t see any significant shift in financing kenneth still banks are skewed toward better creditworthy the borrowers and the lower end of the credit spectrum is more challenged so if you look at it from an industry standpoint we had a big middle market business years ago that really never came back after the recession and that really hasn t changed ken zener keybanc analyst then the last area buybacks if you re not buying back and you re not going to necessarily tell us when you re buying back can you give us some more thinking i mean you talked about opportunity can you just expand on that that is a little bit of a i want to say a shift but i mean you guys have pulled back what would at least be a very steady cadence right you re going to invest in the business you re going to do dividends and the rest is coming back to shareholders it seems like it s eased up a little bit please clarify if that interpretation is wrong and what does an opportunity look like i guess i mean if you could expand on that a little bit mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean really ken there s no change in our long term capital allocation strategy always very very consistent over time which is invest everything in the business make acquisitions what we have done and we will continue to do and we think by the way there s good opportunities in this market environment for acquisitions so that will get some attention and then a dividend program which should grow with earnings over time and then excess cash going to share repurchases it just so happens that in the short term with the 43 run up in stock price last year and where we sit today we think that saving some capacity for a time when we re not competing with shareholders is going to be good for us but that s not going to be two three years down the road that should be in the foreseeable future so that s about as specific as i want to get but there s really no change in long term strategy just how we re executing in the short term ken zener keybanc analyst all right thank you very much mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yep thank you beth operator and our next question today comes from blake hirschman with stephens please go ahead blake hirschman stephens analyst good morning guys first off within the top line outlook for 2020 curious to hear how you re thinking about the relative growth between new pool construction because you mentioned i think you said it was down most likely in 2019 if you expect that to come back kind of versus the large and small r r work peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes good question blake as i said the preliminary numbers show that the new pool construction year over year is probably going to be down 2 to 3 and they re still buttoning that up so that s why i cautioned that was a preliminary comment i think that is almost 100 driven by weather and consider that there s only a certain number of buildable days during the year as where weather permits and we lost many of those days in the first half of last year and then there s only a certain amount of labor that can be applied to those projects so i say that demand is very solid for new pools i see nothing that would indicate that there s any softening of demand in for new pools and new construct or remodel so when i think about the mix i think it returns to our normal if you look at us our new pool construction probably makes up 15 to 16 of our total business and reno is another 25 and then you ve got the maintenance and repair the nondiscretionary part makes up the balance and i think that from a mix perspective 2020 is probably going to look an awful lot like that i don t see people saying i m not going to do remodel i m going to do this or that i think it really i think there s general pent up demand for both and i don t see any of the dealers changing their profile of work blake hirschman stephens analyst got it and then i could have missed it but did you guys say what the top four market growth looks like versus the seasonal markets or anything along those lines peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes when we look at the overall i think the top four markets we had relative strength in florida florida was very good arizona had a tough so above the total business arizona was lighter simply because of a very poor first half the back half of arizona was strong texas was probably about in line with the business but again much skewed toward the back half of the year and california stronger in back half than the first half because they were very cold and wet but in california the fourth quarter was specifically in southern california they got a fair amount of rain which kind of dampened things out so they were slightly below the total blake hirschman stephens analyst got it and then just lastly on m a are you guys still pretty focused on green commercial international are those kind of some of the bigger spots that you re looking to expand in now mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer well yes domestic blue as well so we look across all aspects of the business and we see a fairly active market we ve been in 10 years of economic growth so if there s someone out there looking to sell their business now it s probably not a bad time for them in their minds and so we ll see what happens but we think there will be some good opportunities for us blake hirschman stephens analyst got it thanks a lot i ll get back into mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator and our next question today comes from alex maroccia of berenberg please go ahead alex maroccia berenberg analyst hey good morning guys so i m looking at the commercial business right now and you ve stated in the past that it typically grows around 4 a year so how are you beating that market at the moment peter d arvan president and chief executive officer i think we ve invested in salespeople we ve invested in inventory i mean on the commercial business you have to have it s a different expertise because it s largely a bid and spec job for a portion of it on the new construction and then when it comes to maintenance and repair when you have competition pools you have to have it in stock so if there s a competition pool that has a pump go down or a heater go down it s not a question of well who s got the best price it really is a question of hey do you have it in stock so we ve invested in regional inventory to make sure that we have kind of all the important inventory within a reasonable lead time to where the concentration of pools are and like i said we ve invested in talent and i think we ve gotten a lot smarter and a lot better in tackling that business so i think it s just it s share gain based on our investments in people and products alex maroccia berenberg analyst got it and just a follow up on that given that it s about 5 of total sales currently how much larger do you think that could get in the future peter d arvan president and chief executive officer well i think our overall market share on commercial pool we re in the 10 range and if you look at what our overall market share is on the rest of the business that implies that there s a fair amount of room for us to grow so but there s also a portion of that business that we don t participate in that has to do with bulk chemicals so of what we consider the addressable market i think we could easily double the business that we have alex maroccia berenberg analyst okay got it and then second question for me is i m just looking at the inventory number from 2018 and 2019 you re around 22 as a percentage of sales there trying to think of free cash flow for 2020 do you see that inventory number dropping anywhere near the historic 20 or so percent range any time soon mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes in terms of the percent i m not as i would say that the inventory growth should be modest this year we have an opportunity to grow that a little bit less than we have the last couple of years we ve had an impact from acquisitions of course we had an impact this year end from vendors who shipped a bit more on early buys than they normally do now those were on dated terms so it didn t impact cash flow but that helped push up inventory growth a little bit and then we had the big inflation on inventory from 2018 into 2019 so add 4 to the inventory levels for inflation which pushed it up a little bit so given all those factors and really a focus on our part to look at making sure that we re managing that well i don t expect to see the same kind of growth and probably getting back closer to the historic levels that you re talking about alex maroccia berenberg analyst great operator today s next question comes from garik shmois of loop capital please go ahead garik shmois loop capital analyst hey this is jeff stevenson on for garik and yes my first question is just on the 6 to 8 base business forecast anything you could call out on differences between the blue and green businesses as far as expectations for next year peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes good question jeff i think about growth opportunities for both businesses a little bit differently the green business is has a big irrigating component irrigation is tied to new construction and new construction has been relatively strong and continues to look that way so from a base business growth probably the green business growth profile in that area is a little bit better than blue but not significantly different garik shmois loop capital analyst got it no that makes sense and then at your investor day you mentioned that cost inflation will be more modest in 2020 in that kind of 1 to 2 range just wondering is that still a good way to look at it and have there been any changes that you would call out that are more or less than original expectation mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes no i think that s still the way we re viewing things based on the feedback from suppliers and the increases that were announced it looks to be a much more normal year in that regard garik shmois loop capital analyst got it and one last one i know you only called out the first quarter asu tax benefit but just when you look at 2020 is there anything you could call out do you think it could be more front half loaded or anything as far as steady cadence here to help with modeling purposes mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer well we gave some guidance if your parse our comments i think we gave some guidance throughout the p l starting with the top line and the revenue growth expectations greater in the first quarter due to the easier comps we have really first quarter first half with less growth in the back half some early buy from a customer standpoint moving from q2 into q1 gave quite a bit of color on margins on expenses didn t really provide a lot of modeling color other than overall for the year so i think that we ve given about as much or more than we normally do in terms of kind of how the year looks like it s going to shape up at this point so i ll leave it at that i think garik shmois loop capital analyst understood thanks and best of luck mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer i thank you operator and ladies and gentlemen this concludes the question and answer session i d like to turn the call back over to mr arvan for any closing remarks peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes thank you thank you all for joining our call today our next call will be scheduled for april 30 where we ll discuss the

federal reserve board nominee judy shelton faced deep skepticism from republicans and democrats on the senate banking committee on thursday as lawmakers challenged her independence from president donald trump and characterized her thinking as too far outside the mainstream to trust with the nation s economy after the hearing three republican senators indicated she had not fully alleviated their concerns enough to sink her nomination in a committee divided between 13 of trump s fellow republicans and 12 democrats who are unlikely to vote in her favor over the course of the roughly two hour hearing she found herself having to back away from prior views explain that she would not pursue a common north american currency with canada and mexico if confirmed as a fed governor and even apologize for comparing a currency forger s challenge of the federal government s dominance over money to civil rights pioneer rosa parks challenge of segregation laws i apologize for the comparison i truly do shelton said of an incident raised by alabama democratic senator doug jones in which a north carolina man issued millions of dollars of his own precious metal backed currency i believe he was testing the idea that money needed to be backed by gold and silver shelton explained is that something you want to test jones shot back summing up committee concerns about past shelton writings seeming to support a return to something like a gold or other asset backed standard to keep the value of the dollar stable no senator said shelton a member of the trump transition team and a long time conservative author and commentator on financial issues it was one of a series of pointed exchanges between senators and shelton an economist with a long track record criticizing the fed and questioning at least in theory whether central banks can even do the job assigned to them not in the mainstream four previous trump appointees to the fed failed to clear the senate a sign of the weight congress has put on keeping the country s monetary policy as free as possible of political interference given trump s open verbal attacks on the fed and demand for lower interest rates asked about trump s war by tweet against the fed shelton responded i don t censor what someone says but during the hearing pennsylvania republican senator patrick toomey called her views about using the fed to manage the value of the dollar against other currencies a very very dangerous path to go down trump has often blamed the fed for a rising dollar which he argues has hurt exports shelton has often written about the need for a sound dollar a spokesman for toomey said afterwards that the senator was undecided and that shelton s answers didn t alleviate his concerns alabama senator richard shelby also has not decided at this point i know he still has some concerns the senator s communications director blair taylor told reuters shelton who holds a doctorate in business administration and has been sharply critical of the federal reserve in her writings and commentary pledged broadly that she would be an independent thinker who would work well with existing fed officials i pledge to be independent in my decision making and frankly no one tells me what to do shelton said deflecting questions about her past writings that for example characterized the fed s setting of a short term interest rate as similar to soviet central planning i don t claim to be in the mainstream of economists i would bring my own perspective but i think the intellectual diversity strengthens the discussion senate democrats said flatly that they do not trust her shelton has flip flopped on too many issues to be confirmed said ohio democratic senator sherrod brown she is far outside the mainstream she is outside the ideological spectrum two nominees a second nominee christopher waller a career economist who is currently the research director of the st louis federal reserve faced few questions about his views both were nominated by trump to fill vacant seats on the fed s seven member washington based board of governors both waller and shelton released opening statements on wednesday ahead of their hearings that offered few clues about their views on monetary policy beyond promising to promote policies that support financial stability and help the fed meet its goals of full employment and price stability the two emphasized the fed s accountability to congress which oversees the central bank both said they agreed with many of the opinions held by current fed

over to michael arougheti who will start with some quarterly and full year financial and business highlights michael arougheti director co founder chief executive officer and president thank you veronica good afternoon everyone our fourth quarter s results capped off a record year for ares with top line management fee growth in excess of 20 and fee related earnings growth in excess of 25 our strong management fee related earnings also supported realized income growth in excess of 25 in the year as an active year of modernization supplemented our base core earnings 2019 was yet another solid year for aum growth as we raised 24 billion representing year over year growth of 14 we continue to benefit from a broad consolidation trend as limited partners shrink their number of gp relationships to achieve economies of scale and invest more with their preferred managers to illustrate this point our existing lps represented more than 80 of our gross capital raised as they reupped into successor funds or invest in other strategies across the platform at an impressive rate during 2019 over 150 lps invested with us directly including 100 existing and 51 new to ares interestingly existing lps invested more than 4 times the capital than our new investors growth of wallet share from our existing clients continues to be a great opportunity for us we continue to broaden and deepen our relationships with our investors today 80 of our aum from direct investors is invested in more than one ares fund and over 50 is invested in two or more of our investment groups with all that said we believe that we re just scratching the surface and we re growing in all of our major investor categories particularly with global pension funds insurance companies sovereign wealth funds and private banks heading into 2020 we re embarking on a meaningful period of capital raising with several of our largest flagship funds either in the market or soon to be launched we currently believe that 2020 fundraising could surpass the record 36 billion that we raised in 2018 we re currently in the market we re planning to come to market this year with several flagship funds across our three businesses including our sixth corporate private equity fund with a target of 9 25 billion our fifth european direct lending fund our second u s junior capital direct lending fund our third opportunistic real estate fund in the u s where we ve already held initial closings in excess of 700 million our third european value add real estate fund our inaugural alternative credit and climate infrastructure private equity funds and we ll be completing the fundraising in the coming months of our inaugural special opportunities fund which is now at 1 6 billion against the target of 2 billion we ve discussed in the past generally speaking based on historical experience successor funds are 1 5 times larger on average than predecessor funds in addition to all of this activity and possibly other commingled funds that we may launch later in the year we expect to remain very active also with clos open ended funds and strategic separate account mandates as our core business continues to expand and perform well we re constantly investing for future growth we re expanding into new areas beyond our core business that we believe will provide meaningful aum and earnings growth in the future these strategic initiatives include our insurance expansion via the launch of aspida the launch of ares australia management with our joint venture partner fidante and our recently announced planned expansion into asia through our pending ssg capital transaction i do want to spend a minute on ssg with 6 2 billion in aum ssg is a leading pan asian alternative asset manager focusing on credit and special situations investing ssg has strong investment performance a global investor base extensive relationships and significant infrastructure built across several countries in this high growth strategic region we believe that ssg is a clear market leader in the asian private credit markets and when added to our leading u s and european franchises cements our global leadership position in private credit while we haven t provided financial details this transaction will be modestly accretive out of the gate but more importantly it provides a strong foundation to build something meaningfully accretive to us both strategically and financially in the years to come and we couldn t be more excited during 2019 we also began to recognize more of the benefits from our 2018 c corp conversion which drove more institutional investors to our company and a significant rise in shareholder value the structural changes made in 2018 including providing our shareholders with voting rights facilitated a growing roster of not only institutional investors but also index and passive investors we believe that we re still in the early days of our shareholder transformation based on the demand that we continue to experience next to touch on performance we had another strong showing across all of our businesses in 2019 starting with credit we had a great year generating low to mid teens returns across our significant funds in liquid and illiquid credit our loan and high yield strategies in particular demonstrated outperformance versus their benchmarks since inception and delivered top decile and top quartile performance in 2019 with 10 and 16 1 gross returns our significant real estate funds had another strong year with our u s and european equity funds generating gross returns of 16 8 and 12 7 respectively and from a private equity standpoint our corporate private equity fund composite posted a gross return of greater than 20 for the year from an investing and deployment standpoint we had an active year with total drawdown deployment of approximately 22 billion up from 17 billion in 2018 with growth across all three of our investment groups in today s competitive market we use our broad platform of over 450 investment professionals to source quality assets where we have an informational and experienced edge and where value can be created i d now like to turn the call over to mike mcferran who will walk through our results in more detail and talk about the outlook on future earnings mike michael mcferran partner chief financial officer chief operating officer thanks mike i ll start with a review of our fourth quarter and full year results 2019 capped off another year of impressive growth across our key financial metrics the fourth quarter represented our 11th consecutive quarter of growth in fee related earnings which totaled 88 7 million this represents an increase of 30 over the fourth quarter of 2018 2019 full year fee related earnings totaled 323 7 million an increase of 27 over 2018 our fourth quarter results translate into a 32 fee related earnings margin for the quarter which is an increase from 30 for the fourth quarter of 2018 but slightly down from 33 for the third quarter of 2019 due to an elevated level of general and administrative expenses the increase was primarily attributable to approximately 6 5 million of costs pertaining to an sec matter related to certain of our compliance policies and procedures we believe this matter is nearing resolution and that the bulk of the expenses are behind us looking ahead to 2020 while there may be some fluctuations on a quarter to quarter basis for g a expenses we expect that full year g a expenses in 2020 would increase more moderately between 5 and 10 over 2019 levels with respect to margins we estimate full year 2020 fre margins will be approximately 34 which is more aligned with what they would have been for the fourth quarter after the absent the aforementioned sec matter costs in addition we expect to achieve a higher run rate margin of 35 at some point during 2020 realized income for the quarter totaled 206 1 million which represents an increase of 82 3 million or 66 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 for the full year 2019 realized income totaled 503 5 million an increase of 108 1 million or 27 from 2018 after tax realized income per class a common share net of preferred stock distributions was 0 67 for the fourth quarter and 1 67 for the full year an 18 increase over prior year levels i do want to touch on our effective tax rates and thoughts on realizations going forward with respect to our 2019 taxes our full year effective tax rate on realized income assuming all shares were converted to class a common stock was approximately 16 3 with a tax rate on fee related earnings of 12 1 while our tax rate is the function of numerous variables we currently estimate 2020 effective tax rates in the 15 to 18 range for realized income and the 8 to 11 range on fee related earnings again assuming 100 of our shares were converted to a class a common basis with respect to net performance income realizations while the timing of realizations is obviously hard to predict we are well positioned to continue to grow net realized performance income from 2019 levels in the years ahead the following data points might be helpful we have increased our net performance income at a compound annual growth rate of 11 2 over the past five years in addition we have increased our incentive eligible and incentive generating aum rates of 18 5 and 12 8 over the same 5 year period as you can see the foundation for continued growth is reflected in these underlying metrics in addition we started 2019 with 249 million of net accrued performance income we ended 2019 with 348 2 million of net accrued performance income an increase of 39 despite a good year of realizations the growth in net accrued performance income coupled with the growth in incentive eligible aum of over 11 during 2019 leaves us well positioned for realizations in what remains a very favorable market backdrop also as we are now raising our sixth flagship buyout fund we are actively harvesting more mature investments in our predecessor private equity funds next let me spend a few minutes on our assets under management and related metrics our aum reached 148 9 billion an increase of 14 over the prior year driven by another strong year of fundraising our fee paying aum increased over 18 year over year as a meaningful amount of our aum was converted to fee paying aum upon investment our strong drawdown deployment of 21 5 billion reflecting the growth of our platform was up 25 from the prior year which accelerated growth in our fee paying aum we have good visibility on future fee paying aum and management fee growth through the embedded management fees that we expect to generate from capital already raised but not yet deployed also known as our shadow aum we ended the year with near record amounts of dry powder and shadow aum and these balances represent the opportunity to capture value from existing capital upon deployment our available capital totaled 34 6 billion down less than 10 year over year but our shadow aum of 27 1 billion was relatively flat despite the 20 billion plus of deployment of this 27 1 billion approximately 25 2 billion is available for future deployment with corresponding annual management fees totaling 233 5 million or approximately 23 of our last 12 months management fees next i also wanted to elaborate on the significant expansion in our shareholder base we have experienced since we converted to a corporation in 2018 since that time we have experienced strong growth in our trading volume public float and shareholder base as we made our stock easier to own our trading volume is about 6 times higher than before our conversion leading to improved liquidity and larger position sizes in our top shareholders we have increased the number of institutional investors by more than 4 times since converting and nearly 90 of our float is represented by loan only or passive funds we added over 150 new institutional investors since converting our index ownership continued to expand through 2019 with the addition of the russell index funds ares is now represented in various vanguard crsp russell s p and msci indices in addition to the larger index providers we are also seeing significant demand from shadow indices that track the larger indices as a percentage of our float index and passive ownership is now in the high teens up from nearly 0 before our conversion despite the progress we have made we continue to see more interest in our shares from institutional investors and we are excited for the increased focus our industry is experiencing last before handing the mic back to mike i wanted to recap our capital management policy that we put into place upon our corporate conversion as all of you i believe are aware our capital management policy is to peg the growth of our dividend to the expected growth in our after tax fee related earnings we don t look to achieve a retroactive or prospective fixed payout ratio but our intent is for after tax fee related earnings to support the dividend and for us to retain realized performance income for the primary purpose of investing in growth with that background let s look at 2019 based on 1 67 of after tax realized income per class a common share for the year and 1 28 of dividend for class a common share for the year we retained 0 39 per share which has enabled us to have modestly less leverage than in past periods and be positioned with increased liquidity to pursue growth opportunities including our insurance business through aspida financial our announced acquisition our announced transaction with ssg and support our organic growth as we embark on a period of meaningful fundraising ahead of us as mike described mike will now close with his thoughts on our future outlook michael arougheti director co founder chief executive officer and president thanks mike looking ahead to 2020 our business is extremely well positioned to grow with significant momentum and visibility in our core business we believe our future is bright as we embark on a new fundraising cycle of flagship funds and prudently invest the significant levels of shadow aum that we ve already raised our clients continue to trust us with a greater share of their capital and with our expanding product suite we re continually taking additional market share in a rapidly growing global industry in addition we re investing significantly for the future we believe that our recent strategic initiatives have meaningfully diversified our company and improved our growth prospects in future years we re looking forward to reporting progress on all of these new initiatives in the coming quarters and years ahead as we ve highlighted in the past our business is structured and well positioned to outperform in any market environment 2020 may or may not be the year where markets slow or turn but to be clear our capabilities are most evident during volatile times our world class investment capital raising and business ops teams our available capital of close to 35 billion and our firm s strong liquidity position have us very well positioned to capitalize on changing markets when and if they occur i want to close by thanking the entire ares team for all the hard work and effort in delivering outstanding results in 2019 it really was a wonderful year all around and as always we appreciate your time and support for our company and with that operator we d like to open up the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from craig siegenthaler with credit suisse please go ahead craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst thanks first just looking for an update on the real estate business really a year after david roth joined from blackstone and can you remind us how you re thinking of expanding outside your opportunistic business including maybe a core vertical michael arougheti director co founder chief executive officer and president sure we could not be more pleased with the progress that we ve been making in real estate not only since david s joined but since bryan has joined and supplemented our already strong leadership and our debt business on the fundraising side we had very great success on our fifth european fund that closed out last year hitting the hard cap this year we are now in the market with our third opportunistic fund under david and his partner s leadership and our next series of european value add fund in europe both of those funds have significant momentum early indication is that they will meet or exceed the cover and not surprisingly all of that is on the backs of very strong performance across all of our strategies and you can see that in the published information around some of our core flagship fund returns in the real estate business importantly acre has really found its footing and has great momentum that stock has been trading consistently above book value for the better part of two years continues to raise its dividend and beat dividend expectations and we ve now put that company back on a meaningful path to growth with a recent stock offering last month our real estate debt business away from the public company continues to scale as we grow our open end fund around our mortgage lending business and i think there s now a meaningful opportunity to take that franchise into europe leveraging our market leading franchise on the equity side to replicate some of the success that we ve had on the debt side when you go through the segment reporting what you ll see is significant margin expansion on the real estate side and as we ve talked historically about the consolidated margin the real estate business has brought down the margin still not quite where we want it to be but you ll see meaningful improvement given the scaling of funds so we re really really happy everything is going as well as we could hope with regard to core we do have a very significant development capability as we ve talked about before i think we have two opportunities specifically around your question craig i think core plus and developed core is clearly something that fits strategically for us i think the big question for us is whether that s a buy versus a build and that conversation is ongoing craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst thanks michael just as a follow up i actually thought it was a pretty big deal that arcc raised equity capital for the first time in i think about five years just in the fourth quarter so i know you plan to grow arcc assets and fees via leverage but could we see additional common equity raises in the bdc vehicle this year michael arougheti director co founder chief executive officer and president could you yes i think as kipp talked about on yesterday s earnings call the capital management policy there is really balancing deployment with getting into the target leverage range and expanding the equity base so just to put it in perspective arcc raised about 66 million of equity on a 7 5 billion equity base through an atm program i think thinking about the atm program as a tool for arcc to manage its balance sheet and leverage profile is the best way to think about it but if deployment continues to be strong and on the historical trajectory i think we could expect that the equity base at arcc will continue to grow thanks craig and i m also happy it sounds like we have someone on the call whose last name may be harder to pronounce than mine craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst thank you michael arougheti director co founder chief executive officer and president thanks greg and i m also happy it sounds like we have someone on the call whose last name may be harder to pronounce than mine operator our next question comes from alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead alex blostein goldman sachs analyst might be easier to pronounce but still incorrectly pronounced it s all good so thanks so a question for you guys around the my favorite topic fre margins so look i appreciate your comments around g a growth moderating to sounds like 5 to 10 but the 34 fre margin for 2020 implies quite significant acceleration in compensation despite the fact that a lot of the management fee growth that you guys are talking about is coming from either deployment of shadow aum that s already been raised the next vintage funds where again teams are kind of in place and recovery of part i fees etc so all of these feel like there should be much higher incremental margins so what s driving acceleration and compensation for 2020 maybe help us think through the timing of some of these revenues coming through and that s what the difference could be between the full year margin and the exits maybe talk a little bit about the exit fre margin as we re thinking through this next fundraising cycle michael mcferran partner chief financial officer chief operating officer absolutely alex a couple of thoughts why don t we put this in context for 2019 our margin was 31 so in our view guiding that we expect to achieve a 34 margin in 2020 i think on a year over year basis is actually pretty good and while we totally expect to have a lot of growth over the coming year a lot of the revenue from that growth hits in 2020 but a lot of that hits as we raise capital especially in the credit funds and have a full year run rate off of funds and real estate or private equity that would be reflected in 2021 so i think again with all that in mind 31 to 34 is great second i did clearly highlight for you that we expect to hit 35 during the year so could we do better than 34 possibly it was two or three quarters ago that i said we d be 18 months out from hitting something in the mid 30s and a couple of quarters later we were in the mid 30s so as you appreciate we don t we have forecast about expectations of timing of capital raising timing of deployment we think we have a very good visibility on this but just specific dates obviously a little harder to predict and we re very conscious of not wanting to message something we don t think we can deliver and we re very confident we can deliver a 34 margin and set and at some point that you have a run rate above it and if it ends up above 34 it ends up being 35 for the year that wouldn t surprise us either on compensation i m not expecting growth over and above our historical growth rates alex blostein goldman sachs analyst okay got it thanks for that other question for you again maybe a little bit more specific so i saw you guys signed an agreement with ss c as your i guess core provider going forward what kind of when does that phase in what kind of benefits is that going to create for the expense base over time kind of how should we think about that new relationship michael mcferran partner chief financial officer chief operating officer sure it s not a new relationship we have ss c as a fund administrator for us we ve had a contract with them i think back to 2013 that contract was getting closer to maturity we renewed the contract with them they announced it in the press release as far as the benefits look the longer we re with them the more we re able to optimize the service delivery model and they continue to invest in technology and the like we reap benefits the contract renewal effect january 1 as we grow and have scale and able to leverage technology on what the economics become increasingly more favorable to us that is reflected in what i would call decelerating g a growth we expect for the year but overall i wouldn t say there s anything new new about this this is just kind of continuation of an existing relationship alex blostein goldman sachs analyst got it thanks so much operator our next question comes from gerry o hara with jefferies please go ahead gerry o hara jefferies analyst great thanks for taking my questions this morning maybe just one on fundraising there s obviously a number of products that are in the pipeline but perhaps you could help us just sort of understand or think about the staging of how some of that might be coming online in terms of fee paying aum throughout the course of the year and quite possibly into next year as well michael arougheti director co founder chief executive officer and president sure just to remind folks that as a general rule our pe oriented strategies both corporate and real estate will pay on committed assets and the bulk of our credit funds will pay on invested and so obviously when we raise a larger successor pe fund regardless of the strategy we see a meaningful step up in the base management fee and fre rate within that family funds even as we re stepping down the fee rate on historical funds on the credit side obviously the embedded value of the capital raising momentum that we have shows up most dramatically in the shadow aum numbers and when you look through the investor presentation you see where the composition of the shadow aum lies you ll see that it s predominantly within the credit business if you were to look at the fre growth in 2020 what we re most proud of is we were actually able to deliver that without any meaningful flagship fundraises over the course of the year now not to say that 24 billion is not a great year it s actually meaningfully in excess of our historical average but 2019 was really about deployment across the platform and monetizing the management fee base within the shadow aum i think looking into 2020 it s going to be a little bit more of a balanced picture of continued deployment the turning on some of these larger flagship pe funds both corporate and real estate and then an acceleration of the growth rate into 2021 as the credit shadow aum continues to build on the back of our fifth european fund our second junior debt fund and continued growth across the liquid credit platform gerry o hara jefferies analyst okay that s helpful and maybe one for mike mcferran if i heard correctly g a we should sort of anticipate a 5 to 6 increase and if you just wouldn t mind clarifying over the full year 2019 number and then just sort of what some of the incremental investment in the business might consist of perhaps as it relates to some of the initiatives that you laid out or just other investments that would be helpful thank you michael arougheti director co founder chief executive officer and president sure so just to clarify i said it was 5 to 10 in my prepared remarks as far as the growth of g a but some of it s just frankly a function as the firm has grown meaningfully so i think for us to show the type of growth rates we ve had with g a growth well inside of that demonstrating scale of our business again 5 to 10 considering the amount of all that we re doing next year i think is a reflection of our discipline on expense management which we ve been very effective at and we mike in his prepared remarks talked about there are a lot of initiatives of growth avenues on the go in addition to all the organic growth we re focused on so that s all that s baked into that hopefully that answers your question gerry o hara jefferies analyst yeah absolutely thanks for taking my questions this morning michael arougheti director co founder chief executive officer and president absolutely thanks sure operator our next question comes from mike carrier with bank of america please go ahead mike carrier bank of america analyst alright great thanks for taking the question first question you guys did multiple like strategic transactions you ve got the speed on the insurance side you mentioned the ssg the australia jv and then i think the clo the crestline denali new transaction just how should all these like impact maybe the earnings ahead and probably more importantly the growth profile in some of those areas relative to the past michael arougheti director co founder chief executive officer and president sure each one is different and it s interesting because of all the things that you highlighted i think it s a good indication of the types of things that we can do strategically given how the business is positioned and where we see either gaps in product or new addressable markets crestline denali fairly small transaction as we you saw in the press release acquired some management contracts the good news is when we do things like that which is really a bulk up trade for our liquid credit team we can drop down any acquired management fee revenue at a very high marginal profit rate so if we re in that business acquiring clo management contracts they re going to really drop down at close to 100 marginal profit so a really nice way to generate earnings accretion but i would say that that s a tuck in not a new strategic avenue of growth obviously given our current leadership position in the clo market australia and ssg i think are two really good indications of how we can take existing capability and track record and existing product and open up new geographies aam obviously a little bit more on the distribution side given what we see as a long term opportunity to satisfy demand for fixed income product in the superannuation market and ssg as i said really a gateway into the pan asia region that team their approach to market their approach to investing is so in line with the way that we approach our business and culturally they re so aligned with our approach we just have very very high expectations for what we can do with that platform going forward today it s predominantly focused as we mentioned on direct lending and special situations given the capability of that team and given the capabilities of our platform our expectation over time is that the entirety of our business will be in asia i e not just credit but private equity and real estate so we re excited about that and then aspida it s early days but we think that we have a wonderful platform to build from we have a high conviction on a high growth rate there we ve committed significant resources and capital to make sure that that grows according to plan and as we ve articulated on prior calls we re already in the market lining up third party capital partners to help make sure that we can scale that business the way that we want to across the plan so other than crestline i actually think that each of those three is opening up new markets and new geographies for us that are going to be very meaningful contributors to the profit picture over the next three to five years mike carrier bank of america analyst okay all right thanks a lot and then mike mcferran maybe just on the g a item just one more question just on the 5 to 10 for 2020 makes sense given all you guys are doing but i just want to make sure is that on the stated like 2019 like g a expense or is that adjusting like the elevated level that you had in the fourth quarter and then just on the sec matter i don t know if you can provide any more color if it was operational or something else and then do you feel like most of the cost related to that are behind you michael mcferran partner chief financial officer chief operating officer sure so starting with the g a it is off the stated 2019 number on the sec matter we really can t say anything more than we ve already said because it s as i mentioned it s nearing resolution but it s not resolved so we can t say anything further until it is but as i highlighted in my prepared remarks mike it is we believe the bulk of the costs are behind us and reflect in the q4 numbers on this mike carrier bank of america analyst got it okay thanks a lot michael mcferran partner chief financial officer chief operating officer absolutely operator our next question comes from kenneth lee with rbc capital markets please go ahead kenneth lee rbc capital markets analyst thanks for taking my question just a follow up on ssg capital you remarked upon the direct lending opportunities within the asia region just wanted to see if you could just at a very high level comment on the market dynamics and relative environment for generating returns within direct lending in asia versus what you re seeing in the u s and europe michael arougheti director co founder chief executive officer and president sure look one of the reasons why we were attracted to the platform other than the cultural affinity is that this team has been investing across the region as a partnership with demonstrated results for over 15 years which actually quite rare to see given where some of those markets are just in their own life cycles we ve looked for years at organic and inorganic growth opportunities in the region and it became abundantly clear to us that we really needed to acquire a beachhead there with people that we trust that actually had local presence local relationships and a deep local track record direct lending in asia is a little tricky and it depends on jurisdiction obviously the rule of law depending on which country you re in is different than we re used to operating in here which means that the product positioning needs to be different we re generally taking a different set of risks for a different set of returns and we and our soon to be partners at ssg do that eyes wide open but similar to what we saw in europe and the playbook that we executed there growing that business from 0 to 25 plus billion over the last eight or nine years these markets develop very quickly even in markets where we see banks dominating or lending money at what we would think are irrational risk adjusted returns for policy reasons as these markets develop mature and scale the opportunity for non bank credit products accelerates with it and so we actually think we re entering the market at a really interesting time the nonbank markets in india and china and indonesia are actually fairly well developed fairly fragmented in certain markets the rule of law is improving the capital markets ecosystem alongside the private credit markets are growing and improving so i think one of the big opportunities here is to actually continue to move the ssg platform into lower risk lower return lending similar to what we ve done in both our u s and european franchises if you look at the product set early on in u s it was predominantly a higher risk higher return mezz type business same for europe and now when you look at what we ve built globally across the direct lending franchise it s really capturing the full risk return opportunity in the capital stack and we d expect asia to develop in a similar manner kenneth lee rbc capital markets analyst great very helpful and just one follow up if i may you touched upon this in the prepared remarks in terms of how you view dividend growth as being tied to expected fre growth and certainly there was a meaningful increase in dividends for this year in terms of what it signals to us in terms of potential fre growth would you say that most of the potential fre growth is going to be driven largely in terms of the fundraising they expect this year coupled with arcc and just wondering whether there s any other key factors that we should keep in mind michael mcferran partner chief financial officer chief operating officer sure i think mike touched on this a little bit but just to elaborate we if you look at 2020 with the expected growth in fre and expected aum growth i know mike in his prepared remarks mentioned within 2020 if all that we have coming could exceed our prior record year in capital raising which was 2018 where we had 36 billion but not all funds are raised day one and not all revenues turned on when those funds are raised so i think 2020 is reflecting a year where there will be revenue growth coming from incremental capital raised but similar to 2019 a lot of revenue coming online is a function of capital we already have that s not yet deployed and as we continue to deploy that adds to revenue every day with every investment we make from our credit business specifically and as the annualization of revenue we deployed during capital we deployed during 2019 that s now online for a full year in 2020 so i do expect a lot of our growth to come from things that have already happened hence the deployment of stuff in 2019 continued deployment in 2020 as well as capital raising during the course of 2020 and i think in addition to what we think is going to obviously be a very good year for 2020 that really sets us up with a strong run rate heading into 2021 and beyond michael arougheti director co founder chief executive officer and president one thing i d just highlight we re obviously trying our best to peg our dividend to our expected fre we when you look at where we set the dividend in 2019 and how that developed over the course of 2019 year i think we now are having a pretty good demonstrated track record on our ability to tighten the range on the peg and feel pretty confident about the growth going forward into 2020 kenneth lee rbc capital markets analyst very helpful thank you michael mcferran partner chief financial officer chief operating officer thanks operator our next question comes from chris harris with wells fargo please go ahead chris harris wells fargo analyst great thanks a question on deployment i think you guys are sitting on a near record level of dry powder 2020 sounds like it s going to be a great fundraising year perhaps another record so if the economy continues on the current path do you feel confident about really deploying all that capital i mean are you guys seeing enough opportunities out there today to be able to kind of execute on that michael arougheti director co founder chief executive officer and president yes we do maybe telling people what they know the and i mentioned this in the prepared remarks the firm is structured and set up to outperform in down markets when you look at as an example at our private equity franchise our private equity funds that we already manage and those that we re raising now are flexible in structure that allow us to invest in both regular rate buyouts growth investments and distressed for control our special opportunities fund which as i mentioned is approaching its cover is specifically focused on companies and industries in transition with a lot of dry powder frankly looking for a little bit more volatility in the market across our credit platform and you ve seen this in the bdc and in our ace funds the ability to navigate the cycle and continue to deploy regardless of the market environment so the way i would think about it is given the amount of dry powder that we have you may see a shift in deployment from self originated assets and primary market activity to secondary market purchases or portfolio purchases and restructurings but when we look at the embedded addressable opportunity we re pretty confident that if the market turned we may actually even see deployment accelerate chris harris wells fargo analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from michael cyprys with morgan stanley please go ahead michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst hey morning thanks for taking the question just on coming back on the deployment side i m just curious how you guys would kind of characterize the 27 billion in 2019 in terms of what you put to work and what environment could you see that slowing and just curious to hear an update on where you re finding some of the most attractive areas situations for deployment as you re looking ahead into 2020 michael arougheti director co founder chief executive officer and president sure look the good news is and we said this in the prepared remarks the deployment was good and consistent across all of our strategies it was balanced and it grew year over year as we grew our capital base and grew our headcount and capability set if you look at the 27 billion roughly 20 billion of it was in our credit business that 5 billion of it was in our private equity business and about 2 billion of it 2 5 billion was in our real estate business that matches kind of nicely with the aum composition of the business and in credit we were active in a pretty balanced way across the liquid and illiquid markets in terms of where we re seeing opportunity like i said the u s economy is fundamentally sound we re finding plenty of things to do here certain of our strategies i think we d like to see a little bit more volatility to capitalize on some market inefficiencies but i think our base case for 2020 looks a lot like what our base case was for 2019 which is fairly benign environment fundamental growth healthy capital markets accommodative central banks which will support asset values and funds flow and we ll be able to deploy into that market albeit with a little bit more caution and a little bit more conservatism like i said i think there s an argument to be made given the nature of our capital that if the markets become more volatile or we actually see the long awaited downturn that we could accelerate deployment but that s not what we re underwriting this year michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst so would you characterize it as a sustainable pace of deployment that you guys can continue to put that to work that level as you look forward and what scenario would that actually slow michael arougheti director co founder chief executive officer and president yes i think it s sustainable i can t really come up with a scenario where it would slow for a sustained amount of time if you look at generally how our markets function if you see significant volatility you may see a slowdown as the market resets and rerates but then transaction activity picks up and while that pause in the primary market is occurring you see us get very active in the secondary market on secondary purchases and portfolio trades so again i think if you think of deployment both in terms of origination but also being in the secondary market we have every confidence that this level is sustainable michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst okay and then just as a follow up i think when you started 2019 you had about 28 billion of aum that was not yet earning fees at that point i m just curious how much was kind of pulled through where you activated fees i think the fee paying aum grew what 15 billion in the year so i guess trying to figure out like how much of that 28 billion was pulled through and activated then you kind of replenished it with fundraising elsewhere and then the question would be if that s 10 billion if it s 8 billion or if that was activated how to think about that sort of pacing into 2020 michael mcferran partner chief financial officer chief operating officer it s a great question i apologize mike i don t have the roll forward in front of me but the way you re thinking about it is spot on i would look at the majority of our fundraising this year would have added to i m not saying all of it but the majority would have added to shadow aum so i think to start mike and again i ll give you the contrast slide in a second for 2020 but most of the fundraising would have gone to shadow so when you think about the growth fee paying aum i d say the lion s share of that came from what was the available capital that was undeployed at the end of 2018 entering this year as mike mentioned the really and you have to look at our capital raising the distinction is in a year where we would raise larger private equity and real estate funds and we did have a couple of meaningful real estate funds this year that is becomes automatically fee paying when those funds are activated so when we activate our next private equity fund that will immediately become fee paying upon activation unlike our credit funds where you raise it and then it enters its deployment life cycle but i think again looking at the growth in fee paying aum and deducting that or let s say 75 of that from the shadow aum should be a pretty good indicator michael arougheti director co founder chief executive officer and president but i m just i m looking at some of the numbers we re probably if you look at the gross fundraising in 2019 probably 20 billion of the 24 billion was aum that pays on investment and if you look at the 27 billion of deployment you re probably looking at 20 billion ish of that deployment in pools of capital to pay on deployment so most of that pull through was on the credit side on new aum getting raised and then old aum getting deployed michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from chris kotowski with oppenheimer please go ahead chris kotowski oppenheimer analyst yeah good morning thanks for taking my question i just wanted to get back to the 0 40 dividend bump which was kind of more than we are looking for and just to make sure that we don t get out over our skis on fre assumptions but i mean 0 40 times just under 250 million shares is about 100 million in big round numbers tax affected for an 8 to 11 tax rate it tells you the pre tax free should be somewhere around 110 million and obviously that s quite a distance from the 89 million that we saw in the fourth quarter and it s kind of easy to get to a number in that 110 million zip code if you assume acof vi turns on but i mean am i right in thinking that that s probably 110 million a quarter pre tax free is kind of a very aggressive number for the first part of the year michael mcferran partner chief financial officer chief operating officer well keep in mind if we thought the first part of the year we d be again covering 0 40 and again we don t do a coverage payout analysis but hence the peg concept but if we thought that it was going to be 0 40 in q1 growing 0 41 0 42 0 43 the dividend would have been set higher so 0 40 is looking at the full year of 2020 as far as your math goes thinking about that on an annualized basis again we don t give fre guidance but i think the growth of the dividend is probably the best indicator of how we think about the growth of the business and you appropriately highlight the tax rates on an after tax basis your math doesn t sound like you re doing anything wrong chris kotowski oppenheimer analyst okay that s it for me thank you operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to michael arougheti for any closing remarks michael arougheti director co founder chief executive officer and president we have none again thanks for spending time with us today

wcn earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 waste connections wcn 0 05 q4 2019 earnings call 8 30 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator greetings and welcome to the west connections fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call as a reminder this conference is being recorded thursday february 13 2020 i would now like to turn the conference over to worthing jackman president and ceo please go ahead worthing jackman president and chief executive officer thank you rita and good morning everyone i d like to welcome everyone to this conference call to discuss our fourth quarter 2019 results and provide a detailed outlook for both the first quarter and full year 2020 i m joined this morning by mary anne whitney our cfo and several other members of our senior management team as noted on our earnings release 2019 ended on a high note as financial results for the fourth quarter exceeded expectations on better than expected solid waste price growth e p waste activity and acquisition contribution we re also extremely pleased with our results for the full year as underlying adjusted ebitda margins in solid waste collection transfer and disposal expanded by 50 basis points excluding cng credits moreover our ability to deliver full year adjusted free cash flow of 916 8 million or 17 of revenue and 54 8 of adjusted ebitda on a 16 2 increase in capital expenditures as we reinvested in and expanded our business is indicative of our disciplined focus on quality of revenue and free cash flow generation acquisition activity also accelerated into year end as we announced an additional 130 million in acquired annualized revenue in december acquisitions completed in 2019 provided rollover revenue growth of approximately 170 million in 2020 and the base of acquisition activity remains elevated 10 stocks we like better than waste connections when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market david and tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and waste connections wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of december 1 2019 along with strong pricing growth this already sets us up for high single digit growth in revenue and adjusted free cash flow positive solid waste volumes any increases in values of recycled commodities or renewable energy credits since year end or additional acquisitions closed during the year would provide upside to our initial 2020 outlook before we get into much more detail let me turn the call over to mary anne for our forward looking disclaimer and other housekeeping items mary anne whitney chief financial officer thank you worthing and good morning the discussion during today s call includes forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the u s private securities litigation reform act of 1995 including forward looking information within the meaning of applicable canadian securities laws actual results could differ materially from those made in such forward looking statements due to various risks and uncertainties factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed both in the cautionary statement on page 3 of our february 12 earnings release and in greater detail in waste connections filings with the u s securities and exchange commission and the securities commissions or similar regulatory authorities in canada you should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements and information as there may be additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently believe are immaterial which could have an adverse impact on our business we make no commitment to revise or update any forward looking statements and information in order to reflect events or circumstances that may change after today s date on the call we will discuss non gaap measures such as adjusted ebitda adjusted net income attributable to waste connections on both the dollar base and per diluted share and adjusted free cash flow please refer to our earnings releases for a reconciliation of such non gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measure management uses certain non gaap measures to evaluate and monitor the ongoing financial performance of our operations other companies may calculate these non gaap measures differently i will now turn the call back over to worthing worthing jackman president and chief executive officer thank you mary anne in the fourth quarter solid waste price plus volume growth was 4 in line with the upper end of our outlook for the period pricing growth of 5 4 exceeded our outlook for the quarter up 60 basis points year over year and 30 basis points sequentially primarily reflecting the additional price increases implemented in prior periods to address cost pressures and to recover through collection pricing a portion of the impact from lower recycled commodity values pricing in q4 range from about 3 5 in our western region exclusive markets and over 5 5 in our more competitive markets reported revenue growth in q4 was negative volume growth in q4 was negative 1 4 consistent with our assessment coming out of q3 that we had seen some pull forward of volumes from q4 into q3 and therefore expected to see a decline in volumes in q4 volumes tend to swing period to period as evidenced by our expectation for positive volume growth in q1 2020 looking further at 2020 we expect pricing growth to continue to average about 5 starting higher at approximately 5 5 early in the year due to the rollover impact of higher price increases implemented during 2019 and exiting 2020 between 4 and 4 5 as that rollover contribution wanes during the year we expect reported volumes to be about flat for the full year again starting positive in q1 with some variability by quarter looking at year over year results in the fourth quarter by line of business on a same store basis commercial collection revenue increased approximately 5 mostly due to price increases roll off revenue increased approximately 4 5 on a combination of higher pulls and higher revenue per pull in the u s pulls per day increased about 2 and revenue per pull was also up about 2 in canada pulls per day increased about 2 and revenue per pull increased about 3 solid waste landfill tonnage increased about 1 on higher msw tons up about 1 led by increases in florida and on the west coast and higher cnd tons up 7 with the largest increases in the northeast special waste tons were down about 2 in q4 primarily due to certain markets were outsized activity in q3 as noted earlier while special waste was up 10 year over year but increases in all regions on a combined basis commodity related revenues from recycled commodities and renewable energy credits or rins from landfill gas sales were largely in line with q3 as expected with slightly weaker recycled commodity values offset by stronger rins first recycling recycling revenue excluding acquisitions was about 12 million in the fourth quarter down 10 million or approximately 46 year over year occ prices in q4 averaged about 41 per ton which was down 56 from the year ago period and down about 5 or 2 per ton from q3 the estimated flow through from changes in recycling revenue was similar to earlier quarters with decremental margins of approximately 140 due to the combination of lower fiber values and higher recycling processing costs paid at third party facilities the resulting impact was about a 14 million impact to ebitda or a drag on reported margins of about 80 basis points and about 0 04 per share of eps in q4 occ prices currently averaged approximately 45 per ton and have largely stabilized in the 40 to 45 range for the past six months 2019 occ pricing averaged 52 per ton peaking at 77 in q1 which therefore will be the toughest quarterly comparison in 2020 current pricing of 45 per ton is down about 42 year over year for the quarter we continue to believe that pricing stability and ultimately some amount of improvement are reasonable expectations as a result of higher demand for recycled feedstock by both newton mills and domestic mills expected to convert to accepting recovered fiber we ve also seen indications of higher international demand for occ which could also support higher domestic fiber pricing for us next renewable energy credits or rins landfill gas revenue was approximately 12 million in the quarter down about 4 million or 25 year over year rins which account for about 40 to 45 of landfill gas revenue averaged approximately 0 82 in q4 up 19 from q3 but down 59 year over year resulting in a drag of about 20 basis points to reported margins in the period and about 0 01 per share of eps throughout january rin prices remained mostly in line with q4 levels but recently have jumped as high as 1 60 it is too soon to note these levels will persist throughout the quarter and full year so while we are encouraged by recent increases we have not baked this into our outlook for the year or for that matter q1 moving next to e p waste activity we reported 62 5 million of e p waste revenue in the fourth quarter above the high end of our outlook in spite of further rig count declines during the period e p waste revenue in q4 was down about 2 3 year over year and down about 5 8 sequentially from q3 which was our strongest quarter in over two years despite the weakening macro last year as noted throughout 2019 our activity held up better than expected as overall e p waste revenue increased 4 5 year over year in spite of a 20 plus percent decline in rig count as also noted throughout 2019 we benefited from our asset positioning and diversity of basins as well as contribution from new or expanded facilities that said particularly given the recent decline in crude and concerns about global demand we remain cautious in our outlook for e p waste activity looking at acquisition activity as noted earlier we closed approximately 130 million in annualized acquired revenue in q4 including a new market entry in pennsylvania and tuck ins in illinois and tennessee these acquisitions include penn waste in south central pennsylvania which provides solid waste collection and state of the art recycling services in addition we acquired a recycling facility in illinois which complements our existing operations and allows us to internalize additional recycled commodities in that market we also expanded our existing market positioning at tennessee through the acquisition of collection and transfer assets enabling us to internalize additional disposal volumes in that market along with other acquisitions completed earlier in the year this brings our total acquired annualized revenue in 2019 to approximately 300 million and provides rollover acquisition contribution of about 170 million in 2020 three years ago we had suggested that there may be a four year window of outsized acquisition activity our experience over the past three years has been consistent within that expectations as we have essentially completed six years worth of transactions over that three year period as we enter 2020 we continue to believe that the factors that have been viewed favorably by sellers are still relevant they continue to note the strength of their underlying businesses and the clarity resulting from tax reform under the current administration with the potential for uncertainty being introduced as a result of any change to the status quo given those concerns and the current amount of dialogue we believe 2020 could be another year of outsized acquisition activity in 2019 we deployed approximately 835 million in acquisitions with leverage decreasing to about 2 4 times debt to ebitda and we finished the year with over 325 million in cash on the balance sheet as such we remain well positioned for potential continued outsized capital deployment now i d like to pass the call to mary anne to review more in depth the financial highlights of the fourth quarter and provide a detailed outlook for q1 and full year 2020 i will then wrap up before heading into q a mary anne whitney chief financial officer thank you worthing in the fourth quarter revenue was 1 36 billion up 100 2 million over the prior year period and about 17 million above the high end of our outlook due to higher solid waste pricing and e p waste activity as well as contribution from acquisitions closed during the quarter in total acquisitions completed since the year ago period contributed about 70 4 million of revenue in the quarter or about 68 5 million net of divestitures adjusted ebitda for q4 as reconciled in our earnings release was 419 million about 14 million above our outlook for the period on higher than expected revenue and the benefit of the compressed natural gas tax credit which was applied retrospectively for 2018 and 2019 in december and totaled approximately 7 5 million ebitda was up 21 8 million year over year despite an estimated 18 million hit to ebitda from recycled commodities and rins adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue in q4 was 30 8 down 70 basis points year over year but exceeding our expectations an estimated 50 basis point increase in underlying solid waste collection transfer and disposal margins and a 50 basis point increase due to cng credits were more than offset by an estimated 100 basis point impact from lower recycled commodity values and rins as noted earlier and an estimated 70 basis point impact from lower margin acquisitions completed since the year ago period fuel expense in q4 was about 3 9 of revenue or essentially flat year over year we averaged approximately 2 69 per gallon for diesel in the quarter which was up about 0 04 from the year ago period and up about 0 08 sequentially from q3 depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter as expected was 13 8 of revenue down 20 basis points year over year interest expense net of interest earnings in the quarter increased by 1 8 million over the prior year period to 33 5 million due to a combination of higher total borrowings as compared to the prior year period and lower interest earnings from invested cash balances debt outstanding at quarter end was about 4 35 billion and our leverage ratio as defined in our credit agreement ended the year at approximately 2 4 times debt to ebitda with cash balances of approximately 327 million at year end approximately 85 of our debt was at fixed rate and our weighted average cost of debt was approximately 3 4 since year end we ve increased the portion of our debt that is fixed to almost 100 as we completed a 600 public offering of 2 6 10 year senior notes in january which lowered our all in average cost of debt to approximately 3 3 our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 17 7 slightly lower than expected there was no impact to the rate from the proposed regulations previously expected to be finalized in 2019 as such regulations still have yet to be finalized gaap and adjusted net income per diluted share in q4 were 0 50 and 0 69 respectively adjusted net income in q4 primarily excludes the impact of intangibles amortization and other acquisition related items and impairments as noted earlier the impact to our adjusted net income per diluted share from recycling and rins was a drag of about 0 05 in q4 adjusted free cash flow in 2019 was 916 8 million or 17 of revenue and above our 915 million outlook for the year in spite of higher capex capital expenditures in 2019 were 634 4 million up 16 2 year over year and approximately 20 million higher than anticipated due primarily to a high number of fleet deliveries received in december i will now review our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2020 before i do we d like to remind everyone once again that actual results may vary significantly based on risks and uncertainties outlined in our safe harbor statement and filings we ve made with the sec and the securities commissions or similar regulatory authorities in canada we encourage investors to review these factors carefully our outlook assumes no change in the current economic and operating environment unless otherwise indicated it also excludes any impact from additional acquisitions or divestitures that may close during the remainder of the year and expensing of transaction related items during the period looking first at full year 2020 revenue in 2020 is estimated to be in the range of 5 725 billion to 5 775 billion for solid waste we expect pricing growth of approximately 5 with volumes about flat adjusted ebitda in 2020 as reconciled in our earnings release is expected to be in the range of approximately 1 76 billion to 1 785 billion or a range of 30 7 to 30 9 of revenue down 20 to 40 basis points year over year as underlying margin expansion in solid waste collection transfer and disposal is expected to be more than offset by a combined estimated 65 basis point impact from the following an estimated 25 basis points impact from recycled commodities and rins assuming year end 2019 values approximately 20 basis points impact from an assumed 10 decline in e p waste activity and an additional estimated 20 basis points of margin dilution from approximately 170 million in rollover acquisition contribution already in place for the year positive solid waste volumes any increases in values for recycled commodities or renewable energy credits since year end or additional acquisitions closed during the year would provide upside to our initial 2020 outlook for instance to the extent that higher rin pricing were to persist at the recent elevated levels described earlier the annualized incremental ebitda benefit could be 15 million to 20 million regarding tax rates our effective tax rate for 2020 is expected to be approximately 21 5 with some quarter to quarter variability adjusted free cash flow in 2020 as reconciled in our earnings release is expected to be in the range of 975 million to 1 billion or between 17 and 17 3 of revenue turning now to our outlook for q1 2020 revenue in q1 is estimated to be approximately 1 36 billion we expect price growth for solid waste to be approximately 5 5 in q1 with volume in the range of flat to up 50 basis points e p waste revenue is estimated in the range of 55 million to 60 million and rin revenue does not reflect the recent run up in pricing described earlier adjusted ebitda in q1 is estimated to be approximately 405 million or 29 8 of revenue down 120 basis points year over year the margin headwinds expected from lower year over year commodity related revenues lower e p waste revenues and acquisition contributions are most pronounced in q1 totaling over 100 basis points and therefore masked our underlying improvements one additional headwind specific to q1 is the impact of one extra day in the quarter due to leap year which is expected to result in a drag of about 50 basis points to reported margins the drags on reported margins are expected to abate as the year progresses as we anniversary the toughest comps for recycling and rins in the first half of the year and of course leap year only impacts q1 depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter is estimated to be about 13 7 of revenue of that amount amortization of intangibles in the quarter is estimated to be about 31 5 million or 0 09 per diluted share net of taxes interest expense net of interest income in q1 is estimated to be approximately 35 million and finally our effective tax rate in q1 is estimated to be about 19 5 subject to some variability similar to q1 2019 the effective rate for the period includes a slight benefit to the provision related to excess tax benefits associated with equity based compensation and now let me turn the call back over to worthing for some final remarks before q a worthing jackman president and chief executive officer ok thank you mary anne once again we are extremely pleased with our results for 2019 driving our 16th consecutive year of positive shareholder returns we expanded underlying margins in solid waste collection transfer and disposal by 50 basis points in the year excluding cng credits completed another year of outsized acquisition activity and converted almost 55 of ebitda to free cash flow most importantly in spite of continued labor constraints we ve maintained our focus on safety as evidenced by the over 55 of our operating locations that either posted zero safety related incidents in 2019 or drove further year over year improvements we would like to recognize the tireless efforts of our more than 18 000 employees for our continuing success given the headwinds of 2018 and 2019 we appreciate the greater visibility we have as we enter this new year if you ll excuse the already overused pun a 2020 vision that s mary anne s little pun i ll give her credit for that one that vision starts with our financial outlook high single digit revenue growth from price increases and acquisition contribution already largely in place continued underlying solid waste collection transfer and disposal margin expansion and maintaining our industry leading free cash flow conversion to drive up to 1 billion in adjusted free cash flow and again positive solid waste volumes any increases in values for recycled commodities or renewable energy credits since year end or additional acquisitions closed during the year will provide upside to our initial 2020 outlook our 2020 vision is also focused on engagement with our employees our customers and our communities engagement means continued investment in training and development for our local leaders and frontline employees and building our technology offerings to increase connectivity both inside and outside the company engagement drives culture increases retention and further improves safety in addition our 2020 vision is focused on sustainability at waste connections we recognize the importance to our stakeholders of our continuing efforts to minimize our impact on the environment but also to measure the positive impacts we have in the communities we serve the development and welfare of our employees the financial health of our company and the returns to our shareholders we hold ourselves accountable to deliver on these commitments we appreciate your time today i ll now turn the call over to the operator to open up the lines for your questions operator questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from the line of brian maguire from goldman sachs please proceed with your question brian maguire goldman sachs analyst hey good morning congrats on being the only company i covered that actually waited until 2020 to give their vision 2020 outlook mary anne whitney chief financial officer it sounded new brian maguire goldman sachs analyst you might be the only one that actually hits it so let s see i just wanted to get at the underlying margin improvement that s in the guidance because there s a lot of moving pieces and i think you gave a lot of detail there but it seems to me like the underlying margins in 2020 are going to be up 50 bps if i break out the i guess you said 25 from recycling 25 from e p waste 20 from m a probably another 10 or so from the leap day but just trying to separate all of the noise and with the 5 price increase that s kind of embedded in the guidance so i d assume you re going to get pretty good underlying margin expansion on that mary anne whitney chief financial officer sure i think brian you just identified the moving parts of course there s a little drag from cng because of course we ve got two years worth of credits in the end of 19 a little drag there too so yes you re right what the guide suggests is underlying margin expansion in solid waste similar to what we saw this year and of course our guidance we d like to leave ourselves some room to do better and so yes you re right coming into the year with 5 price we would hope to meet or beat brian maguire goldman sachs analyst ok and i guess the e p volumes and sales came in better than you thought in 4q it seems like the outlook for 2020 only down 10 is maybe a little bit better or more optimistic than i would have guessed given the rig count moves and how oils performed year to date so just getting a sense of how conservative you think that is and what factors drove your volumes to be better than the overall industry i know you guys added some capacity earlier in the year just maybe that s a factor but just what would allow you to kind of outperform the overall market worthing jackman president and chief executive officer well look you can t respond to that question without recognizing the efforts of our group and how talented they are in this current environment but obviously we ve said throughout the year look the permian was down in 2019 year over year but the diversity basins allowed us to benefit from increases in louisiana onshore and offshore we opened the additional landfill up in the wyoming up in the powder we ve talked about investments we were making also in the permian during the year last year those will start to come online this year we ll start to see some benefit from those modestly but still coming off a 0 base from those assets last year that ll help us a little bit this year look i ll say that january exceeded our expectations internally for e p waste and so one month down 11 months left to go our view is it has to come down and so while we haven t seen anything that is worse than our expectations so far obviously we d rather be cautious at this time of the year as we look out ahead because if we had not assumed down 10 and assumed this current environment you d be asking us why didn t we assume e p would be down 10 or at least in the year and so let s throw a 10 number out there obviously if we re doing well early in the year that means we ve got that cushion above 10 as you move through the year in case things do weaken later in the year as you know we ve been expecting a weakening amount of activity for the past almost 12 or 14 months again our hats off to our folks and their execution of our business plan there brian maguire goldman sachs analyst ok i ll turn it over thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of tyler brown from raymond james please proceed with your question tyler brown raymond james analyst hey good morning guys worthing jackman president and chief executive officer hey good morning tyler brown raymond james analyst hey worthing just want to start with volume so i appreciate the flat guidance but in 2019 didn t you guys spend on a couple of new contracts that i thought would give you around a 50 basis point tailwind in 2020 and if so does that imply that you re guiding effectively to kind of down core volumes worthing jackman president and chief executive officer well i d say there are two answers to that one is obviously early in the year you want to give yourself cushion to exceed right and we talked about the contracts last year we said that was about a 50 basis point benefit to volume for the year and so if all that plays out if underlying is flat and we benefit from the new contracts that would mean there s about a 25 million bias to the upside for volume growth if things play out like they might 25 million is not a big needle mover from a top line or ebitda standpoint but we left that as cushion on the upside look at total volumes last year in 2019 full year basis we were down about 20 basis points so we re essentially flat if that repeated this year and that 20 basis points gets improved by the 50 basis points of new contracts that means we re up about 30 basis points in volume so again the number is starting to get pretty small here we d rather leave that for upside versus doing an all in guide at this point tyler brown raymond james analyst ok conservative i think that is maybe a good way to put it but in the same vein so i m a little surprised to see capex remain somewhat heightened in 2020 i thought you would have had again some reprieve from those contracts spending that presumably doesn t repeat you just talked about e p being down core volumes aren t exactly doing a whole lot at least under the current assumptions so any thoughts there on the capex and is that something that we might see step down in 21 worthing jackman president and chief executive officer we put some cushion in the guide because we find is that as you move through the year as acquisitions come in people stay focused on incremental ebitda and incremental free cash flow from it and forget about increased capex that results from acquisitions too so obviously there is some cushion in that guide i d also tell you as you look at one month playing out the landfill volumes in january alone were up mid single digits though that persists obviously we re also assuming that there might be additional landfill capex above and beyond we currently anticipate tyler brown raymond james analyst ok and then on the landfill side i may have missed it but did you give msw landfill pricing mary anne whitney chief financial officer we didn t break that out specifically tyler as you know we think about reporting pricing in the aggregate and of course talked about our 5 4 core pricing in the year you ve seen through the course of the year i think we ve talked before in the 2 5 to 3 type of range is the type of increases we ve seen on average across our network of landfills worthing jackman president and chief executive officer but as you move through the year last year and if we need it again this year we will as well i mean last year we saw escalating costs at certain sites for leachate handling obviously capex at landfills you re getting less for your dollar these days right and so it s not just p l pressure at landfills it s the increasing cost to build out landfills over time and so landfill pricing overall will be moving higher it s a question of kind of what sites and what regions you see the most movement in some locations we ve moved pricing as much as 5 or 6 last year tyler brown raymond james analyst ok that s helpful and then maybe going back on the core margin improvement side what are you guys seeing on the labor inflation side have you seen that begin to abate at all mary anne whitney chief financial officer we have tyler and that was encouraging in q4 that was really the first time that we saw a step down in the past few quarters we ve talked about the fact that same employee increases have been around 4 85 and this was first quarter it was in the low 4s so it dropped by about 50 basis points which is encouraging and also makes sense because our feeling was that we had been through the worst of those market adjustments we had done really over the past two years which drove outsized wage increases in those markets so we are beginning to see signs that our optimism about the abating of those cost pressures was well placed tyler brown raymond james analyst ok good and then maybe my last one here modeling question mary anne but any color on cash tax rate or as a percentage of the book mary anne whitney chief financial officer sure we talked about a 21 5 effective tax rate for the year in cash taxes i would think about them as a percentage of book as being up slightly from 2019 i think in the 65 to 70 range a little higher than we talked about last year of course what changes that is that to the extent we do continue to get deals done and we get incremental benefits from acquisitions you could see that come down tyler brown raymond james analyst right ok very good thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of hamzah mazari from jefferies please proceed with your question mario cortellacci jefferies analyst hi this is mario cortellacci on for hamza how are you worthing jackman president and chief executive officer hey good morning good mario cortellacci jefferies analyst just quick question on landfill pricing you d already mentioned that you ve seen pretty good increases so far last year just wondering how long you think that s sustainable for and then maybe you can just comment or discuss what the catalyst has been the sector has been pretty consolidated for a while and you ve been relatively disciplined just curious to know if there was any other catalyst in there that s causing these to rise longer term worthing jackman president and chief executive officer sure well i think it s first if you look back longer term over the past 10 or 15 years for us overall as a company we ve averaged about cpi plus 150 basis points kind of as a portfolio of market pricing that s been more elevated than that last couple of years as you know last couple of years this industry s faced the impact from lower recycled commodity values and the need to push the cost of recycling to the generators you ve also seen some episodic spikes in certain cost items mary anne already talked about labor by the last couple of years you ve seen higher third party logistics cost and those mostly have all abated we ve talked about those getting good line of sight on those and kind of the surprises stopped in q2 or so of last year on those the ones that will persist are more focused on the landfill side i mean those that will persist will be leachate cost we as a company are looking longer term to try to control our own destiny and bring the leachate handling and treatment in house versus having to rely in some cases on third party potw plants landfills generate a lot of leachate they re big rain collectors right and so as those costs move up that s the needle mover for this industry again i already talked about rising capex cost and for that matter rising litigation costs the u s is very litigious society anybody with a checkbook will get sued and landfills have a target on their back in some markets and so look the persistence of those cost items will not abate anytime soon so i wouldn t be surprised if you see disposal pricing continue to click up despite other pressures having abated mario cortellacci jefferies analyst great one more and i ll turn it over your leverage sits around 2 4 times right now and given your free cash flow and so your free cash flow profile and if you guys get sub two times do you think your balance sheet is a little inefficient and if that s the case do you have any larger deals in the pipeline or do you guys just go straight to buying back a lot of stock worthing jackman president and chief executive officer well we agree with you it is inefficient if it got that low which is why the only time we ever got that low was episodically in late 2008 early 2009 while we waited to deploy almost 500 million in acquisitions you haven t seen us go below two times since then we drifted closer to 2 2 times in q3 of last year and we ve increased back to 2 4 times but look these are high class problems to have because leverage is coming down by spending about 1 billion a year in acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders above and beyond that so i don t expect to see our balance sheet fall below two times obviously as the return on capital increases to shareholders that ll keep the leverage probably longer term between two and a half and three times when you combine that with acquisitions versus seeing us drift closer to two times mario cortellacci jefferies analyst great thank you so much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael hoffman from stifel please proceed with your question michael hoffman stifel financial corp analyst hey thank you very much hi worthing and mary anne to follow through on sort of the commentary around the business trends and sorry everybody keeps focusing on volume can we talk a little bit and remind everybody how the volume calculation works that landfill is clearly it s straightforward but vast majority of the business is service space and therefore price is really the motivator and so flat volumes against a strong price on inflation at 2 5 is exceptionally powerful worthing jackman president and chief executive officer well yes look i think you re leading the witness with the answer which is ok look this business is more about in many cases a fixed pay system right fixed pay service and so when you look at kind of units of increase it really narrows down the amount of revenue that s exposed to that and that big third party volumes at the landfill which obviously gets weighed you can look at volumes for that but third party disposal revenue in most companies is anywhere from kind of 12 to 15 of total revenue so even if landfill volumes go up 4 you re looking at a whopping 50 basis point contribution to the overall volume growth away from that you ve got a point to point business in roll off for construction related activity and as we said for that that s up 2 in pulls and so if that business is all in 8 to 10 of total now you re talking about another 20 basis points or so and so it s really difficult to move the needle in this industry on volume on a sustained basis meaning volume at 2 3 4 unless you ve got when those things happen those are episodic large special waste jobs those are the start of large new contracts that one would have to call out this industry is not about a volume game i mean it is an industry where price retention is most important and we like that kind of a fixed pay approach in good economies and bad michael hoffman stifel financial corp analyst ok that helps thank you and then where are we as a company on infrastructure related spending to as you get bigger and bigger things like erps moving from servers to clouds and i m assuming you re doing all those investments as normal course of business that we don t need any particular carve outs for them worthing jackman president and chief executive officer no we ve never called out or added back any sort of it related that s just the cost of doing business and look it depends on what you re talking about i mean amazon s got a very powerful product out there on the cloud and obviously we ve moved certain components of our business up to the cloud things that we re doing right now looking at new technology deployment also pulls in the cloud new connectivity that we talked about with regards to employee engagement and customer connectivity these are things that we just are part of running the business we re making all the right investments we have a lot going on like most companies it is probably our biggest growth department in the company and that s a good thing given all the benefits that we ll realize in a matter of time michael hoffman stifel financial corp analyst ok and then because cash flow is so important one should really try to do a multiyear model and just think about sort of trend lines so if i take this economy and all of your headwind related issues recycling rins everything stays constant from this point forward is the right way to think about price is something in the low 4s consistently a zero to a little bit of positive volume and then inflation s 2 2 5 and therefore you can model through how you want to think about operating leverage if you re taking a sustained long view about how to think about the model worthing jackman president and chief executive officer absolutely i mean we ve always talked about this being kind of a 4 to 6 price plus volume growth business especially in that 2 5 type underlying cpi obviously we were on the low end of the 4 to 6 range in q4 we ll be on the high end or better of that in q1 and so it kind of can move around quarter to quarter in that kind of 4 to 6 organic growth if it s price led ought to drive ebitda growth and free cash flow growth on a dollar basis slightly above that acquisitions are additive to that and obviously on a per share basis as we start returning more capital to shareholders through buybacks per share basis you get growth that accelerates faster than that as the denominator starts to shrink michael hoffman stifel financial corp analyst got it and last question just to make sure that nobody gets confused you would never overpay for a deal to keep your leverage at 2 5 or better the capital allocation will still be strictly done on good returns based metrics worthing jackman president and chief executive officer yes we could ve been doing that the last 22 years if you want i mean when you see cash building up at 300 million 400 million 500 million clips that s just because we re saving it for the better deals versus blowing it on deals that have gotten done mary anne whitney chief financial officer and michael we tried to be very clear about the fact that we re not chasing a growth rate and that we should expect more return to shareholders over time to the extent that deal activity slows down michael hoffman stifel financial corp analyst got it thank you so much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of noah kaye of oppenheimer please proceed with your question noah kaye oppenheimer and company analyst thanks good morning so you called out the improving employee engagement obviously the strong safety performance and improvement there as well as the lower labor cost pressure could you tell us where you re currently with the labor turnover rate and can you remind us of the historical benchmark worthing jackman president and chief executive officer sure well i ll tell you our historical low as a company was coming out of great recession where we bottomed out at about 11 12 all in as the economy improved total turnover by the way the total turnover for us is voluntary and involuntary involuntary for us runs about a third of our total turnover just to make sure framing it correctly because again we still believe it s important we can make our life easier if we didn t have involuntary turnover but again if you re risk based scoring your employees you want to make sure you re mindful of what the right thing to do is here but the turnover clicked up to about 16 by 2015 or so the combination with progressive waste which had turned over north of 40 in 2016 that combination obviously pulled the total company turnover up into the low 30 range following that transaction and we ve trended that now back down toward the mid 20s on a total basis again that s voluntary plus involuntary and our goal is to continue to move that closer to 20 the fact that between 16 and 19 we ve been able to bring it down from the 30 plus range down in the mid 20s in the face of tightening labor environment just shows you how much effort we re spending to lean into this and bring that lower and we ve got additional things lined up this year to hopefully benefit from that we started last year that i hope we ll continue to see improving trends within that direction noah kaye oppenheimer and company analyst great helpful and then on m a i mean you ve mentioned potential during the prepared remarks for another year of outsized activity and in the past you ve provided some metrics around say the amount of lois out there so just anything you can do to characterize the pipeline in terms of lois or other sort of sense of quantity and then the mix of tuck ins versus new markets worthing jackman president and chief executive officer yes i ll just say that there s nothing needle moving in and of itself right i mean there s half dozen or more in that kind of 10 million to 50 million range that collectively if we just execute embed our averages i would think that by our july call we ve probably signed or closed what i would call a full year s worth meaning 125 million to 150 million of revenue we still have half a year left so really playing out no different than how the last three years have played out with regard to that people have asked us over time hey does your pipeline include anything from potential waste and advanced combination and the answer has always been no we don t think of that as something we ought to include in any pipeline obviously we ve been very cautious in our dialogue around that and it s way too early to tell whether or not we ll benefit from any of that noah kaye oppenheimer and company analyst great thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of sean eastman of keybanc capital markets please proceed with your question sean eastman keybanc capital markets analyst thanks for taking my questions i guess just continuing on this leverage discussion and the deal pipeline just curious to feel you out on where you re at on maybe considering some more noncore m a we ve seen some of your peers look at some more environmental services type stuff just curious on where you guys are at there relative to what you have in the pipeline on the traditional solid waste side worthing jackman president and chief executive officer yes it s been our belief that our runway is long enough in solid waste last time i checked there s still almost 18 billion of private company revenue in the sector and 3 5 billion to 4 billion of that fits our model now if we close all 4 billion of that during this year which we won t then you can ask that question but now we remain focused on solid waste services obviously there s a lot that comes through here because people know we they want us to be the buyer of choice for a lot of unrelated or closely related businesses and we passed again our view is that shareholders ought to go buy the stocks because other companies they want to play those sectors sean eastman keybanc capital markets analyst ok thanks that s helpful and you guys highlighted a 15 million to 20 million number could you just remind me exactly what that was i guess what i m trying to understand is what this 1 60 rin price today translates into for 2020 ebitda if that holds mary anne whitney chief financial officer sure sure sean so what i said in the prepared remarks is that there could be as much as 15 million to 20 million in annualized ebitda impact if the rins were to stay at the elevated levels that we referenced so in essence if you had year end numbers around 0 80 and they ve hit as high as 1 60 what that s saying is a doubling of rin equates to 15 million to 20 million on a full year basis worthing jackman president and chief executive officer of benefit mary anne whitney chief financial officer yes sean eastman keybanc capital markets analyst ok got it and then can i just ask where the recycled commodity basket sits today relative to the exit 2019 level that s reflected in the outlook mary anne whitney chief financial officer right as we ve said we ve really been sitting in that low to mid 40 range for occ which is a good indication of where the basket is as a whole what we ve seen recently is that there s indications of higher pricing in february and that s the basis for some of the optimism in the short term and as we ve said before longer term throughout the course of the year the optimism came from the additional mills expected to come online and you re also seeing some dynamics internationally where the spread between occ and mixed paper is widening as demand increases for occ so i d say in the near term we are seeing some improvement kind of a couple of dollars up from where we exited the year we think longer term is where there s more benefit worthing jackman president and chief executive officer and frankly if we continue to benefit from higher rins and higher recycling it d be nice for that to finally become a tailwind after fighting two years of headwinds especially around recycling sean eastman keybanc capital markets analyst got it and last quick one for me i m kind of ducking for cover from michael asking you a volume question but just curious on those lumpy special waste type opportunities are there things like that potentially in the pipeline this year and what point in the year will you have line of sight around that type of upside driver on the volume side mary anne whitney chief financial officer sure so certainly sean every year you have just between really 2 and 3 of our revenue in special waste activity and it is lumpy which is why we talked about it in q3 as potentially impacting q4 and that s exactly what happened the line of sight is typically around 90 days sometimes you have indications longer term if there s infrastructure projects or something going on specific to an individual market because it all becomes about asset positioning typically it s logistics driven and so if we re in the market we re likely to get the job and then the question is when does it start and how long does it last that s where the uncertainty comes in so certainly there s that potential out there again we think the prudent way to guide at the beginning of the year is to say volumes are flat and we ll let you know if we do better sean eastman keybanc capital markets analyst got it very helpful thanks for the time operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris murray from altacorp capital please proceed with your question chris murray altacorp capital analyst thanks folks good morning i m just thinking about the guidance for 2020 you know it s interesting a lot of the headwinds you guys talk about in terms of the ebitda pressures are probably ones i would have thought that would have had an upside impact on free cash flow and we re looking at capex being fairly flat year over year so i guess my question is even with all those pressures how are you actually kind of growing free cash flow and a couple of things i m looking at working capital seems to be year over year even in a growing business positive any thoughts around how we should be thinking about you re getting to hit those operating cash flow numbers mary anne whitney chief financial officer well certainly coming into every year we try to position ourselves to have some flexibility as you know we guided to 915 million in free cash flow did an extra 20 million in capex to achieve that number and didn t deliver more than that as we did last year if you think about it last year we exited the year and we actually delivered about 20 million higher than expected so on that 915 million or 917 million we delivered this year arguably that base is even higher so we don t see that being as much of a stretch year over year as it might indicate otherwise so we try to come in with working capital cushion and to plan accordingly and so that s really the basis for our expectation that we can achieve those numbers worthing jackman president and chief executive officer yes on a percentage growth basis it s fairly consistent with the percentage growth in ebitda i think the other way you can ask the question is could it have been could we have guided higher yes but it s too early in the year chris murray altacorp capital analyst ok fair enough and then just thinking back about acquisitions and maybe kind of back to michael s questions we re thinking longer term again even going back to your comment about we re kind of hitting the fourth year or four so let s assume for arguments sake that this will be another call it 300 million 400 million of acquired revenue type of year that we ve seen in the last few years historically you ve always sort of said 3 to 4 of revenues is the normalized run rate and is this something that as we go through an election cycle that is this sort of the last year at the party or is it something that longer term you think could actually extend but it depends on a couple of different actions not sure worthing jackman president and chief executive officer well as i said earlier i mean there s about 18 billion of private company revenue out there and if all we re doing is knocking down 300 million or so in an outsized year that s effectively the growth rate of that basket and so there s a long runway here and as we ve always said look sellers or owners of good businesses pick the time to sell sellers drive the timing and so while there s been a kind of a heightened amount of activity in the last three years and expected again this year there s still a large revenue basket out there that will continue to come to the market over time and they ll just meter itself out over a long period of time that s why i talked about kind of a long runway for m a growth and again if you think about the capital outlay dollars as we grow the business kind of in this third decade of our existence i mean you ve got obviously the organic growth is now 75 to 80 of top line growth on an average year that has a lot less capex dollar or capital dollar outlays than if you looked at our first decade of existence where m a growth was at 75 to 80 of top line growth and so you just have to for the realities of how you re evolving as a company you don t force the growth you don t overpay and again you let sellers drive the timing for m a and m a will continue well beyond this year chris murray altacorp capital analyst ok thanks very much folks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of kyle white from deutsche bank please proceed with your question kyle white deutsche bank analyst hello good morning following up on the recovered paper discussion with occ up 10 per ton on average here in february relative to the end of 2019 what kind of benefit does this provide on an annualized basis similar fashion to what you ve been providing for rins are you able to provide that for recovered paper mary anne whitney chief financial officer sure and again what i said was pricing was a couple of dollars higher than where it had ended the year if you look at our overall numbers for the full year a 10 movement in the recycled commodities works out to about 6 5 million and so that s the way to think about the benefit on revenue and ebitda and it would be a good indication of what that movement would be kyle white deutsche bank analyst yes that s helpful and then where are you seeing this increased demand internationally on the recovered paper and do you believe it is it something that s short lived or do you see that something that is a little bit more sustainable mary anne whitney chief financial officer and just to be clear most of what we handle is we handle it domestically what i mentioned was that there s an international effect which could have ripple impact on the domestic market that could impact our pricing and what we were referring to was india for instance where they ve pushed out mixed paper and therefore the demand for occ the higher quality paper has gone up and that spread has widened between occ and mixed paper kyle white deutsche bank analyst got you and then just last question just quick thoughts on sg a for 2020 you ve made good progress on this line item do you see more progress this coming year or is 10 of revenue kind of the good target worthing jackman president and chief executive officer no look you could see and you can see us over time drive that as a percentage of revenue down as we grow the top line of business and we re probably right now in that 10 plus or minus 20 or 30 basis points around that kyle white deutsche bank analyst thank you and good luck in the court for the year thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mark neville from scotiabank please proceed with your question mark neville scotiabank analyst hi good morning i just want to understand i guess for the again the sensitivities around the rins and the recycled commodity 15 million 20 million rin the 6 5 million for occ that s an annual number on the 10 mary anne whitney chief financial officer yes and it s all recycled commodities mark neville scotiabank analyst yes ok and then i guess is this effectively a 100 contribution margin again just trying to understand the sensitivity mary anne whitney chief financial officer yes i mean that s how we re thinking about the very mark neville scotiabank analyst yes ok ok and maybe just on the margin guide again lots of color and again i apologize for getting maybe too granular but i think there was a 20 basis point benefit from the absence of the 401 k match was that in the 50 basis points of underlying or is that i guess something separate mary anne whitney chief financial officer we didn t break that out separate what i tried to call out are the things with the headwinds and then arguably there are moving parts within the underlying solid waste margins as i said there are a couple of drags from leap year and the cng tax credit not repeating two years worth but just one and then yes there s some pickup from something like 401 k there have been other puts and takes during the year whether it was some stock market moving which impacted deferred comp and things like that i just haven t gotten that granular on the underlying solid waste margin expansion what i would encourage you to do is think about it as being similar to 2019 mark neville scotiabank analyst ok ok that s helpful and maybe just one last one i think worthing you made some comments just on the capex and i missed them i thought something around building some cushion into the number or i just sort of missed what you said if you could repeat that that would be helpful worthing jackman president and chief executive officer yes i think what we re talking about is look it s not atypical for us as we budget one year and as you move through the year things come up right and so our view is as you lay out capital for the year or capex expectations make sure you ve increased it to allow for some cushions for the unknown and to make sure you have people focused on a higher number because frankly as we close acquisitions during the year the capex that goes along with those newly acquired sites people always seem to tend to model in revenue and ebitda from acquisitions and don t below a p l and get to the capex line and so we re trying to be anticipatory of some of that as well mark neville scotiabank analyst ok got it thank you that s helpful i think i ll just leave it there thanks a lot mary anne whitney chief financial officer thanks operator thank you mr jackman there are no further questions at this time i will now turn the call back to you please continue with your presentation or closing remarks worthing jackman president and chief executive

the latest report from iran s central bank cbi released on thursday indicates a steep rise in the volume of money supply and increased government borrowing from banks according to the report the volume of liquidity has risen to 20 262 trillion rials or 174 billion free market rate showing a growth of 28 and 56 in december 2019 compared with 2018 and 2017 respectively the report also indicates that the volume of liquidity has grown by four fold since president hassan rouhani took office in 2013 growing liquidity is one of the major contributors to rising inflation in iran which is around 40 percent according to data released by the statistical center of iran sci this means that the government prints money which is made available to banks the state controls in iran and then it borrows from these banks the central bank report also indicates that the government debt to banks in the twelve months leading to december 20 2019 had increased by 28 and reached 3 880 000 billion rials or close to 30 billion again in comparison with 2013 when rouhani took office the government debt to banks shows a growth of more than 3 5 times the private sector s debt to banks in the twelve month period ending on december 20 reached 14 400 000 billion rials or more than 110 billion the iranian government s foreign debt according to the report at the end of 2019 stood at more than 9 billion of which 1 5 billion is to be paid in the short term twelve months ago iran had a total foreign debt of slightly over 10b the central bank of iran s latest report for the first time and without explanation has included natural gas condensates ngc in the non oil export category and said non oil exports in the nine month period from march 21 to december 20 amounted to 31 9b the central bank has not released any figures on the budget since december 2018 the latest cbi report says in the nine month period from march 21 2018 only 61 of expected government revenues materialized which indicates a significantly higher budget deficit if this was the case in 2018 with the deteriorating economic conditions last year one can only expect an even larger deficit in the last 12 months the new central bank report also does not offer any figures on the country s total exports including oil exports according to the international monetary fund imf forecast iran s exports crude oil oil products non oil products and services will drop to 55 5 billion while total imports are expected to be higher by 3 billion making iran s trade balance negative for the first time if the volume of exports drops to the level the imf has forecast it will show a 50 drop since 2017 when the united states withdrew from the nuclear deal with iran and re introduced sanctions imf has also predicted a budget deficiency of nearly 8 of the total gdp in the current iranian calendar year ending march 20 and the next year which translates into 37 billion each year budget deficits coupled with a drop in exports will force the government to borrow from banks particularly the central bank and draw on its foreign currency reserves according to the latest report of the institute of international finance iif on january 13 iran s economy hit by the sanctions which have almost wiped out the country s ability to sell crude oil is facing recession for a second year the report says iran s foreign reserves could drop to as low as 73 billion by march 2020 meaning a loss of nearly 40b in the past two years according to the same report if the united states maintains its sanctions on iran by 2024 iran s foreign currency reserves could drop to 20b while if the sanctions are lifted iran s economic growth could exceed 6 annually with reserves growing at a normal rate
ar earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 antero resources corporation ar 1 02 q4 2019 earnings call 11 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator greeting and welcome to the antero resources 2020 fourth quarter earnings conference call i will now turn the conference over to your host michael kennedy you may begin michael kennedy senior vice president finance thank you for joining us for antero s fourth quarter 2019 investor conference call we ll spend a few minutes going through the financial and operational highlights and then we ll open it up for q a i d also like to direct you to the home page of our website at www anteroresources com where we have provided a separate earnings call presentation that will be reviewed during today s call before we start our comments i would first like to remind you that during this call antero management will make forward looking statements such statements are based on our current judgments regarding factors that will impact the future performance of antero and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond antero s control actual outcomes and results could materially differ from what is expressed implied or forecast in such statements today s call may also contain certain non gaap financial measures please refer to our earnings press release for important disclosures regarding such measures including reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measures joining me on the call today are paul rady chairman and ceo and glen warren president and cfo i will now turn the call over to paul paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer thank you mike and thank you to everyone for listening to the call today in my comments i ll begin with an update on the continued momentum around our internal cost savings initiatives including our lower well cost targets for 2020 and then glen will highlight our balance sheet and liquidity position and provide a brief update on our ongoing asset monetization efforts let s start by discussing the cost reduction momentum across all of antero s cost structure detailed on slide number 3 titled cost reduction momentum nearly half of these reductions will come from lower well costs as we target almost a 2 million per well cost reduction in 2020 relative to our initial 2019 capital budget this equates to roughly 240 million in total well cost savings assuming our budgeted 125 completed wells in 2020 with an average lateral length of 11 400 feet lower midstream fees net marketing expense loe and g a make up the remaining savings of approximately 280 million in total we expect our cost structure to be reduced by 520 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 now let s move on to slide number 4 titled marcellus well cost reductions which provides an update to our marcellus well cost targets driven by expanded flowback water blending operations and continued step change improvements in our drilling and completion efficiencies we are now targeting a reduction of 15 to 18 or 1 7 million to 2 0 million per well the left hand side of the page illustrates ar s january 2019 budgeted well cost at 970 per lateral foot as we exited the fourth quarter of 2019 ar s well costs were approximately 840 per foot which equates to 1 5 million per well of savings achieved as compared to our initial 2019 budget this also represents 55 per foot improvement from our previously targeted fourth quarter 2019 afe these accelerated savings were primarily driven by drier completions enhanced drill out technology and lower costs of flowback water as antero midstream implemented water blending and localized storage operations the coordinated effort between ar and am allowed us to quickly and successfully execute our blending program and deliver savings ahead of schedule looking ahead in 2020 we are targeting a well cost range of 795 to 825 per lateral foot which will be driven by implementing dryer completions in 100 of our wells expanding produced water service through am s pipeline system and further drilling and completion efficiencies slide number 5 titled significant reduction in operating cost structure illustrates how material these cost savings are on a unit cost basis we expect 2020 all in cash expense to be 2 30 per mcf equivalent which is 0 22 lower than the full year 2019 guidance we are forecasting an 0 11 per mcfe reduction in loe g a and gp t or gathering processing and transportation but the biggest driver is an 0 11 decrease in net marketing expense this substantial year over year reduction is due to a combination of higher production volumes and renegotiated terms with third party service providers that allow us to optimize more of our premium priced firm transportation as we grow into our firm transportation portfolio through 2021 we anticipate further reductions bringing our all in cash expense to 2 10 per mcf equivalent in 2022 in 2022 we expect net marketing expense to be 50 million per year or just 0 03 per mcfe as compared to over 250 million or 0 22 per mcfe last year our reduced cost structure will provide us with flexibility and allow antero to generate sustainable free cash flow in 2022 and beyond at current strip prices now let s turn to the operational side by turning to slide 6 entitled marcellus drilling and completion efficiencies as we continue to make improvements on cycle time for 2019 we averaged 5 934 lateral feet drilled per day a 30 increase compared to 2018 during the fourth quarter we set new records for average lateral feet drilled per day averaging 7 000 feet per day and set another new one well world record drilling of 10 453 lateral feet in one day the quarterly average represents a 17 increase in lateral performance from the prior quarter and a 38 increase compared to the 2018 average in lateral performance further the reduction in freshwater used in our completions helped increase our completion stages per day to a new quarterly record of 6 3 stages per day an increase of 7 from the prior quarter in summary our cost reduction efforts have already delivered significant results our fourth quarter d c spend was 300 million and our full year 2019 d c spend was 1 27 billion a 14 decrease from 2018 our 2020 d c capex budget of 1 15 billion is 10 lower than 2019 while still delivering modest production growth of 9 highlighting the improving capital efficiency of our asset these savings along with our industry leading hedge position support our modest growth strategy through 2021 as we fill our premium unused firm transportation commitments it is important to note that this program is projected to be cash flow neutral in 2020 based on today s commodity strip and including the 125 million water earnout payment that we received in january of 2020 with that i will turn it over to glen for his comments glen c warren president chief financial officer and director thanks paul turning to slide number 7 titled substantial liquidity enhancements i d like to start with antero s liquidity position and discuss how we re thinking about upcoming debt maturities in november of 2021 and december of 2022 in early december we announced a three pronged approach to address these upcoming debt maturities the first two shown at the top of the slide internal cost reductions and midstream fee reductions have already been specifically detailed as paul just highlighted our cost reduction initiatives are projected to reduce our all in cost structure by approximately 520 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 these savings combined with the water earnout payment and our robust hedge position lead to a free cash flow neutral profile in 2020 even at today s depressed commodity price strips the third part of our strategy is targeted asset sales as previously stated we are targeting 750 million to 1 billion in asset sales in the year 2020 with proceeds being used to reduce absolute debt the chart on that page shows our liquidity outlook starting with our liquidity position at year end 2019 of 1 5 billion as i mentioned before we expect to be cash flow neutral in 2020 so as you can see the successful execution of our asset sale program will significantly enhance our liquidity position providing more than enough liquidity to address both our 2021 and 2022 remaining maturities illustrated on the right side of the chart we were able to repurchase a notional amount of 225 million of our 2021 s and 2022 s and an overall discount of 17 effectively reducing absolute debt by 37 million now let s review the asset monetization options that we are evaluating turning to slide number 8 titled asset monetization opportunity set you can see we have a multitude of options available to us we have 541 000 net acres in appalachia with 19 tcfe of proved reserves and 12 tcfe of proved developed reserves we have an 84 net revenue interest in our leasehold well above most of our peers our hedge book while always core to our company s strategy could be restructured to bring forward a portion of the approximately 1 1 billion in value that it holds today lastly we own 28 of antero midstream with a current market cap of roughly 685 million that s the market value of the am that we hold our goal is to complete our asset sale program in 2020 and reduce absolute debt having multiple options gives us great confidence that we will be able to achieve our asset sale proceeds target in the coming quarters now i d like to discuss our ngl realizations for the quarter on slide number 9 as we saw tremendous improvement with regard to our c3 ngl pricing during the fourth quarter antero realized a pre hedge c3 ngl price of 29 63 per barrel a 1 26 per barrel premium to mont belvieu this premium was primarily driven by the recently widened international pricing arbitrage versus mont belvieu that we were able to capture through our committed propane and butane volumes on mariner east 2 looking forward we are well positioned to continue realizing premium prices to mont belvieu due to our advantaged position as the largest ngl exporter in the u s and from our access to international markets through marcus hook in pennsylvania as depicted on slide number 9 antero resources most advantaged ngl producer antero is able to capture the international arbitrage versus mont belvieu through direct sales into international markets fixed terminal rates and local fractionation this is in direct contrast to producers with exposure to the gulf coast who received mont belvieu less pricing due to constrained export and storage capacity in the region and no local fractionization that would enable purity product sales looking ahead to the year 2020 we expect our c3 ngl price realizations to continue to be at a premium to mont belvieu providing a truly differentiated ngl story for antero now let s move to slide number 10 titled well protected from near term gas pricing weakness antero resources has a long track record of hedging and selling production forward as we have generated 4 7 billion of net cash hedge gains since the year 2008 for 2020 ar has hedged 94 of its expected natural gas production at 2 87 per mmbtu or approximately 38 above current strip pricing ar is also well hedged in 2021 with 93 of expected natural gas production hedged at 2 80 per mmbtu or approximately 20 above current strip pricing for that year as you can see on slide number 11 titled significant oil and oil equivalent hedge position antero resources is 100 hedged on 26 000 barrels a day of 2020 crude oil and pentane production at approximately 56 a barrel or 10 above current strip prices in conclusion i will round out my comments by directing you to slide number 12 entitled antero long term strategy we have detailed our cost savings initiatives that are expected to extract approximately 520 million from our cost structure in 2020 through lower well costs and reduce cash expenses our new well cost target of 795 per foot at the low end is a substantial decrease from the 970 per foot in our initial 2019 budget saw a year ago these savings are already delivering critical benefits as shown by our capital budget that is 10 below 2019 while still generating moderate production growth our modest growth strategy allows us to realize the 75 million in previously announced gathering processing and transportation expense savings in the year 2020 and ultimately results in 350 million in total savings between 2020 and 2023 additionally by growing into our unutilized firm transportation commitments we reduced our cost structure by another 200 million by the year 2022 combined with our liquids focus and world class hedge book we are forecasting a free cash flow neutral profile in 2020 despite the deterioration of the commodities strip our asset sale program is well under way with proceeds to be used to bolster our liquidity position and reduce absolute debt ultimately further through the asset sale program we will have substantial liquidity available to address our late 2021 and late 2022 debt maturities and to navigate the lower commodity price environment that we re in today with that i ll now turn the call over to the operator for questions questions and answers operator thank you at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session and our first question is from david deckelbaum please proceed with your question david deckelbaum cowen analyst good morning paul and everyone thanks for taking my questions i had two primary ones one you guys had some pretty strong drilling records this quarter realizing your target i think for the year is somewhere in that 6 500 lateral feet per day i guess can you talk about what drove that huge increase was it just drilling some of the longer lateral lengths and realizing efficiencies there and where do you see that progressing i guess the rest of the year paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer yeah as we mentioned in this fourth quarter we averaged 7 000 feet sideways per day which is a continued increase and it s really competitive techniques i would say that we use to get faster and faster in our budget we ve been conservative as to amount of footage per day but there s a very good chance that we ll be able to exceed even what we achieved in the fourth quarter that is more than 7 000 feet per day so really hats off to our drilling department for making such inroads i think we ve compared it across all of the shale plays and we re right there at the top in terms of lateral feet per day it s multiples of what some of the other basins can achieve so we re very very proud of it but to answer to your question i think we ll be able to keep it up and even get faster david deckelbaum cowen analyst i guess what i m asking is what s the difference in perhaps that average and the record of that 10 453 feet per day i guess what was able to be achieved there paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer well the stars do have to align in terms of being at the right spot in the lateral if you have a nice long lateral of 14 000 feet then you re off to the races you can go 10 443 feet in the lateral within 24 hours but the stars don t align and you only have a 9 000 foot lateral to make that point or if you re two thirds of the way through and you only have 7 000 feet remaining then you can t get those 10 000 feet a day records so it all has to fall into place we have to but not many days as you can imagine we make the turn at around 6 300 feet so there s not that many days spent in the lateral so you just need to have a nice long lateral with a good run at it david deckelbaum cowen analyst got it and then just the last one for me just you ve made some headway i guess on some of the transport costs relief out of the firm portfolio are you optimistic that there s more room to go there and i guess what sort of structure are these negotiations taking with some of these firm contracts that you have are these just the signs now at lower tariffs or are these being offloaded to other parties and you re trading out of them just any color you could provide there paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer yeah i would say it s not lower tariffs the tariffs are ferc regulated so we have offloaded some and we ve announced that i think in the fourth quarter and earlier we do what are called asset management agreements they re ferc regulated but amas where a third party or marketing party might take the transportation path off our hands and pay us a fee upfront to do that and then they can market around it and it s a way for us to recoup a good amount of our demand charges so that s out there but as we grow we ll be filling it all with our own equity gas in the meantime it s that either laying it off or buying distressed third party gas at the many receipt points that we have and being able to move it and collect the spread and offset the demand charges or at least some of them and be able to fill the unutilized and continue to whittle down those costs david deckelbaum cowen analyst thanks for the answers guys operator our next question is from welles fitzpatrick please proceed with your question welles fitzpatrick suntrust analyst hey good morning paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer hi welles glen c warren president chief financial officer and director good morning welles fitzpatrick suntrust analyst obviously really impressive drilling records you guys are doing up there in the marcellus and needless to say it s a good problem to have but does the speed that you guys are putting these things away at now i mean does that mean that maybe we should be a little bit more biased to front half weighted capex or possibly even flex down the rig count at some point paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer well i do think flexing down the rig count at some point for us is possible we re just we ve made the point before but years ago we had a high of i think 22 rigs drilling across marcellus and utica and what we can achieve now with four rigs and it s really three big rigs and a smaller top center rig that gets us down to the curve it s just amazing what we can achieve with just this so could antero be able to accomplish as much with fewer rigs someday yeah that s possible certainly we re a leader in the drilling side of things will it translate across the industry will everybody be able to achieve this no probably not depending on the play and circumstances of everybody s inventory so but it s possible to drop our rig count at some point and maintain our growth but don t know if it translates to the rest of industry welles fitzpatrick suntrust analyst okay okay makes sense and then going to the presentation it looks like that the acreage drop of 43 000 to 541 a is it am i right comparing that to the last presentation and b is that mainly coming from maybe utica stuff you wouldn t be getting to for decades paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer yeah it s really exploration it s kind of around the french that we wouldn t be drilling any time soon so we ve let some things go here and there yeah welles fitzpatrick suntrust analyst okay makes lot of sense thank you guys paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer yeah thank you operator and our next question is from jeoffrey lambujon from tudor pickering please proceed with your question jeoffrey lambujon tudor pickering holt co analyst good morning glen c warren president chief financial officer and director hi jeff jeoffrey lambujon tudor pickering holt co analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions my first one is just on longer term financing the free cash flow profile certainly improves year on year as you guys point out as you continue to bring down costs but there still appear to be a gap between cumulative free cash flow generation and some forthcoming maturities as we look out assuming strip pricing as illustrated in the deck and i know that asset sales are a targeted solution for the 2021 s which would augment the credit facility capacity but how do you generally think about not only financing those in the 2022 s but also addressing just the longer term objective of bringing down aggregate debt glen c warren president chief financial officer and director yeah the asset sales obviously bring down aggregate debt so we re targeting up to 1 billion of asset sales and we may even go beyond that over time so we d like to take at least 1 billion out of our total absolute debt getting us down into the mid 2 billion range on absolute debt so that s really our objective there as far as the maturities go obviously the asset sales also would address that we don t have a need to go to the bond market if we are able to execute on the asset sales this year so we think it s a pretty concrete plan and you can t shortchange the cost restructuring because these are obviously subdued prices right now and there is kind of a perfect storm here over the last few months around natural gas and then oil and ngl so i don t think you can take those prices as the longer term view on price so we have tremendous leverage to prices for instance if we had with this reset cost structure if we had just the average prices we realized in the year 2018 we d be generating 1 billion of free cash flow this year if we look out to 2022 when our hedges have rolled off if we have 2 75 per mmbtu natural gas and we have say 28 per barrel c3 and i m assuming kind of a 55 oil price in those kind of normalized pricing environment we re throwing off well over 500 million of free cash flow so prices feel a heck of a lot but we re not assuming that we re assuming that we re going to monetize some of the assets and get the overall debt down jeoffrey lambujon tudor pickering holt co analyst understood i appreciate the detail on that my second one is just around the flexibility around maintenance timing is there a scenario in which you consider moving to that type of capital program sooner than what s been laid out in some of the previous decks or assuming the time line sticks what s the thought process around considering moving to even declines in the out years just in the interest of solving for free cash flow assuming strip pricing holds paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer yeah strip pricing were just a static which it never does of course but if that s your view on prices then in 2022 once our hedges have rolled off we filled our premium firm transportation so we re selling a good free cash flow position there in 2022 and beyond so no plan to differ from that trajectory that we ve laid out you always have to look at that every quarter every year in terms of what s my view on prices how much do i have hedged but we re in pretty good shape right now i think the soft spot today is liquids prices but we are over 30 hedged this year and we re hedged on the highest value products which is our pentanes and our oils so we re in good shape this year from a hedge standpoint and that really gives us the staying power to stick with our budget so i don t see us different from that over the next couple of years but you always have to look at it what s the current outlook jeoffrey lambujon tudor pickering holt co analyst all right thank you operator and our next question is from gregg brody from bank of america please proceed with your question paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer hi greg gregg brody bank of america analyst hey guys good morning glen c warren president chief financial officer and director good morning gregg brody bank of america analyst thanks for the update maybe you could provide some you took your ngl per barrel guidance down which reflecting the curve but curious if you can provide some perspective on the ngl market and maybe your thoughts on the freight markets just to try to help us think through what should we be paying attention to today for price action paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer yeah well i think what we can say is over the last number of months let s say before coronavirus that it was quite a healthy ngl market that international arbs both the northwest europe and the far east we re extremely strong how do we explain that well there was a congestion i guess we could say in the belvieu and the export docks along the gulf and so it was hard to clear liquids in the gulf we have a competitive advantage in sailing time to northwest europe so we were able to pick up a lot of the market there but even beyond that far east was strong they were just not getting enough liquids out of the gulf due to the constraints and congestion there so a very healthy fourth quarter market as mariner east 2 has come on and is ramping up its capacity it s helping to drain the bathtub so to speak of the northeast that s always been a healthy liquids market until so much liquids came on from the marcellus but mariner east is making a good dent in it therefore the we keep about half our volumes to sell domestically and we sell it at the tailgate of the hopedale fractionator and from there we can get prices that are getting closer and closer to belvieu a year ago we would have been 0 25 off belvieu now we re 0 05 to 0 10 off and as mariner drains the bathtub further we re seeing things there climbing toward the belvieu price so for us with the export market it s been healthy a lot of buyers out there now of course coronavirus has put a blanket on everything so we ve definitely slowed down the last few weeks in terms of price expectations still moving our volumes but the international markets are more subdued but absent that we re quite optimistic as to the opportunities there to keep moving barrels out of marcus hook to far east and northwest europe there s good demand and good world growth gregg brody bank of america analyst so it sounds like you could also keep more volumes in appalachia too just because pricing is improving there paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer yes yes that s right gregg brody bank of america analyst got it and maybe just a credit question for you obviously the borrowing base redetermination is coming up in the spring could you give us your thoughts on expectations there and then also with the recent downgrades from the rating agencies you spoke last quarter about potentially having more lc postings i think you said like 100 million to 300 million curious if you re still comfortable with that number and how maybe a surety bond market may offset some of that paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer yeah on the borrowing base we ll have to see where the bank price decks come out they ll be out in the next couple of weeks i think and then we can start to look at that again keep in mind that we re so well hedged on the first couple of years that s really where the likely price action downgrade is from the banks on their strips so any reduction there versus what we looked at in the fall is likely muted by the hedge book so we re not too concerned about that and we feel confident that we re going to have a 1 billion plus cushion above our lender commitments of 2 6 billion maybe it s 1 5 billion cushion somewhere in that range but we ll see how that shakes out so the good news is we have the borrowing base we will be in excess of the lender commitments there so that keeps us in a great position from a liquidity standpoint our liquidity numbers those are all based on just the current lender commitments not the total borrowing base of course and then glen c warren president chief financial officer and director yeah on the lcs i think gregg you should probably noted that we reduced some by 80 million in q4 down to 623 million those downgrades that you mentioned from the rating agencies did increase that amount we have that amount in our 10 k currently it s at 730 million so that s the extent of it so we basically offset the rating agency downgrades with increased surety bonds and we continue to work on that and are working on other lcs to replace them as surety bond so hopefully we ll have some update for you on that at the end of the first quarter gregg brody bank of america analyst so the 730 million takes into account all of the every glen c warren president chief financial officer and director that s correct yeah gregg brody bank of america analyst i think you said there was so you ve got that and you could possibly reduce it more you think glen c warren president chief financial officer and director right gregg brody bank of america analyst all right i ll hope back in a queue thank you for the time guys glen c warren president chief financial officer and director thanks gregg operator and our next question is from holly stewart from scotia howard weil you may proceed with your question holly stewart scotia howard weil analyst good morning gentlemen glen c warren president chief financial officer and director good morning paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer hi holly holly stewart scotia howard weil analyst maybe just first you guys have talked a lot about the asset sale program glen or paul could you just maybe talk about how the a d market is sort of shaping up right now glen c warren president chief financial officer and director well first off i mean that s not our primary focus in the a d market so we re not out there marketing anything specifically in the a d market we ve talked in the past about minerals and overriding royalty we have some discussions there beyond that the other things are sort of outside of that they re unsolicited type discussions and other big numbers in terms of what we re talking about these days and how much of it gets done that remains to be seen but that s kind of all we can say right now it s going to take some time and we ll see how that unfolds but we re confident on getting all that done in 2020 holly stewart scotia howard weil analyst okay fair enough and then maybe just on the capital spending program for the year can you just outline some maybe the trends or the cadence i guess throughout 2020 for the spending as well as the sort of production outline paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer yeah the production is a ratable growth holly up to average at 3 5 from the q4 2019 on the capital the capital slightly a little more in the first and second quarter as we mentioned with those drilling efficiencies in our drilling ability of those four rigs are currently running right now for the first three quarters and then its three rigs in the fourth quarter so slightly down in the fourth quarter but generally even throughout just slightly lower in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the other three quarters for capital holly stewart scotia howard weil analyst okay that s great and just a follow up on the lc question so it looked like at year end you re at 623 million and you re saying post the rating agency movement now you re at 730 million and then you ll look to decrease that with further surety bond issuances glen c warren president chief financial officer and director correct that s correct yeah holly stewart scotia howard weil analyst okay great thank you glen c warren president chief financial officer and director thank you operator and our next question is from arun jayaram from jpmorgan please proceed with your question arun jayaram jpmorgan analyst yeah glen i was wondering about your longer term hedging strategy looking beyond 2021 glen c warren president chief financial officer and director yeah i ll let paul comment on that paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer yeah so we ve made the point especially on gas that we re hedged through 2021 so we ve obviously we ve done well in hedging over the last 10 plus years and we don t plan to stop that just gives us a lot of comfort a lot of protection against the price falling away like it has recently so we re looking out there but the prices are not interesting enough for us right now but we ll we keep an eye on things every day every month and the opportunity will arise and so we ll do that we ll be hedging a lot of our gas in cal 22 and beyond as prices come back as hopefully they will and yeah so that s where our focus is beyond on the gas price gas hedging pricing as to liquids we keep an eye on that as well and there s still some to be done in the ngls but we re pretty solid on oil for this year and as you know it s oil goes up and down but very liquid and very readily doable on a short notice so we ll watch that as well from cal 21 arun jayaram jpmorgan analyst okay and i know that you have the asset sales program a lot of different levers that you could pull i was wondering if we do have some merchandise i think eqt does have a processed on the mineral side and perhaps your utica asset but can you just talk at a higher level what type of interest that you re seeing in minerals i know range was able to do a couple of two three asset sales that kind of equated to at 12 5 times kind of multiple in terms of cash flow as well as what you re seeing in terms of market appetite for undeveloped acreage or non cash flowing acreage in appalachia paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer yeah i d just say we have we see strong interest in all that and we won t have any color to announce on it until we have a deal to announce so that s all i m going to say on that at this point arun jayaram jpmorgan analyst fair enough thanks a lot paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer thank you glen c warren president chief financial officer and director thank you operator and our next question is from betty jiang from credit suisse proceed with your question betty jiang credit suisse analyst thank you good morning paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer hi betty betty jiang credit suisse analyst so just looking at the on the cost side cash costs came down 0 07 from the guidance given last december and a lot of that reduction came in gp t and net marketing expense so just trying to understand what s the key driver of that reduction just over the last two months glen c warren president chief financial officer and director yeah key driver is just as our production grows it fills our capacity we ve talked about laying off through asset management agreements any paths that we re not using and get prepaid for it and as spreads have widened that is as the regional pipelines have gotten more and more full so there s not that much unused capacity and the capacity that is unused and i m talking about industry capacity through appalachia not everybody can reach that and so the spreads have widened they ve widened to the gulf to chicago so we re able to buy third party gas and fill that transport and collect the spread and so all of that helps to fill what we have make the most of our assets and be able to offset some of those demand charges betty jiang credit suisse analyst got it so i mean just given the magnitude of that decline certainly welcome like are there do you see more room for that cost to come down and then separately like could we see more relief coming from midstream partners paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer i wouldn t expect anything with midstream partners but with long haul transport which is held by ar of course as the spreads widen the third party gas or as spreads widen and laying off any full paths and get prepaid we could see improvement as it becomes more constrained and as the spreads widened all of that goes into antero s interest into our pocket and helps to offset any of that ft so sure it can definitely improve betty jiang credit suisse analyst and follow up just on that too on the reduction that we have seen based on optimization of spreads could that persist beyond 2020 relative to what you guys were thinking about in december paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer yes that of course on all pipes the spreads get remarked every day or even within the day meaning that there s four trading cycles in the day so the spreads are always moving always changing but there s always the potential as there s more gas here and more demand there that spreads can definitely improve and as they have since the fourth quarter and so sure there s definitely potential for that to help us betty jiang credit suisse analyst got it thank you for that operator our next question is from tarek hamid from jpmorgan you may proceed with your question tarek hamid jpmorgan analyst good morning paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer hi tarek glen c warren president chief financial officer and director good morning tarek hamid jpmorgan analyst just a follow up on the lcs can you maybe just talk a little bit about the surety bond market kind of what you re seeing in terms of rate and tenor in that market just sort of trying to get a sense of kind of the cost of those how to think about the cost of those moves glen c warren president chief financial officer and director yeah the costs are just very similar to the lcs and they re for a one year term tarek hamid jpmorgan analyst and then a little bit more interesting topic just on the sort of am units you then sort of highlighted them as an asset and you also highlighted the sort of the am rp capacity could you maybe just talk a little bit about how you think about sort of selling those units to am versus selling it to a third party sort of what s the calculus in your mind between sort of control versus non control on the buyer paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer yeah first off i mean we re in sort of an enviable position of having time right we re not too concerned about having to do anything right away so they re not trading at an attractive price for a sale right now from ar s perspective i don t think so we ll see how that plays out over time tarek but it s something that we ll just keep an eye on it s not sort of our number one priority right now tarek hamid jpmorgan analyst and that was literally my follow up on how do you think about the timing given that sort of every move you make on ar clearly benefits the am valuation as well over time is that the right way to think about staging of potential sales paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer well i just i wouldn t hyperfocus on that i mean am has some appetite probably to buy more shares it has a program out there and those shares may be bought from ar or bought in the open market but ar is not in a position to it s not leaning in on selling am shares right now i think is the read so we can be patient and it s something we ll look at throughout the year tarek hamid jpmorgan analyst got it appreciate it i ll get back in queue thank you paul m rady chairman and chief executive officer thank you glen c warren president chief financial officer and director thank you operator and i have reached the end of the question and answer session and i will turn the call back over to michael kennedy for closing remarks michael

for our companies from financial to operational to environmental results we achieved solid earnings at both our utility and bank and grew consolidated earnings 8 we strengthened our consolidated return on equity to 9 8 and improved earned roe at the utility and maintained a strong roe at the bank our utility continued to deliver on key priorities of its five year plan we re especially proud that hawaiian electric and the state of hawaii were recognized for their leadership in transforming our state to a clean energy carbon neutral economy our state s leadership and innovation in clean energy transformation was highlighted in recent reports by the rocky mountain institute and public utilities fortnightly and hawaiian electric was named 2019 utility of the year by utility dive american savings bank also performed well delivering 5 7 loan growth and maintaining a net interest margin above its peers excluding a onetime net gain on sale of properties the bank exited as it moved to its new campus bank earnings were up slightly from 2018 despite lower than expected interest rates our pacific current team continued to focus on optimizing its existing project portfolio and pursuing additional sustainable investment opportunities with our continued financial performance and our confidence in our future prospects our board approved a second consecutive annual increase in the dividend raising the quarterly dividend per share from 0 32 to 0 33 or 1 32 annually at hawaiian electric our 2019 accomplishments reflect goals and initiatives from our 2015 to 2020 strategic transformation plan which focused on delivering a cost effective clean energy portfolio improving customer experiences and offering innovative energy solutions creating a modern grid and technology platform strengthening stakeholder relationships and working with stakeholders to align regulatory and market models with the transformation of our industry and company improving company culture and ensuring we have the financial strength to deliver on this transformation and our state s ambitious energy goals at our utility we made great strides on each of these priorities and have great momentum into 2020 on clean energy energy sales from renewables reached 28 driven by new utility scale solar and a nearly 5 increase in private rooftop solar we experienced our largest single year increase in solar capacity we secured puc approval of seven purchase power agreements for the lowest cost solar plus storage seen to date in hawaii we launched our largest ever stage two combined renewables storage and grid services rfp which attracted more than 75 bidders and we re hard at work evaluating those bids we also renegotiated the puna geothermal ppa which if approved by the puc is expected to reduce hawaii island customer bills in our approval request we ve also proposed a shared savings performance incentive we completed our company owned west loch solar project which is now delivering the lowest cost solar in the state on customer experience we achieved customer satisfaction scores in the top third of the industry we continued to develop new programs for customers to participate in the clean energy transformation this includes our project footprint campaign to inspire customers to adopt sustainable practices and contribute to hawaii s renewable energy goals and it includes the approval of hawaii s first community based renewable energy project as we ve mentioned in the past with limited land especially on oahu we cannot achieve 100 renewable energy without private rooftop solar and other customer sited resources in recognition of the importance of customer resources we ve reorganized and created a dedicated customer energy resources department to serve customers connecting to our grid with rooftop floor and other devices given our ambitious renewable plans we need modernized grids with enhanced technologies capable of integrating large amounts of both utility scale and customer sited renewables in 2019 we reached an important milestone when the first phase of our grid modernization strategy was improved in march and we re now executing on that strategy our expertise in developing and operating complex grids was recognized in october when we were awarded a competitively bid 50 year contract to own operate and maintain the army s electric distribution system serving 12 installations here on oahu our request for approval of that contract is now pending with the puc we ve continued to work together with our communities and stakeholders to find the best ways to achieve a clean energy future that s affordable reliable and resilient there are two hawaiian words that describe the way in which hawaii must work to achieve a clean energy future the first is kako o meaning it will take our whole community working together it also must be done in a way that is pono that is right and just for our communities in 2019 we have focused on stakeholder engagement this includes workshops to gain stakeholder input as we undertake our next phase of resource and grid planning or integrated grid planning it also includes ongoing community based resilience planning workshops on the windward side of oahu stakeholder engagement has also been central to the evolution of our regulatory framework in 2019 the commission the utility and stakeholders began the design phase of performance based regulation or pbr which will be implemented in 2021 parties have submitted their pbr proposals and we look forward to continued collaboration with stakeholders we are encouraged that there have been no surprises as we progressed through the design phase we also advanced efforts to improve the utilities culture and the key accomplishment in 2019 was completing consolidation of functions across all three of our utilities under our one company initiative finally we continue to improve the financial health of our utility as earnings and earned roe improved and we continue to pursue a number of cost management initiatives our bank also had a number of significant achievements in 2019 although 2019 s interest rate environment turned out to be very different from expectations when we started the year american performed well highlighting its stability and the consistency of its business and business model despite the challenging interest rate environment bank net income excluding the gains from the property sales was slightly up from 2018 which was a record earnings year american maintained an above peer net interest margin despite the low interest rate environment with net interest margin of 3 85 for the year up slightly from 2018 the bank is now operating in its new state of the art campus this was an important move for our bank s team members and the bank is focused on realizing the benefits of the consolidation into the new space including increased collaboration and efficiency 2019 was also a milestone year for pacific current its first year with its own management team in place under their leadership pacific current signed a contract to meet a portion of our hamakua plant s fuel supply with locally sourced biodiesel we are proud that pacific current is able to execute transactions that contribute to the sustainability and energy independence of our islands we also launched the evercharge hawaii joint venture to address the accessibility of ev charging for multiunit dwelling and high rise office buildings to encourage broader electric vehicle adoption construction for the university of hawaii solar plus storage projects also move forward and we will start seeing those projects become operational throughout the year so as you can see we ve had a very active and productive year across our enterprise i ll now ask greg to update you on our 2019 financial results and also our 2020 guidance gregory c hazelton executive vice president and chief financial officer and treasurer thanks connie as shown on slide seven hawaii s economy remained stable in 2019 and finished the year at a record level of visitors exceeding 10 million for the year this represented a 5 4 increase over 2018 with visitor expenditures also up slightly unemployment remained low at 2 6 as of december well below the national average hawaii real estate sales volumes were up for single family homes and prices on oahu were flat condo sales volumes were down while condo prices were up slightly over the prior year the state s outlook is stable with moderate gdp growth expected at 0 9 in 2020 and 1 1 in 2021 i would note we are also closely monitoring coronavirus developments and the potential impacts on our hawaii economy and our businesses turning to our results in 2019 we achieved solid consolidated financial performance with good results at both the bank and the utility 2019 consolidated earnings increased 8 to approximately 218 million or 1 99 per share our 2019 results included a 5 5 million gain on the sale net of associated cost of two former bank properties the year over year earnings grew at the bank even when excluding the net gain from the property sales the holding company and other segment loss grew primarily due to higher interest expense from incremental long term debt issued in late 2018 on the right side of the slide of slide eight our consolidated roe for the last 12 months was 9 8 up 30 basis points from last year utility roe for the last 12 months improved 20 basis points while bank roe including the impact of the gain on sale was comparable to last year turning to slide nine utility net income grew 9 to 157 million contributing 1 43 to eps well within our guidance range of 1 40 to 1 47 on an after tax basis the most significant net income drivers were 24 million revenue increase from recovery under the ram and from rate increases from our investments to integrate more renewable energy improved customer reliability and increase system efficiency 11 million revenue increase for recovery of the schofield generation project under the major project interim recovery mechanism 2 million of additional revenue earned under performance incentives for procuring low cost renewable energy for customers and achieving better reliability in call center performance and 2 million from lower interest expense due to debt refinancing these were partially offset by 15 million higher operations and maintenance expenses compared to 2018 primarily due to higher overhaul and maintenance expenses for generating facilities higher support costs from outside services for asset management and energy management systems enterprise resource planning software and support costs costs related to grid modernization projects and the reset of pension costs included in rates on oahu and in maui county as part of rate case decisions also 9 million higher depreciation expense due to increasing investments to integrate more renewable energy improve customer reliability and increase system efficiency and 5 million lower net income versus 2018 due to favorable tax adjustments in 2018 on slide 10 american s earnings grew about 1 million over 2018 when excluding the onetime net gain from property sales including the net gain the bank earned 89 million contributing 0 81 to the consolidated eps within our guidance range of 0 79 to 0 85 which was also which also included the net gain on sale the most significant after tax drivers of the variance from 2018 were 4 million higher net interest income driven by growth in interest earning assets primarily from strong loan growth 6 million higher provision for loan losses reflecting additional reserves for the consumer loan portfolio and borrower specific circumstances requiring additional reserves on loans within the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios 13 million higher noninterest income primarily due to the 10 8 million pre tax gain on sales of former properties and increased mortgage banking income and 6 million increase in noninterest expense primarily due to higher compensation and benefit expenses as well as higher occupancy costs related to the campus move turning to slide 11 american remains solidly profitable in 2019 including the impact on the net gain on property sales return on assets was 125 basis points up from 120 basis points in 2018 return on equity continued to compare favorably to peers at a 13 5 equivalent to 2018 let s turn to key elements that drove net income and profitability on slide 12 american s net interest margin has continued to perform well against both our similarly sized and hawaii based peers net interest margin of 3 85 for the year was flat compared to 2018 and at the low end of our guidance range of 3 85 to 3 95 fourth quarter net interest margin was 3 74 compared to 3 82 in the linked quarter and 3 95 in the fourth quarter of 2018 with the decline primarily due to lower yields on interest earning assets as you can see our fourth quarter interest earning asset yield of 4 was lower than both the linked and prior year quarters for the full year 2019 interest earning asset yield was 4 14 cost of funds has remained low as we continue to benefit from our disciplined approach and focus on relationship banking our cost of funds was 26 basis points in the fourth quarter well below peers on slide 13 total loans were 5 1 billion as of december 31 up 5 7 from the prior year with retail loans up 4 1 total deposits grew to 6 3 billion as of december 31 an increase of 1 8 from the prior year reflecting a strategic reduction in government cd funding while core deposits grew a healthy 3 2 net interest income for the year increased 2 2 over 2018 to 248 1 million while fourth quarter 2019 net interest income of 60 9 million was slightly lower than the linked and prior year quarters fourth quarter and full year noninterest income was elevated primarily due to 10 8 million in pre tax gain on the sales of the former properties as well as increased mortgage banking income as we ve stated before this resulted the sale resulted in a 5 5 million after tax gain net of exit costs on slide 14 credit quality remains sound due to prudent risk management in the stable hawaii economy the credit quality of our residential portfolio remains solid with strong collateral values and low default rates and our commercial and commercial real estate portfolios are stable as previously mentioned the higher provision in 2019 where related provision was related to consumer the consumer loan portfolio and borrower specific circumstances for certain commercial and commercial real estate loans allowance for loan losses of 53 4 million was 1 04 of outstanding loans at year end equivalent to the linked quarter and modestly lower than the same quarter last year nonaccrual loans were 0 58 down from the linked quarter and slightly above the same quarter last year our net charge off ratio increased to 45 basis points for the year compared to 34 basis points from 2018 driven by the personal unsecured loan portfolio and the partial charge off of the commercial credit the net charge off ratio for the fourth quarter was down from the linked quarter which included the partial charge off of just a partial charge off we just mentioned let s turn to our expectations for future performance starting with our utility capex forecast in 2019 we invested 450 million of capex well above our revised capex guidance for the year as we accelerated certain investments originally planned for 2020 this included baseline capex projects focused on improving reliability resilience as well as grid modernization projects among others our 2020 forecast of 360 million reflects the partial acceleration of capex into 2019 while it s difficult to perfectly time capital expenditures over year end periods on average the 2019 and 2020 investments are consistent with the 400 million per year of investments necessary to achieve our grid modernization resilience and reliability goals in 2021 to 2022 period we expect capex to average approximately 400 million per year the midpoint of our 350 million to 450 million guidance range or about two times depreciation our capex growth starting with 2018 as a baseline through the end of the forecast period translates to an average annual rate base growth of 4 to 6 through 2022 this is slightly lower than the 5 to 7 rate base growth guidance range we ve provided in for the 2019 to 2021 period due to the denial of the in 2019 of two planned battery storage projects and a reevaluation of future utility battery storage investment opportunities in light of those decisions our capital investments remain focused on maintaining reliability and resilience as we integrate more renewable energy and modernize our grid importantly we expect the utility to be able to continue to self fund its forecasted capex through 2020 via retained earnings and access to the debt capital markets on slide 16 our financing outlook for 2020 reflects our strong financial condition the bank which has long been self funding has continued to provide strong dividends given its consistent performance in 2019 asb s dividends to the holding company was 56 million and in 2020 we expect that increase to increase to approximately 75 million an increase of 33 from 2019 the utility is expected to be able to support a 65 industry average payout ratio to hei and hei plans to invest approximately 35 million of equity to support hawaiian electric s capital investment program and its puc approved capital structure with improved cash distributions from the bank and utility we do not anticipate the need to issue any external equity in 2020 unless we identify significant additional accretive investment opportunities our improved earnings and cash flow outlook has allowed us to grow the hei dividend while managing our capital structure to maintain our investment grade rating on slide 17 we are initiating our 2020 consolidated earnings guidance of 1 90 to 2 10 per share consisting of 1 46 to 1 54 at the utility 0 73 to 0 80 at the bank and a loss of 0 27 to 0 29 the holding company and other company segment our 2020 utility guidance assumes no change to our major regulatory recovery mechanisms as we await the puc s order expected at year end approving the final design of pbr we also assume o m expense increasing at or below inflation and no material impacts from performance incentive penalties or rewards utility guidance also includes approximately a 5 million net income impact from continued customer benefits or bill reductions agreed to in the last hawaiian electric and maui electric rate cases as shown in our appendix our 2020 bank guidance reflects continued stability from the bank with earnings relatively consistent with 2019 excluding the onetime 5 5 million gain from the american s property sales the bank guidance reflects american s disciplined approach to growth with earning asset growth targeted to low to mid single digits it also reflects expectations for a continued low interest rate environment as well as needed technology investments and upgrade to core systems as we continue to build up the pacific current platform we continue to expect that it will not contribute meaningfully to 2020 earnings connie will now make her closing remarks constance hee lau president and chief executive officer thanks greg the accomplishments and financial guidance we ve talked about today are part of our strategy to deliver sustainable long term value for all of our stakeholders we ve long viewed the success of our enterprise and the value we deliver to shareholders as inextricably linked with the value we deliver for our customers our employees and our community and the health of our environment our economy and our state as a whole with all of our operations here in hawaii and island state with ambitious renewable energy carbon neutrality and clean transportation goals we are very attuned to both the risks and also the opportunities presented by climate change last summer our board spent most of its strategic retreat on climate change as well as other environmental social and governance or esg considerations since then we ve been formally integrating climate change and esg into our strategic planning enterprise risk management and our disclosures we ve been reporting on certain key esg metrics for some time since one of our core strategies is to help hawaii transition to 100 renewable energy we ll be expanding our disclosures and are targeting to issue our first sustainability accounting standards board or sasb aligned report in 2020 and also plan to add tcfd or task force on climate related financial disclosures thereafter to further align management incentives with our strategic goals our board has increased the proportion of performance based executive compensation to include the achievement of renewable portfolio standards ahead of state mandated time lines and you ll see that in our upcoming proxy our board is always focused on strong governance and in our proxy statement you ll also see our board s proposals to enhance our governance policies by adopting majority voting and declassifying the board over the next three years we see these initiatives as further enhancing our core strategies and governance profile across our companies to reflect best practices in summary 2019 financial performance was in line with expectations and guidance and we look forward to continuing to deliver consistent results in 2020 our utilities will continue to focus on achieving our state s 100 clean energy and carbon neutral economy goals while ensuring affordable reliable and resilient energy our bank continues to provide a strong platform to deliver stable sustained value for customers shareholders and our communities pacific current is a promising platform and we ll continue pursuing further sustainable investment opportunities our company allows us to create value for our communities here in hawaii while creating long term sustainable value for our shareholders everywhere finally before turning to q a i want to welcome eva zlotnicka to our board of directors as we announced yesterday eva joins our board from the valueact spring fund as we believe that we and valueact are committed to the same goals including hawaii s ambitious renewable energy and carbon neutral goals and the desire to serve our customers and communities well with that said we re here today to discuss our 2019 results and 2020 guidance and ask that you focus your questions on those topics finally this is alan oshima s last webcast so i want to thank him for his amazing leadership of our utility during this time of great change scott seu succeeds alan on february 15 and we are confident that he will continue our leading edge work of helping our state achieve its ambitious goals and with that we look forward to your questions questions and answers operator and the first question today comes from eric lee of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead eric lee bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good afternoon thanks for taking my question maybe first off i just wanted to check in for asb how should we think about average interest earning asset growth i see that it was about 1 for 2019 could you just discuss the drivers there and expectations for that portfolio growth on a forward basis richard f wacker hawaiian electric industries inc yes this is rich thanks for the question we re targeting mid single low to mid single digits so that would be in the kind of 3 4 range typically there and if you see what we did this year and i think greg highlighted core deposit growth was about 3 last year we offset that with some reductions in some of the higher government cd that brought us back down to kind of the 1 overall so we think we ve had adjustments done so it s kind of normal course business trying to keep that consistent we ve had it for multiple years that 3 to 5 range and that s through just everything we re doing around relationship expansion and growing primary customer primary bank customers eric lee bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it so we should expect it to normalize back to the expectation for 2020 at least within embedded within guidance as a normalization back toward that richard f wacker hawaiian electric industries inc right eric lee bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay that s helpful and then maybe shifting to the utility a little bit could you just discuss the capex outlook a bit more it seems like there was a bit of a decrease there as well as under rate base outlook subsequently could you discuss the drivers toward the low and high and i get that there was a little bit of a pull forward into 2019 2020 but it seems like 2021 and 22 are lower relative to the prior 400 million to 500 million guidance gregory c hazelton executive vice president and chief financial officer and treasurer yes we ve revised the guidance range as you ve seen the 350 million to 450 million on a forward basis with a point estimate about 360 million for 2020 and as i highlighted mentioned previously you ve got to look at that in conjunction with the 2019 because you really q1 projects being accelerated and then the timing of those really puts you just slightly above 400 million and that s consistent with our a midpoint of our guidance range on a going forward basis that level that s down a bit from what we had previously shown before 400 million to 500 million as we look forward to the major capital investments across the system which also included a couple of battery several actually battery energy storage projects that were on the planning board as you know two projects were declined this last year and we ve i think conservatively reevaluated how much of those projects we put into our forward capex as we think that some of them may be competitively procured versus utility build and we will update the forecast as we get clarity relative to those types of projects is that so those are the major drivers eric lee bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right that s certainly helpful so it seems like the battery storage is what would be toward the high end presumably of that range gregory c hazelton executive vice president and chief financial officer and treasurer yes in all major any major projects they come in a bit lumpy and they and that s why you have a range from year to year tayne tayne s y sekimura senior vice president and chief financial officerd yes so and adding to what greg said what would thrust this more into the higher end of the range are like the acceleration of some of the project expenditures for example with the army privatization we ve got a schedule for that with commission decision making and depending on when that decision comes out we may be able to accelerate some of those expenditures and then also on the grid modernization we do put our best forecast forward but depending on the pace of that project there could be some acceleration and as you may know the grid modernization projects they don t come in in one big chunk they come in smoothly over the period so we have some of that that could support the higher end of the range eric lee bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it that s helpful and just one more question before i pass it on perhaps so i know you mentioned the rooftop solar earlier in your conversations toward meeting the rps goals could you just discuss plans on dr integration broadly and how discussions there have been going around potential incentives with pbr and how that maybe also ties into grid mod spend just given presumably need for grid mod to support dr integration alan m oshima chairman president and chief executive officer this is alan i think we can just speak in generalities we are dependent on an increased percentage of private rooftop solar given their very small relative land base in hawaii that s available for renewable projects we ve recently combined our dr demand response and der activities seeing the benefit of folks offsetting each other or complementing each other we look forward to increased penetration of rooftop private rooftop combined with behind the meter storage so there s so many moving parts to our total renewable efforts and we re looking at many different generating resources to get to our 100 does that answer your question or did you have a different question in mind eric lee bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes i was just wondering in addition to that just how discussions have been going around potential incentive like pims with pbr their performance incentive mechanisms for supporting dr integration i know that that was one of the pillars discussed within pbr so just wondering if there s anything to point to joseph p viola vice president this is joe viola with the regulatory affairs at hawaiian electric so as you ve identified that s correct currently the pbr docket is in the phase 2 as we call it the kind of the design phase so the commission has asked all the parties to develop and propose incentive mechanisms specifically related to der integration so that s in process parties have been developing proposals the hawaiian electric companies have submitted proposals several other stakeholders have and the commission has indicated expects to have a decision on those proposals collectively in december of this year so we re still we re waiting eric lee bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thank you appreciate it joseph p viola vice president thanks eric operator the next question today comes from paul patterson of glenrock associates please go ahead paul patterson glenrock associates analyst we re all doing so just to sort of follow up on that rate base question i m a little bit when you look at 2021 before we just get without going into all the capex timing and acceleration what have you rate base itself seems to be like substantially lower than what your expectations were before is that because of the battery storage or if you could just clarify what s causing the substantial decrease in the expectation for 2021 tayne s y sekimura senior vice president and chief financial officerd paul this is tayne yes in terms of what s causing that decline it was the battery energy storage projects for slated for completion in that time frame and what we had in the forecast and what you previously saw was about 140 million of investments of battery storage here in oahu constance hee lau president and chief executive officer so paul if you remember that those were going to be companies done projects and they were put into the competitive bid rfp paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay i got you and then with respect to pbr you guys mentioned the constructive process that collaborative or stakeholder process that you guys have going on do you think there s a potential for a settlement given where you are now or could you comment a little bit on that or just any more color on how that s proceeding joseph p viola vice president this is joe viola again so i m not sure we re still actually we just had a i just came over from a workshop today so the schedule and the doc calls were continuing exchange between the parties to better understand positions but the commission has encouraged all of the parties and stakeholders to focus on developing their own proposals we certainly see many areas of alignment but i don t know that we expect any type of settlement we expect the parties to do what the commission has asked us to do to provide very comprehensive detailed proposals to address the outcomes they want to promote in this proceeding paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay so alan congratulations i wanted to alan m oshima chairman president and chief executive officer thank you paul paul patterson glenrock associates analyst you missed these calls so but a few quarters ago i think i asked you about the potential for rate increases with respect to with pbr with the transformation etc and it was a little too early i think you guys felt comfortable in terms of commenting on what the potential rate increase or rate outlook might be leaving fuel and stuff out of the picture and i m just wondering given how things have been coming in sort of just do you have an update on how we should think about the rate impact you guys are looking at now we ve now that you re further along in the pbr further along in your rate base and outlook and what have you alan m oshima chairman president and chief executive officer well this will be an unsatisfactory answer to a very good question i don t think we have an update as joe mentioned we re still in pbr we won t get the results of the full docket till the end of this year we re seeing i think the most comforting aspect of the process is that the environmental utility financial aspects are all being discussed at the same time and there s some true understanding of the totality of as connie mentioned earlier how this has to be kako o that is all of us together operating toward a very ambitious state energy policy which we are all fully committed to but underlying it is a realization and i think it s always been emphasized by our regulators as one of the guiding principles and that is the financial integrity of the utility because it is the grid that makes it all possible so with that i mean as unsatisfactory as that may be in terms of a metrics driven answer i don t think we can give any more color to it than that but it s been a good process so far paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay great no problem then just finally on the coronavirus i know that obviously the virus can travel and what have you you guys have a substantial amount of asian tourism but how much do you have like off the top of your head the percentage of tourism that comes from china as opposed to asia in general gregory c hazelton executive vice president and chief financial officer and treasurer yes we ve looked at that as you know we get about 10 million visitors annually we just broke through that threshold from mainland china and hong kong it s approximately 1 or slightly below so it s pretty minimal overall so the things we d be concerned about is travel in general people s willingness to get on planes and travel which could impact the economy somewhat paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay great thanks so much gregory c hazelton executive vice president and chief financial officer and treasurer thank you thanks for operator the next question comes from charles fishman of morningstar charles fishman morningstar analyst well first alan good luck to you alan m oshima chairman president and chief executive officer thank you very much charles fishman morningstar analyst and then let me make sure i got these i m thinking about this right the bank generated about 0 81 about a 0 05 of that was from the headquarter sale leaving 0 76 for this year or last year which is about the midpoint of guidance so essentially excluding the gain the bank s roughly flattish yet you re projecting a dividend increase that is like 1 3 higher what can you give a little more color on that what s going on richard f wacker hawaiian electric industries inc yes so thanks for the question so if you ll notice our capital levels ticked up across the second half of the year we were in the process we re adopting cecl the new accounting standard for provisions this year and so we were retaining a little bit more capital so when that adjustment comes through which is an adjustment to the provision level a onetime adjustment to the provision level offset to capital that we end up in a good spot relative to our overall capitalization and so with that we have the ability to dividend up a little bit more of our earnings as we go through the year and stay in a good spot constance hee lau president and chief executive officer and charles i ll just add that so the bank will still be targeting what has been our longtime target of about 8 5 on the tier one leverage ratio so as rich just noted they had trended above that toward the end of 2019 and now they ll be coming back down to that charles fishman morningstar analyst so the 75 million of dividend that you re projecting for 2020 is pretty much a new base going forward richard f wacker hawaiian electric industries inc no no thank you on an ongoing basis you d expect our traditional levels to be about the right component of earnings that we would and we have a little bit of an adjustment this year in 2020 projected as we reset to the ongoing leverage ratio that we ve been in the past too gregory c hazelton executive vice president and chief financial officer and treasurer and remember that we re anticipating consistent earnings performance through this period of time so there ll be some level of consistency to the dividend capabilities of the bank going forward charles fishman morningstar analyst got it that s helpful just another question on the utility last quarter we talked a lot about the capex especially because of the cycling of the diesel units and that s understandable with the i mean you re sort of the canary here with what s going on with renewable in the country if not the world and hearing you talk about that but certainly a concern of something that maybe nobody in the industry is fully appreciating at least on the analyst side i didn t hear you talk about that this time in fact you said on the guidance o m at or below inflation so is that something that was just a one timer or you just didn t talk about it gregory c hazelton executive vice president and chief financial officer and treasurer well we so we did show it as a year over year increase 2018 to 2019 so that was in some of our results this year ultimately you re absolutely right those units have to be kept in good work in order to backstop all of the renewable energy and it s a cycle however we have to operate in them and if we cycle them higher levels we have to have the appropriate maintenance for those but i think prospectively we ve gone through a series of periods with major overhauls and those the major overhauls don t have to be done annually is that right tayne tayne s y sekimura senior vice president and chief financial officerd yes so charles this is tayne sekimura so when we look at our overhauls our planned overhauls and it depends on run hours and they can be lumpy in between years and so and if you link it to what we see from a recovery standpoint i mean it could also be a little lumpy as you look at it over a period of time as you look into 2020 though and trying to understand the o m forecast being at or below inflation how to think about it we did talk about our completion of our one company initiative where we restructured functions to allow more standardization and consistency of work and that will help us in terms of bringing more efficiencies to our utility as well as enabling us to do things like strategic sourcing in our purchasing area in this forecast for 2020 we also have embedded our benefits from use of our new system using sap which went live in the fourth quarter of 2018 those efficiencies are also embedded in 2020 as well so you can see that s how we re allowed to forecast an o m level of at or below inflation constance hee lau president and chief executive officer charles i d add to what tayne said about the sap erp savings because those are now fully ramped up they were ramping up over 2019 so they re fully ramped up now for the 2020 year charles fishman morningstar analyst okay i forgot about that sap that s right well that s good to hear that it s providing benefit that s all i had thank you very much constance hee lau president and chief executive officer thanks charles operator the last question today comes from andy levi of exoduspoint gregory c hazelton executive vice president and chief financial officer and treasurer andy julie r smolinski director of investor relation strategic planning hi andy andy levi exoduspoint analyst how are you just two very quick ones just i guess following up on paul just on the coronavirus so how specifically does it i thought you guys would decouple how will this affect i mean i understand the tourism part but how does it affect the earnings overall gregory c hazelton executive vice president and chief financial officer and treasurer well potentially through economic activity that could impact the commercial enterprises where the bank has deployed capital and is lending into the community it could slow down commercial activity somewhat that would be one concern we ve also keeping a close eye on the supply chain for procurement of our renewable projects if that gets either constrained or the cost of those go up we haven t seen anything to date but it s something continued to monitor because bringing those projects online is very important to us andy levi exoduspoint analyst so it s more project related and bank related gregory c hazelton executive vice president and chief financial officer and treasurer i would think so andy levi exoduspoint analyst okay and then just for 2020 just in your forecast for the utility what roe earned roe are you embedding in that gregory c hazelton executive vice president and chief financial officer and treasurer we haven t actually disclosed that but if you use the midpoint of the range it would be a slight improvement to where we re at today as you know we closed at 7 8 in the year and we would see some improvement over that as if we assuming the midpoint of the range i would say a modest improvement we don t anticipate we do have a couple of rate cases going on we have an interim decision on helco and the ongoing potential interim we ll expect an interim hearing about july time frame on the heco rate case which may provide some benefit but beyond that for significant improvements in the achieved roe we ll have to see how pbr plays out in the implementation in 2021 andy levi exoduspoint analyst okay and my last question just on the rate base slide on 15 so 4 to 6 off of 2018 is that how it kind of works gregory c hazelton executive vice president and chief financial officer and treasurer it is because we were trying to normalize the differentials between 2019 and 2020 and also to align that with the guidance how we had done our previous guidance range and using 2018 as a base as well for comparability andy levi exoduspoint analyst so it s 3 to 5 off of 2019 4 to 6 off of 2018 okay i get that and thank you for moving the call to wednesday afternoon gregory c hazelton executive vice president and chief financial officer and treasurer we did it just for you andy constance hee lau president and chief executive officer it s your valentine s present andy andy levi exoduspoint analyst thank you constance hee lau president

everyone and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2019 conference call today corecivic is a diversified real estate investment trust specializing in delivering government real estate solutions to serve the public good we are the country s largest private owner of real estate assets being used by u s government agencies following our latest portfolio acquisition last month and the recent opening of our newly constructed correctional facility in lansing kansas we own 136 facilities totaling nearly 19 million square feet of real estate we have a 35 year history of delivering a broad range of solutions to help solve tough government challenges in flexible cost effective ways our unique diversified portfolio of assets generates a steady reoccurring cash flow stream underwritten by investment grade government tenants each of our three business segments provide specialized real estate to government tenants our safety segment owns and manages corrections and detention facility including 50 correctional and detention facilities with a design capacity to safely and securely care for over 72 000 people in the last five years in this segment we ve helped over 30 000 individuals achieve their high school equivalency or an industry recognized trade certificate which evidence based research has shown to materially reduce recidivism rates our community segment is a network of residential reentry centers and nonresidential community based corrections alternatives that help address america s recidivism crisis and includes 29 residential reentry facilities with a design capacity to support 5 394 individuals we also provide nonresidential community based services to approximately 35 000 people on a daily basis finally our property segment is a portfolio of mission critical government leased properties that as of the year end 2019 included 28 properties representing approximately 2 4 million feet of real estate subsequent to year end this portfolio has expanded by nearly one million square feet due to the recent opening of our new lansing correctional facility a new lease with kentucky for our southeast correctional complex and our acquisition of a 28 property portfolio of gsa leased assets in january our properties portfolio produces predictable reoccurring cash flows through leases backed by the high credit quality government tenants for the full year 2019 we generated 1 98 billion in revenue an 8 increase from the prior year this top line growth led to strong double digit growth in earnings per share ffo and ebitda normalized ffo per share was 2 62 an increase of 13 and adjusted ebitda was 444 million a 12 increase from the prior year our growth was the result of multiple accomplishments across each of our three business segments our safety segment which accounted for approximately 85 of the company s ebitda generated year over year revenue growth of 6 during 2019 we were awarded four new contracts two of these contract awards resulted in activation of previously idle correctional facilities in may of 2019 our 1 422 bed eden detention center was awarded a new contract from the united states marshal service and our 910 bed torrance county detention facility was awarded a new contract from immigration and customs enforcement or ice these facilities were activated over the summer and operations were normalizing throughout the end of the year in september of 2019 our 2 232 bed adams county correctional facility in mississippi was awarded a new contract from ice transitioning the facility from another federal partner our safety segment was also awarded an out of state contract from the state of kansas for up to 600 beds in our saguaro correctional facility in the arizona our property segment which accounted for 10 of the company s ebitda in 2019 generated year over year revenue growth of 34 the growth generated within this segment was driven by m a activity completed throughout 2018 we deliberately tempered our m a activity in 2019 due to the market valuation of our equity and debt securities throughout the year which resulted from politically motivated attacks on the company and our industry however we continue to pursue accretive m a opportunities to grow our properties and community segments we have narrowed our focus on portfolios with above average risk adjusted returns with the opportunity for utilizing alternative financing structures as evidenced by our acquisition in january of a 28 property portfolio of gsa leased assets using a downreit structure this portfolio acquisition coupled with new leases at our lansing correctional facility in kansas and the southeast correctional complex in kentucky positions our property segment for continued revenue and noi growth again in 2020 our community segment accounted for 5 of the company s ebitda in 2019 but has generated 21 year over year revenue growth revenue growth in this segment was largely driven by acquisitions we made in the area of nonresidential correctional alternative service including electronic monitoring and case management services we continue to pursue limited m a opportunities for the residential municipalities and nonresidential service providers and we acquired two rrcs in virginia during the fourth quarter of 2019 in the fourth quarter we posted total revenue of 498 million a 3 increase year over year and normalized ffo per share of 0 59 or 0 01 below the low end of our fourth quarter 2019 guidance the primary driver of our financial performance in the quarter was lower than expected utilization by ice across our safety portfolio our initial fourth quarter guidance anticipated a combination of decline in ice utilization and additional expenses for our recently activated facilities continued to ramp to normalized utilization levels throughout the quarter during the spring and summer of 2019 activity across the southwest border was at heightened levels not reached in nearly two decades in an effort to help address the humanitarian crisis there was high utilization at many of our facilities under contract with ice this above average utilization by ice over the summer resulted in increased earnings we correctly anticipated a reduction in utilization in the fourth quarter but the declines were slightly larger than what we had forecasted it is important to note that this ability to flex up or down utilization levels with based on real time demand is actually one of the key reasons why ice contracts with corecivic for a substantial for their detention capacity and that flexibility is one of the key ways we provide value to taxpayers ice utilization is historically the most difficult to predict of any of our government partners because there are so many complex factors at play however southwest border activity returned to historical norms in the fall of last year and has remained at similar levels based on the latest available government data this recent trend along with other immigration policy changes implemented last year has informed our current expectations for ice utilization in 2020 and is reflected in our initial 2020 financial guidance our full year 2020 financial guidance forecast normalized ffo per share in the range of 2 30 to 2 40 and affo per share in the range of 2 29 to 2 39 our guidance also includes 0 06 per share in additional interest expense resulting from the refinancing of our unsecured bonds that were set to expire in april of 2020 and the december 2019 issuance of our 250 million term loan b having summarized some of the key drivers of our fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results and our initial full year 2020 guidance which dave will review in more detail i would now like to shift our focus to recent business development and market opportunities with the potential of influencing future financial performance starting first with our safety segment so far this year we have already announced one new safety contract in january we signed an emergency 375 bed contract with mississippi to utilize our tallahatchie county correctional facility to assist the state following a series of operational challenges at their nearby facility in parkman which has also sustained significant infrastructure damage the 90 day contract provides optional extensions for up to two additional 90 day terms and allowing to take time to develop a long term plan for their correction system situations like this exemplify how critically important it is for state and federal partners to have access to our modern real estate assets and the services we offer our tallahatchie facility has provided immediate capacity for the state to move a portion of their closed company population which should help to improve the safety and security of the entire without the private sector there would be no immediate alternative solution available to the state and we stand ready to provide the state with additional assistance should it be requested the state of idaho s board of correction has granted authority to the department of corrections to award us a contract pursuant to an rfp issued last year for up to 1 200 beds we have not yet received a final contract but we have been in frequent communications with department of corrections since its announcement we will hopefully have more to report on that in the very short term we are seeing a real need for modern correctional infrastructure across the country and there is a growing number of states acknowledging this reality as a serious challenge recently the governor of arizona proposed closing the state s oldest prison in florence to generate 275 million in savings over three years from avoidable repairs and upkeep the arizona state prison complex in florence dates back to 1909 and has a capacity of 3 946 beds their stated plans are to utilize other public and privately owned facilities within the state that have available capacity the state has not announced their official transition plan so we are awaiting potential procurement opportunities in our property segment we have seen very positive momentum with new lease agreements new development and future development opportunities as i mentioned earlier we ve recently activated our new legacy correctional facility in kansas and entered into a new lease agreement for our southeast correctional complex in kentucky these two lease agreements represent 3 088 newly leased beds or over 525 000 square feet of real estate our 83 2 million acquisition of a portfolio of 28 gsa leased properties adds an additional 445 000 square feet of real estate to our property segment s portfolio as for development opportunities within the property segment state of alabama is in an impactive process to procure three large scale state of the art facilities financed and constructed by the private sector in order to consolidate approximately 15 outdated overcrowded prisons the state estimates the aggregate size of this procurement to be approximately 10 000 beds at a cost of nearly 1 billion the state published an rfp in the fourth quarter of 2019 and we have been publicly named as a qualified respondent to the procurement this opportunity in alabama will not contribute to our 2020 financial performance but it is further evidenced that the build finance lease model pioneered by corecivic properties is resonating with government agencies dealing with critical criminal justice infrastructure needs we know there are at least half a dozen other states and many municipalities considering a similar process to address their aged inefficient criminal justice infrastructure for decades appropriators at the federal state and local level have repeatedly declined to provide sufficient funding to address pressure points within their criminal justice infrastructure making access to private capital and industry expertise offered through our corecivic s property segment most efficient cost effective way to address these previously unmet needs it is very gratifying to see this offering is resonating and expect to see more of these opportunities come to market in our community segment we focused much of our attention in 2019 on integrating the operations of our two nonresidential community based service companies we acquired in 2019 to create a consistent platform we believe the strategic integration position us very well to compete for new market opportunities the largest market opportunity we are actively pursuing is the rebid of the intensive supervision of appearance program also known as isap for immigration and customs enforcement the isap program is the largest electronic monitoring contract in the world serving well over 100 000 active participants on a daily basis we have remained engaged throughout the procurement process which began last may and believe we offer a very competitive option the estimated award day for this opportunity is expected to end is expected by the end of this month we believe we have positioned the company to continue to improve portfolio utilization as evidenced by the activation of three previously idled correctional facilities since the start of 2019 the activation of our eden detention center torrance county detention center and southeast correctional complex represents 2 988 previously idle beds once these contracts are fully activated we will have five remaining idle correctional facilities in the portfolio a very meaningful improvement in less than 15 months we also believe this is to be evidence of the our real estate and service offerings are resonating across a diverse set of government partners with varied needs each of our three business segments have multiple potential catalysts that could meaningfully contribute to additional cash flow in 2020 in addition it is important to note that we do not have any material contracts subject to competitive rebids over the next 12 months so we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on a large number of market opportunities outstanding i d like to close my remarks by providing you an update on how we are thinking about our long term capital allocation strategy our quarterly dividend is very well covered at an affo payout ratio of 75 based on the midpoint of our full year 2020 financial guidance this payout level is very manageable given our strong cash flows and well below the average reit affo payout ratio since converting to a reit in 2013 we have maintained a targeted affo payout ratio of 80 and at the current dividend level our stock carries an attractive yield of over 10 we continue to assess m a opportunities on a case by case basis as we believe further growth of our community and property segments will generate long term shareholder value since the issuance of our term loan b in december the pricing of our unsecured bonds in the secondary market has meaningfully improved however the pricing of our bonds and the valuation of our equity securities still do not reflect our strong credit profile or stable cash generation which requires us to target acquisitions with above average risk adjusted returns and to structure unique deals that do not require significant cash at closing given the current market conditions we believe the best use of our excess cash flows in the near term is to reduce our leverage profile i d now like to pass the call over to dave to provide a more detailed look at our financial results in the fourth quarter and our outlook for the first quarter and full year of 2020 dave david garfinkle executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you damon and good morning everyone for the full year ended december 31 adjusted eps was 1 72 up 18 6 from the prior year normalized ffo was 2 62 up 13 4 from the prior year and affo was 2 58 up 17 8 from the prior year depending on the metric these per share amounts were either 0 22 or 0 23 higher than the midpoint of our initial guidance published a year ago at this time in the fourth quarter we generated 0 35 of eps or 0 36 of adjusted eps compared to our guidance range of 0 38 to 0 42 normalized ffo totaled 0 59 per share compared to our guidance range of 0 60 to 0 64 affo totaled 0 58 per share compared to our guidance range of 0 59 to 0 63 adjusted eps was 103 5 million for the quarter adjusted amounts exclude expenses associated with debt refinancing and m a transactions including contingent consideration on an m a transaction reflected in the prior year quarter our financial results for the fourth quarter were slightly below our guidance levels due to lower than expected populations from u s integration and customs enforcement or ice last quarter i mentioned that we have lowered our q4 ice population projections because we did not believe the elevated levels we experienced in the second and third quarters of 2019 were sustainable as total southwest border apprehensions had reached the highest levels in over a decade however ice populations nonetheless declined to levels below our forecast compared to the prior year quarter adjusted eps and normalized ffo decreased by 0 04 per share and affo decreased by 0 01 per share new federal contracts in 2019 to activate our previously idle 1 422 bed eden detention center in texas and our 910 bed torrance county detention facility in new mexico were more than offset by declines in california populations at our 3 060 bed la palma facility in arizona which completely vacated the facility by the end of the second quarter of 2019 as expected year over year results were also negatively impacted by higher g a expenses and lower ice populations at our tallahatchie facility in mississippi and at our eloy facility in arizona we continue to manage a strong balance sheet with leverage of 3 7 times at december 31 we had 92 million of cash on hand and 413 million of availability on our revolving credit facility in addition to a 350 million accordion feature under our credit facility which matures in 2023 during the fourth quarter of 2019 we accessed the capital markets to obtain a 250 million term loan using the proceeds toward repayment in december of 325 million of senior unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in april 2020 with the balance funded from our revolving credit facility we now have no debt maturities until october 2022 in december 2019 we completed construction and activated the 512 bed complex at the lansing correctional facility in kansas ahead of schedule and completed the 1 920 bed complex last month on schedule and below budget for a total cost of 155 million resulting in commencement of the 20 year lease our 2020 capital expenditure forecast includes 21 million to 23 million in prison construction primarily to complete construction of lansing correctional facility and in connection with a new lease signed in december 2019 with the commonwealth of kentucky to reactivate our 656 bed southeast correctional complex pursuant to a 20 year lease agreement including extension options our 2020 capital expenditure forecast also includes approximately 7 million of tenant improvements and leasing commissions and maintenance capex of approximately 60 million split evenly between real estate and non real estate assets moving next to a discussion of our earnings guidance as indicated in the press release adjusted eps guidance for the first quarter of 2020 is in range of 0 26 to 0 29 normalized ffo per share guidance for the first quarter is 0 49 to 0 53 and affo per share guidance is 0 50 to 0 54 for the full year adjusted eps guidance is in range of 1 38 to 1 47 full year normalized ffo per share guidance is in range of 2 30 to 2 40 and full year affo per share guidance is 2 29 to 2 39 adjusted ebitda guidance for the first quarter is 96 million to 99 million and for the full year is 427 5 million to 437 5 million as a reminder compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 q1 is seasonally weaker because of one fewer day in the quarter and because we incurred approximately 75 of our unemployment taxes during the first quarter resulting in a collective 0 04 per share decline from q4 to q1 our q1 and full year guidance reflects higher interest expense and lower utilization from ice to several of our facilities compared to 2019 levels from q4 to q1 these items account for a per share reduction of 0 05 from 2019 to 2020 these items account for a per share reduction of 0 31 we have taken into consideration recent immigration trends and policy changes implemented by the federal government last year in setting our forecasted levels throughout 2020 our full year guidance also includes a new contract in mississippi higher utilization at our newly expanded otay mesa detention facility the commencement of leasing with kansas and kentucky and the full year impact of the activation last year of our eden and torrance facilities in addition to the lease agreements with kansas for the new lansing correctional facility commencing in the first quarter of 2020 and with kentucky for our previously added southeast correctional complex commencing mid year our guidance for the corecivic property segment includes the portfolio acquisition announced january 2 2020 of 28 properties all leads to the federal government through the general services administration we were pleased to be able to finance this 83 million acquisition with only 7 million of cash with the balance funded by assumed debt with an attractive fixed interest rate of 4 9 and the issuance of 1 3 million limited partnership units to the seller that are convertible into cash or common stock following a two year period as the market prices for our securities have been affected primarily by headlines from some of the industry s banking partners as well as washington politics we have tempered our m a pursuits and have no other m a transactions in our guidance our guidance also does not include any new contract awards beyond those previously announced as it is difficult to predict the timing of new awards as damon mentioned the state of idaho has granted authority to the department of corrections to award us the contract pursuant to an rfp for out of state capacity of up to 1 200 offenders this ultimately awarded we may activate another one of our idle facilities we are also pursuing several other state opportunities damon mentioned any of which will provide upside to our guidance our guidance range reflects our best estimate of ice populations however such populations are the most difficult to predict and could provide upside to our guidance like they did last year compared with 2019 our full year 2020 guidance reflects a per share reduction of 0 06 for higher interest expense associated with the 250 million term loan obtained in december at an interest rate of libor plus 4 5 which was used to refinance our 4 125 senior notes although we had the capacity to repay the mature notes with our revolving credit facility which would have faced considerable interest expense we believe refinancing such notes with longer term capital was a more prudent strategy than relying on shorter term bank debt the adjusted ebitda guidance in our press release enables you to calculate our estimated normalized effective income tax rate of 4 to 5 for the first quarter and full year and provide you with our estimate of total depreciation and interest expense for the first quarter and full year we expect g a expenses to be approximately 6 of total revenue whether we are providing flexible capacity for ice during times of emergent need like those experienced in 2019 or for the u s marshal service both of which rely on the private sector for their detention capacity or are providing a lease to a correctional system facing unique challenges or outdated infrastructure we play a very important role we understand transient federal populations particularly ice can be volatile and influence our short term financial results so while we signed three large contracts with ice as well as two large contracts with the u s marshal service over the past 18 months we have not taken our focus away from state business in fact we have been very successful in executing new contracts with state partners in 2018 we signed the aforementioned 20 year lease agreement with kansas bolstering our growth in the course of the property segment and signed management contracts with south carolina vermont and wyoming while completing the intake of state population pursuant to new management contracts from kentucky ohio and nevada supporting our corecivic safety business in 2019 we signed a new management contract with kansas to utilize a portion of our saguaro facility in arizona and another agreement with kentucky to activate one of our auto facilities in the commonwealth this time under a lease agreement where kentucky will operate the facility last month we signed a new management contract with mississippi and we are in pursuit of a management contract from idaho and a lease of an idle facility with another state regardless of the jurisdiction government agencies continue to turn to corecivic for the solutions we provide we have been winning new contract awards and completing accretive acquisitions that provide a growing base of stable cash flows several of these new agreements also demonstrate that we can provide facilities operated by our government partner to elise in our corecivic property portfolio or turnkey solutions where we provide both the real estate and correctional services in our corecivic safety portfolio at the midpoint of our guidance for 2020 we expect to generate roughly 285 million of affo a proxy for cash flow after maintenance capex but before dividends and expect to invest 15 million in revenue producing capex funded from cash flows at the current quarterly dividend rate of 0 44 per share our dividends annualized to 210 million leaving about 60 million of residual cash flow which we currently expect to use to pay down debt our dividend is well covered with an affo payout ratio of 75 based on our guidance close to our guided dividend policy of 80 with an attractive yield of over 10 our board reviews dividend levels and our dividend policy every quarter as part of the quarterly dividend declaration process the next board meeting is scheduled for february 20 we expect to issue a press release shortly after that meeting announcing the amount of the next quarterly dividend that would be paid in april i will now turn the call back to the operator travis to open the line for questions questions and answers operator we have a question from joe gomes noble capital joe gomes noble capital analyst good morning and thanks for taking the questions david garfinkle executive vice president and chief financial officer hi joe joe gomes noble capital analyst first question looking in the fourth quarter did understand the whole ice and everything but if i m looking at the safety segment revenues increased year over year but we all saw a big increase in expenses in the safety segment where they went up to 74 3 of revenues from 72 6 of revenues i just wonder if you could talk a little bit about what was going on there david garfinkle executive vice president and chief financial officer at a high level yes our expenses let me back up so when you see declines in populations we re not able to necessarily reduce staff so you have a fixed cost of staffing that you can only flex if you have significant reductions in populations so throughout 2019 we had some pretty meaningful increases in federal populations and so on the margin those are higher than if you re activating an idle facility for example but as far as kind of at a global level expenses in 2019 reflect higher wage rates so you ve got a very low unemployment rate so provided wage increases had to provide several market adjustments in several of our facilities but beyond that i can t think of anything out of the ordinary that would influence those expense margins joe gomes noble capital analyst okay thanks for the detail on that and on ice i was wondering if you might be able to talk a little bit about what government funding for 2020 is or if there s any new government policies that you guys see being bandied about that could positively or negatively impact demand from ice damon t hininger president and chief executive officer yes this is damon and i ll answer that question and i appreciate the question itself so a couple of things one is that as we look at trends month to month in addition to kind of real life feedback from our partner in this case being ice and both on the data and looking at it historically but also the kind of feedback from ice they indicated last summer that was extraordinary levels of population and in turn needs for capacity within our system and our other facility they used throughout the country so we knew going into the last year that they were going to see decreased utilization and really kind of get back to kind of historical levels and we should look about 10 years back and kind of look at historical levels and you may know already historically too now as you see kind of level that you usually see a little bit of a decrease during the winter holidays which has been pretty consistent in the last 60 days to your question specifically about policy and funding so funding has been stable this year based on the demands for ice and then the president i think just released a couple of days ago the budget for 2021 and within that document there is a request for increased funding of 60 000 so that would be 60 000 beds i should say so that would be an increase over current funding levels now you know as well as i that s got to go through congress and the house and the senate so a lot more activity on that front to determine exactly what that number is but at least gives you a preview of what lease administration is looking for next year from a policy perspective you ve probably seen all the kind of articles and things we hear back from our partner relative to the cooperation or given with some of the latin central america countries and also with mexico so there s nothing really to add to that but i d say generally as we said in my comments and it s been reported in media i think there is some of those policies and agreements they ve worked out has an impact on the southwest border anything you would add to that david david garfinkle executive vice president and chief financial officer no no but i do want to go back to your first question joe i was thinking if you re looking at expenses year over year we did have start up expenses to activate our torrance and eden facilities so year over year q2 we had about 2 7 million of start up in q3 we had about 6 8 million of start up so those would be reflected in our margins and other in per diem tables that we present in the supplemental financial joe gomes noble capital analyst okay great and one last one for me one of the opportunities that you guys have mentioned in the past is the potential transfer of some of the ice or u s marshals inmates from local jails to say a corecivic property what do you guys see is there any progress in that or the actual potential of that in the near term damon t hininger president and chief executive officer yes great question and i would say it s over the last couple of years you don t see a lot of attention to this but we kind of hear on the ground and different regions where we operate there has been some incremental movement populations from city county facilities to corecivic and even to geo and the kind of common thing that we hear is that ice through their credit they continue to kind of raise the bar relative to quality and the type of standard they want to put in place a solely and we have consistently met or achieved compliance with those standards where that may be challenging for a studio or county so you don t see a lot of press on this but we hear anecdotally and we hear from time to time with our folks in various regions in the country they re hearing about a city or a county facility or jail that has taken a step either to go ahead and transition that population back to ice and that s sort of like corecivic or they ve just made the decision that they can not comply with the standards that banks expects for those providers public or private so again i d say it s incremental we ve seen some opportunity with that in different parts of the country joe gomes noble capital analyst okay great thank you very much damon t hininger president and chief executive officer yeah appreciate your questions operator your next question comes from jordan sherman ranger global jordan sherman ranger global analyst good morning thanks i wanted to go back to your comments about la palma i m not sure i heard that correctly did you say that that is in the supplement it says it s 60 59 occupied is that right and is that where is that trending i m sorry i missed the comments on that damon t hininger president and chief executive officer yes so yes supplemental that obviously indicates end of year i think we re pretty consistent with it today maybe it might be a little higher utilization as we go into first part of this year but yes i d say it s trending a little bit of an increase since in the fourth quarter anything you would add to that david david garfinkle executive vice president and chief financial officer no and as la palma recall in 2019 we had california vacating that facility we ve signed a new contract with ice to kind of replace the california population but as of yet they ve not fully replaced them so we had a transition going on throughout 2019 and california really exiting through june and then ice are ramping up i think year over year i think q4 versus q4 i want to say they were let me double check on that so if you want to jordan sherman ranger global analyst well that s okay what s your expectation on what will happen with that and is that capacity you might be able to use with the arizona situation damon t hininger president and chief executive officer yes good question i d say the first part is ice has indicated that location is very important to them it s in close proximity to our eloy facility which historically has always been utilized for ice for gosh almost 20 to 25 years so operationally it is a very good facility for them in proximity not only eloy but also their florence facility so ice has indicated kind of i d say short and midterm interest on full utilization of facility but to your second part of your question absolutely we ll obviously continue to kind of judge that with ice and determine if there s other partners that could use that capacity and that might be a good fit for them david garfinkle executive vice president and chief financial officer in q4 i averaged about 1 800 people in that facility q4 2019 compared to about 900 in q4 2018 jordan sherman ranger global analyst right and i m just wondering in terms of the outlook for the detainees for ice and u s marshals considering the new policies in place i m wondering again i m not sure we all know what s going to happen longer term on that but i m just wondering does the 60 000 beds in the trump budget actually make sense i mean it doesn t look like we re trending in that direction damon t hininger president and chief executive officer yes if you look at i guess the last 12 months just look at my chart we got as high as i think 56 000 57 000 middle of last year i guess during the summer months and that was again increased utilization based on historical standards today if you look at the nationwide number let s see this was january today that number was about 42 000 43 000 nationally that i said in detention capacity public or private and what i would say is that if you look at just the amount of individuals they ve apprehended on the border that appears to be pretty consistent over the winter with historical standards looking back at 10 plus years so that s a long way of saying and it appears that having kind of funding i don t know if it s 60 000 but probably some funding up to where they were last year 55 000 based on now kind of unique things that happen from time to time but also seasonal fluctuations in population that s probably a pretty good number again 50 000 i don t know if that all can get through congress and through the house and senate but i d say kind of the funding that it got today that might be a pretty good number for them to think about claiming now on next year anything you would add to that david david garfinkle executive vice president and chief financial officer as damon mentioned it is typically seasonal so you ll see declines in illegal immigration during the peak winter months and during the peak summer months we factored into our guidance the new policies of the administration implemented last year and that s about when we saw declines in our populations beginning in september october ish so there can be substantial surges last year we would not have predicted we did not predict the level of ice detainees that we had throughout 2019 as i mentioned q2 and q3 were kind of high watermarks for us and it s just very difficult to predict whether that s going to happen again this year we re not expecting it to it s not in our guidance based on the new policies of the administration so if it does there would be upside damon t hininger president and chief executive officer and if i could just add one more thing to the question i was asked earlier one thing that i think gives us maybe buffer just a little bit on maybe its population going up and down is i mean we meet all the appropriate standards i mean we ve got the newest most modern facilities providing capacity to ice again we meet all the appropriate standards not only if it s physical plans but operational standards and our ice facilities are the most monitored probably in our portfolio i mean there s a lot of government employees that are walking the halls in our facilities every day monitoring our operations interaction with the detainees and so and we welcome that we welcome that oversight and that constant monitoring i guess my point is that if ice has the opportunity to maybe recalibrate a little bit their capacity and their system i think we ll always get the first look versus a city or county that again can t maybe make the capital investment or the dollars investment to meet these standards that continue to increase and raise the bar on quality jordan sherman ranger global analyst understood actually let me ask a question along that line before how much of ice s capacity or u s marshals i don t know if u s marshals has any is not is in like county or municipal facilities damon t hininger president and chief executive officer yes great question so going back to that number let me just use a round number say 45 000 or maybe 50 000 of potential capacity that ice uses on an annual basis i would say between us and geo and mtc it s probably about half of the capacity so if the half of that capacity is private sector so say in a different way the other half is with the public sector cities and counties there is a little bit of ice capacity that they ve got where they own and operate themselves but that s a very small amount so i think only a couple of thousand beds so i say half and half on marshals service we have about i think 8 000 9 000 prisoners on any given day for the marshals service i think it s pretty consistent with geo and i d say david probably with almost 60 000 federal prisoners is probably not half it s probably maybe about 1 3 of marshals prisoners that are in private facilities like ours and the other 2 3 are in public or public facility city and county jails jordan sherman ranger global analyst right and i m just wondering is there any i don t know if you ve looked at the details of the budget i know it s just preliminary or just a more talking points than it is actual budget is there an increase in funding requested for ice officers for enforcement i mean maybe that ultimately would could drive increases in the number of detainees immigrant captures and detainees damon t hininger president and chief executive officer yes there s actually pretty well kind of funding across the board for all of ice and homeland security i should say also and even customs and border patrol so yes staff and personnel attorneys so you had a lot amd lot of investments i d say throughout their kind of the entire system jordan sherman ranger global analyst okay i ve got a couple others but let me i ll return to the queue and see if there s anyone else who wants to ask a question damon t hininger president and chief executive officer perfect thank you operator we do have our follow up from mr sherman jordan sherman ranger global analyst okay thought i d give someone else a chance so just to go back to the three facilities adams tornante and eden what i was just wondering how the contracts are sort of structure is there a base minimum and then an incremental per dm for as or when you get above that i m just wondering how those work damon t hininger president and chief executive officer yes so it s kind of all of the above every contract that we negotiate kind of stands on their own there s many things that we consider based on kind of the dynamics and needs from the partner also the regional location and maybe flexibility either ice or marshals want or vice versa we want based on potential opportunities like in arizona or in mississippi so it s kind of all of the above we ve got different provisions in all three jordan sherman ranger global analyst okay and then i guess with adams 51 what s the outlook for adams usage 51 occupied now if ice doesn t take up the rest of that are there opportunities to farm that out somewhere else or use that for some other damon t hininger president and chief executive officer yes good question it s almost kind of the same identical situations la palma on arizona so it s a great location for ice close proximity in new orleans which is a key kind of airport for them on moving of individuals around the country or maybe out of the country so it s a great location strategically for them but it s also kind of the same kind of view we have in that facility ice has indicated a need and desire to use the entire facility but we continue to kind of monitor that and talk to them real time based on their needs because we know we have now a need in state with like mississippi the initial contract we did up in tallahatchie which is the northern part of the state but also out of state placement could be an opportunity too so we re monitoring closely but i guess the short answer is ice has indicated an interest in entire facility jordan sherman ranger global analyst so is your expectation that that would ramp that up this over the next few quarters or next year how does that sort of sort out damon t hininger president and chief executive officer yes i d say probably the way to look at that one i guess probably it s similar to la palmas is probably during the course of this year again it is a conversation and based on kind of either changes they have we re also communicating with them that as you heard me say in my script too i mean we ve got gosh one two three four several states express an interest in capacity in our system and so we re also keeping them educated about opportunities maybe where we could use capacity like in atlanta la palma so i d say during the course of this year but again this will be probably kind of a day by day week by week we ll monitor it closely and determine based on their needs opportunities we can also use that capacity for someone else jordan sherman ranger global analyst and then just the last question i apologize if i missed it the timing of the idaho either rfp or awarding or where does that stand again damon t hininger president and chief executive officer it s we think any day now so we ve had the most notable thing was the public announcement by the board of corrections in january indicating authority and approval for them to negotiate them being the department of corrections negotiate a contract with us corecivic and so we ve been in constant communication with the state idaho so we think probably any day now david garfinkle executive vice president and chief financial officer and as i mentioned in my remarks we don t have that contract in our guidance would likely require the activation of an idle facility which is probably 120 day ramp as well so you re probably talking second half of the year before you start seeing a financial impact if we ultimately get that contract awarded jordan sherman ranger global analyst so some potential addition to this year but obviously a bigger much bigger impact next year david garfinkle executive vice president and chief financial officer right damon t hininger president and chief executive officer right that s exactly right jordan sherman ranger global analyst okay and then just finally i apologize arizona have they said anything about the timing of their decisions i know that was sort of a that came out of a left field that they would shut down that big facility but have they put any timing on any part of that process damon t hininger president and chief executive officer i don t think they ve put a hard time line on it it was part of you probably know already that it was part of the governor s state of the state address earlier this year and so it s our anticipation that this would be a fiscal year next year fiscal year event so that would be starting july 1 of this year again they haven t said exactly what they plan to do but we anticipate that they probably will do a procurement or a series of procurements for either in state and or out of state capacity longer term it could be a play where they want a owned and managed so a safety solution and or because it is a big quantity and or maybe a property solution where we lease it to them and develop it for them so near term could be capacity utilization but long term could be either a new facility or utilizing a lease model like we do in kansas or proposed in alabama jordan sherman ranger global analyst okay great thank you very much damon t hininger president and chief executive officer appreciate the questions operator we have no further questions in the queue i d like to turn the call back over to mr hininger damon t hininger president and chief executive officer thank you travis before we conclude the call i once again want to take a moment to recognize all of our employees across the country who are doing great work on behalf of our government partners thanks to their hard work and dedication we were able to make a real difference for those in our care for example in 2019 approximately 6 500 high school equivalency or career trade certificates were awarded to individuals that trusted in our care this type of accomplishment for the individuals in our care can drastically improve their ability to successfully re enter society and it would not be possible without the commitment of our employees whether we are for these individuals on the road to reentry or providing a safe environment for people who have just entered our country our employees play a meaningful and important role and for that i am truly truly thankful i would like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today we look forward to reporting to you our first quarter 2020 financial results in may thanks again operator duration 53 minutes call participants cameron hopewell managing

surge on monday february 3rd that brought the usd cad to 1 3300 for the first time in two months defined the range in the latter part of this week as neither us statistics or the china safety trade

7 in december putting it near the middle of the tight 101 2 to 105 0 range for 2019 chairman powell s semiannual monetary policy report appearance in the house on tuesday and the senate on wednesday featured his upbeat assessment of the us economy we find the us economy in a very good place wages moving up most at the bottom end of the wage scale it s great to see he said on tuesday we have learned that unemployment can be lower than many had thought without increasing inflation under questioning by the representatives he observed that the risk of recession is low there is no reason why the expansion can t continue there is nothing about this expansion that is unstable or unsustainable trade concerns have diminished the signing and implementation of the usmca agreement will be a positive for the economy in that it removes some uncertainty on trade the chairman has in the past observed that the us china trade pact has reduced tensions between the nations several members mentioned the potential economic effect of the corona virus in china and mr powell temporized we will be watching this carefully what will be the effects on the us economy will they be material we have to resist the temptation to speculate on this the impact on the us economy would have to be persistent for the fed to contemplate a policy change it is very likely that there will be some spillover on the us economy but china s asian neighbors and major trading partners in europe have greater risks we will be watching this carefully what will be the effects on the us economy will they be material he noted we have to resist the temptation to speculate on this the impact on the us economy would have to be persistent for the fed to consider a policy change it is very likely that there will be some spillover on the us economy but china s asian neighbors and major trading partners in europe have greater risks the chairman noted that that the global decline in rates has reduced the central bank s ability to effect the economy the current low interest rate environment also means that it would be important for fiscal policy to help support the economy if it weakens he said he also observed that the ban had learned from the recent turmoil in the overnight funding market that the size of its balance sheet needed to ensure smooth function was larger than it has though however the repo market spike doesn t appear to be a symptom of deeper financial problems he said mr powell s comments offered a number of interesting points on central bank policy and global economics but in main arena the status of the us economy and potential fed policy it had all been said before on thursday cpi was a bit stronger on the year in the headline at 2 5 in january from 2 3 in december and as expected in the core rate at 2 3 initial jobless claims for the february 7th week were 205 000 leaving the four week moving a 212 000 near it 50 year low retail sales for january on friday were as forecast 0 3 with the ex autos category at 0 3 as well and the control group slipping to flat missing it 0 3 prediction december was weaker than initial posed with overall reading revised to 0 2 from

from december s 195 900 building permits in december jumped 7 5 much more than the 0 6 forecast and reversing the last three negative months statistics conclusion february 10 14 the trajectories of the us and canadian economies were little changed by the week s data the slightly weaker us retail numbers especially in december may shave 0 1 or less from fourth quarter gdp but a much more pronounced and prolonged drop would be needed to affect perception and rate policy the fed s confidence is not misplaced the bank of canada had noted the decline in housing at the last meeting this

on friday will tell if the slowing job creation in the second half of the year had any effect on consumption and have the greatest potential for market impact in november sales rose 0 9 and the ex autos number was 0 2 us statistics february 17 21 monday is a holiday in the us markets are closed housing starts and building permits for january on wednesday are expected to be within recent parameters for a healthy housing sector permits are to rise to 1 45 million annualized from 1 42 million in december while starts should return to trend at to 1 39 million in january from 1 608 million the prior month which was the highest total since the housing bubble the fomc minutes for the january 28 29 meeting at 2 00 pm on wednesday will provide detail for the fed s current neutral stance and positive view of the us economy but will not offer any new insights to policy thursday s initial jobless claims is of historical and econometric interest as the us labor market continues its record setting run but unless it is wildly out of kilter markets will pass notice market economics of london issues its pmi reports for february manufacturing services and composite on friday serve as a second to the better known and far older ism report the manufacturing index has consistently read higher than the ism never dropping into contraction with a below 50 reading with a low of

forecast this will hint at further slowing in the economy likewise for the retails sales figures on friday as the bank of canada has warned of waning growth any confirmation will weigh on the canadian dollar the recent divergence between the adp and national employment numbers are curious but not for market direction as they are both pointing higher american statistics are will not have major market impact housing has ceased to be a market concern the fomc minutes will not separate from public policy and markit s pmi figures are an appetizer not the main course usd cad technical outlook the limited one figures range this week 1 3235 1 3330 with the downside contained by february 3rd technical run kept the analytical picture intact the 21 day moving average is decidedly positive but the lower close on friday from the week s open though over 200 points above the early january low was not enough to turn the 100 day average higher or reverse the trend in the 200 resistance begins with a band from 1 3330 1 3345 representing the highs last week and december and on the upside last october next and stronger is at 1 3400 which served as both a top and bottom on many days from march through june the area between 1 3400 and 1 3500 was traded almost continually from late april to early june and will absorb most technical penetration without setting a specific line above that is a strong line at 1 3500 and a weak one at 1 3550 with the drop below 1 3300 support has become more pertinent than it was last week the first is at 1 3240 this week s triple low after that we have 1 3200 1 3150 and 1 3100 as last week which were established prior to december and are moderate to strong the weak lines are 1 3025 and 1 2955 are from the december s liquidity free plunge and are unlikely to give more than token effort usd cad sentiment poll once again near term sentiment has reversed reflecting the week s trading while longer term views are unchanged the one week outlook has a weaker bullish view 47 vs 54 a stronger bullish note 47 vs 31 and a neutral loss 6 against 15 the forecast at 1 3253 vs 1 3313 reflects market reality the one month view is more bullish 33 vs 22 slightly more bearish 63 vs 61 and barely neutral 4 vs 17 the forecast is little different at 1 3218 vs 1 3233 the one quarter view is similar for the bulls 14 vs 11 weaker for the bears 53 vs 72 and almost double for the uncertain 33 vs 17 the forecast is status quo 1 3144 vs 1 3134 canadian and us statistics gave little indication of changing economic direction this week and do not seem likely to provide much different next the loner term bearish cast to the usd cad is independent of the major market variable in china and does not reflect its potential

and this approach takes advantage of our positions in some of the country s best mill markets principally in the us south timber basket we will seek transactions for prime properties in the 5 million to 50 million range with our preference for direct fee ownership and using less leverage our coastal georgia acquisition in 2017 as an example joint ventures also can contribute to provide us with the investment opportunities to grow our holdings by leveraging our platform for scale and operating efficiencies in terms of size and partnership structure we will look to use the model of our very successful dawsonville bluffs joint venture which effectively round trip last year importantly we also will be focused on further reducing overall company leverage collectively we intend to continue to redeploy capital by selling assets that are less productive and no longer meet our operating targets and buy more productive assets that are accretive to cash flow and or optimize portfolio construction we also may use proceeds for a combination of debt reduction and share repurchases so growth will occur through a disciplined approach focused on direct fee ownership smaller to mid sized deals potentially additional joint venture co investments and less leverage all of our attention is on providing our shareholders with predictable and stable cash flow it s a simple strategy and we intend to keep our strategy simple turning to 2019 results it was a very good year for catchmark we met our company guidance and produced anticipated cash flow growth benefiting from our superior timberland holdings delivered wood sales model fiber supply agreements and rigorous management practices in meeting catchmark s guidance for the year we realized increased timber sales superior pricing in the us south timber basket and a significant increase in net timber revenue driven by higher timber volumes in the pacific northwest higher pricing in the us south and improved sawtimber mix we completed integration of the 2018 bandon acquisition in the pacific northwest improving overall sawtimber mix we increased asset management fees from a full year of triple t joint venture which is meeting all of its operating targets taken together all of these initiatives continue to support a consistent dividend from operating cash flows for our shareholders and position catchmark for future growth ursula will now review the financial results and then todd will provide an overview of operations and ursula i d like take this opportunity to welcome you as chief financial officer you ve been an integral part of our team since the start of catchmark and we all look forward to working with you in your new role ursula godoy arbelaez senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer thank you very much brian and good to be with all of you on today s call as brian highlighted catchmark generated excellent year over year results for both fourth quarter and full year 2019 fueled by increased timber revenues and asset management fees the results reinforce the efficacy of our strategy based on investing in prime timberland holdings near leading mill markets and maximizing our operations through our delivered wood sales model and fiber supply agreements for fourth quarter 2019 catchmark increased revenues by 27 to 29 1 million compared to fourth quarter 2018 lowered net loss by 69 to 11 8 million primarily due to lower losses allocated from the triple t joint venture increased adjusted ebitda by 61 to 15 1 million increased total harvest volumes by 23 to 628 000 tons increased gross timber sales revenue by 23 to 20 million increased net timber revenues by 30 to 11 7 million and increased harvest ebitda by 42 to 9 7 million net timber revenues increased as a result of higher harvest volumes and increased sawtimber mix the increased sawtimber mix derived from a 7 increase in the us south and the fully integrated pacific northwest operations during the fourth quarter catchmark also acquired 900 acres of prime pine timberlands located near existing holdings in south carolina for 1 9 million of cash on hand generated from capital recycling dispositions we sold 3 200 acres of timberlands for 5 million increasing real estate ebitda by 2 3 million over the same period in 2018 we entered into a 21 3 million contract for a large disposition of 14 400 acres of georgia timberlands which closed in january 2020 as part of the company s capital recycling strategy and we paid a dividend of 0 135 per share to stockholders of record on december 13 2019 for full year 2019 the company reported the following year over year results increased total revenues by 9 to 106 7 million compared to full year 2018 lowered net loss by 24 to 93 3 million primarily due to lower allocated losses and higher earned asset management fees from triple t increased adjusted ebitda by 14 to 56 9 million due to higher net timber revenues and asset management fees increased total harvest volumes by 3 to 2 24 million tons driven by integration of our pacific northwest property increased timber sales by 4 to 72 6 million increased net timber revenue by 9 to 41 4 million and increased harvest ebitda by 8 to 33 7 million these gains were generated in part by a higher sawtimber mix increased pricing in the us south and the integration of pacific northwest operations gross timber sales revenue increased year over year by 3 1 million as a result of a 5 2 million increase in the pacific northwest region offset by a 2 million decrease in the us south region resulting from a 9 decrease in delivered sales as a percentage of total volume total harvest volume in the us south remained comparable year over year with pulpwood pricing increasing 2 and sawtimber pricing increasing 1 net timber revenues increased by 9 as a result of higher harvest volumes and increased sawtimber mix and higher us south pricing for full year 2019 we also increased asset management fee revenue by 113 to 11 9 million primarily due to a full year of triple t operations we recognized 600 000 of incentive based promotes 1 million of income 4 8 million of adjusted ebitda and received 4 8 million of distributions from the highly successful dawsonville bluffs joint venture we increased investment management ebitda by 35 to 16 7 million due to triple t fees and the dawsonville bluffs results we realized timberland sales of 17 6 million from the disposition of 9 200 acres the proceeds were in line with 2018 results in company targets we completed large dispositions of 14 400 acres for 25 4 million capturing a gain of 8 million and paying down outstanding debt and lastly we paid fully covered dividends of 26 3 million or 0 54 per share in 2019 we also made significant progress on our mission to reduce company debt relative to adjusted ebitda and met our year end target of a sub 8 times net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio down from 9 5 times at year end 2018 this accomplishment reflects the full year impact of asset management fee revenues earned from triple t and the execution of our ongoing capital recycling program through large dispositions of timberlands that no longer meet our productivity criteria by year end 2019 liquidity had increased to 196 6 million from 170 6 million at year end 2018 this was comprised of 185 1 million of debt capacity and 11 5 million of cash on hand in addition we also took advantage of the favorable interest rate environment to blend and extend existing interest rate swaps after fourth quarter hedging transactions to fix rates on 275 million of debt the average term on our fixed rate debt stood at nine years at a weighted average interest rate of 2 17 before the applicable spread and expected patronage dividends that compared to an average term of four years at 2 44 at the end of the third quarter the 2019 results do not include the recent approximately 21 million georgia timberlands large disposition which we closed last month on january 31 proceeds of this transaction were used to repay approximately 21 million of outstanding debt on february 3 as a result our fixed to floating rate debt is now 63 and liquidity has now increased to 206 million these results all underscore our commitment and focus on appropriately deleveraging and strengthening our balance sheet during the fourth quarter 2019 catchmark did not repurchase any shares under the company s 30 million stock repurchase program for full year 2019 the company repurchased approximately 329 000 shares for 3 million with 15 7 million remaining available under the program at year end now i will turn it over to todd for the operations review todd p reitz chief resources officer thank you ursula at the outset i want to recognize our team of field managers for the excellent job they continue to do working with our customers and contractors to ensure we execute on our commitments their efforts paid off again during a very strong fourth quarter where we met plan on production and pricing including achieving a favorable sawtimber mix our strong mill markets fiber supply agreement partners delivered wood model and opportunistic stumpage sales continued as our primary performance drivers helping maintain pricing levels for all pine products substantially above timbermart south southwide averages specifically in 2019 catchmark achieved pricing premiums that were 47 higher for pulpwood and 31 higher for sawtimber than the timbermart south averages we are encouraged about the healthy pace of us housing starts with increasing levels of permits and homebuilder order files pointing to a 1 3 million start projection for full year 2020 this should lead to stronger lumber demand and higher pricing for finished products which should produce better supply demand dynamics in the timber market low existing home inventories favorable mortgage rates and a strong jobs market including rising real wages all support this favorable outlook in addition applying specifically to catchmark sawmill capital improvement and greenfield projects in the us south are coming to fruition and beginning to start operations although we did not expect fully realized demand to materialize in our markets until 2021 and into following years we have begun to experience early demand upticks in local and regional micro markets pricing is expected to trend up slightly during the year with seasonal ebbs and flows we also expect our harvest volume for the year to increase to 2 3 million to 2 5 million ton range with 95 of our production coming from us south operations our sawtimber mix projects at approximately 40 from the us south and 80 from the pacific northwest we forecast first quarter 2020 harvest volumes to be higher year over year and first quarter pricing to be relatively stable quarter over quarter for further 2020 guidance i ll turn it back over to brian brian m davis president chief executive officer director thanks todd consistent with our past practices guidance does not include potential contributions from acquisitions possible new joint venture investments or additional capital recycling we forecast adjusted ebitda of between 48 million and 56 million reflecting decreased contributions from dawsonville bluffs which effectively wrapped up last year an expected sharply reduced gaap net loss for the year of between 10 million and 15 million reflects a substantial reduction in losses allocated from triple t as todd noted we anticipate harvest volumes between 2 3 million and 2 5 million tons asset management fee revenue is projected at 11 million to 12 million primarily from triple t higher anticipated harvest ebitda will be driven primarily by increased harvest volumes and steady pricing while investment management ebitda will decrease due to the absence of significant contributions from dawsonville bluffs timberland sales targets of 15 million to 17 million remain in our traditional annual range of 1 to 2 of fee acreage in making new investments we will continue to focus on buying prime timberland assets our analysis and due diligence will concentrate on achieving sustainable yield and durable cash flow based on strong stocking and productivity characteristics as well as locations in superior mill markets we intend to remain highly disciplined and prudent using our ownership presence to find appropriate off market deals concentrating in and around our existing mill markets in particular we are confident that we can continue to come across opportunities to expand our market presence through delivered wood model relationships to sum up catchmark delivered an excellent 2019 operating results and we improved our capital position to enable future growth we realized a significant increase in adjusted ebitda higher harvest volumes increased timber sales superior pricing in the us south timber basket and increased sawtimber mix a significant increase in net timber revenue and harvest ebitda the successful integration of the bandon property in the pacific northwest significant asset management fees earned from triple t the success of dawsonville bluffs and meeting timberland sales targets in addition the capital recycling strategy employing targeted large dispositions continues to improve the overall quality of our timber assets reduce leverage strengthen our balance sheet and enable future investments in prime timberlands furthering our growth strategy and most importantly we have a strong cohesive group of executives and staff dedicated and focused to meeting our ongoing targets our team remains steadfast in implementing a simple and proven strategy based on investing and owning premier timberlands and superior mill markets and employing the best sustainable management practices to help deliver durable harvest yields taken together these initiatives executed by our outstanding team will enable us to continue to provide a consistent dividend supported by predictable and stable operating cash flows for our shareholders all of us at catchmark remained disciplined dedicated and confident about meeting our objectives going forward thank you again for joining us today now ursula todd john and i will be pleased to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session and our first question will come from collin mings with raymond james please go ahead collin mings raymond james associates analyst thank you good morning brian and team and congratulations again to everyone brian m davis president chief executive officer director great good morning collin ursula godoy arbelaez senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer good morning collin mings raymond james associates analyst to start i did want to follow up on the leadership change in your opening remarks brian first is there any additional color you can provide on the timing of the transition and then also brian i was curious just as it relates to your prepared remarks as you and the board look toward the company goes from here it sounds like lower leverage is a key priority do you and ursula have any specific targets in mind brian m davis president chief executive officer director sure collin i ll take that so from a your first question regarding timing the process for leadership development began with my promotion to president in april of last year we ve been developing our team from the time which we had our ipo which we had nine employees today we have 25 and so the board and myself have been very focused on developing expertise and bench strength and it s now was demonstrated by this most recent leadership change of a number of people taking a great step forward filling those opportunities internally we ve brought in external general counsel from alston bird almost two years ago todd reitz comes to us from weyerhaeuser by way of plum creek so we have great bench strength and so from the standpoint of timing the board feel very comfortable on our move forward as it relates to the leadership team which we have in place today now your ultimate question comes back to an approach and our approach really is to continue to deliver our value proposition through disciplined acquisitions of prime timberlands and high demand mill markets superior management to provide predictable and stable cash flows which we announced in our pre read but ultimately my bias is toward a relatively simple corporate structure for a company of our size with a lower leverage profile as it relates to a target it s more of a direction versus a target and that direction is a lower leverage profile than what we currently have and we will be disciplined in our approach as we are well within our financial covenants or no near term maturities and we have plenty of liquidity so this would be more of a bias over a period of time as it relates to the direction for leverage collin mings raymond james associates analyst okay fair enough sticking with the simplicity theme if you will i do want to touch on joint ventures as well brian it does sound like while you are look maybe looking forward to maybe in the future less complexity if you will there is still a willingness to conduct smaller joint venture opportunities so just curious on the jv front is there any near term opportunities that you ve identified on that front just again given the wind down here of dawsonville brian m davis president chief executive officer director yeah so as it relates to jvs in the future i think dawsonville bluffs represents a great model i believe my opening remarks captured some of that sentiment we have a positive lean in recreating that type of success with the joint venture by virtue of scale and structure of dawsonville 2019 was a busy year as it relates to the integration associated with the bandon and the full year operations of triple t i can tell you about the fourth quarter of 2019 we have reinvigorated our efforts as it relates to those types of joint ventures as well as direct acquisitions collin mings raymond james associates analyst okay sticking with the asset management business last quarter the company discussed how volatility in the lumber markets was a headwind to maybe getting a deal with gp done as it relates to the triple t joint venture just recognizing you aren t going to negotiate on anearnings call maybe you can you just remind us more broadly your latest thoughts to the best path to create value on as it relates to triple t especially recognizing there is some extra incentive for catchmark to get something done here within call the first two years of that jv forming brian m davis president chief executive officer director correct and also as we ve noted in prior calls we ve established a good working relationship with gps since we began managing the property in 2018 and under john rasor s guidance we re meeting all the targets under our existing wood supply agreements we remain engaged in a constructive dialog with gp and we re both evaluating whether there is a transaction associated with potential agreement modifications that s mutually beneficial to both of us and we should note and you re correct collin we re not going to negotiate on anearnings call but if we re able to reach an agreement with gp then it may accelerate our ability to realize value with the respect to the triple t joint venture but consistent with other calls if we re not able to reach an agreement with gp then we believe triple t is still a very good investment is a great property one of the fastest growing regions in the country and we ve been managing very well meeting our targets on the supply agreements and taking advantage of other revenue generating opportunities collin mings raymond james associates analyst okay i appreciate the color there brian switching gears real quick to the just the real estate activity during the quarter i don t know if there is some additional details you can provide obviously the per acre transaction price or per acre of the different transactions that were completed in the fourth quarter i should say just optically looked a little low obviously there s a lot that goes into a per acre pricing on timberland deals but just curious if you can provide a little bit more color on that just given where those realizations were todd p reitz chief resources officer hey collin this is todd you bet there in the fourth quarter we ended up closing out with that 4 million deal it s really a pure hardwood timberland sale had difficulty of access operability type items with it so therefore being pure hardwood doesn t have the stocking level and the pricing associated with an upland stand you would see a little bit lower rate there collin mings raymond james associates analyst okay and one last one for me and i ll turn it over again todd just as it relates to the timberland markets and specifically the demand for logs in the pacific northwest recognizing you guys don t have a huge presence there but just if you can weigh in obviously a lot of discussion on some of the otherearnings callas it relates to the impact of the export markets on tension in the pacific northwest a lot of uncertainty created by both the european salvage wood situation and the coronavirus not to mention obviously the trade situation so just your thoughts on the pacific northwest as you start ramping up harvest volumes in that region todd p reitz chief resources officer sure and just to reiterate you re right we don t have a huge exposure or play within the whole export arena there but it does provide some tension and as of late we actually have an opportunity here for some pricing improvement and it s really driven from the standpoint of the canadian log flow really going into the japanese market has been a little bit diminished and so we ve seen some of that pick up in the pacific northwest region as of late really just a couple of weeks ago we received a modest improvement in pricing there they ve not only improved our export options but it also drove some improvement in the local domestic market which was very well received and who knows how long that will last it could be a month it could be the whole quarter we ll just have to wait and see but it is a data point things are improving there we d like to see that additionally in the south we ve seen a little bit of uptick there you mentioned the tariff easing potentially we don t really know exactly what that s going to look like at this point in time we know something is coming but in the south most recent we had market reopen that have been closed and while it s an early indicator maybe things to come it was encouraging in spite of the fact that we don t know exactly what it s going to look like going forward as far as the timing of the tariffs being removed or reduced we did see that happen so we welcome that again back to the tension in the overall marketplace outlook is still very positive in the overall scheme of things with all of our domestic customers not really hitting a whole lot around concern over as you mentioned the european issue of lumber coming in some have speculated that maybe that hit its peak last year and we could see that going down so not a whole lot of concern around that at this point in time coming from our customers anyway collin mings raymond james associates analyst okay thank you i ll turn it over brian m davis president chief executive officer director thanks collin todd p reitz chief resources officer good operator and our next question will come from anthony pettinari of citi please go ahead randy toth raymond james analyst good morning this is actually randy toth sitting in for anthony brian m davis president chief executive officer director good morning randy randy toth raymond james analyst up over 5 at the midpoint can you just talk about what s driving that year over year expectations brian m davis president chief executive officer director yeah from our standpoint our management of our assets has really been focused on maximizing the returns of our overall portfolio we have everything from our direct harvest activity to investment management business to landfill business as well as our other revenues our management approach over the last couple of years has included some harvest deferrals or harvesting at the lower end of our range for the past three years it has actually led to our southern stocking of our forest growing from 38 tons per acre to 43 tons per acre at the end of 2019 and so as we look at maximizing the value associated with forest we have the merchantable inventory that s available to be delivered into the marketplace and i think it s an important consideration todd if you wouldn t mind talking a little bit more about the specifics of our harvest plan for 2020 todd p reitz chief resources officer sure brian so looking at 2020 we actually have an opportunity to fully implement pacific northwest and then really it s just utilizing that prime southern timberland ownership we have through normal course business that is the main drivers for 2020 do you think about the overall mix of what we re going to be producing we re still going to be in that 75 target range as far as a delivered program is concerned we already have 0 5 million or so tons dedicated and locked up with our fiber supply agreement partners there is additional upside potential with that as we look to q1 production over 19 if you look at the first quarter of 20 compared to the first quarter of 19 be very similar from a percentage basis as we said in the opening remarks we would anticipate pricing to be modestly improving throughout the year so quarter over quarter that may be fairly flat and growing as we move forward in addition to just the first quarter as we look out throughout the year we would anticipate a little more consistent flow throughout the year as compared to 19 we re not going to see that building when you think about q1 q4 tend to be a little bit lighter production quarters compared to q2 and q3 which tend to have more available production days randy toth raymond james analyst okay that s helpful thank you and then including the proceeds from the recent disposition in georgia it looks like you re right around 8 times leverage is there a target range you would like to get to by the end of 2020 thank you brian m davis president chief executive officer director hey randy it s a very similar question i think collin had asked as well as regarding a target we don t really have a target it was much more of a direction we re very comfortable where we re operating today at an 8 times leverage our bias is to move that leverage number down over a period of time but again we re not in any rush we have a well covered dividend we have good visibility and predictability associated with our cash flow we ve got no near term maturities and well within our financial covenants and so from a standpoint of having a target we don t at this time it s much more of a direction randy toth raymond james analyst okay that s helpful i ll turn it over thank you brian m davis president chief executive officer director thanks randy operator and our next question will come from dave rodgers with baird please go ahead david rodgers robert w baird co analyst yeah good morning everybody i guess i wanted to talk about the portfolio obviously you guys have constructed since the ipo but mill markets have changed since then distribution pattern so how much of the portfolio now that you ve undertaken a couple of bigger sales over the last six months how much of the portfolio today sits in the highest quality mill markets that you want to be in and what do you consider really available for sale as you continue to want to make the portfolio of higher and higher quality brian m davis president chief executive officer director right dave this is brian good morning so from our standpoint we have this in our investor presentation 95 of our acres under current management it s in the top 4 markets in the us south and so we feel very confident that we ve done a great job since ipo of assembling a superior asset base relative to anybody else and so the opportunity is really inside of our marketplace like the accounting transaction or we call the georgia timberlands transaction really fit that criteria for us for large dispositions it s one kind of an asset profile to operational considerations and then three impact on accretive nature associated with the proceeds so for example the georgia timberlands good marketplace kind of outside of our operational expectations regarding it s much more of a stumpage market for us versus our delivered wood model create some sort of variability associated with cash flow versus what we normally would want to do stocking levels were lower at 28 tons per acre versus our average around 43 tons per acre and then from a productivity standpoint because we ve been active on these tracks it was more of about 1 8 tons per acre from a productivity standpoint over the next 10 years versus 4 5 to 5 5 tons and so what we ve seen dave is really an opportunity inside of our existing marketplace because we ve bought so well since our ipo along with the legacy property in of itself there is a lot more liquidity for existing assets it provides us the opportunity to actually redeploy in our existing marketplace to create much more scale and opportunity for us to execute under delivered wood model so we like the markets we operate in today david rodgers robert w baird co analyst and for taking those three criteria how much of the portfolio then falls below that where you are making that decision to recycle still brian m davis president chief executive officer director yeah that s on a continuous process if you think about the capital recycling activity we ve done over the last couple of years we ve our southwest properties which consider consisted of texas and louisiana we recycle those properties and acquisition of bandon last year we did about 25 million of dispositions in our existing marketplace in the us south of which we use 20 million of that debt to pay down and then we ve done 21 million first quarter of this year from our standpoint that seems to be the right amount of tempo as it relates to capital recycling opportunities we ll continue to review our portfolio ultimately it becomes to what was the use of that capital and it s going to be focused on an accretive use of that capital whether through paying down or relatively inexpensive debt or really building up our pipeline which we ve been doing since the fourth quarter of last year of these kind of middle market lower middle market acquisition opportunities in that 5 million to 10 million range david rodgers robert w baird co analyst thanks and then maybe on the harvest deferrals that you mentioned taking the total stocking from 38 to 43 tons per acre the plan that you have now kind of that you ve set out for 2020 and going forward how does that impact your expectation of stocking levels giving growth parameters over the next year or two three does that take keep you with that 43 tons with growth rates or do you kind of work that back down into the 30s how do you think about that brian m davis president chief executive officer director yeah so first off it starts with the acquisitions we ve made since our ipo we ve had an opportunity to really buy high quality very productive sites so from a growth rate standpoint we have a much above average as it relates to growth criteria that being said we would while we have grown that from 38 tons to 43 tons we would expect to bring that level slightly down it s really not much of concern it s on a normalized basis so from our standpoint we ve been operating the asset to maximize the value and we feel very comfortable with that we d be operating above the 38 tons per acre range but below 43 david rodgers robert w baird co analyst great thank you brian m davis president chief executive officer director great thanks dave operator and our next question will come from albert sebastian with prospect advisors please go ahead albert sebastian prospect advisors llc analyst good morning brian m davis president chief executive officer director good morning al albert sebastian prospect advisors llc analyst just a few questions first could you give us the ebitda associated with the sale that you entered into the 14 400 acres in georgia that you i guess you closed in january brian m davis president chief executive officer director right so we can discuss more al regarding the productivity and so that s about 1 8 tons per acre per year over the next 10 years or you can use a weighted average of what we realize on a per ton basis that can give you an expectation around ebitda albert sebastian prospect advisors llc analyst okay okay and just taking a look at your guidance your net cash provided by operating activities for the year was about 33 million for 2018 it was around 30 million could you give us some sort of guidance based on your ebitda guidance this year or what that might be or give us a bracket brian m davis president chief executive officer director yeah one way to think about it al is that we considered around payout ratio regarding our dividends so we target a 75 to 85 payout ratio so if you know what our dividends are going to be for 2020 you can kind of back into the expectations regarding cash generation albert sebastian prospect advisors llc analyst okay okay and distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures i assume a lot of that was about 4 million in 2019 it was just under 5 million in 2018 i assume a lot of that is dawsonville could you give us a handle on what that number that line item might be for 2020 ursula godoy arbelaez senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer good morning al this is ursula i ll take that question so you re right as we ve discussed dawsonville bluffs contribution for 19 was near the top end of our range of around 4 8 million currently we have approximately 2 million in value on the books and this is mainly coming from our mitigation bank credits so from a contribution standpoint to catchmark for the next couple of years it we anticipate it s going to be pretty negligible at no more than call it 0 5 million annually beginning in 2020 albert sebastian prospect advisors llc analyst okay so this line item probably will be about 0 5 million for this year ursula godoy arbelaez senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer that s right albert sebastian prospect advisors llc analyst okay thank you very much brian m davis president chief executive officer director thanks al operator our next question is a follow up from collin mings with raymond james please go ahead collin mings raymond james associates analyst thank you i just first a follow up from me is just want to go back to dave s question on the portfolio can you maybe just expand a little bit more on the 900 acres you acquired during the fourth quarter and then just kind of more specifically do you have any other acquisitions currently under contract as we sit here today brian m davis president chief executive officer director so collin 900 acres it was in our existing marketplace what we ve noticed in this this is a very small transaction but what we ve noticed in the lower end of the middle market we actually have some opportunities in that space given our operating area we have a lot of connectivity into these marketplaces and there seems to be we re building a very strong pipeline in this kind of 5 million to 10 million range we don t have anything currently under contract we re looking at a number of transactions john capriotti who has been spearheading our efforts since our ipo in 2013 has done a really good job really building those opportunities for us been able to recalibrate and refocus our efforts doubling our efforts inside of our existing market area and we re finding some pretty good liquidity for opportunities that really hit kind of highlight up our board for us so we re excited about albeit this is 900 acres that we did in the fourth quarter but it really speak to more about the opportunities that we see in our existing marketplace collin mings raymond james associates analyst got it and along these lines how does the pacific northwest fit into the potential for some of these smaller deals that you re targeting brian m davis president chief executive officer director right pacific northwest has had a little bit different availability in the marketplace from a liquidity standpoint we re not seeing as many opportunities in the pacific northwest as we are in the southeast some of that speaks to our existing size of our operations out there todd and his team has done a fantastic job in 2019 of getting that up in operational and 2020 is going to be expanding those operations during the year but we always keep our eyes and ears open associated with the four accretive opportunities collin mings raymond james associates analyst okay and then one other housekeeping one from me here just as it relates to the anticipated gain from large dispositions recognizing that you provide a range around that is that just the one 14 400 acre deal that s already closed there is just kind of uncertainty as it relates to some of the accounting of that or is there some additional large dispositions that you re thinking about as you kind of put out that guidance range brian m davis president chief executive officer director that s related to the transaction that we closed in january collin collin mings raymond james associates analyst okay thank you brian m davis president chief executive officer director great thanks collin todd p reitz chief resources officer thank you collin operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to brian davis ceo and president for any closing remarks please go ahead sir brian m davis president chief executive officer director thank you

the winter 2020 economic forecast published today projects that the european economy is set to continue on a path of steady moderate growth the euro area has now enjoyed its longest period of sustained growth since the euro was introduced in 1999 the forecast projects that euro area gross domestic product gdp growth will remain stable at 1 2 in 2020 and 2021 for the eu as a whole growth is forecast to ease marginally to 1 4 in 2020 and 2021 down from 1 5 in 2019 valdis dombrovskis executive vice president for an economy that works for people said despite a challenging environment the european economy remains on a steady path with continued job creation and wage growth but we should be mindful of potential risks on the horizon a more volatile geopolitical landscape coupled with trade uncertainties so member states should use this weather window to pursue structural reforms to boost growth and productivity countries with high public debt should also shore up their defences by pursuing prudent fiscal policies paolo gentiloni european commissioner for the economy said the outlook for europe s economy is for stable albeit subdued growth over the coming two years this will prolong the longest period of expansion since the launch of the euro in 1999 with corresponding good news on the jobs front we ve also seen encouraging developments in terms of reduced trade tensions and the avoidance of a no deal brexit but we still face significant policy uncertainty which casts a shadow over manufacturing as for the coronavirus it is too soon to evaluate the extent of its negative economic impact growth to remain stable driven by domestic demand the external environment remains challenging however continued employment creation robust wage growth and a supportive policy mix should help the european economy maintain a path of moderate growth private consumption and investment particularly in the construction sector will continue to fuel economic growth public investment especially in transport and digital infrastructure is expected to increase significantly in a number of member states together with tentative signs of stabilisation in the manufacturing sector and a possible bottoming out of the decline in global trade flows this should allow the european economy to continue expanding at the same time these factors appear insufficient to shift growth into a higher gear a small upward revision to the inflation forecast the forecast for inflation harmonised index of consumer prices in the euro area has been raised to 1 3 in 2020 and 1 4 in 2021 an increase of 0 1 percentage points for both years compared to the autumn 2019 economic forecast this reflects tentative signs that higher wages may start passing through to core prices and slightly higher assumptions about oil prices in the eu the forecast for inflation in 2020 has also been raised by 0 1 percentage points to 1 5 the forecast for 2021 remains unchanged at 1 6 risks to the forecast while some downside risks have faded new ones have emerged overall the balance of risks continues to remain tilted to the downside the phase one trade deal between the us and china has helped to reduce downside risks to some extent but the high degree of uncertainty surrounding us trade policy remains a barrier to a more widespread recovery in business sentiment social unrest in latin america risks derailing the region s economic recovery heightened geopolitical tensions in the middle east have raised the risk of conflict in the region while there is now clarity on trading relations between the eu and the united kingdom during the transition period there remains considerable uncertainty over the future partnership with the uk the outbreak of the 2019 ncov coronavirus with its implications for public health economic activity and trade especially in china is a new downside risk the baseline assumption is that the outbreak peaks in the first quarter with relatively limited global spillovers the longer it lasts however the higher the likelihood of knock on effects on economic sentiment and global financing conditions risks related to climate change though mainly long term cannot be ruled out in the short term on the positive side the european economy could benefit from more expansionary and growth friendly fiscal policies and enjoy positive spillovers from more benign financing conditions in some euro area member states for the uk a purely technical assumption given that the future relations between the eu and the uk are not yet clear projections for 2021 are based on a purely technical assumption of status quo in terms of their trading relations this is for forecasting purposes only and reflects no anticipation or prediction with regard to the outcome of the negotiations between the eu and the uk on their future relationship background this forecast is based on a set of technical assumptions concerning exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices with a cut off date of 29 january for all other incoming data including assumptions about government policies this forecast takes into consideration information up until and including 4 february unless policies are credibly announced and specified in adequate detail the projections assume no policy changes the european commission publishes two comprehensive forecasts spring and autumn and two interim forecasts winter and summer each year the interim forecasts cover annual and quarterly gdp and inflation for the current and following year for all member states as well as eu and euro area aggregates the european commission s next economic forecast will be the spring 2020 economic forecast which is scheduled to be published on 7 may 2020 source european commission

thanks to our employees hard work and dedication and the unparalleled support of our communities as always we ll leave ample time to answer your questions turning to slide 4 in 2019 ppl continued to deliver on its commitments to shareowners customers and the communities we serve we remain steadfast in our strategy to deliver best in sector operational performance invest in a sustainable energy future provide superior customer service maintain a strong financial foundation and engage and develop our people our results in 2019 reflect this strategy we exceeded the midpoint of our earnings guidance for the 10th straight year delivering ongoing earnings of 2 45 per share we remain committed to dividend growth increasing our dividend for the 17th time in 18 years and returning more than 1 billion in dividends to shareowners as we delivered on these financial commitments we continued to extend our track record of operational excellence we maintained strong transmission and distribution reliability across all of our utilities in addition we achieved top decile generation reliability in kentucky at the same time we remain as focused as ever on providing superior customer service in fact our utilities remain among the very best for customer satisfaction in the regions we serve our us utilities earned four jd power awards for customer satisfaction raising their combined total to 51 since jd power began assessing utility customer satisfaction in 1999 meanwhile our uk utilities all achieved a 9 out of 10 in ofgem s broad measure of customer satisfaction review in addition western power distribution earned the uk s customer service excellence award for the 27th consecutive year the company was also ranked by the industry regulator as best in stakeholder engagement and support for vulnerable customers for the eighth straight year these achievements and more reflect our shared values and common purpose across ppl to deliver without fail for our customers to exceed their expectations and to continuously improve aware of the tremendous opportunity we have to make a positive impact on society not only today but for years to come ppl also invested more than 3 billion in infrastructure improvements our continued investments are aimed at strengthening grid resiliency in the face of worsening storms incorporating automation replacing and rebuilding power lines and substations and reshaping electricity networks to support the growth of renewables and other distributed energy resources in regulatory matters we remained focused in 2019 on achieving balanced regulatory outcomes that will benefit our customers and our shareowners in kentucky we received public service commission approval of a combined 187 million revenue increase which supports additional improvements to the grid our natural gas lines and our generation fleet new rates took effect may 1 and in the uk we continued to actively engage with ofgem to advance a balanced regulatory framework that will provide real value to customers support the uk s electrification and decarbonization initiatives and provide fair and reasonable returns to investors when the next price control review period begins in 2023 our engagement over the past year included meeting with ofgem leadership and submitting responses to ofgem s open letter consultation on behalf of both ppl and wpd including our shareowners i ll note that the riio ed2 framework released by ofgem in december was largely in line with our expectations in summary we re proud of our many achievements over the past year on behalf of ppl shareowners and customers our performance is reflected in the numerous awards received throughout the year looking ahead we re committed to building on this momentum and adding to our long term track record of financial and operational excellence now turning to slide 5 and our 2020 outlook today we initiated formal 2020 earnings guidance of 2 40 per share to 2 60 per share this reflects our updated foreign currency hedge position which we increased following the uk election that finally led to brexit last month given the election result we expect the uk business climate to remain strong as it has historically been turning to our dividend today we announced we were raising the annualized dividend to 1 66 per share the increase announced today represents our 18th dividend increase in the last 19 years and we remain committed to dividend growth in terms of network investment in 2020 we plan to invest an additional 3 3 billion in all of our utilities these investments will continue to support our efforts to improve customer experience and grid resiliency and advance a cleaner energy future finally as i touched upon earlier we will remain engaged on the regulatory front to achieve balanced outcomes that benefit customers and shareowners last week the new ceo ofgem jonathan brearley announced his decarbonization program action plan ofgem s plan over the next 18 months to make low cost decarbonization a reality shows that the dnos will play a critical role in the significant investment required to deliver clean energy and the uk s net zero carbon emissions target by the year 2050 this supports what we ve been saying that we see real long term growth opportunities with our wpd business as the dnos lead many of the decarbonization initiatives that will enable a net zero carbon economy i ll now turn the call over to vince for an operational update vince vincent sorgi president and chief operating officer thanks bill as we turn to a new year and a new decade i just want to express how proud i am of the operational excellence that our seven utilities continue to deliver for our customers our sector continues to rapidly evolve and our teams are meeting the challenges in finding opportunities to leverage technological advancements and decarbonization initiatives that are driving real value for our customers we believe that ppl is well positioned to further enhance its networks and continue to build these utilities of the future as we look ahead i d like to highlight some of the operational developments from this past year and briefly discuss our strategic priorities for each segment for 2020 and beyond i ll also provide an update on our five year capital expenditure plan turning to slide 7 starting with the uk during 2019 wpd continued to demonstrate its leadership in support of the uk s decarbonization goals wpd was the first uk network operator to publish an electric vehicle strategy building on knowledge gained through the company s electric nation ev smart charging initiative the company has begun to proactively ready its network for increasing numbers of electric vehicles anticipating the potential for up to 3 million evs in our service territory by 2030 wpd also continues to deliver an industry leading innovation program including finding ways to connect more distributed generation to local networks through 2019 wpd connected nearly 10 gigawatts of distributed generation to its networks about 6 gigawatts of which was renewable energy in addition wpd is leading the way in developing markets for flexibility services and demand response solutions to help maintain grid resiliency and control costs to the uk customers these flexibility solutions should enable the deferral of some network spend which ofgem is keen to see the dnos deliver as we look to the upcoming year it s important to review how we are performing against our riio ed1 business and i m proud to say that wpd continues to perform extremely well in riio ed1 in the most recent ofgem annual report for electric distribution wpd ranked first in customer satisfaction and customer minutes lost and ranked second in time to connect customers our returns are middle of the pack with an rore expectation of 8 4 on a real basis over the ed1 period i ll note that this equates to a nominal rore of about 11 when including rpi inflation as we ve indicated in the past as the only fast tracked company in riio ed1 we think the fact that we are the top performing dno group in the sector and only earning average returns will serve us well going into riio ed2 our strategic priorities moving forward are to continue this high level of performance and continue our engagement with ofgem to help develop the sector specific methodology our objective is to ensure riio ed2 provides the appropriate incentives for dnos to deliver on the initiatives required to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 turning to slide 8 in pennsylvania ppl electric utilities continue to demonstrate its leadership in the deployment of smart grid solutions we currently have 4 500 smart switches installed on our grid since 2015 this technology has helped us eliminate over 900 000 outages for our customers as we ve discussed during the year ppl electric has received numerous awards this year for its operational excellence and commitment to innovation including the deployment of a new distributed energy resource management system or derms and the development of groundbreaking technology that safely and automatically cuts power to downed power lines protecting the public first responders and our employees in addition ppl electric utilities was awarded the most improved utility of the decade by pa consulting the company is also substantially complete with the multi year nearly 500 million project to install 1 4 million advanced meters for our customers looking ahead for 2020 we remain focused on executing on our substantial electric transmission and distribution investment plan the majority of the spend this year remains in our transmission business which has been the fastest growing business in our portfolio for a number of years now due to the ongoing need to upgrade and modernize our transmission system this includes upgrading transmission lines and substations replacing wood poles with steel poles and building new substations we ve also invested considerably in our distribution network also adding smart great devices to the network hardening the system targeting our tree trimming efforts and investing in new systems to automate how the network is controlled this investment has also resulted in significant reductions in the number of and duration of outages for our customers going forward we ll continue to deploy digital and cloud based technology solutions to further automate the system to improve service even further for our customers from a rates perspective our retail rates continue to remain competitive in the mid atlantic region thanks to our ongoing emphasis on integrating technology and efficiently managing costs especially since we haven t had a base rate case since 2016 over the past decade we ve held our operating cost to less than a 1 increase on average each year we ll look to continue our efforts in this area as we don t expect another rate case to be effective within the earnings guidance period moving to kentucky on slide 9 louisville gas and electric and kentucky utilities continued to make progress on a multi year 800 million project to cap and close ash ponds at our coal fired power plants overall we are about 80 complete with the cap and closure program we also retired 272mw of coal fired generation at our e w brown facility raising the amount of retired coal generation to nearly 1 200mw since 2010 in addition we secured public service commission approval of a green energy tariff for businesses and continued to enhance our solar offerings for all of our customers we completed construction of the first phase of our subscription based solar share program and we have fully subscribed the second phase with construction expected to be completed in q2 of this year following up on a renewable energy rfp conducted in 2019 in january we requested approval of contracts to supply an additional 100mw of as available solar power to kentucky customers as we move into 2020 we see a balanced mix of investment across our kentucky utilities over the past decade we ve had a significant portion of our capital devoted to improving the environmental profile of our generating units which has supported reductions of so2 and nox emissions by approximately 90 and 80 respectively we ll be completing the majority of these environmental projects to comply with current regulations within the next couple of years as the environmental capital requirements have begun to decline we ve been able to deploy capital to improving our electric and gas t d networks with a focus on system reliability and automation that are already delivering real value for our customers as evidenced by 120 000 interruptions that have been prevented to date from our smart grid solutions all of these investments have supported rate base growth of over 7 per year on average over the past 20 years in kentucky as we look forward we are focused on a number of initiatives including customer focused programs such as our green energy tariff as well as planning for the future investment cycle as it relates to generation resource planning we ll also be working on updating our integrated resource plan with a new irp to be filed with the commission in late 2021 we expect the new irp will provide a better sense of timing for the next wave of capital deployment in kentucky related to the replacements of our coal fired generating fleet i ll touch on this further in a few minutes turning to slide 10 as the world focuses on climate change ppl remains committed to advancing a cleaner energy future while maintaining safety reliability and affordability for those we serve today we are updating our goals to reduce ppl s co2 emissions specifically we raised our goal of reducing ppl s carbon emissions to at least 80 from 2010 levels by 2050 from our previous target of 70 the company also accelerated its previous 2050 target by a decade and we are now targeting reducing carbon emissions by at least 70 by 2040 ppl has already reduced its carbon emissions by over 50 since 2010 by exiting the competitive generation business in 2015 including nearly 4 000mw of coal fired generation and retiring 1 200mw of coal in kentucky we expect to achieve these further reductions through a variety of actions including replacement of kentucky coal fired generation over time with a mix of renewables and natural gas while meeting our obligations to provide least cost and reliable service to our kentucky customers our updated targets are based on our ongoing resource planning activities and updated market data and trends in kentucky assuming we receive kpsc approval for the previously mentioned renewable ppa and if technology continues to improve and drive down the cost of renewable it is certainly possible that we can achieve even greater carbon reductions than these targets while at the same time ensuring the best value and liability for our customers we are confident however that these targets are achievable under current legislation and regulation as well as current technology and current economics turning to slide 11 we also wanted to provide an overview of the near term and longer term opportunities to economically shift our business mix away from coal fired generation as you can see from the chart on the left side of the slide ppl s rate base already consists of more than 80 transmission distribution and non coal fired generation given that our significant planned investments over the next five years are heavily weighted toward additional t d infrastructure the percentage of rate base in coal fired assets is expected to decrease even further in the near term in fact only about 5 of our 14 billion capital plan is for investments related to coal fired generating assets our current filed irp supports the transition to cleaner energy driven by technology and economics consistent with current policy and regulation as you can see based on the chart on the right of the slide based on certain scenarios from our latest irp filed back in 2018 we could see some additional coal retirements in the back half of the 2020s with significantly more coal retirements in the 2030s these scenarios continue to involve and we are starting to see more momentum for renewals in the state as evidenced by the results of the recent renewable rfp where we are proposing to economically add a lower cost as available renewable generation resource while reducing the amount of output from some of our higher cost fossil units we are not at a point where renewables can compete on a replacement capacity basis as renewable plus storage options are not even competitive with our peaking gas plants with that said it is clear that these factors are rapidly changing as we move through time which requires us to continuously assess the most prudent strategy that s in the best interest of our customers something we ve always demonstrated moving to slide 12 we ve updated our capital expenditure plan and continue to see significant investment opportunities in our networks over the next five years totaling about 14 billion we ve increased our 2020 and 2021 projections by approximately 200 million each year from our prior estimates primarily due to additional fluid limitation guideline spend in kentucky and then making some timing related investments in the uk our uk capital plan projects that we will be within 1 of our ofgem approved business plan for ed1 this will strengthen our credibility with ofgem when we file our riio ed2 business plan note that changing the assumed fx rate from 1 40 per 1gbp to 1 30 per 1gbp on our uk spend reduce the five year capex projections by about 300 million we have not included the 300 million kentucky ami project in our forecast at this time but that remains a potential upside opportunity for us as well as the other areas of opportunity noted on the slide including decarbonization related spending in the uk we believe these additional opportunities could be as much as another 500 million above what s in the five year capital plan long term we expect more than an incremental 1 billion of investment to be required over the five year riio ed2 period to achieve electrification initiatives based on our initial estimates as i previously noted we also believe the transition of our coal fired generation fleet will be the next significant investment opportunity in kentucky while this opportunity is outside of our five year capital plan under current scenarios it s important to remember that this plan reflects assumptions based on today s use of future prices and market conditions which could rapidly change what will not change is our commitment to our customers to continue to optimize our fleet and exceed expectations as we lead the evolution of our kentucky operations including the transition to less carbon intensive generation resources so as we look at the diverse portfolio of businesses that we have it s important to point out that each business is in a different stage of its investment cycle while uk rab growth has been a strong 5 to 6 in ed1 we see that growth accelerating into ed2 beginning in 2023 as we fund the uk electrification initiatives in kentucky we see the initial stages of the kentucky coal generation replacement strategy likely starting in the mid 2020s which will begin another period of significant capital investments and in pennsylvania we are expecting growth to likely slow in the next couple of years following an extensive period of transmission spending over the last five years at almost 700 million per year it s the diversity of our portfolio of businesses combined with our culture of operational excellence and continuous improvement that will continue to deliver long term value for our shareowners with that i ll turn it over to joe now to cover the financial review joe joseph p bergstein senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks vince and good morning everyone i ll begin with a brief financial overview on slide 14 and while ppl delivered an outstanding quarter of financial performance earning 0 57 of ongoing earnings per share i ll focus my review this morning on our full year results we have included a walk in the appendix of today s presentation and our news release for additional details on fourth quarter results looking at the full year we achieved 2019 reported earnings of 2 37 per share compared with 2 58 per share a year ago adjusting for special items primarily reflecting mark to market changes related to unrealized foreign currency economic hedges 2019 earnings from ongoing operations was 2 45 per share exceeding a midpoint of our forecast by 0 05 per share this compares to the 2 40 per share that we earned last year which included significant weather benefits of about 0 08 per share looking forward to 2020 we announced the formal guidance range of 2 40 to 2 60 per share which reflects updates for current market conditions on our foreign currency hedge position we also are updating our 2021 estimates primarily reflecting changes to foreign currency forecasts which are lower than our prior forecasts let s turn to slide 15 for an update on our earnings results for the full year walking from our 2018 results on the left we first make weather adjustments for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses as i mentioned weather was 0 08 favorable compared to normalized weather results in 2018 for 2019 we experienced slightly favorable weather the net result was a 0 07 per share decline year over year across all of our utilities we also adjust for the effect of dilution we settled the remaining 43 million shares on our forward equity transaction in november of 2019 which is the primary driver of the 0 10 per share of dilution year over year segment allocation of dilution is included on the slide for your reference turning to the individual segment drivers which exclude the impact of these items starting with the uk our uk regulated segment earned 1 40 per share a 0 12 year over year increase the increase in the uk earnings was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins primarily driven by higher prices due to the april 1 2018 and 2019 price increases partially offset by lower sales volumes and a higher pension income in pennsylvania we earned 0 62 per share which was 0 05 higher than our results in 2018 our pennsylvania results were primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission partially offset by year over year differences in reduced income tax rates due to us tax reform the higher adjusted gross margins were partially offset by higher depreciation expense turning to our kentucky regulated segment we earned 0 59 per share in 2019 a 0 05 increase over our results one year ago the increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins primarily resulting from higher retail rates effective may 1 2019 and lower income taxes primarily due to the kentucky recycling credit recorded in the second quarter partially offsetting these items were higher depreciation expense and higher interest expense due to increased borrowings results in corporate and other were consistent compared to the prior year the results were primarily driven by higher other income offset by higher operations and maintenance expense turning to slide 16 and our financial outlook for 2020 ppl s growth is underpinned by continued operational excellence and organic investment at our regulated utilities walking from our strong 2019 results on the left of the slide i ll note that weather in this past year was not significant compared to our forecast of normal conditions and resulted in only a 0 01 per share adjustment for comparability purposes we also project dilution of about 0 11 due to the november 2019 settlement of our may 2018 equity forward offering which increases our 2020 average shares outstanding compared to 2019 the allocations by segment are provided on a slide for your reference excluding these two factors we project growth at each of ppl s business segments the uk segment is expected to experience growth primarily driven by higher base demand revenues due to the annual april 1 increases and expected higher foreign currency exchange rates reflecting our solid hedge position for 2020 these positive drivers in the uk are expected to be partially offset by lower revenues from true up mechanisms related to cost of debt recovery property taxes and sales volumes totaling about 0 10 lower pension income primarily due to the significant decline in discount rates in the uk and a combination of other miscellaneous drivers such as higher depreciation financing costs and taxes in pennsylvania we project an increase driven primarily by higher returns on transmission investments and turning to kentucky we project an increase from 2019 driven by higher retail rates partially offset by higher depreciation expense in corporate and other we project improved earnings driven by a number of items including lower interest expense due to lower short term debt post the settlement of our equity forward these drivers result in the midpoint of our guidance range at 2 50 per share turning to slide 17 we have also updated our 2021 projections to account for current foreign currency forecasts our prior earnings forecast of 2 50 to 2 80 per share reflected a foreign currency range of 1 35 per 1gbp to 1 60 per 1gbp which was consistent with bank fx forecasts at the time we initiated the earnings range our updated earnings forecast of 2 40 to 2 60 per share includes an updated foreign currency range 1 25 to 1 40 per 1gbp which is below the current forwards and market forecasts we are using these lower rates for the fx range given the expected near term volatility as the uk works through the brexit transition period during 2020 and we will be heading hitting 2021 during this time period the other drivers for 2021 highlighted in our previously announced forecasts remain largely unchanged with rate base still expected to grow at 5 to 6 and our expectation to continue to earn near our allowed returns our 2020 and 2021 forecasts continue to assume an immaterial amount of equity issuances as previously indicated let me provide an update on our foreign currency hedging status which is on slide 18 for 2020 we were actively hedging during the fourth quarter and increased our hedge percentage by another 20 bringing our hedge position to 90 of 2020 forecasted ongoing earnings the average rate for 2020 reflecting these new hedges is 1 48 per 1gbp we were able to slightly improve on the average 2020 hedge rates by optimizing our hedge portfolio given the brief uplift in currency rates following the positive uk election outcome and the strength in our 2019 results we continue to utilize options in our hedging strategy that preserve upside for the current market rates with about one third of the 2020 hedge portfolio being option based and for 2021 our hedge position is at 5 of forecasted earnings at an average rate of 1 33 per 1gbp again we expect to continue evaluating the 2021 hedges going forward turning to slide 19 as we continue our efforts to invest in our networks and earn our authorized returns we remain committed to paying dividends to shareowners as we ve done over the past century the january 1 dividend represents the 296th consecutive quarterly dividend paid to shareowners as bill mentioned we remain committed to dividend growth and today announced we re raising the annualized dividend to 1 66 per share and we will continue to assess the rate at which we grow the dividend going forward in the context of our yield and payout relative to our peers that concludes my prepared remarks and i ll turn the call back to bill for some closing comments bill william h spence chairman and chief executive officer thank you joe before we open up the call for q a i d like to take a moment to reflect on what has truly been a remarkable decade for ppl over the past 10 years we ve doubled our market cap we ve unfailingly exceeded the midpoint of our earnings forecast we ve grown our dividend 18 we won 21 jd power awards for customer satisfaction in the us we ve consistently ranked highest for customer satisfaction among the network operators in the uk we ve invested 27 billion to make our networks smarter to improve reliability and to advance a cleaner energy future we ve cut average customer interruptions by over a third in the uk and by more than 20 in the us since 2010 all the while we ve kept electricity costs reasonable for our customers and remained deeply engaged with the communities we serve and last but not least we have dramatically transformed ppl a decade ago we were primarily a pennsylvania hybrid utility facing stiff headwinds in competitive markets today we are one of the nation s largest investor owned utility companies with 100 of its earnings driven by stable high performing regulated businesses in short we are stronger today than we were a decade ago we re better positioned to invest in the future and as we celebrate our centennial we are poised to power progress for another 100 years when our directors first met a century ago they did so at a pivotal time the country was beginning to move from a patchwork quilt of isolated lighting companies to a coordinated network of regional utilities power plants and transmission lines born in that moment ppl would help drive that change extending electricity service throughout the regions we serve expanding to meet the needs and demands of rapid industrial growth and helping to improve quality of life for generations of customers today we again find ourselves at a pivotal moment for our industry which is investing in new technologies to reshape not only how we deliver power but how we produce it as well in this moment we remain as committed as ever to powering progress to fostering innovation to creating long term shareowner value and to making a positive impact on society in closing i m proud of our past achievements i m equally excited about our future and i m convinced that ppl s best days are ahead with that operator let s open the call for questions please questions and answers operator today s first question comes from ali agha of strh please go ahead ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey inc analyst thank you good morning william h spence chairman and chief executive officer good morning ali ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey inc analyst good morning first question i just wanted to reconcile your 2020 guidance of 2 40 to 2 60 with the numbers you ve been showing us for quite a while up until recently a 2020 projected range of 2 54 to 2 58 i guess when i think about the midpoint i know that was a narrower range but the midpoint was certainly higher than what you re showing us today could you just reconcile what changed from the numbers you ve been sharing with us william h spence chairman and chief executive officer sure i ll make a couple of opening comments and i ll pass it on to joe one of the things you just pointed out was the very tight range that we had established for 2020 having said that we still are kind of within that range but toward the lower end operationally when you look at the assumptions behind the 2020 we re largely consistent with the prior forecast the primary change was really a significant decline in corporate bond rates in the uk resulting in some lower discount rates which had a negative impact on our uk pension obligations those factors really resulted in about a 0 06 impact compared to our prior plan but as i mentioned despite this we re still in the prior range for 2020 joe do you want to say anything more joseph p bergstein senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah we saw a sharp decline in corporate bond rates in the uk that lowered the discount rates resulting in the increased uk pension obligations under us gaap the discount rate declined by more than 100 basis points it went from about 3 to less than 2 and that s really what s causing the difference from our prior forecast and again to those point operationally everything else remains unchanged ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey inc analyst got it and then second question vince i just wanted to be clear when you talked about the capex opportunities that you re seeing across the different utility segments did i hear it right that over this five year period 19 through 24 or 23 24 i should say that you re seeing potentially another 800 million of additional capex or was the number even larger than that i just wanted to be very clear what s the opportunity size that you see that s not yet embedded in your official capex numbers vincent sorgi president and chief operating officer yeah sure ali in my remarks i indicated that was about 0 5 billion so 500 million ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey inc analyst 500 million and i think separately you also talked about 300 million of ami that s not yet in that is that correct vincent sorgi president and chief operating officer yeah that s part of the 500 million ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey inc analyst oh that s part of the 500 million i got you okay vincent sorgi president and chief operating officer and the other thing i would note is that just changing that fx assumption from 1 40 our previous assumption down to 1 30 as indicated on our slide 12 cut about 300 million from the forecast so depending on when we get out particularly to 2022 and beyond to the extent the fx rate goes back up that will come back into the forecast and we do think that there is a skew to the upside when it comes to the fx rate given where we see brexit today and the uk political front so we re expecting some of that may come back in but that was 300 million alone ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey inc analyst right and last question bill to you i know in the past you ve talked about from your vantage point you still think that the uk business is disproportionately too big as a contributor to earnings for ppl just wondering how you look at that today and is there any new tools available to you or what s your thinking on how to correct that today if you still think that it s disproportionately too large of a business mix for you william h spence chairman and chief executive officer sure well first i d say we are comfortable with the current business mix and believe it will deliver long term value for our shareowners and that there are many opportunities as vince described in his remarks as i have said in the past the unprecedented uk volatility that we ve been experiencing over the past few years i would have preferred to be less weighted toward the uk but quite frankly we probably share a similar view for any jurisdiction where we ve got a significant weighting such as in the uk i do think for those things that were within our control we ve got a great track record of operational excellence and financial investments that i think are going to pay dividends for the future and i think the opportunities we outlined today will continue to enable us to be successful for a very long time ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey inc analyst got it thank you william h spence chairman and chief executive officer sure operator our next question today comes from shar pourreza of guggenheim partners please go ahead shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst hey good morning guys william h spence chairman and chief executive officer good morning shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst i just want to just touch on sort of the guidance and your outlook just a little bit deeper obviously if you just kind of look at your outer year plan the capex steps down and remains flat kentucky rate base kind of declines there is a modest step up in pennsylvania can you maybe just give a little bit more details and the puts and takes and what could move you higher and i m kind of curious on when you can present the timing of an update understanding that you guys are very very conservative when it comes to the outer years i e like with the capital opportunities associated with ev deployment in the uk why not have included some of this stuff in your capital outlook today like why take such a conservative stance william h spence chairman and chief executive officer yeah so i ll make a comment or two and then turn it to vince if you look at the overall capex plan and the rate base growth that s associated with that looking at in my view a minimum 4 rate base growth with earnings that will follow that with the caveat that of course exchange rates and pension deficits funding can push that higher or lower but i think in my view because of the upsides that vince talked about i look at the plan as a minimum 4 probably more in the 4 to 6 over the longer term as we fill in some of the gaps with more certain projects and really scrub things a little bit better in the outer years as you indicated we have historically been pretty conservative with our forecast and we continue to be really driven by what we know about current projects but also what we see is the current kind of fx rate which as you know has been pretty volatile over time and again i mentioned earlier that i believe we have a skew to the upside with the fx rate as the brexit process becomes a lot more clear vince do you want to add anything to the potential upside vincent sorgi president and chief operating officer yeah and shar shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst hey vince vincent sorgi president and chief operating officer specific to your question about kind of uk ev spend and how we re thinking about that when we would update so the 200 million a year that we ve included so basically an incremental 1 billion that we re expecting over really in ed2 that s based on our initial estimates going into the electrification initiatives that would be required to be funded by the dnos when you look at the process going forward for riio2 the sector methodology consultation will be coming out q2 q3 of this year this is on slide 28 by the way in the deck the methodology decision would be coming out till q4 then the companies will be submitting our submissions in q2 of 2021 so to be honest with you we re going through the process right now on planning for those submissions the business plan submissions while we re consulting with ofgem on the methodology and so i think we just need to get through that process a little more shar before we would i think update the view of ev or electrification spending going into ed2 but to your point i think there certainly could be an opportunity there for incremental capital especially coming out of what jonathan brearley published really i think his first day on the job with his decarbonization plan so we think that all fits very nicely into what we ve been talking about but i think we need to get through the process a little more before we would go beyond our initial estimate shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst got it and then just sticking sort of with your conservative theme here just around the fx i mean you did highlight obviously you re taking a little bit more of a conservative stance but your assumptions do trail sort of consensus and forwards so just maybe talk a little bit about that at a deeper level and then what s sort of the timing of the 21 hedging program are there sort of any mandated thresholds or are you able to keep it open based on kind of your fundamental views william h spence chairman and chief executive officer joe do you want to talk about fx for a start joseph p bergstein senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so i guess the first part of your question shar on our forecast range relative to four market spot rates and market forecasts we are lower than those for the reasons i said in my prepared remarks we expect volatility in the exchange rate during 2020 as the uk continues through the transition period and we will be hedging 2021 during that time period bank forecasts are in a range of 1 35 to 1 45 for 2021 so there is certainly some potential upside to our forecast and as we looked at 2022 those bank forecasts are actually in the mid 1 40s range so sensitivity of 0 01 of fx to 0 01 of earnings that s 0 15 of upside if the bank forecasts are accurate in 2022 relative to where we sit today shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst got it and then just one last one is to bill i know you may or may not want to answer this but i know the board has been obviously very patient around how you guys are thinking about the stock and the valuation but it does kind of still continue to trade even if you look at it from a sum of the parts multiple rab basis post brexit is there any other strategic steps that you can take to maximize value for shareholders outside of the plan you sort of present today and outside of the obviously incremental opportunities given the fact that your plan is very conservative william h spence chairman and chief executive officer well obviously i m not going to speculate on potential m a but when i look at the overall strategy for the things that we can control it s actually worked really well i think in terms of meeting all the things that we do control you obviously can t control the politics in the uk or the exchange rate i think that as we look forward particularly as we get through 2020 it s very likely that we ll know a lot more about where brexit ultimately lands and what the currency landscape looks like for sure having said that we re always looking at strategic or improvements to the base case that we can make that would create shareowner value so we ll continue to do that as a board and as a management team wherever and always if there is opportunities i think to create some additional shareowner value but we are always on the lookout for how do we improve the base case and the plan that we have and i will continue to do that shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst thanks guys a lot of valuable shares appreciate it william h spence chairman and chief executive officer thank you you re welcome operator and our next question today comes from greg gordon at evercore isi please go ahead greg gordon evercore isi analyst thanks actually shar actually set me up reasonably well there we didn t even plan this when i look at like what you can control obviously operationally you guys are still top notch across all your businesses but given the things that you can t control in 20 and 21 and then the other thing you can only to some degree control in 22 which is the reset of under riio ed2 if i step back and look at this from a high level is it fair to look at the big picture as the next few years you ve got some earnings challenges that could create a more or less flat earnings profile but the setup going into 22 and beyond creates a lot of growth opportunities from a decarbonization perspective on both your platforms to start growing the business again at a pretty steady and long trajectory william h spence chairman and chief executive officer yeah greg i would say overall the earnings from with the guidance we just gave here today from 20 to 21 at least looking at the midpoints looks flat as we indicated depending on the fx rates in particular that could move up and show some growth i think the underlying businesses kind of to your point continue to grow the rate basis continuing to grow and i think we are going to be set up well going into both decarbonization opportunities in the uk as well as domestically so i think that depending on your outlook for the fx will dictate whether there s growth from 2020 to 2021 greg gordon evercore isi analyst right and then look 2022 i know you haven t given guidance so i m not trying to sort bait you into giving me guidance but we did go through in riio ed1 when you transitioned there was a reset year on revenues that you had to overcome and you ve talked about on prior calls how you can manage through fast pot slow pot allocations and how you think that because you re best in class operator you ll do better than average on the outcome and that hopefully the dnos will do better on the margin than some of the other utility segments but it is fair to say that 22 has its own set of challenges as well that you re going to have to manage correct william h spence chairman and chief executive officer well i think again i think it really depends on what the forecast that you want to use for foreign currency rates because i think we re in my view kind of toward the low end if you look at what fx rates have done really since the election there was a temporary bounce but really stayed around 1 30 it s pretty much been range bound for the last couple of months and you look at the forward forecast and a lot of them as joe indicated are 1 35 and better particularly much better when we get to 2022 so i would expect just on the strength of the fx that by the time we get to 2022 we ll see some earnings growth joe i don t know if you want to add joseph p bergstein senior vice president and chief financial officer i guess if we just look at the underlying business absent fx sort of all else equal given we are talking about 2022 we would see growth in the businesses and really the reason we re flat from 2020 to 2021 based on the midpoints is because of our strong hedge position for 2020 relative to the hedge position we have in 2021 so that s really what s showing a flat year over year earnings is because we actually have a decline in the fx rate that s hedged and assumed in 2020 compared to what we ve used in the forecast for 2021 so i think there is on the underlying businesses we see growth and then we ll have to see what fx does but certainly as we move through 2020 you expect some clarity on the transition get back into what we would expect and hope to be more normal times around the fx rate that could add additional growth on top of that vincent sorgi president and chief operating officer yeah greg it s vince just also the riio2 transition is 2023 not 2022 greg gordon evercore isi analyst oh gosh sorry yeah vincent sorgi president and chief operating officer yeah i think they ll or on joe s point on expected growth into 2022 right on the money greg gordon evercore isi analyst got you and then i think back to the strategic decisions that you guys made when you decided to aggressively diversify and you bought the you bought more utility assets in the uk and you bought the kentucky business and you did it at a really opportune time to diversify it away quite well from your exposure to the declining margin outlook for merchant power and i can t help but think that this decarbonization opportunity which is going to be huge for your company in kentucky and in the uk is also a huge opportunity and to build a little bit on shar s question on strategic options would that play into a decision to think about how you could potentially scale up with a partner to better potentially better execute on that transition william h spence chairman and chief executive officer well probably i won t i shouldn t say probably i will not speculate on m a but in terms of your underlying thesis around the decarbonization opportunity i agree with that and i believe that particularly in the uk it s one of the reasons why we continue to have a positive outlook on the uk we ve weathered probably the strongest of the storms so far particularly with renationalization threats which are now obviously not a threat at all given the strong election outcome in the uk so that risk is now behind us and we still have the risk of brexit that s keeping the markets a little bit jittery but beyond that i think things will stabilize we ll have a much better view of not only riio ed2 but also where the fx starts to land and i think for the going forward setup for the business was i think we re in very good shape greg gordon evercore isi analyst okay thank you guys take care william h spence chairman and chief executive officer thanks greg operator our next question today comes from praful mehta of citigroup please go ahead praful mehta citigroup analyst thanks so much hi guys william h spence chairman and chief executive officer good morning praful mehta citigroup analyst good morning so maybe staying unfortunately with the theme on the strategic side and i guess one of the points that i took away from all the answers was clearly you would look to at least benefit from reducing the proportion of the uk business so i just wanted to understand i know that there was a constraint around selling the uk business because of tax and the leakage there if you were to partner up and use that to increase the size of the company effectively reducing the proportion of the uk business what kind of constraints should we think about on the tax side or other side that could limit any kind of strategic decisions around that decision william h spence chairman and chief executive officer well again i m not going to speculate around m a however as we ve indicated in the past an outright sale either in full or partially of the uk business does create multiple challenges all of which destroy shareholder value and if you look at the valuation of the company today i think it s even more challenging today than it probably was when our stock was in the upper 28 to 30 range so in the upper 20s so i think with where we are today that strategic decision continues to be a big challenge for us in terms of where the renationalization risk being removed clearly you ve seen the values of the uk utilities move up significantly after the election and we still have what we believe is one of the strongest if not the strongest distributor network operator in the uk so we believe on its own its value has increased but again for us to de weight and sell the business that would be destructive to shareowners praful mehta citigroup analyst yeah i know i get that and i remember that what i m asking is if rather than selling the uk business ppl as a whole would partner with somebody else and that way reducing the proportion of the uk business do those same constraints apply on the tax side or any other side that we should be thinking about as we think about the strategic direction william h spence chairman and chief executive officer yeah let me ask joe to comment on that joseph p bergstein senior vice president and chief financial officer hi praful i mean i think that it s a very hypothetical question and it would be dependent on the other party and a lot of aspects of that and so it s really hard to give an answer in that i would say we to the earlier point we look at all sorts of ways to create shareowner value and obviously tax implications and what that would do to shareowner value is something that we focus closely on but i think it d be very difficult to say in a hypothetical situation and dependent on who the other party may be praful mehta citigroup analyst fair enough and that makes sense just a couple of quick cleanup questions on slide 25 when i look at the rate base growth that you ve projected through 24 i saw a meaningful decline in rate base growth both for the uk business and kentucky obviously this was slightly different timing 18 to 23 versus 19 to 24 but i m just trying to understand the uk sounds like mostly pension related and exchange rate and mostly exchange rate i guess and kentucky you guys have talked about is there anything else we should be thinking about around the rate base growth profile as you think about the different segments william h spence chairman and chief executive officer so looking at that slide 25 you can see there that the rate base growth in the uk is about 5 5 it s not materially different i don t believe from where it was previously i think it might have been as high as 6 i think the biggest decrease is really in the kentucky operation where we re only projecting a 1 5 growth much about or much because of the reasons that vince articulated in his opening remarks and in the pa transmission that s really been probably the larger decrease when you look at the overall mix because for a period of time we were growing double digit there and then on the distribution side i think it s been fairly consistent in the 4 to 6 so i think the two big changes are lower in kentucky and lower on the pennsylvania transmission side praful mehta citigroup analyst yeah thanks sorry i did mean pennsylvania transmission sorry so thanks for that and finally just on slide 26 when i look at incentive revenues there has been a slight decrease in that projection as well for the uk so i just want to understand is that also exchange rate or anything else on the incentive side william h spence chairman and chief executive officer it s purely exchange rate praful mehta citigroup analyst okay perfect well i really appreciate it guys thank you william h spence chairman and chief executive officer okay you re welcome operator our next question today comes from julien dumoulin smith of bank of america please go ahead julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst hey team well done again and just going to play a cleanup here on some of the last questions so can we talk a little bit more specifically on the timeline here for ami and kentucky you talked about 300 million sort of procedurally how do we get that done when i know there s been some talk historically about that and also perhaps more importantly decarbonization in the uk how do you think about that the timeline be able to reflect some of that and what would that how would that manifest itself in terms of capex here just to be a little bit more specific on that process and i got a follow up william h spence chairman and chief executive officer okay sure vince go ahead vincent sorgi president and chief operating officer sure julien on the ami we would likely time that with the next rate case as you know in kentucky we ve been on this every other year rate case cycle the last rate case new rates were effective may 1 of 2019 if we were to continue that cadence yeah right you would see a rate case becoming effective in the first half of 2021 so ami i would say we would factor that into that upcoming rate case and then i apologize what was the second part of your question julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst how does the decarbonization in the uk get reflected how does that manifest itself what kind of order of magnitude of spending we re talking about i know you guys talked about a 500 million upside in the five year outlook i mean when you think about decarbonization that probably seems like a bigger number here but i don t want to put words in your mouth and what time period are we talking about in the current ed are we talking about the next one if you can provide some context vincent sorgi president and chief operating officer sure so the bulk of the incremental electrification capex we ve included in the ed2 initial estimate so we have about 1 billion over five years call it 320 million a year in that five year period and again that s based on our initial assumptions the team is working through our business plan submission and that will be filed mid 2021 as part of the riio2 process i would say depending how aggressive the government initiatives and ofgem s policies become on the tail end of ed1 we could see deploying some capital in our current rate our current business plan time frame on electrification initiatives we think we have enough leeway within the existing plan that we would be able to divert some spending toward that therefore it wouldn t be a drag on the returns because as you know the revenues are kind of set for the ed1 period so we would have to basically shift capital away from other things to evs we have innovation capital other things that i would say are placeholders that we could redeploy there so i think we have enough flexibility in the back end of ed1 and you ll see a significant uptick in e2 which could once we get the business plans done could be higher than what we re currently projecting at that 1 billion over the five years william h spence chairman and chief executive officer yeah it s probably obvious but anything that we would shift from the current ed1 to ed2 to accommodate any electrification initiatives would wind up showing up in ed2 because presumably it s all work that is necessary to be done not necessarily for electrification put for reliability and customer service reasons operator and our next question today comes from anthony crowdell of mizuho please go ahead anthony crowdell mizuho securities analyst hey good morning i want to follow up on greg s earlier question if i think about 2021 and 22 earnings in order to see some growth there do i need to see in order to see like an earnings growth that matches rate base growth do i need to see an improvement in the exchange rate william h spence chairman and chief executive officer no anthony crowdell mizuho securities analyst and then also on currency for i think some of the currency hedges are options where it preserves the upside any thought on why not locking in 21 now since i don t know if there is many moving parts to 21 earnings with rate cases and also 22 i think that you just mentioned kentucky not locking those options now and preserving the upside but maintaining a base versus if there is any further fallout in the uk joseph p bergstein senior vice president and chief financial officer the options anthony are for 2020 not in 2021 so i think given where the options are priced and where the spot rate is we ll prefer to see what happens within those option rates because we re protected on the downside clearly you could see some appreciation on the upside but they re in 2020 not 2021 william h spence chairman and chief executive officer sorry just to add to that to the extent that we wanted to put options on for the bulk of 2021 that can be pretty expensive so we probably wouldn t look to do that unless there were some shifts in our thoughts around the currency but for now i think we ll look opportunistically to hedge in at 1 30 and above wherever we can and you ll see we ll start to ramp up a lot of our hedging by probably mid year anthony crowdell mizuho securities analyst and just lastly if you could update us on the pension assumptions i don t believe there is a major change in your pension assumptions in the uk i thought there was like a 10 degradation from 2020 to 2021 but i just wanted to double check with you guys joseph p bergstein senior vice president and chief financial officer we had projected about 0 05 change from 2020 to 2021 and our assumptions haven t changed materially around that at this point anthony crowdell mizuho securities analyst great thanks for taking my question joseph p bergstein senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks william h spence chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes the question and answer session i d like to turn the conference back over to bill spence for any final remarks william h spence chairman and chief executive officer okay thank you rocco and thanks everyone for joining us today we ll visit with you again

situation of the wet suwet en is similar to that of many other indigenous nations in this regard there are vibrant traditional legal and political protocols in place that lay out each nation s responsibilities to the land and all in it yet the case of the wet suwet en suggests that canada and b c will completely ignore indigenous laws and protocols that continue despite colonialism and the violence that the colonial state is evidently willing to deploy in furthering its economic and political objectives threatens all indigenous peoples when there is a conflict over the use of the land

on monday president donald trump released his proposed budget for fiscal year 2021 the proposal touches on every area of economic activity from taxes to spending to regulation and the value of work while the budget is a welcome step toward reduced spending lower regulation and a growth oriented dynamic economy bolder reforms are needed to establish fiscal solvency and restore the government to its constitutional prerogatives here are the facts you need to know total spending and the national deficit the president s fiscal year 2021 budget a budget for america s future spends 4 89 trillion it includes 4 4 trillion in savings bringing deficits down each year and putting the federal government on a path to a balanced budget by 2035 his proposed budget would add 1 083 trillion to the national debt which stands at more than 23 trillion this year and nearly a trillion dollars in the following two years the overall trajectory moves the united states toward greater stability the current u s debt to gdp ratio stands at 81 percent and would reach 100 percent of gdp by 2030 under trump s proposed budget the debt would amount to 66 percent of gdp in a decade robust projected growth would mean that by 2030 less than one in every five dollars in the economy would be consumed by the federal government but that s the rub optimistic outlook the president projects vastly larger economic growth than the congressional budget office the president s growth projection for 2025 is literally double that of the cbo the fact that the cbo repealed the use of dynamic scoring at the beginning of the 116th congress may explain some of this difference extended tax cuts the president s budget assumes the tax reductions passed as part of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act tcja scheduled to expire in 2025 will be extended permanently however the budget as presented does not continue immediate business expensing beyond the end of 2022 this practice rewards firms that invest in capital goods by letting them write off the full expense in the same year rather than over several administration officials say a more robust tax reduction package will be proposed this summer 4 4 trillion in spending cuts the president s proposed budget forecasts 4 4 trillion in budget cuts about half of them 1 9 trillion by paring back non defense discretionary programs it is refreshing that these represent real budget cuts not merely reductions in the rate of growth which talking heads of both parties erroneously describe as cuts moreover many of these cuts would occur within agencies that have the greatest regulatory footprint the budget for the department of commerce would nearly be halved with the proposed 48 percent reduction the environmental protection agency would lose 26 percent of its budget while the president would eliminate almost 50 wasteful programs that are outside of epa s core mission or duplicative of other efforts saving taxpayers over 600 million foreign aid would fall by 21 percent the dept of housing and urban development hud would see its budget cut by 15 percent largely by returning authority over some housing programs to state or local governments those changes sound large but would represent just seven percent of projected federal spending over the next decade of 61 trillion writes chris edwards of the cato institute commitment to further deregulation the budget notes that the trump administration s deregulatory to regulatory action ratio has been a remarkable 7 4 to 1 resulting in a total of 51 billion in net regulatory cost savings for the american people this is a stark contrast to the 420 billion in net regulatory costs imposed by the obama administration during the same amount of time the president plans even bolder efforts during the remainder of 2020 citing concrete action on cafe standards and allowing greater innovation for small businesses school choice perhaps sending a message the president s fy2021 budget requests 66 6 billion for the department of education a modest reduction but this would consolidate 29 overlapping elementary and secondary programs into a new block grant which saves taxpayers nearly 4 7 billion the education budget would allocate up to 5 billion annually for education freedom scholarships a tax credit for those who donate to state based scholarship funds for use at private schools a lawsuit over a similar program is pending before the supreme court while a commitment to school choice is welcome some are concerned even an arms length entanglement of federal money in private education could open the door to stifling regulation restoring work requirements for federal benefits the proposed budget would require able bodied working age individuals aged 18 65 years old who receive federal benefits such as medicaid and temporary aid to needy families tanf to work at least 20 hours a week the law includes categories of exemptions but reestablishes the importance of work for all who are able moving people from government dependence to self reliance this will also realize meaningful savings the budget forecasts 182 billion in savings from reforming the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap formerly food stamps and 193 billion by rolling back the medicaid expansion and chip funding overall the growth of medicaid would be slowed from five percent annually to two percent the relief will be felt nationwide as swelling medicaid rolls are straining state budgets from coast to coast the border wall the fy2021 budget requests a mere 2 billion to build the wall across the nation s border with mexico at a glance that might be seen as a sign trump is giving ground writes niv elis in the hill but in reality it shows how he has successfully dodged congress to provide funds for the wall without the cooperation of democrats president trump declared a national emergency which allowed him to repurpose money congress allocated for other programs to border security from the moon to mars trump boosts nasa funding by 12 percent including 3 billion to finance a new human lunar landing by 2024 the last took place in 1972 this mission will build a sustainable presence on the lunar surface as the first step on a journey that will take america to mars modest medicare reimbursement reform medicare pays a higher reimbursement rate for procedures performed at a hospital than in a doctor s office paying the same rate for the same procedure would save 270 3 billion however the budget does not contain any bold sweeping reform to the two largest federal entitlements medicare and social security the trump administration seems to believe the government can grow its way out of the structural issues present in both even if the most optimistic forecasted growth came to pass it would not correct the unsustainable design flaws of intergenerational transfer programs partial privatization of government run industry the budget would privatize some of the assets of the power marketing administrations the federal government began the projects during the new deal era the heritage foundation notes originally intended to pay off federal irrigation and dam construction and to provide subsidized power to poor communities the pmas now supply such areas as los angeles california vail colorado and las vegas nevada this is a good first step toward getting the federal government out of private industry federal funding of daycare president trump s fy2021 budget would make a 1 billion one time investment via grants for state governments to build the supply of child care providers pushing states to adopt paid parental leave policies the president spurred on by daughter ivanka has championed paid parental leave for new parents the budget would push states to establish paid parental leave programs in a way that is most appropriate for their workforce while many parents wish for greater paid leave use is uneven between the sexes and women express a far greater desire for overall workplace flexibility evidence exists that california s program reduced employment by seven percent and would cost taxpayers up to 2 000 a year in additional taxes the last thing anyone needs is another government program which lacks constitutional authority and could saddle future generations with even more debt potential impact by continuing the regimen of economic freedom that has generated enviable economic growth president trump could set the united states on a course toward greater prosperity some pundits will say that the trump spending cuts will hurt the economy but that narrative is false large spending cuts would spur economic growth by leaving more resources in the private sector and allocated by markets federal spending causes microeconomic damage that undermines growth explains edwards but it won t pass under the constitution all spending bills must originate in the house of representatives the budget is a statement of values said house speaker nancy pelosi and once again the president is showing just how little he values the good health financial security and well being of hardworking american families senate democrats said the trump budget is breathtaking in its degree of cruelty and filled with broken promises indicating unipartisan bicameral backlash as such budget proposals act more as statements of political intention than as policy crafting documents frankly budgeting has become pretty much a joke in this country where budgets are used as messaging documents and an excuse to trade insults said maya macguineas president of the committee for a responsible federal budget the president s budget makes welcome cuts to programs that encourage government dependence and underscores the dignity of work the latter is particularly valuable to those who look at the budget through a scriptural lens guided by the injunction that if any would not work neither should he work it provides a welcome contrast with alexandria ocasio cortez s green new deal which guarantees federally funded economic security to those unwilling to work however the budget misses an opportunity to ask for bolder reforms to federal transfer programs deepens the national debt and entangles the government in new unconstitutional programs more fundamental reforms than those outlined in this aspirational budget would be necessary to return the federal government to its constitutional functions that said this clearly delineates many of the steps necessary to restore fiscal solvency respect for conscience rights independence federalism and economic growth values every person of faith should appreciate photo credit public domain
