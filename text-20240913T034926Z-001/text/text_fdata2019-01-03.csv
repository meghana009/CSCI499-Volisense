by ambrose evans pritchard the telegraph london wednesday january 2 2019 to be charitable you could say the euro has proved itself merely by surviving until its 20th birthday this january that is a low bar monetary union has otherwise failed as an economic and political endeavour the evidence of europe s lost decade is that it can be made to work only under a regime of technocrat caesaropapism that is to say by stripping elected parliaments of their lifeblood control over taxation spending and the core economic policies of the nation state one day the house of cards will collapse says professor otmar issing the founding chief economist of the european central bank and the chastened prophet of the euro project dispatch continues below advertisement buy sell or store precious metals

of economics has assembled package of papers by illuminati from europe and north america to mark this week s anniversary published by the journal comparative political studies mark copelovitch jeffry frieden and stefanie walter do not pull their punches in the prologue the calamitous european monetary union saga has led to the most serious economic crisis in the history of the european union it has done more lasting damage to swaths of europe than the great depression of the 1930s and has pitted eurozone states against each other in a bitter struggle for control over the levers of policy the political dynamics have become poisonous years of rolling crisis entrenched and amplified the power and influence of creditor countries such as germany working through the european central bank and the european council in other words eu bodies became debt collectors for the creditor bloc and enforcers of a german imposed strategy of debt deflation and fiscal contraction the burden of adjustment fell on the weaker states leading to a contractionary bias for the whole system the nobel fraternity have watched this display of pre modern and pre keynesian illiteracy with a mixture of horror and despair yet nothing is actually changing there has been no truth and reconciliation to probe the disaster that was allowed to unfold those in control of the eu machinery still think they were right the ideology prevails the london school of economics papers said eu leaders have responded at every stage with half measures in a sequential cycle of piecemeal reform just enough to stop the collapse of emu without resolving the core deformities of an orphan currency with no fiscal union to back it up what is clear is that the status quo cannot persist indefinitely if the euro is to survive in the long term it said i would argue that the spectacle of an eu in such a shambles from 2010 to 2015 led directly to brexit it profoundly shook the moral prestige of the eu and demolished claims of economic competence while eu leaders quibbled over decimal points and debt repayment in brussels youth jobless rates reached 57 percent in greece 56 percent in spain and much the same across italy s mezzogiorno these were levels once unthinkable in a modern developed democracy they have left a wreckage of labour hysteresis that will lower economic speed limits for a generation to come several hundred thousand economic refugees came to work in britain from the emu depression belt a further wave from eastern europe came to the uk instead of going to the eurozone as they would have done in normal times the double surge had maximum impact just before the referendum more subtly the euro crisis revealed that the pathologies of monetary union cannot be managed by normal democratic means the elected prime ministers of greece and italy were toppled in 2010 and 2011 and replaced by eu functionaries in soft coups organized by brussels and the pro emu vested interests of each country the ecb switched off liquidity support for greek commercial banks in 2015 knowingly and illegally precipitating a banking collapse that was hard to reconcile with the ecb s treaty duty to uphold financial stability when push come to shove the reflex was authoritarian it spoke to the character of the eu that i why i voted for brexit the london school of economics says the euro crisis was predictable and was in fact widely predicted it mimicked countless episodes in latin america east asia and other emerging markets where debtors borrowed heavily in dollars they could not print the pattern is for countries to succumb to credit booms while money is loose and the carry trade is in full bloom they spiral into busts when confidence evaporates and the capital flows dry up this is the classic sudden stop faced by states that do not borrow in their own currency europe s elites imagined that current account deficits did not matter in the magical euro union even though the deficit states in southern europe and ireland had lost their sovereign policy instruments and no longer had a lender of last resort behind them they were therefore no different from argentina or thailand the elites also failed to grasp that fixed exchange rate systems without full fiscal union switch currency risk into default risk the rating agencies also missed this elephant in the room and so did the international monetary fund as it confessed later in its devastating mea culpa ideological capture drained everybody of their senses the illusion that monetary union was risk free led to epic bubbles made worse by a one size fits all interest rate set for german needs when germany was in trouble when the storm hit the berlin frankfurt brussels riposte was to misrepresent what was in essence as a cross border banking and capital flow crisis as if it were caused by fiscal profligacy in the south this became the morality tale version of emu it lives on in the policy structure it was and is fundamentally bogus except for greece under new democracy but it served the interests of northern creditors prof issing says the rescue of greece in 2010 was in fact a bailout for french and german banks the imf has admitted that the country was in effect sacrificed to save the euro and the european banking system at a delicate moment yes the south was naive nations feasted on the windfall of lower interest rates they let unit labour costs ratchet up even as germany was ratcheting them down through the hartz vi wage squeeze in what was objectively if not intentionally a beggar thy neighbour policy they forgot that they cannot devalue their way back to exchange rate equilibrium the eu s cardinal error was to then try to force the high debt states to claw back 20 or 30 percent lost labour competitiveness against germany through internal devaluations a euphemism for slashing demand this was self defeating even on its own crude terms it shrank the economic base and drove up debt ratios faster through the denominator effect the london school of economics says the result of so much damage is that the eurozone s troubles today appear disturbingly similar to those of japan trapped in deflationary stagnation for 20 years with broken banks except that euroland is not japan it is not a cohesive society with a monetary and fiscal machinery working in harmony europe s debt problems look even more serious and threatening the lse said debt to gdp ratios in a string of vulnerable countries are far closer to the danger line now they were at the onset of the global financial crisis a decade ago up from 68 to 125 percent in portugal 36 to 98 percent in spain 99 to 131 percent in italy 65 to 99 percent in france 54 to 96 percent in cyprus and 103 to 176 percent in greece despite haircuts a weaker euro interest rates of minus 0 4 percent quantitative easing six years too late and a belated end to fiscal austerity did induce a modest cyclical recovery from 2015 to 2017 but it is not self sustaining and is already petering out the eurozone risks crashing into the next global downturn with no defences rates cannot drop any lower there is no proper banking union with pan emu deposit insurance the dangers of a sovereign bank doom loop remain they are on full display again in italy emmanuel macron s grand plan to rebuild emu on safer foundations has come to nothing there is no fiscal entity worth the name counter cyclical budget stimulus to fight shocks is prohibited by the machinery of the stability pact and fiscal compact the ecb is still unable to act as a full lender of last resort berlin has written a debt brake into the german constitution a way of telling the world that it will not take any serious steps to reduce a current account surplus of 8 percent of gdp a much greater threat to emu survival than anything happening in greece the lse team takes a long view comparing the eurozone s travails to struggles between alexander hamilton and thomas jefferson over the handling of state debts in the united states the battle saw disputes over the first and second national banks and lasted until the completion of u s monetary union in the 1870s and took a civil war to resolve crafting a functioning economic and monetary union is a long hard road the lse said the presumption is that the europe s leaders must in the end agree to some form of fiscal union but this runs into the fundamental barrier of democracy such a system would eviscerate the tax and spending prerogatives of elected parliaments forgetting the lessons of the english civil war and indeed the american revolution it can retain democratic legitimacy only if the eu goes the whole way to a supranational federal union akin to the united states and for this there is not the slightest popular support in any major country the ineluctable conclusion is that a monetary union of budgetary sovereign states cannot be made to work and should not be made to work the euro is a constitutional anomaly it must therefore be broken up all else is self deception help keep gata going gata is a civil rights and educational organization based in the united states and tax exempt under the u s

this report will show how markets are developing the same characteristics as they developed in the 2015 2016 period when the big five global central banks last tried to tighten monetary policy it will compare and contrast the behavior of each major asset class to the same time in 2015 2016 when central banks last attempted synchronized tightening policy the chart below shows the macro picture of global liquidity the chart clearing shows that in late 2014 the four largest central banks met and decided on a policy of monetary tightening the major points of interest are the bank of england stopped accumulating assets completely the usa also stopped accumulating assets and in 2018 began letting them roll off return to cash and so reduced its balance sheet of assets the european central bank and the bank of japan followed the same course as the others however after markets in both countries began collapsing asset purchases started again and in japan accelerated from previous levels the chart above comes from robert p balan and his pam service that i thoroughly recommend and subscribe to when one talks of asset purchases it means buying paper assets such as long dated public and corporate debt bonds and mortgages we are not talking about investment or construction of real productive assets such as factories infrastructure and schools there is no asset creation going on just asset price inflation as the paper is bid up by a buyer with very deep pockets the aim of central bank policy is to benefit its constituency commercial banks and the financial sector by quantitative easing that inflates the market for mortgages and hence real estate prices stocks and bonds held overwhelmingly by the top one percent this increases asset prices not wages or consumer prices obliging the 99 percent to pay for these higher priced assets squeezes most household budgets and deflates consumer spending in the production and consumption economy source hudson michael j is for junk economics a guide to reality in an age of deception islet verlag kindle edition so what happened to asset markets in 2015 2016 when the last tectonic shift in central bank policy took place the charts below illustrate this world stock markets dove in unison and did not climb again until central bank liquidity from japan and europe resumed the acceleration in japanese liquidity made up for the cessation in the us and the uk world gdp sank gdp is a measure of transactions in an economy over a given period if there is less money around there will be fewer transactions and therefore a lower gdp crude oil dbo price dropped from over 100 per barrel to as low as 35 at present oil has fallen from 85 to 44 could 35 be seen again if at the next meeting of world central banks they decide to resume asset purchases a resurgence could be seen though there is a more likely scenario that i will outline at the conclusion of this article when liquidity levels drop there are fewer transactions less income less economic activity and therefore less requirement for energy of which oil forms the largest component gold gld sank as well even this safe haven asset was no refuge in 2016 and is unlikely to be in 2019 when the central banks take away their support then all assets fall no matter the type less liquidity means asset price deflation more liquidity means asset price inflation bond bnd yields fell and face values rose and are doing so again major world currencies the euro fxe fell in value and is doing so again but this time from a lower level than before the usd uup rose and is doing so again and is one bright spot where one can take refuge and preserve wealth and gains the yen fxy gained strength and appears to be trending that way again there is a support resistance line at 100 and then at 80 if the former is broken the gbp fxb belonging to one of the worst run economies in the world fell after 2015 into 2017 and looks to be carrying out a repeat performance from lower levels as per the euro for the usd basket dxy to rise most of the other currencies in the basket must fall and the euro and gbp are part of the losing side of that basket the swiss franc fxf remained neutral throughout the coming and going of the central bank liquidity tide an island in the storm the aud fxa follows the pattern for the gbp and euro and is now likely to fall further as global liquidity recedes the chinese yuan cyb lost strength last time and looks to be starting this trend again this is a pegged currency artificially managed and will be whatever the government says it will be so long as it has foreign currency reserves to give out to manage the level that it wants with trillions of forex reserves on hand there is no immediate threat of an unwanted currency movement what happens next there appears now a consensus that global central bank liquidity should be reined in and normalized the definition of normal appears to be whatever the levels were before the global financial crisis gfc this means no asset purchases and higher interest rates in the absence of national fiscal spending in the sense of keynesian counter recessionary spending such as after the great recession in 1929 the world central banks have become a proxy for this unlike a national government that spends on education healthcare and infrastructure assets the public purpose such as the roosevelt new deal policies central bank spending is limited to paper asset purchases that do not add productive capacity to the economy or make any real improvement to real assets until there is a policy change at the world central bank level investors can expect falling asset markets with practically no safe haven except for the usd and swiss franc and perhaps the yen if the central banks now withdraw it leaves only national governments to provide liquidity by deficit spending with the prevailing worldwide austerity bias it is unlikely this will occur a requisition for instance for a half million houses would not have seemed more difficult to comply with than those we were already in process of executing for 100 000 airplanes or 20 000 guns or 2 000 000 tons of projectiles but a new set of conditions began to rule from 11 oâ clock onwards the money cost which had never been considered by us to be a factor capable of limiting the supply of the armies asserted a claim to priority from the moment the fighting stopped source churchill winston the world crisis the aftermath 1929 11 oâ clock was on november 11 1918 when the peace was declared after wwi nothing has changed this then leads inevitably to the following chain of events
transferwise is an international money transfer service founded by taavet hinrikus and kristo käärmann they developed it after their personal experiences in how difficult and costly it is for people whose livelihood requires constant conversion of cash from one currency to another they launched the online company in 2011 since then transferwise has grown to have more than 4 million customers all over the world who send billions of dollars per month it s especially beneficial for freelancers and remote workers whose employers pay them through a different currency than what they use to pay their mortgage or other expenses before you sign up for the service it s best to read this transferwise review so you know if it suits your needs additionally here are some things that you must know before you use the platform 5 things you need to know before using transferwise 1 it s a revolutionary system transferwise can afford to implement cheaper rates than those of banks and other money transfer services because of its unique arrangement it starts with the company allocating massive stores of various currencies globally then when you exchange say 1500 united states dollars usd to australian dollars aud the money does not need to be moved physically what they do is they add your money to their american dollar pool and pay the recipient the equivalent amount in aud from their local cash pot this way they remove the processes that make traditional transfers lengthy and cut the costly middlemen to provide a better exchange rate to its users 2 it has a very user friendly interface the website of the online money transfer service makes it very easy to pay someone from another country all you need to do is to log in on the site choose the currency you re using and the currency that your recipient is expecting and type in the amount you ll be sending next you choose how to fund the transfer either through your bank account credit card or other options such as android pay or apple pay to complete the transaction 3 it supports several major currencies transferwise supports most major currencies the only difference for some countries is that they can only send payments to or from private individuals not businesses like in brazil here are some of the currencies that you can send money to and receive money from aud australian dollar cad canadian dollar chf swiss franc dkk danish krone eur euro gbp pounds sterling huf hungarian forint jpy japanese yen nok norwegian krone nzd new zealand dollar rub russian ruble sek swedish krona sgd singapore dollar usd united states dollar meanwhile for places such as the uae chile china colombia georgia indonesia south korea mexico the philippines thailand and vietnam the service can only course payments for their respective currencies through local banks if you re from these countries it s likely that your local bank will charge you with a transfer fee if you need to send money to the philippines you can benefit from online platforms such as compareremit which allows you to compare the best dollar to peso exchange rates from different companies in real time 4 it uses real exchange rates aside from lower fees caused by the elimination of unnecessary processes for international transfers transferwise also gives its users higher value for their money by using real exchange rates otherwise known as the mid market rate these are the numbers that you get when you convert an amount from one currency to another using google often banks add a markup to the mid market rate and keep the difference 5 it does not have a standard delivery date while the service aims to transfer money as quickly as possible various elements affect the length of time involved in sending the payment and receiving it these are the four significant factors that influence your money s delivery date the cities or countries you re sending to and from the payment method you chose the time you completed the transaction security checks conducted by local banks most transfers to europe that are made in the uk is completed within a business day it would also take about one business day to transfer money into a swiss bank account whereas russian bank accounts receive the payment after three working days conclusion the rise of online services has caused people to be vigilant about scams especially when it comes to financial matters concerns about the safety and security of transferwise transactions are understandable you can be assured that transferwise is safe because the company is registered with the uk financial conduct authority fca which regulates finance firms and ensures customer protection read also author sarah morris
editor s note seeking alpha is proud to welcome cashflow capitalist as a new contributor it s easy to become a seeking alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas active contributors also get free access to the sa pro archive click here to find out more â ray dalio billionaire founder of one of the world s largest hedge funds bridgewater associates provides a thoroughly researched and agonizingly cogent explanation of credit cycles in his book titled principles for navigating big debt crises since our debt in america is denominated in our own currency the next debt crisis is almost certain to be a deflationary one says dalio and in such crises central banks try to offset deflationary pressures with the inflationary act of lowering interest rates this may work for a while many decades even but when interest rates reach about 0 percent that lever is no longer an effective way to stimulate the economy policy makers try to deal with the crisis through strategic debt restructuring and because incomes and thus tax revenues are falling austerity measures in this phase debt burdens debt and debt service as a percent of income rise because incomes fall faster than restructuring debt paydowns reduce the debt stock and many borrowers are required to rack up still more debts to cover those higher interest costs big debt crises pt 1 p 15 when interest rates have no more downside room central banks inject liquidity into the financial system via digital money printing given the equivocatory name of quantitative easing in an attempt to revive inflation the idea is that the central banks buying of debt assets both treasuries e g the ishares core u s treasury bond etf govt and toxic assets like mortgage backed securities e g the ishares mbs etf will induce banks to lend investors to invest and savers to spend but it turns out that inflation in terms of the consumer price index only results if qe is dispersed in large quantities those whose debt assets were purchased by the central bank go on to buy other financial assets so there must be very large market gains before any money trickles down into spending bdc pt 1 p 36 and this wealth effect from qe is only experienced by a fraction of the population nyu economist edward wolff demonstrates that as of 2016 the richest 10 of american households own 84 of stocks while only 27 of the middle class own significant stock holdings 10 000 or more 94 of the rich do this may partly explain why luxury goods inflation is hitting 6 while consumer price inflation struggles to hit the fed s 2 target will the real depression please stand up dalio refers to the great recession of 2008 2009 as a depression and said in 2014 that the u s is in the midst of a beautiful deleveraging but would the great recession qualify as a depression according to his theory dalio says that depressions happen only after interest rates have been reduced to zero extensive qe has been implemented and substantial deleveraging occurs was that the case in the wake of the great recession not really monetary policy makers had not yet exhausted their tools they were able to drop interest rates by a little more than 5 roughly the same amount as rates were dropped in 1990 1992 and 2001 2003 they also significantly ramped up the fed s balance sheet from less than 1 trillion to 4 5 trillion a 3 8 trillion increase but what about deleveraging surely with all the pain of the great recession substantial and lasting deleveraging occurred at least somewhere right well it certainly didn t manifest in the public sector either in total dollars or as a percent of gdp according to mainstream predominantly keynesian economists we should see government debt spike during recessions as automatic stabilizers kick in to maintain a base level of consumer spending even as tax revenues fall however the acceleration of fiscal deficits much less the lack of deleveraging even ten years into an economic expansion defies any economic theory what about on the consumers side we did indeed see some deleveraging of mortgage auto and credit card debt during the recession that was promptly reversed around the time the second iteration of qe began in 2010 total mortgage auto and credit card debt are all higher than they were going into the great recession in 2008 and delinquency rates are inching up for all three as well given the lack of sustained deleveraging in other areas related to the consumer it should go without saying that student debt almost entirely under the control of the federal government has likewise seen no deleveraging what about on the corporate side contrary to what one might think the u s saw no net deleveraging of corporate debt during or after the great recession you might object that total corporate debt matters less than debt to earnings or total debt as a percentage of gdp and you would be right corporate debt as a percentage of gdp did indeed fall during the great recession but it resumed its climb around the beginning of qe2 and now sits as high or a little higher than in 2008 as one last example of the lack of lasting deleveraging take margin debt which is higher than in both 2000 or 2008 on a total basis as well as a percentage of gdp admittedly current margin debt of 3 does not quite rival the excess seen in the stock market boom leading up to the great depression given that the broker loan market reached 8 549 billion in 1929 and u s gdp stood around 105 billion in the same year peak margin debt prior to the great depression reached 8 14 of gdp but it is now as high as it has been since then objection what about total debt to gdp one might object that while many forms of debt have increased since the great recession total debt to gdp has actually declined dalio contends that the u s is in the midst of a beautiful deleveraging and shows this chart as proof how could this be given that both public debt and corporate debt as a percentage of gdp have risen since 2008 first as it pertains to debt service it s necessary to remember that since 2009 we ve had eight years of near zero interest rates with rates being held low for that long it s not surprising to see the interest burden fall even as total debt remains elevated and what explains the moderating total debt level the main reason is that the housing bubble popped but there are specific reasons why a housing bubble was inflated in the united states and those reasons have largely been dealt with for instance there is no longer a political push for every american to own a home like there was in the 2000s nor is it as easy now as it was then to originate loans to individuals who had no business taking on a mortgage nor lastly are fannie and freddie buying as many subprime or otherwise risky loans now as they were then if you adjust for the anomaly of excessive mortgage debt in the early to late 2000s then the peak in debt to gdp which hit in 2009 2010 disappears likewise though credit card debt is higher today than in 2008 it has fallen somewhat as a percentage of gdp notice however that it leveled off in 2014 and began climbing slightly by 2016 if credit card debt continues to climb as gdp growth slows as it is expected to in the coming years then revolving credit to gdp could easily rise back to its previous highs in the early and late 2000s if the big debt crisis the worst depression of our lifetimes has already passed us shouldn t there have been a bit more deleveraging than that will the next recession be the real depression with the sort of debt situation we find ourselves in here in the u s not to mention that much of the world is even more indebted than we are it s difficult to see how the big one has already come and gone shouldn t a beautiful deleveraging involve more well deleveraging the lack of substantial deleveraging combined with the fact that the federal reserve hadn t quite run out of monetary policy tools in 2008 leads me to believe that the big one the debt crisis which will leave no option but to painfully deleverage has not yet hit us with another recession on the horizon 4 trillion still on the books of the fed and the fed funds rate sitting at 2 5 and widely expected to stay there in 2019 it sure looks like monetary policy makers have run out of fuel source studebaker studio with this in mind it s reasonable to conclude that the big debt crisis the culmination of the long term debt cycle has not yet come it s still lurking in the shadows of the near future as bad as the great recession was we will likely experience something worse the next time around and the next time is looking closer and closer

slowing iphone sales in china sparking fresh concerns over the fallout from the sino u s trade war ahead of the u s earnings season we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration particularly in greater china apple chief executive office tim cook said this provides solid evidence of how slowing economic growth and a trade war make the best death cocktail for sentiment said naeem aslam chief market analyst at think markets uk ltd in london the warning from apple whose stock is a member of all the three major indexes is a gloomy omen for wall street bulls hoping for an

there is a chinese curse which says may we live in interesting times like it or not we live in interesting times they are times of danger and uncertainty but they are also the most creative of any time in the history of mankind while it would be reasonable to date this quote to 2018 it is actually taken from a 1966 speech delivered by robert f kennedy at the university of capetown although more than 50 years old it rings as true today as it did then almost daily we are met with a barrage of headlines highlighting economic and political uncertainty stemming from trade wars rising inequality migrant flows nationalism populism and enormous environmental challenges yet we re also in an era of unprecedented innovation in domains from agriculture to biotechnology and alternative energies last year i noted the world feels fragile chaotic and full of conflicting realities ambiguity reigns and radical uncertainty is lurking behind every decision this seems as true today as it did a year ago just think of the events that transpired in 2018 while america and china continued to escalate the tariff driven trade war nafta 2 0 helped avoid a north american economic conflict across the atlantic brexit negotiations followed an unsurprisingly nonlinear path and italy fought its own economic battles with europe and many stock markets had their worst performance since the global financial crisis 2018 also saw leadership changes in brazil mexico colombia peru south africa and pakistan to name a few as well as at vodafone pepsico unilever wpp deutsche bank nissan and general electric and in contrast to otherwise ubiquitous change both china and russia escalated their leaders into seemingly permanent positions wildfires raged in california indonesia suffered devastating earthquakes and hawaii s kilauea volcano s 35 year continuous eruption ended so what is one to do when facing a world of fluid relationships that seem to lack any resemblance to stability how are we to make decisions in such an environment while there is definitively no correct answer to these questions my approach has been to focus on structural dynamics the approaches seems at least marginally more helpful than my ouija board and magic 8 ball long term trends underlying today s cross currents offer a compass that can help guide us through the turbulence of today s headlines scenarios can help us map possible futures but unlike others who tend to make predictions on a one year view i opt for a longer time horizon believing that time allows signals to surface amidst the deafening noise in 2015 i made 15 predictions for 15 20 and in 2016 i pointed to 16 global developments to watch between 2016 and 2021 in 2017 i wrote about the 17 developments to watch over the 2017 2022 timeframe and last year i presented 18 happenings that might transpire between 2018 and 2023 regardless of how the predictions actually fare the very act of considering them has proven helpful to me in navigating uncertainty

to understand the phenomenon gilets jaunes we may start from some background facts the background study will show us why this phenomenon is complex we shall also see how far the opposition of daniel cohn bendit one leading person of 1968 rebellion is correct and we must see why prof alain badiou distanced himself from this movement because alain badiou is one of the very few of french academicians who even recently defended mao and the cultural revolution readers can find his recent interview here and latest book here and his points of criticism are very interesting but why we cannot agree with cohn bendit at all and why we may request prof badiou a rethink for that we shall have to see the whole see various colours of the gilets jaunes spectrum which will lead us to some probable inferences background we all know now that yellow vests gilets jaunes are compulsory for all motorists in france now only one year ago 12 oct 2017 there was a provocative heading in le figaro though some what exaggerated in paris car is already an endangered species according to 2011 figures published by insee institut national de la statistique et des études économiques le figaro showed among active population in paris only 12 3 use cars and 4 5 use motor bikes whereas 64 8 avail public transport 4 2 use bicycles and 9 5 walk there are metrorail and or trams in a dozen or so bigger cities of france even dwellers of many banlieues or suburbs of paris have more or less good metro connectivity near their neighbourhoods using car is more provincial in the provinces lesser towns and etc the picture is more than reverse 77 9 use cars 1 6 use motor bikes whereas only 7 6 use public transport 1 9 use bicycles and 6 1 walk but 10 bigger cities accommodate only some 10 of the population or less in provinces a motor vehicle is almost a must there are places where public transport bus is available only twice a day before their protest started one of the spokesperson of gilets jaunes eric drouet said the first bakery next to my house is 5 km away i have to take the road nora bensaâdoune aptly headlined her piece in the guardian 12 dec 2018 if you want to understand the gilets jaunes get out of paris and this frane 2018 is much different from france 68 in many aspects to note a few in 1970 about 27 of the active population were in secondary sector industry manufacture plus about 10 in construction jobs whereas about 12 were in agriculture and about 53 in tertiary sectors including those in rail road marine transports and communication in 2014 only about 12 of the work forces were in industry about 7 in construction only about 2 3 in agriculture the rest about 77 were in service sector including transport and communication though persons of these sectors are not geographically equally distributed over the country we can guess the sectoral composition of provincial populace and today a very little part of the workers and employees only about 8 are union members this figure was nearly 30 in the 1950s a huge fall in trade union density moreover as a capitalist society france is also a very unequal society though might be a little less unequal than some other rich or developed countries according to 2014 data bottom half 50 of the population has only 6 3 of total wealth averaging 25 500 only per adult which can buy them a new toyota corolla or volkswagen if they put all their wealth together but then only about 3 4 thousand will remain with them this poorest 50 earn less than29 of the total income next higher 40 of the population has only 38 4 of the total wealth all their fortune i e 193 000 per adult put together can get them at maximum a 300 sq ft yes three hundred square feet only apartment at outer paris this middle 40 population nearly 45 of the total income the top 10 population has 54 5 of the wealth averaging 1 097 000 per adult and they also earn 26 of the total income index mundi site and numbeo from these data we can guess who can afford car who can afford housing in large cities and previously we saw who are compelled to have a car statistia website gives car ownership picture of france 2017 table 1 car ownership in france 2017 number of cars per household number of households of total households no car 5 853 000 11 16 1 car 24 685 000 47 07 2 cars 18 038 000 34 40 3 cars 3 864 000 7 37 total 52 440 000 100 00 then there is yet another evil aspect of capitalism unemployment after the 2008 crisis total unemployment crossed 9 and stayed above 9 since then sometimes rising above 10 too but the future of the future generation is bleaker for young ones with age 15 24 years unemployment was lowest just before the crisis at 18 3 and since then it is always more than 22 sometimes almost touching 25 some sources citing oecd figures put it at 28 therefore now at least 1 75 million or so nearly one in every four young french of age 15 24 are unemployed now being a colonialist imperialist power france had migrants from ex colonies and france also once indirectly received migrants for exploiting them as cheap labour in his very popular number lettre à la république the black rapper kerry james says you chose to tie your past with us now you must take responsibility during 1968 uprising we saw how the workers students action committees translated their publication into several languages for agitation propaganda among migrant workers there were leaflets specifically for migrant labourers too in recent years the libyan syrian sudanese etc crisis caused additional influx according to international migration portal in 2017 already 12 2 of the population in france are international migrants almost one person in every eight they number 7 9 million with an influx of additional 337 000 or one third of a million migrants in 2017 if second generation or older migrants are counted then their number will be much higher in early 2018 calais saw an ugly armed clash between afghan migrants and african migrants with dozens hospitalised with critical injuries lastly let us read a rather long quote from the website of europe solidaire sans frontières this year the price of diesel has increased by 23 percent and petrol by 14 percent due to the jump in the price of a barrel of oil in addition the government has recently announced that diesel and petrol prices will increase further by four and seven cents a litre respectively immediately upon reaching office macron abolished the solidarity wealth tax isf giving 4 billion to the richest and has strengthened the tax credit for solidarity and employment cice a tax cut and exemption program transferring 41 billion a year to french companies including multinationals shortly afterwards with the 2018 budget bill macron established a flat tax that allowed a lowering of taxation on capital handing another 10 billion to the richest at the same time the government has increased the general social contribution csg income tax to be paid by pensioners while pensions themselves have ceased to be indexed to inflation and thus to retirees ability to buy consumer goods it has got rid of the subsidized contracts which allowed large numbers to work on contracts partly financed by public bodies and lowered by five euros a month the amount of housing contributions apl for the most disadvantaged the por rich character of the present regime of president macron is very clearly visible to the french in this situation if some revolt occurs how might be the character of that for this we need to explore the social political climate of france and also the political climate change during say past 50 years to stay very brief we may only travel through voting figures of some years in 1962 national assembly elections the gaullists got 31 9 votes and in cases where 2nd round happened they got 40 36 votes the communist party pcf got 21 84 in first round and 20 94 in seconds which were indeed respectable figures but in 1965 presidential elections pcf did not put its candidate rather supported mitterrand who got 31 72 in first round and 44 80 in second against de gaulle who got 44 65 in first and 55 20 in second round to win in the 1969 presidential election after that great 1968 upheaval and after all the pcf had done had not done had undone pcf dared to participate and got 21 27 votes in the first round slightly missing to get second in the race which the democratic centre candidate got with 23 31 vote share in the second round the democratic centre candidate alain poher got 41 8 losing to gaullist candidate mr pompidou who scored 58 2 in the assembly election of 1968 that happened just after the 68 may events pcf got more than 20 votes anyway those days are gone in the 2017 presidential race pcf did not dream of putting a candidate and supported mr mélenchon of la france insoumise he got 19 6 votes in first round and the new anti capitalist party candidate with lutte ouvrière got some 1 7 lagging behind the gaullist candidate mr fillion 20 20 mme le pen 21 3 and president macron 24 0 who did not hesitate to label himself openly as more of right than centrist therefore the votes left got was almost equal to vote got by mme le pen incidentally mme le pen came third in the first round of 2012 presidential race surprising many observers bagging 17 9 votes this time she bagged 3 9 more to become second only 2 7 less than mr macron in the first round in the second round mr macron got 66 1 and mme le pen got 33 9 of valid votes parliament or national assembly election took place on the next month in the 2017 assembly election pcf got only 2 72 and 1 20 in first and second round respectively lfi la france insoumise headed by mr mélenchon a european parliament mp got 11 43 in first round and where second round needed got 4 86 madame le pen s party well known as a party with fascist leaning got little bit less the combined vote of lfi and pcf in terms of votes and also a little less in absolute number of votes so overall the parliamentary political spectrum had shifted already to right to far right fascist direction add with this falling trade union density i e tu members divided by number of workers and employees ipsos france the market research company that worked with detail election stat gave some more disturbing news among blue collar workers the anti capitalists got 4 and lfi got 24 whereas mme le pen got 37 among whitecollar workers anti caps got 4 lfi 22 whereas mme le pen got 32 there were indeed several mobilisations and movements much militant and combative in nature in the last 25 years but this militancy is rather a very french thing barricades fires here and there molotov cocktails upturned cars set ablaze and so on are not very unnatural to the french spontaneous revolt without call of any party is also not new in recent past there was the famous nuit debout movement that cropped up without any call from any political party and what we saw weresmall compared to may 1968 or perhaps even workers protests in 1990s time magazine once made a headline in 2009 why the french love to strike but those could not contribute to building up a strong revolutionary political opposition in the long run for example nuit deboutorganiser françois ruffin formed a party named picardie debout pd he is now the only pd deputy in the national assembly from somme s first constituency beating candidate from macron s party receiving 55 97 votes in the second round mr ruffin and his party are very much in the gilets jaunes as well as mélenchon and his lfi by the way total vote cast in the presidential election was 77 8 in first and 74 6 in second round and in the second round 11 5 were blank null votes incidentally as per mr žižek s analysis before that presidential election one cannot choose in between mr macron and mme le pen for him both are practically same in danger level count while we take a stock of political climate change in a country or region it is customary and also imperative to take into account that political climate change in the global level but for the sake of brevity let us only list a few vital aspects a post wrold war 2 development of euro communist parties of west europe and its stagnation during before 1970s rightward opportunist tendencies setback b soviet losing appeal rather becoming very much questionable to say the least after hungary and czech episodes to name a few c but still in the late sixties and early seventies there was an anti imperialist tide particularly in case of vietnam liberation war and also ongoing liberation wars in many third world countries d the china cultural revolution mao phenomena had a worldwide appeal to some extent also in west europe those days were different suppose there was a sartre openly distributing his political journal in paris with mao s photo on it the autonomia movement rocked italy there were new mlm parties coming up in many countries e but in the post mao period many complexities arose be that the vietnam kampuchea war be that change of line in chinese leadership and etcetera f fall of the soviet and east european regimes led to or went hand in hand with dismantling of the welfare state mechanisms in west g feasibility of socialist states and all related things of actually existing socialisms like party state centralised control hierarchy and etc very much questionable to say the least h the communists groups almost worldwide except a very few number of smaller countries failed to become a real alternative in terms of mass support i as a result socialism revolution lost the aura which was comparatively much stronger 50 years ago and lastly j rise of far right nationalist or fascist forces in various countries also in europe in the post liberalisation era it is complicated the grey shades therefore in this political climate and socio economic settings can it be imagined what might be the characteristics of a social eruption that was not called or organised by some political party we know from the onset gilets jaunes move was supported by picarde debout france insoumise as well as by mme le pen s party rassemblement national or rn take somme there in the first constituency pd candidate won beating macron s candidate 19 329 votes against 15 205 votes from 1962 onwards this constituency elected either communist party pcf of socialist party ps as deputy in the second constituency lfi candidate lost to macron s candidate 11 053 votes against 17 948 votes adding up we get lefts got 30 382 votes almost 48 combining and rights got 33 153 votes almost 52 here in somme a strange thing happened in the very beginning phase of the gilets jaunes movement on 20 nov gilets jaunes on a road intercepted a container carriage suspecting some sound coming from inside and yes there were six illegal migrants clandestinely coming from belgium end and they had been handed over to police this shocking event was cited by the leader of the largest trade union cgt pro pcf in the first week of the movement as one of the reasons why the cgt was not giving a call of convergence of fight with the gilets jaunes leaving aside their other sectarian characteristics including suspicion to peoples spontaneous movement even if we forget all what they did in 1968 now consider 5 of the 40 42 revendications or demands of the gilets jaunes which are mentioned in last subsection of this article those which were related to migrants same job same salary for everybody working in france no detached work for migrants treat the causes of migration immigration otherwise people when much troubled will migrate from their country that asylum seekers should be treated well we owe them housing security food and education the asylum seekers who are rejected may go back real integration policy for asylum seekers with french language education history civics etc courses here if somebody give more emphasis on 2 4 and to some extent 5 asylum seekers must integrate and become really french than on 1 and 3 citing the significance of 4 then gilets jaunes charter may be called anti migrant then consider a provocative heading in the far right islamophobic website of résistance républicaine the rassemblementnational fr the le penists who are supporters of the movement on 19 nov gilets jaunes maisoùétaientdonc les musulmans le 17 novembre meaning gilet jaunes but where were the muslims on 17 nov start date of gilet jaunes but these are not all one national spokesman out of eight of the gilet jaunes mr christophe chalençonon 3 dec in a tv interview reaffirmed the gilets jaunes slogan macron resign and declared his support for general edouard philippe the general who resigned following differences with macron as the new president as alice in the wonderland thought things are becoming curiouser and curiouser we may add another sample incident a new charter of demands of the gilets jaunes started circulating in december second week which contained some clauses that would make mme le pen happy no 9 frexit sortie de l ue afin de regagner nos souverainetés politique monétaire et économique regagner notre droit de battre monnaie that essentiallymeant france s exit fromeurozone to reaginsovereignty mintingowncurrency franc no 22 otan sortie immédiate du traité de l atlantique nord et interdiction d engager l armée française dans des guerres d agression that essentially meant immediate exit from nato and pulling out of wars or aggression which are us led no 24 immigration empêcher les flux migratoires impossibles à accueillir ni à intégrer étant donné la profonde crise civilisationnelle que nous vivons that essentially meant given the profound crisis of civilisation in which we are living stop immigrant inflow all these were enough for one of the leaders of the 68 uprising and now one of the advisers of president macron mr daniel cohn bendit to label the movement as dangerous he explained his opposition to the observer in no hesitant term i hear people from la france insoumise hard left talking about this being a great people s revolt but these are the same ordinary people who pushed trump into power we saw in germany in 1933 what ordinary people did not all ordinary people are good it s not an accident that this movement has proposed general de villiers as an alternative leader then and nobody in 68 made death threats against those who want to talk all those on the left thinking this is a leftwing revolution are wrong it s veering to the right to hear that gilets jaunes who want to negotiate are receiving death threats is evidence of this authoritarian right this movement is very different to may 68 back then we wanted to get rid of a general charles de gaulle today these people want to put a general in power lastly he added to the gilets jaunes i say if the movement becomes more violent all that will happen is more capitalism not less there comes a moment when violence becomes counter productive i realise it s not all the gilets jaunes but when we see macron s car being banged on and spat at when we see written on the arc de triomphe fuck your old woman not us in this age of metoo we need to stop and think is this what we want just because it s a social movement doesn t mean anything is allowed well but sadly mr cohn bendit did not look at many other types of incidents of the same gilets jaunes movement and pronounced a verdict based on only very partial info as we shall see we may also note here the criticism of prof alain badou though we did not get any direct source other than one given by edicijajugoslavija on 12 dec in their facebook page referring to the event alain badiou le nommé migrant un prolétairenomade public hosted by maison de la poésie scène littéraire edicijajugoslavija wrote tonight in the house of poetry paris during the lecture the named migrant a nomadic proletarian alain badiou concluded on what finally makes him taking distance from yellow vests movement it could be resumed in 3 points 1 non alliance with nomadic proletarians named migrants 2 absence of universalistic demands in the movement which for him could be resumed the best in the name communism 3 omni presence of tricolor national flag as the generic emblem of the movement but there are other colours in the spectrum large section of the french society is feeling fed up not just now but for quite some time their pent up anger is to some extent getting expressed through this movement as we saw in a previous short article on this subject suppose how that small poultry farmer aloïs gury expressed himself why and how he joined the yellow vests read his story given at endnote we saw how persons with no experience in movement gave the wake up call by a petition by a facebook call to mobilise on a day to protest read how it all began at endnote slowly people with various political leanings came inside the movement be that a probable supporter ofright frank buhler whose videoappeal was viewed by 4 million be that eco socialist mp of euro parliament like mr mélenchon and then things snowballed many factory workers conveyed their support in opinion poll for instance see the opinion poll result published on 23 nov at thepsa valenciennes factoryis given in endnote in the country 70 or people are supporting gilets jaunes throughout the span of the movement here we shall see more examples of support from various layers and corners of the society these will also show how different sections of the people are perceiving the movement and are joining the movement open letter to our fellow citizens with or without yellow vest by the national secretariat of the peasant confederation published on 5 dec we fully share the demands on the purchasing power and fair distribution of the wealth that is expressed throughout the country on a daily basis we suffer the unequal sharing of the value produced in the sectors confiscated by the food industry and large retailers the income of the peasants thus remains dramatically low and the gaps widen further the peasant confederation has always fought the unrestrained competition brought by the various free trade agreements that ruin collective solidarities hinder the transformation of our agricultural and environmental model and prevent the deployment of quality food accessible to all precarisation of small rural communities departmental peasant confederations have joined or will join the movement of yellow vests these points of convergence are only growing as the encounters and debates on our territories unfold the national secretariat of the peasant confederation modef demands that the president of the republic listens to the people and the distress of the peasants and the rural world the union calls on its members to reach out to the yellow vests and also the events organized in the coming days to work towards the convergence of struggles in respect of property and dignity of each it is clear in his statement one week of planned event 5 dec farmers of fnsea national federation of farmers unions and ja young agriculturers which incidentally allow only farmers below 35 years to be members will express their dissatisfaction all next week in a distinct movement of yellow vests south rail and raillwaymen with yellow vests all on the street on december 8 the sud rail federation its members and its activists take note of the anger and citizen mobilization of the yellow vests which is gaining momentum in the country even if the trade union movement initially had fears partly based on the sometimes ambiguous nature of this movement presence of the extreme right support of a certain fringe of the employers it is clear that the movement of yellow vests corresponds above all to a popular movement for another distribution of wealth against the cost of living precariousness and for another vision of public services the increase in taxes on gasoline is only the catalyst of a deep bowl the sud rail federation joins and calls the rail workers in the mobilizations to come in particular that of saturday december 8 and makes available its union tool and its renewable national notice in progress to allow those who wish it to join the movement including under this modality in order to allow the yellow vests to be able to gather and to demonstrate in paris or in region the sud rail federation launches a citizen call to the whole of the railwaymen let s give the possibility to all the yellow vests to be able to borrow for free the national rail network that is owned by the people yellows greens and reds if all the angers converge the capitalists costs us much the committee truth justice foradamathe adama committee will join the next yellow jackets event on saturday december 1st a gathering under the banner neighbourhoods in yellow vests as the announcement of the event creates on facebook we too live in landlocked areas even near major urban centres we too living in working class neighbourhoods work most often in the most precarious sectors for poverty level wages we also sometimes have to take several hours to reach our workplaces in factories warehouses industrial cleaning or in the security sector to these social inequalities are added racism daily humiliation and police violence police violence that yellow vests are also facing today in their turn said the committee in a statement members also denounce the ultra liberal policy of macron against which the protesters will demonstrate again next saturday the adama committee therefore invites all inhabitants of lower income neighbourhoods to make common cause with yellow vests a way also to not leave the ground on the far right indeed several racist excesses have already tainted the movement we reaffirm our positions against racism inside the movement of yellow vests said the committee supported by the action anti fascist paris banlieue another organization that will participate in the march after the dec 1 action day a group of activists belonging to comitéadamaand some other organisations opened a fb event page gilets jaunes antiracistes and called people to join the 8 dec protest that fb page may be visited to see the discussions that took place yes you have to be yellow vests by elias d imzalène edito this movement does not belong to anyone our ghettoized and politically marginalized populations are the first victims of this desire of the elites to perpetuate the situation of the deprived classes in their social and political misery as such we are the most legitimate to carry in this revolt so let s not be afraid to embody our avant garde function that history imposes on us socialism has definitely given up the idea of opposing the rise of the liberalist vision of america and its loyalties it is therefore up to us muslim to re impulse an integral political protest of the american way of life we have to lie to fukuyama and prove to the world that the story is not over yet a very succinct portrayal of the movement and call came from an anti racist organisation named collectif rosa parks yellow vests with black gloves equality justice dignity or nothing 22 nov for yellow vests the bet is won this raw and unprecedented mobilization bears witness to the existence of deep discontent among the impoverished popular classes despised by ruling class and the elite it would be false to see only a manipulation of the extreme right this spontaneous movement cannot be understood without the successive defeat of the social movement against the labour law and later strikes by the sncf and without the existence of arrogant state executives who are shamelessly surrendering outrageously to the laws of the market the mobilization of november 17 undoubtedly represent a just anger however this spontaneity that makes all its originality and freshness carries no less strong contradictions it is precisely its spontaneity and its porosity that allows the far right le péniste and certain police unions to associate themselves to give it a rightist and chauvinistic tinge the mobilization has already been tainted by scandalous racist acts hateful acts against migrants and other reactionary acts if it is necessary to support the yellow vests for the reasons mentioned here and vigorously denounce the repression of which they were the object it calls all the fringes which constitute the social movement to structure and to give a true political content to the claims of yellow vests we call all the inhabitants of the neighbourhoods like rural areas the populations which undergo the racism and all those who undergo the full whip the neoliberal measures with walk out with us on november 30 from social networks universities and colleges workplaces boycott tv and supermarkets and reappear on december 1 in the form of a march for equality justice and dignity from nation a black glove in hand we hope that those who call to demonstrate on december 1 for more social justice will join us this is a historic opportunity failure to seize this opportunity would be a major political mistake unions and yellow vests with us and with black gloves lastly we must read the 42 demands compiled by the gilets jaunes by online opinion collection from thousands of citizens it is given as an addendum at the end of this article this shows various aspirations of the society as a whole though this may not be an ideal representative opinion so we saw thevarious other colours of the gilets jaunes movement a few probable observations and inferences even if the movement or some vocals parts of it as such did not call for integration with minorities and migrants organisations working with the latter are converging to make the movement more complete this effort will definitely influence a good section of the forces already within the movement or supporting it though as such there are no such demands like say bread land peace of 1917 we can see how the exploited common person is perceiving the movement purchasing power distribution of wealth as pointed by farmers and railwaymen raising minimum wage pension linking with inflation and fixing maximum salary as per the 42 point charter or equality justice dignity as said by the collectif rosa wrath against wto or such forced unions as eu we may recall the criticism of samir amin on this point preacrisation all these point to some essences which might converge with a revolutionary programme had it been actively present within the masses by activity of some strong mass based revolutionary party no party of the left gave call to fight on these points and given the concrete conditions of parties masses historical tendencies even if one or several of lefts gave such a call it could not generate such a mass passion leaving aside guesses like what could have happened had the lfi pd pcf and all other lefts combined given such a call revolutionaries should certainly try their best from inside the movement and also from outside to give a true political content to the claims of yellow vests quoting collectif rosa it must be mentioned here that some smaller organisations of the revolutionary communists are working within this movement big mass movements always needed some ideology while tending to encompass universal demands that want to lead to somebig change which once was manifested by the red flag say movements of national liberation many a times carried national flags symbolising a unifying nationalist ideology after the debacle of world communist movement the national flag was one that was left to act as an unifying symbol and certainly a bourgeois democratic nationalist ideology omnipresence of national flags with absence of red flags symbolised that compare la marseillaise in paris 2018 and l internationale in 1968 but well in pre revolutionary russia suppose in 1905 revolution la marseillaise was indeed a revolutionary song and is fitting in a rich vs poor war the red flag also lost some revolutionary connotation by its continuous use by non revolutionary parliamentary practical lefts in 2011 tahrir square we saw national flag in 2011 anna hazare event in delhi we saw national flags and gandhi topis in some western protests perhaps the guy fawkes mask came to symbolise almost the same content in tien an men square in 1989 we saw the goddess of democracy zìyóunǚshén very similar to the statue of liberty may see the hong kong replica here of course alongside red flags and mao posters which also portrayed their ideological content to some extent but as much as revolutionary communist content will get manifested in mass movements revolutionary communist symbols will also appear the president had scrapped fuel price increase and announced 100 rise in minimum wage but the yellow flames could not be doused yet peoples anger is still bursting on the roads despite the bitter cold weather experienced and well versed comrades may explain much better addendum the 42 revendications of the gilets jaunes before we end let us look into the demands of the yellow vests demands or peoples directives to the mps those are as far as this author could understand those compiled from three sources only which were published on 28 29 and 30 nov respectively deputies mps of france we inform you of the people s directives so that you transpose those into laws zero homelessness change in housing design

invesco s head of us equities simon laing and co heads of asian and emerging market equities will lam and ian hargreaves on their outlooks for 2019 simon laing s us outlook for 2019 a balance of cheaper cyclical companies especially within the energy sector and more defensive companies notably in health care and telecom is an appropriate approach to 2019 key to restoring both business and consumer confidence is a resolution to the chinese tariff situation investors will keep a close eye on the fed led by a new chairman as it continues to define its priorities expect three rate raises in 2019 the us equity market entered 2018 buzzing with optimism after strong 2017 gains expectations for 2018 were high fuelled by the president s tax cut bill improving global growth and strong corporate earnings growth the s p 500 index was up over 7 by the end of january the subsequent fall back to earth was swift and painful and a sign of things to come in 2018 despite the acceleration in gross domestic product gdp and the substantial step up in earnings growth driven by tax cuts the s p 500 has struggled to hold onto gains the escalating trade war and its implication for global growth have weighed heavily on sentiment volatility returned in 2018 and is unlikely to hibernate in 2019 when we think about equity markets there are three components to return corporate earnings growth the valuation multiple we will pay for those earnings and return of those earnings via dividend it is the valuation multiple that will be the most intriguing aspect of market returns for 2019 essentially it represents confidence in the economic and business cycles in 2018 that confidence has eroded meaningfully and multiple developments would be needed to restore it in 2019 most importantly china s tariff situation needs to be resolved although the blunt economic effect of tariffs on the us is small the ripple effect is significant particularly on business confidence and consumer confidence this has repercussions for capital spending hiring and consumer spending the effect on china is a lot more significant and with global growth again looking somewhat precarious a growing or at least stable chinese economy would be positive for global economies overall and us equity markets let s not forget that 44 of s p 500 revenues are generated outside the us to reiterate a resolution is key but an agreement looks some way off us president donald trump s chinese tariffs policy is one that resonates with both republicans and democrats as well as with voters hence there is little pressure to act quickly it is equally unclear what a satisfactory resolution for both sides would even look like but if trump s presidential form is anything to go by it may not be as severe as investors are thinking trump needs something that can be presented as a trade victory our sense is that as we see us gdp start to decelerate probably q1 2019 the timing will look better to declare a victory the federal reserve fed also represents a source of uncertainty for investors in 2019 with the change in chairman the market is still trying to get a feel for this new fed for now the fed seems a lot more focused on its goal than the path to get there under previous feds there were more intra meeting speeches from governors that were clearly meant to influence the stance on interest rates for now this fed has taken a line and appears reluctant to sway from that consensus seems to be to expect three rate rises in 2019 the market is crying out for the fed put the confirmation that rate rises are data dependent and not set in stone we expect the fed s stance to soften through 2019 fed chairman jerome powell s decision to start giving press conferences after each rate decision starting in january 2019 is a step toward a more market savvy fed so all this suggests confidence could improve as we move through 2019 but perhaps not in the first several months that should help equity market multiples eventually but expect volatility while the risk of us recession in 2019 is low in our mind the market s potential to worry about a recession in 2019 is high we suspect corporate earnings growth in 2019 will be solid low double digits but still well below that of tax boosted 2018 the market is likely to become comfortable with this growth outlook only later in the year though leading us to a barbell approach in portfolio construction we want to own cheap cyclical sectors balanced by a healthy weighting in more defensive sectors we still believe there is substantial risk in the technology sector where earnings are more cyclical than the market believes and valuation multiples are still very high this year s late pullback in technology has lured many to buy the dip after so many years of technology outperformance the fear of missing out is enormous but our sense is that there is more damage to come although we recognise that if the market worries about a recession our cyclical positions also will be out of favour we take comfort in the fact that the low valuations we are paying for these companies compensate us for much of any earnings risk technology companies do not have this luxury our favourite cyclical sector remains energy having avoided defensive sectors for much of the last five years we saw good value emerge in some companies through 2018 and think 2019 could be a good year for many of them in particular we think healthcare looks very opportune particularly in the area of large cap biotech we believe the result of the mid term elections removes the overhang of punitive actions on drug price controls we still expect some pricing pressure but far less than the market appears to be discounting and demand should hold up given strong demographic forces innovation is still very important and there are several therapeutic areas that have unmet needs that are being targeted in many cases there is limited value being attributed to the drug pipeline which we think is too harsh telecom is another sector we have recently re appraised it is a sector we had long avoided due to heavy capital investment requirement poor balance sheets and too much competition resulting in destructive price wars with at t broadening its focus to non telecom areas and t mobile attempting to acquire sprint the wireless environment has improved measurably the upgrade to 5g technology looks much less capital intensive than previous upgrade cycles we also see it as expansionary to their addressable market again in contrast to previous upgrade cycles over time 5g will open the markets of home broadband and internet of things iot to wireless providers iot examples include autonomous vehicles home appliances even clothing all of which will want to connect to the internet via wireless we see a tricky year in 2019 where markets will debate the potential for sustained us growth with the potential for a globally driven us slowdown we believe a balance of cheaper cyclical companies and more defensive companies is appropriate will lam and ian hargreaves asian and emerging markets outlook for 2019 emerging markets face increased external uncertainties valuations are beginning to reflect the risks economic and corporate fundamentals remain solid 2018 has been a challenging year for both asian and global emerging equity markets the year began with upbeat earnings expectations and valuations above long term historical averages however since the start of the year valuations have contracted due to a number of factors firstly we have seen a marked increase in the risk premium for emerging markets given increased uncertainty surrounding trade tensions and geopolitics secondly this has led to greater concern about china where growth has already been slowing due to the government s deleveraging campaign lastly the tightening of us monetary policy has led to a deteriorating us dollar liquidity environment with negative implications for emerging market equities and currencies this backdrop is likely to continue into 2019 but emerging economies are better placed to withstand these pressures than before in our view valuations are also beginning to reflect the risks being faced and are currently nearer the bottom end of their historical range trade escalating trade tensions between the us and its major trading partners have dominated the headlines in recent months and have accelerated the broader market s derating negotiations between the us and china have not yet yielded any results with president donald trump happy to ratchet up the pressure by announcing further rounds of potential tariffs the outcome is unpredictable and there is a danger that tensions may escalate further however as the negative implications of tariff increases for the us economy become clearer there is also a possibility that striking a deal becomes expedient in the near term we expect not only a direct impact on trade activity but also an impact on corporate and consumer behaviour with implications for investment and consumption this would impact companies in different ways and we are seeing more opportunities for investment where the market s reaction has been indiscriminate us monetary policy tightening although policy normalisation in the us has been well telegraphed investors have been concerned about a potentially faster than anticipated rise in interest rates as the risk free rate rises so does the cost of capital leading in theory to a valuation de rating of long duration assets such as stocks also a stronger us dollar has led to tighter global liquidity conditions and greater headwinds to global demand growth which could impact emerging market earnings earnings corporate earnings have so far been fairly resilient however leading economic indicators of global growth have declined suggesting export growth is likely to slow from current double digit levels this is a key driver of earnings growth in emerging markets secondly china s economy has been slowing as a result of tighter policy settings initiatives to tackle excessive credit growth reduce financial risk and improve environmental protection are all long term positives in our view as they address some of our biggest concerns but in the near term we would expect a further weakening of economic growth in china given the backdrop of slower global growth it is likely that consensus earnings forecasts for 2019 are still too optimistic over the last six months earnings have been revised down 5 from the peak and we would expect further downward revisions to the current 10 earnings growth expectations for 2019 1 asia in china deleveraging efforts have led to an economic slowdown while trade issues have increased uncertainty in the outlook the authorities are likely to be more tolerant of slower growth than they have been in the past in our view but they are keen to protect the downside risk to the economy as expected we have started to see some moderate easing measures such as reserve requirement cuts increased export tax rebates tax deductions on household income and support measures for smes in the private sector at the same time authorities will not want to see another significant leveraging up of the economy given that this is a major macroeconomic concern the balance between avoiding a sharp slowdown in growth and avoiding excessive stimulus is becoming more delicate elsewhere in the region economies do not look particularly vulnerable current accounts are generally healthy and credit cycles are not extended where current account deficits do exist indonesia philippines and india they seem manageable and growth forecasts have already been lowered those economies more sensitive to global demand such as south korea and taiwan are likely to be impacted by ongoing trade and chinese growth concerns but we believe their innovative companies have strong competitive advantages that should sustain them better than many fear operational strength in asia meanwhile there have been some significant improvements at the corporate level in asia over the last decade the region s capex sales ratio has been steadily declining in part this reflects lower structural growth but it also demonstrates that asian companies are more cautious focused and better managed than they were historically and suggests that better returns on capital are sustainable in a weaker growth environment it is also positive that there are few industries with significant excess capacity risk less capital intensive companies have also been generating stronger free cash flow the challenge has been how to better allocate that capital with management facing growing pressure from minority shareholders to pay better dividends while valuations and positive surprises in earnings are less likely to drive equity returns in the near term there is an increasingly good dividend growth story in asia latin america market volatility in latin america has been exacerbated by politics and uncertainty over the north american free trade agreement nafta presidential elections in mexico and brazil have resulted in populist candidates from either side of the political spectrum gaining power markets have been buoyed by a reduction in political uncertainty and strengthened hopes that key areas of reform will now be addressed in brazil the pace of economic recovery has been sluggish plans to push ahead with pension and tax reforms would help reduce a large fiscal gap and go some way to restoring investor confidence and promoting consumption growth and investment spending meanwhile the prospects for mexico are likely to be bolstered by the successful replacement of nafta with the us mexico canada agreement usmca emea increased uncertainty over us russia relations may dampen economic growth but the russian economy is still expected to expand by 1 5 in 20192 drawing benefit from recovering oil prices strong consumer demand and prudent fiscal policy however aside from an easing in tensions with the us the country needs to introduce further reforms for gross domestic product gdp to accelerate having said that we still believe the status quo is a healthy environment in which domestically focused companies can prosper unfortunately our optimism is not being matched yet by market sentiment which is currently being negatively affected by worries over the imposition of new sanctions elsewhere in emerging europe countries such as poland and hungary are likely to enjoy healthy growth rates and low interest rates in our view a bright medium term outlook over the medium term our outlook for emerging markets is cautiously optimistic economic and corporate fundamentals remain solid and these economies remain the biggest driver of global growth in particular we are encouraged by the capital discipline being displayed by companies across emerging markets with evidence of strong balance sheets and improving free cash flow generation this is being reflected at the macro level too few countries are exhibiting signs of overheating a far cry from the situation that prevailed in the run up to the global financial crisis in 2008 with valuations towards the low end of the historical range and at a significant discount to their developed market peers the market appears too focused on short term uncertainties and is ignoring the fundamental improvements that have taken place

in less than two months the yellow vests gilets jaunes movement in france has reshaped the political landscape in europe for a seventh straight week demonstrations continued across the country even after concessions from a cowing president emmanuel macron while inspiring a wave of similar gatherings in neighboring states like belgium and the netherlands just as el sisi s dictatorship banned the sale of high visibility vests to prevent copycat rallies in egypt corporate media has predictably worked overtime trying to demonize the spontaneous and mostly leaderless working class movement in the hopes it will not spread elsewhere the media oligopoly initially attempted to ignore the insurrection altogether but when forced to reckon with the yellow vests they maligned the incendiary marchers using horseshoe theory to suggest a confluence between far left and far right supporters of jean luc mélenchon and marine le pen to the surprise of no one mainstream pundits have also stoked fears of russian interference behind the unrest we can assume that if the safety vests were ready made off the assembly line of ngos like the raised fist flags of serbia s otpor movement the presstitutes would be telling a different story it turned out that a crisis was not averted but merely postponed when macron defeated his demagogue opponent le pen in the 2017 french election while it is true that the gilets jauneswere partly impelled by an increase on fuel prices contrary to the prevailing narrative their official demands are not limited to a carbon tax they also consist of explicit ultimatums to increase the minimum wage improve the standard of living and an end to austerity among other legitimate grievances since taking office macron has declared war on trade unions while pushing through enormous tax breaks for the wealthy like himself it was just a matter of time until the french people had enough of the country s privatization it is only a shock to the oblivious establishment why the former rothschild banker turned politician who addressed the nation seated at a gold desk while paris was ablaze is suddenly in jeopardy of losing power the status quo s incognizance is reminiscent of marie antoinette who during the 18th century when told the peasants had no bread famously replied let them eat cake as the masses starved under her husband louis xiv while the media s conspicuous blackout of coverage is partly to blame the deafening silence from across the atlantic in the united states is really because of the lack of class consciousness on its political left with the exception of occupy wall street the american left has been so preoccupied with an endless race to the bottom in the two party culture wars it is unable to comprehend an upheaval undivided by the contaminants of identity politics a political opposition that isn t fractured on social issues is simply unimaginable not to say the masses in france are exempt from the internal contradictions of the working class but the fetishization of lifestyle politics in the u s has truly become its weakness we will have to wait and see whether the yellow vests transform into a global movement or arrive in america but for now the seeming lack of solidarity stateside equates to a complicity with macron s agenda it serves as a reminder of the historically revisionist understanding of french politics in the u s that is long established the middle class dominated left wing in america ascribes to a historical reinterpretation of the french revolution that is a large contributor of its aversion to transformative praxis in favor of incrementalism the late italian marxist philosopher and historian domenico losurdo who died in june of this year offered the most thorough understanding of its misreading of history in seminal works such as war and revolution rethinking the twentieth century the liberal rereading of the french revolution is the ideological basis for its rejection of the revolutionary tradition from the jacobins to the bolsheviks that has neutralized the modern left to this day according to its revised history the inevitable outcome of comprehensive systemic change is robespierre s so called reign of terror or the purges of the stalin era in the soviet union in its view what began with the locke and montesquieu influenced reforms of the constitutional monarchy was hijacked by the radical jacobin and sans culotte factions losurdo explains that counter revolutionaries eager to discredit the image of rebellion overemphasize its violence and bloodshed and never properly contextualize it as self defense against the real reign of terror by the ruling class the idea behind this recasting of history is to conflate revolutionary politics with nazi germany whose racially motivated genocide was truly the inheritor of the legacy of european colonialism not the ancestry of the jacobins or the russian revolution maximilien robespierre s real crime in the eyes of bourgeois historians was attempting to fulfill the egalitarian ideals of republicanism by transferring political power from the aristocracy and nouveaux riches directly into the hands of the working class just as the paris commune did nearly 80 years later it is for this reason he subsequently became one of the most misunderstood and unfairly maligned figures in world history perhaps one day to be absolved the us reaction to the yellow vests is a continuation of the denial and suppression of the class conflict inherent in the french revolution which continues to seethe beneath the surfaces of capitalism today in today s political climate it is easy to forget that there have been periods where the american left was actually engaged with the crisis of global capitalism in what seems like eons ago the anti globalization movement in the wake of nafta culminated in huge protests in seattle in 1999 which saw nearly 50 000 march against the world trade organization following the 2008 financial collapse it briefly reemerged in the occupy movement which was also swiftly put down by corporate state repression currently the political space once inhabited by the anti globalization left has been supplanted by the anti globalist rhetoric mostly associated with right wing populism globalism and globalization may have qualitatively different meanings but they nevertheless are interrelated although it is shortsighted there are core accuracies in the former s narrative that should be acknowledged the idea of a shadowy world government isn t exclusively adhered to by anti establishment conservatives and it is right to suspect there is a worldwide cabal of secretive billionaire power brokers controlling events behind the scenes there is indeed a new world order with zero regard for the sovereignty of nation states just as there is a deep state however it is a ruling class not of paranoiac imagination but real life and a right wing billionaire like robert mercer is as much a globalist as george soros ever since capitalism emerged it has always been global the current economic crisis is its latest cyclical downturn impoverishing and alienating working people whose increasing hardship is what has led to the trending rejection of the eu imperialism has exported capital leading to the destruction of jobs in the home sectors of western nations while outsourcing them to the third world over time deep disgruntlement among the working class has grown toward an economic system that is clearly rigged against them where the skewed distribution of capital gains and widespread tax evasion on the part of big business is camouflaged as buoyant economic growth when it came crashing down in the last recession the financial institutions responsible were bailed out using taxpayer money instead of facing any consequences such grotesque unfairness has only been amplified by the austerity further transferring the burden from the 1 to the poor before the gilets jaunes the u k s brexit referendum in 2016 laid bare these deep class divisions within the european union one of the most significant events in the continent since wwii it has ultimately threatened to reshape the occident s status in the post war order as a whole brexit manifested out of divisions within britain s political parties especially the torys which had been plagued for years by an internal dispute over the eu those in power were blind to the warning signs of discontent toward a world economy in crisis and were shocked by the plebiscite in which the working class defied the powers that be against all odds with more than half voting to leave in general well to do brits were hard remainers while those suffering most severely from the destruction of industry unemployment and austerity overwhelmingly chose to leave in what was described as a peasants revolt by the media the value of the pound sterling quickly plunged and not long after the status of the united kingdom as a whole came into question as britain found itself at odds with scotland s unanimous decision to remain brexit tugged at the bonds holding the eu together and suddenly the collective standing clout of its member states is at stake in a potential breakup of the entire bloc euroscepticism is also by no means a distinctly british phenomenon as distrust has soared in countries hit the hardest by neoliberalism like greece 80 with spain and france not far behind in fact before there was brexit there was fear among the elite of a grexit in response to its unprecedented debt crisis manufactured by the international monetary fund imf the greek people elected the coalition of the radical left syriza to a majority of legislative seats to the hellenic parliament during its 2015 bailout referendum unfortunately the synthetic alliance turned out to be anything but radical and a trojan horse of the establishment syriza was elected on its promise to rescind the terms of greek membership in the eu but shortly after taking office it betrayed its constituency and agreed to the troika s mass privatization even its former finance minister yanis varousfakis admitted that syriza was a controlled opposition and auxiliary of the soros foundation apart from suffering collective amnesia regarding the eu s neoliberal policies apparently the modern left is also in serious need of a history lesson regarding the federation s fascist origins it has been truly puzzling to see self proclaimed progressives mourning britain s decision to withdraw from a continental union that was historically masterminded by former fifth columnists of nazi germany it was in the aftermath of wwii s devastation that the 1951 treaty of paris established the nucleus of the eu in the european coal and steel community a cooperative union formed by france italy west germany and the three benelux states belgium luxembourg and the netherlands the europe declaration charter stated by the signature of this treaty the involved parties give proof of their determination to create the first supranational institution and that thus they are laying the true foundation of an organized europe this europe remains open to all european countries that have freedom of choice we profoundly hope that other countries will join us in our common endeavor the idea of forming a supranational union was conceived by the french statesman robert schuman who during the outbreak of wwii served as the under secretary of state for refugees in the reynaud government when nazi germany invaded france in 1940 schuman by all accounts willingly voted to grant absolute dictatorial powers to marshall philippe pétain to become head of state of the newly formed vichy government the puppet regime that ruled nazi occupied france until the allied invasion in 1944 by doing so he retained his position in parliament though he later chose to resign following the war like all vichy collaborators schuman was initially charged with the offense of indignité nationale national unworthiness and stripped of his civil rights as a traitor more than 4 000 alleged quislings were summarily executed following operation overlord and the normandy landings but the future eu designer was fortunate enough to have friends in high places schuman s clemency was granted by none other than general charles de gaulle himself the leader of the resistance during the war and future french president instantly schuman s turncoat reputation was rehabilitated and his wartime activity whitewashed even though he had knowingly voted full authority to pétain the retention of his post in the vichy government was veneered to have occurred somehow without his knowledge or consent schuman is officially regarded as one of the eleven men who were founding fathers of what later became the eu one of the other major figures that contributed to the federal integration of the continent was konrad adenauer the first chancellor of the federal republic of germany the nuremberg trials may have tried and executed most of the top leadership of the nazi party but the post war government that became west germany was saturated with former third reich officials despite the purported post war denazification policy inscribed in the potsdam agreement many figures who had directly participated in the holocaust were appointed to high positions in adenauer s administration and never prosecuted for their atrocities one such war criminal was the former ministry of the interior and drafter of the nuremberg race statutes hans globke who became adenauer s right hand man as his secretary of state and chief of staff adenauer also successfully lobbied the allies to free most of the wehrmacht war criminals in their custody winning the support of then u s general and future president dwight eisenhower by 1951 motivated by the desire to quickly rearm and integrate west germany into nato in the new cold war the policy of denazification was prematurely ended and countless offenders were allowed to reenter branches of government military and public service their crimes against humanity took a backseat to the greater imperialist priority of rearmament against east germany and the soviets in the years following wwii there was also concern among the elite of anti americanism growing in western europe the annual bilderberg group conference was established in 1954 by prince bernard of the netherlands himself a former reiter ss corps and nazi party member to promote atlanticism and facilitate cooperation between american and european leaders invitations to the bilderberg club meetings were extended to only the most exclusive paragons in politics academia the media industry and finance in 2009 wikileaks revealed that it was at the infamous assembly where the hidden agenda of the european coal and steel community later the eu was set e european unity the discussion on this subject revealed general support for the idea of european integration and unification among the participants from the six countries of the european coal and steel community and a recognition of the urgency of the problem while members of the group held different views as to the method by which a common market could be set up there was a general recognition of the dangers inherent in the present divided markets of europe and the pressing need to bring the german people together with the other peoples of europe into a common market that the six countries of the coal and steel community had definitely decided to establish a common market and that experts were now working this out was felt to be a most encouraging step forward and it was hoped that other countries would subsequently join it at the 1955 conference the rudimentary idea for a european currency or what became the eurozone was even discussed three years before the treaty of rome which established the european economic community without the public s knowledge a european speaker expressed concern about the need to achieve a common currency and indicated that in his view this necessarily implied the creation of a central political authority the mysterious bilderberg gatherings are still held to this day under notorious secrecy and are frequently the subject of wild speculation one can imagine a topic behind the scenes at this year s meeting would be how to address the growth of anti eu populism and uprisings like the gilet jaunes hitlerite expansionism had been carried out on the führer s vision for a european federation in the third reich in many respects the eu is a rebranded realization of his plans for empire building how ironic that liberals are clinging to a multinational political union founded by fascist colluders while the same economic bloc is being opposed by today s far right after its new islamophobic facelift while nationalism may have played an instrumental role in brexit there is a manufactured hysteria hatched by the establishment which successfully reduced the complex range of reasons for the leave eu vote to racism and flag waving they are now repeating this pattern by overstating the presence of the far right among the yellow vests such delirium not only demonizes workers but coercively repositions the left into supporting something it otherwise shouldn t the eu and by default its laissez faire policies thereby driving the masses further into the arms of the same far right echoes of this can be seen in the u s with the vapid response to journalist angela nagle s recent article about the immigration crisis on the southern border the faux left built a straw man in their attack on nagle who dared to acknowledge that the establishment only really wants open borders for an endless supply of low wage labor from regions in the global south destabilized by u s militarism and trade liberalization aligning itself with the hollow symbolic gestures of centrists has only deteriorated the standards of the left participating in such vacuousness and dragged down to the level of liberals there is no doubt brexit and trump pushed the xenophobia button and could not have come about without it however such criticism means nothing when it comes from moral posturers who claim to stand with refugees while supporting the very humanitarian interventionist policies displacing them nativism was not the sole reason the majority voted to leave the eu and many working class minorities also were brexiters of course their fellow workers and migrants are not the true cause of their misery after all it was not just chattel slaves who came to the u s unwillingly but european immigrants fleeing continental wars and starvation as well the crisis in the eu today is no different fundamentally migrants seek asylum on europe s doorstep because of nato s imperial expansion and the unexpected arrival of brexit has threatened to weaken the eu s military arm already desperate to reinvent itself and a new enemy in russia despite its functional obsolescence the shock of the referendum has inconveniently undermined nato s ability to pressure moscow and beijing a step forward for mitigating world peace in the long run and a silver lining to its outcome it is the task of the left to reject the eu s neoliberal project while transmitting the message that capital not refugees is the cause of the plight of the masses it is also necessary to have faith in the people something cynical liberals lack racism may historically be the achilles heel of the working class but underlying brexit the election of trump and the yellow vests is the spirit of defiance in working people albeit one of political confusion in need of guidance if the yellow vests are today s sans culottes like those which became the revolutionary partisans in the french revolution they will eventually need a jacobin club relatively progressive but ultimately reformist figures like mélenchon are no such spearhead and will only lead them down the same dead end of syriza the absence of any such vanguard has forced the working class to take matters into their own hands in the interim if history is any guide the gilets jaunes will be stamped out until a new cadre takes the reins whose objective is as lenin said not to champion the degrading of the revolutionary to the level of an amateur but to raise the amateurs to the level of revolutionaries we also cannot fall into ideological fantasies that we live in permanent revolutionary circumstances or that a spontaneous uprising can become comprehensive simply because of ingenious leadership nevertheless as mao tse tung wrote a single spark can start a prairie fire and hopefully the yellow vests are that flame top photo demonstrators wearing yellow vests walk past by

why france s yellow vest protests have been ignored by the resistance in the us max parry the rich are only defeated when running for their lives clr james the black jacobins in less than two months the yellow vests gilets jaunes movement in france has reshaped the political landscape in europe for a seventh straight week demonstrations continued across the country even after concessions from a cowing president emmanuel macron while inspiring a wave of similar gatherings in neighboring states like belgium and the netherlands just as el sisi s dictatorship banned the sale of high visibility vests to prevent copycat rallies in egypt corporate media has predictably worked overtime trying to demonize the spontaneous and mostly leaderless working class movement in the hopes it will not spread elsewhere the media oligopoly initially attempted to ignore the insurrection altogether but when forced to reckon with the yellow vests they maligned the incendiary marchers using horseshoe theory to suggest a confluence between far left and far right supporters of jean luc mélenchon and marine le pen to the surprise of no one mainstream pundits have also stoked fears of russian interference behind the unrest we can assume that if the safety vests were ready made off the assembly line of ngos like the raised fist flags of serbia s otpor movement the presstitutes would be telling a different story it turned out that a crisis was not averted but merely postponed when macron defeated his demagogue opponent le pen in the 2017 french election while it is true that the gilets jaunes were partly impelled by an increase on fuel prices contrary to the prevailing narrative their official demands are not limited to a carbon tax they also consist of explicit ultimatums to increase the minimum wage improve the standard of living and an end to austerity among other legitimate grievances since taking office macron has declared war on trade unions while pushing through enormous tax breaks for the wealthy like himself it was just a matter of time until the french people had enough of the country s privatization it is only a shock to the oblivious establishment why the former rothschild banker turned politician who addressed the nation seated at a gold desk while paris was ablaze is suddenly in jeopardy of losing power the status quo s incognizance is reminiscent of marie antoinette who during the 18th century when told the peasants had no bread famously replied let them eat cake as the masses starved under her husband louis xiv while the media s conspicuous blackout of coverage is partly to blame the deafening silence from across the atlantic in the united states is really because of the lack of class consciousness on its political left with the exception of occupy wall street the american left has been so preoccupied with an endless race to the bottom in the two party culture wars it is unable to comprehend an upheaval undivided by the contaminants of identity politics a political opposition that isn t fractured on social issues is simply unimaginable not to say the masses in france are exempt from the internal contradictions of the working class but the fetishization of lifestyle politics in the u s has truly become its weakness we will have to wait and see whether the yellow vests transform into a global movement or arrive in america but for now the seeming lack of solidarity stateside equates to a complicity with macron s agenda it serves as a reminder of the historically revisionist understanding of french politics in the u s that is long established the middle class dominated left wing in america ascribes to a historical reinterpretation of the french revolution that is a large contributor of its aversion to transformative praxis in favor of incrementalism the late italian marxist philosopher and historian domenico losurdo who died in june of this year offered the most thorough understanding of its

authored by michael howell via crossborder capital global liquidity falling at its fastest rate since 2007 08 crisis over zealous central banks are largely to blame not a broken banking system like 2007 08 crisis squeeze evidenced by flat yield curves and negative real term premia in the us the impact of reverse qe is equivalent to another 10 rate hikes all around is crashing can the centre hold we will enter 2019 with global liquidity tumbling at its fastest rate since the 2007 08 financial crisis yet again investors are learning the hard lesson that low nominal interest rates are a dangerously ambiguous guide to monetary conditions already risk asset markets are skidding in response to tight liquidity and economic slowdown and probable recessions lie ahead the future looks especially bad for those economies firms and institutions that have spent the last decade kicking the proverbial debt can down the road high debt levels always demand high liquidity to facilitate re financing systemic risks rise if debt cannot be re scheduled figure1 shows the scale of the recent drop in global liquidity liquidity here refers to funding liquidity rather than market liquidity although the two are closely linked since end january 2018 world private sector liquidity has fallen by some us 3 trillion with roughly two thirds of the drop coming from the developed economies while world central bank liquidity has fallen by another us 1 1 trillion with two thirds of its drop recorded in emerging markets paced by their large foreign reserve losses added together global liquidity has in total fallen by just over us 4 trillion to us 124 1 trillion this 3 drop looks more serious when set against its 7 normal trend put another way after its brief recovery global liquidity has fallen back again to stand some 25 below its long term trend the table reports the latest weekly activities of the key central banks only china s people s bank pboc is still expanding its balance sheet and measured in current us dollars latest data show world central bank money is down by nearly 10 at an annualised 3 month clip what to watch we monitor global liquidity by closely watching three channels central bank liquidity injections private sector liquidity provision cross border capital flows the first channel is now fashionably dubbed qe or quantitative easing and measures the activities of policy makers in the money repo and debt markets the second looks beyond credit at all forms of cash generation by the private sector it embraces bank credit shadow bank credit and household and corporate savings flows in retail and particularly wholesale markets and covers a history of financial engineering that extends back to the uk fringe banks in the 1970s and japanese zaitech in the 1980s cross border flows include all forms of net investment but they are noteworthy because foreign currency borrowings e g eurodollars are often used as collateral and levered up by domestic credit providers it follows that central bank liquidity and cross border flows represent what we term primary liquidity while banks and shadow banks provide secondary liquidity we define liquidity broadly to include global or cross border effects and deeply insofar that it extends beyond the traditional financial sector to include corporate cash flows and beyond retail banking by embracing wholesale money and repo markets the link between the volume of liquidity and interest rates was anyway never one to one a fact that is especially true in the post 2008 period moreover the link between bank reserves money and liquidity has been similarly blurred with the size of central bank balance sheets playing a more complex role in the funding structure since they simultaneously affect both the supply of cash and the availability of collateral according to adrian and shin 2009 the money stock is a measure of the liabilities of deposit taking banks and so may have been useful before the advent of the market based financial system however the money stock will be of less use in a financial system such as that in the us more useful may be measures of collateralized borrowing such as the weekly series of primary dealer repos adrian and shin money liquidity and monetary policy new york fed staff papers january 2009 funding and the specific role played by central banks are critical factors explaining the liquidity cycle central banks have an outsized effect in deregulated financial systems where retail deposits are not the sole funding source because what matters most is the ability to re finance positions and at the margin central banks are the marginal suppliers of liquidity put another way liquidity is not fungible in crises the very times that it matters most and so central bank interventions are required since the supply of liquidity to roll over existing positions matters more than the demand for finance for new projects the size of the central bank balance sheet often outweighs the impact of interest rates it follows that the relationship between interest rates and the supply of liquidity is rarely one to one central bank interventions into the money markets significantly affect the elasticity of the financial system in short quantities matter and central banks increasingly determine the volume of funding liquidity and often directly impact the amount of market liquidity in modern financial systems figure 2 shows the dramatic expansion in the size of the us dollar money markets to around us 9 trillion and the dominant role played by the us federal reserve in the period since 1980 these markets have increasingly supplemented retail deposits and now fund a rising proportion of us credit and liquidity notably wholesale lending activity admittedly following the 2007 08 crisis they have essentially flat lined in size although the money markets are exploited by both traditional banks and shadow banks as financing pools what sets traditional banks apart from all other financial institutions is their ability to issue liabilities e g demand deposits that serve the non bank sector as a means of payment consequently traditional banks do not face the same funding constraints as other financial intermediaries so making their lending more elastic in theory as long as capital requirements are met the traditional banking system can accommodate additional credit demands by simply creating new means of payment in the process of making new loans what shadow banks do is to transform these bank assets and liabilities and refinance them as longer and more complex intermediation chains e g a lends to b who lends to c etc in doing this they provide alternative stores of value e g asset backed securities to institutional investors that do not want to hold all of their liquid assets as uninsured demand deposits however shadow banks largely repackage and recycle existing savings by lengthening intermediation chains they became involved in large volumes of wholesale funding without creating much new lending the data show that they are involved in 66 of gross funding but directly account for barely 15 of new lending shadow banks therefore increase the elasticity of the traditional banking system by relaxing banks capital requirements through say selling loans externally to gses or internally to off balance sheet vehicles so boosting the credit multiplier a speculative appetite to borrow always exists and seemingly is independent of interest rates keynes dubbed this the unborrowed fringe yet shadow banks could not have originated the credit boom that preceded the 2007 08 crisis since they themselves depend on bank credit the fragility of this wholesale funding model based on short term repos has heightened systemic risks not least because it is market collateral based and highly pro cyclical and it always threatens to feed back negatively on to the funding as well as the lending books of traditional banks traditional economics misses the importance of this gross funding dimension because it takes every credit as a debt debit every debt as a credit so assets and liabilities must match and the system always balances to zero thus it never acknowledges just how big these numbers are regardless of how much credit or debt there is in the system the net figure is always the same but knowing this fact is akin to scaling the world s longest ladder and promising never to fall off the vital role that central banks play in this funding mechanism is also not well understood even by the policy makers themselves for example some experts have even claimed that collateral such as treasury notes that were purchased by policy makers as part of qe operations when released back into the market from the asset side of the fed balance sheet we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us is a far better lubricant for the financial system than the reduction in reserves balances on the liability side of the fed balance sheet thus a leaner central bank balance sheet could justify a much higher policy rate in this cycle than currently being anticipated singh ft april 2017 this is dangerous talk particularly if it has recently played a role in persuading policy makers to become more cavalier in their tightening actions we maintain that the size of the central bank balance sheet serves as an unambiguous guide to the availability rather than simply the cost of primary funding thus quantitative tightening is likely to have an out sized effect in the modern financial system this can be seen in figure 3 which highlights the close relationship between movements in the size of the us money markets and changes in the size of the federal reserve balance sheet the latest drop in the balance sheet spells out an ominous warning for us money market conditions this is a different crisis to 2007 08 therefore we suggest that unlike the 2007 08 crisis which was more about a broken banking system involving the sudden collapse of leverage among over extended banks and shadow banks the current credit squeeze looks more like the 1997 98 asian crisis when central banks led by the us fed tightened the supply of primary liquidity and cross border flows rapidly retreated this time around financial markets are probably even more interconnected and more global consequently this could be an asian crisis like sell off but one not only confined to asia this is shown in figure 4 which depicts the two moving parts that explain fluctuations in total credit changes in the credit multiplier black line and growth in the monetary base orange line although the supply of primary liquidity dipped the 2007 08 crisis was dominated by a forced de leveraging as shown by the skidding credit multiplier the ratio between total credit and the official monetary base in fact pace its absolute decline in 2006 the us federal reserve s balance sheet subsequently expanded rapidly as the crisis unfolded this is shown by the orange line in figure 4 the explanation for this collapse is that in the run up to 2007 08 shadow banks had been borrowing against new collateral such as us dollar deposits and re hypothecating existing collateral i e the so called collateral multiplier to create what might be dubbed a shadow monetary base we can crudely estimate the size this notional shadow base by keeping the credit multiplier fixed at its previous average value and calculating the funding gap required to justify rising total credit this is shown in figure 5 on the same chart we have added the cumulative flows of cross border capital to emerging markets because these flows were likely dominated by dollar loans that were probably being sourced from the same off shore wholesale markets not surprisingly the two series co move closely the collapse of world central bank money in contrast today s monetary problem is more about the other component namely tight primary liquidity this has four dimensions us federal reserve tightening tightening by other major central bank e g ecb and boj usd area tightening e g emerging market central banks legislative onslaught against the eurodollar off shore wholesale markets figure 6 examines the growth in central bank money broken down into three parts the us federal reserve central banks in the non us developed markets and emerging market central banks the scale of the current liquidity squeeze goes beyond the us fed raising the bar on its reverse qe to us 50 billion per month and the ecb halting its qe from year end the chart shows how the us fed has been tightening qe policy since 2015 the major non us central banks started easing later and only began tightening earlier this year similarly with emerging market central banks and as figure 7 highlights the em cycle has been as usual largely dictated by underlying foreign exchange reserve movements this in turn likely reflects an additional negative spill over from us fed tightening summarising the aggregate story the chart shows that all three groups are now contributing to the sharpness of the overall liquidity slowdown the fourth component of tightening is harder to pin down because data is scarce however we suggest that the offshore wholesale markets are under fire from the us federal authorities who seem keen to regain control of us dollar liquidity the eurodollar markets which lie outside of us fed or treasury control were a major factor behind the wayward shadow banking boom ahead of the 2007 08 crisis there have been three moves made to regain control 1 the planned replacement of uncollateralised libor with the new secured sofr on shore money market interest rate 2 the 2018 tax amnesty that facilitated the repatriation of off shore us corporate deposits and 3 the recent removal of the tax allowance for interest payments on off shore inter bank loans these official directives should substantially reduce the future attractions of using the eurodollar markets one way to show their impact is in figure 8 which plots the amount of net funding that us based banks receive from international banks since this represents dollar funding the likely foreign sources are the eurodollar markets figure 8 highlights the sizeable decline from the us 750 billion peak in 2015 other evidence of tightness the scale of this tightness can be seen in two other statistics 1 the real term premia on us 10 year treasuries and 2 the flat slope of the g4 yield curve the 10 year treasury is the canonical safe asset for world investors and a low term premia suggests a high demand for safe assets to remove the distorting effects of inflation expectations on term premia we calculate an inflation adjusted series or real term premia when the net demand for safe assets is normal the real term premia should be around zero greater demand for safety pushes it lower and greater risk appetite among investors should push it higher consequently these real term premia movements provide another way of judging whether monetary conditions are too loose or too tight figure 9 plots the real term premia for 10 year treasuries against fed funds it shows that because of the effect of reverse qe the true fed funds rate is nearer to 5 than the prevailing 2 5 target in other words tight liquidity conditions are equivalent to the fed undertaking around 20 rate hikes rather than the nine it has so far implemented this cycle in figure 10 we show the relationship between global liquidity and the term structure of world interest rates as depicted by the slope of the g4 government yield curve term premia again play a role here because tight liquidity conditions by forcing investors into demanding more safe assets push up bond prices and simultaneously pull down their yields and term premia thus the general flatness of yield curves across the major economies again testifies to generally weak global liquidity conditions it is simply not the case as many suggest that central bank qe lowers bond yields rather because government bonds are safe assets reverse qe in fact causes lower yields and qe raises bond yields this follows because term premia widen as the extra liquidity persuades investors to take more risks so shifting asset allocation from safe bonds to risky equities conclusion we expect a major policy easing in 2019 however only china s pboc people s bank among the majors is so far easing monetary policy we anyway see china as leading this cycle the us fed is likely to follow given the scale of tightness in domestic and global liquidity and this must involve greater liquidity injections rather than simply interest rate cuts we have no view whether this takes the formal shape of an explicit qe4 policy or if it involves an unannounced increase in the size of the fed s balance sheet whichever the immediate implications will be a yield curve steepening and ultimately a weaker us dollar financial shares and emerging markets may prove the main beneficiaries

this article is more than 5 years old brazil s new president jair bolsonaro was sworn in this week brazil s fright wing wing president since the dictatorship years takes over a country greatly damaged by more than 12 years of left wing rule with the last administration of dilma rousseff one of the worst bolsonaro is brazil s last chance to fix the economy before it needs some sort of international lifeline like argentina bolsonaro was elected in a swipe against dilma s workers party and to get tough on crime brazil s murder rate wipes out the equivalent of one small city per year about 60 000 homicides annually but he was also elected to fix an economy that overspent and nearly bankrupted one of its most important enterprises oil firm petrobras bolsonaro has his work cut out for him worse yet he takes over at a time when the global business cycle is in retreat the u s is about to enter a ramped up political crisis with its highly partisan and divided government and china is slowing down and has little room for the debt fueled stimulus of the past if you have a strong china then you have a stronger brazil because of commodities but that depends on forces outside of bolsonaro s control says brian nick chief investment strategist for nuveen the pension reform policies will be the most important for brazil investors and the long term sustainability of that government i think if pension reform falls apart again then investors will get out he says brazil s stock market is up over 5 since bolsonaro was elected on october 28 only india has outperformed within the big four emerging markets fitch ratings bond analysts said wednesday that brazil s economy will grow this year but not by much the potential for upside is all dependent on bolsonaro and external factors namely the u s and china they are forecasting 2 2 growth this year and 2 7 next year bolsonaro has continued to advocate for a generally business friendly agenda putting in place well known investors like paulo guedes and a former treasury secretary and world bank economist joaquim levy in key positions guedes will run the economy for the most part and levy will run brazil s bndes the largest development bank in the americas he has a market friendly team however new investors to brazil should not get too excited about that brazil s two term president luiz inacio lula da silva a workers party founder now serving a 12 year prison sentence for his involvement in the massive petrobras bribery schemes also put in a market friendly team including levy and central banker henrique meirelles see wall street gives brazil until june to save itself forbes bolsonaro s economic platform included fiscal consolidation pension reform simplification of the tax code privatization and formal independence for the central bank significant uncertainties remain over the specific policies bolsonaro will pursue as part of this market liberalization agenda says shelly shetty a senior director for fitch congressional challenges to pension reform are likely to mean that risks lie ahead she says bolsonaro s social liberal party made major inroads in congress in october but the legislature continues to be highly fragmented due to the infinite number of parties in brazil large establishment parties like the social democratic party democratic movement party and the workers party all saw their seat count shrink bolsonaro has more support than not but he does not have a clear mandate he will need the support from other parties in order to pass legislation while pension reform will likely require a constitutional amendment or 60 support to pass in congress i think he will get pension reform passed says teresa barger ceo and cofounder of cartica an emerging markets investment firm he has to do it everyone on his team knows this brazil s social security program accounts for more than 40 of the government s nondiscretionary spending the deficit in brazil s public employee retirement plan is equal to 3 of gdp meaning 2 growth is not enough to fund the program brazil will most likely beat its public sector primary deficit target for 2018 due to cutbacks elsewhere however the overall general government deficit is high and is estimated to be around 8 of gdp well above the average for countries with brazil s same bb credit rating brazil s debt to gdp ratio hit 78 of gdp in 2018 its highest in a generation the imf forecasts it to go above 80 while that number looks low compared to countries like the u s and japan brazil s economy is tiny by comparison and its currency surely does not have the same economic clout as the yen and dollar i m giving brazil until the start of the second half to give us something on pension reform says jan dehn head of research for the ashmore group in london spending cuts will also be necessary to raise brazil s growth rate despite high taxation there is significant tax evasion in brazil and weak growth means the government is collecting fewer taxes to pay for itself which includes things like state run hospitals school teachers and police departments not to mention their retirees improving the business climate liberalizing the economy reduced state participation through rationalization of bureaucracy privatizations and greater infrastructure investment will all be necessary for brazil to rebound says shetty bolsonaro has the political willpower to get the job done one of his proclamations on inauguration day was to eradicate the quasi socialist policies of the past five years under dilma rousseff bolsonaro s task is somewhat sisyphean cursed to push a rock uphill only to watch it roll back down the hill his own base in the military has very little appetite for pension reform as they have been some of the biggest beneficiaries of it worse yet tightening financing conditions in the u s commodity price volatility a china slowdown and an economically weak neighbor in argentina are serious headwinds brazil s domestic economy is not strong enough to make up for that brazil has room to cut taxes and cut interest rates but will have to cut government costs as well or the government will have to tap capital markets for more debt to keep the lights on increased government debt burdens leave brazil vulnerable to change in international financing conditions caused by the u s federal reserve and changes in american investor appetite

for a part of the investment world that is usually a quiet backwater fixed income markets generated quite a bit of noise and news during 2018 riskier securities outperformed earlier in the year then gave up much of their gains once popular fund categories are now seeing sharp price drops and record outflows and liquidity is drying up as lenders reassess risk while bond dealers strain to cope with high trading volume and a spike in hedging activity as yields rise or fall comparing them for different types of securities can take the pulse of the market about various concerns stunted growth inflation pressures fiscal incontinence and default risk from a cash flow infarction changing yield spreads relative to safer government paper show that investorsâ views of risk assets are radically different than just a few months ago recent market stresses reflect two gaps that widened and then narrowed the first is the growth rate differential between the u s and other parts of the world the american economy accelerated while others slipped off the synchronized global growth track a theme that floated most investorsâ boats during 2017 the second gap in interest rate forecasts for the u s relates to tensions between federal reserve policy and market expectations fluctuating projections for interest rates signal a broader change in economic trends the u s started out 2018 on an even economic keel moderate growth falling unemployment and inflation in check except arguably for asset prices the fed was on a seemingly predictable course of gradually raising the benchmark rate a fiscal stimulus was already under way from tax cut legislation soon to be followed by two budget bills that increased federal spending as fiscal largesse revved the engine tightening monetary policy added more coolant the rise and fall near the growth inflection point mohammed el erian chief economic advisor at allianz sounded a cautionary note owing to policy action on several fronts â growth differentials will continue to favor the u s â he wrote in a lead article for bloomberg businessweek in june however â many elements of the surge are strained stretched and vulnerable to sudden disruptions â six months later the international money fundâ s chief economist affirmed the shift in relative growth speaking to reporters before he retired from the imf maurice obstfeld noted the loss of momentum in an increasing number of economies the â air coming out of the balloonâ would impact growth rates in the u s he said on top of â the withdrawal or reversal of some fiscal incentives â obstfeld is not expecting a recession in the u s only a progressive slowdown during 2019 and 2020 but the air comes out of the balloon faster than it goes in as bubble pundits like to say talk of american exceptionalism grew louder during 2018 and then subsided obstfeld also commented on â a more conflictual approach to international economic relationsâ that has eroded the authority of multilateral institutions the conflict has found a strident expression in escalating trade tensions this could be damaging because â so much of global investment and production is tied up in trade â obstfeld said though he does not expect a depression era collapse in trade the opposing forces of fiscal and trade policy on the economy which had been plodding along in the slow lane for years are now becoming clear the tax cuts and spending increases were like installing afterburners on a station wagon new tariffs imposed soon afterwards were more like pouring sand in the gearbox even though the u s economy is less export dependent than many in europe or asia it is not free of friction from trade spats tariffs impose direct costs on importers and lost business on exporters they could also throttle business investment which rose in response to the 2017 tax legislation and looser regulations then stalled later in 2018 these growth dampers are taking hold just as the fiscal stimulus from last year s tax cut legislation is starting to fade a big question for policymakers is whether sustained growth can justify the increase in deficit spending the u s treasury was projected to issue 1 34 trillion in new debt during 2018 unless the federal governmentâ s revenue growth is sufficient in coming years treasury issuance will have to increase further to cover the widening deficit rate expectations the fiscal effects on both gdp growth and national debt raised expectations for tighter monetary policy the fed had already started backing off from an accommodating stance in 2014 by scaling back its program of bond purchases known as quantitative easing or qe overnight lending rates set by the federal open market committee fomc had been rising slowly since 2015 real inflation adjusted rates were negative for an unusually long spell since the 2008 financial crisis then crossed into positive territory a few months ago by midyear the fomcâ s projections indicated the benchmark rate would peak at about 3 4 nominal before settling back in the longer term that meant several more quarter point increases as the fed continued to normalize interest rates financial markets never entirely bought into these projections though except for a brief rise in september and october the likelihood of two or three fed rate increases during 2019 has been low as estimated from futures contracts even that two month aberration looks in retrospect to be a misreading of the data toward the longer end of the government bond spectrum the 10 year yield peaked in november as adjusted for inflation it rose above 1 for the first time since 2011 that modest move came with slightly rising expectations for short term rates investors figured the economy was gaining enough strength that the fed could continue tightening policy without derailing it but technical factors were moving bond prices as robin wigglesworth and kate beioley pointed out in a financial times article a tax break altered the timing of companiesâ bond purchases and the cost of hedging currency risk rose high enough to dampen foreign demand for dollar denominated bonds both negatives hit at a time when china was reducing its holdings of u s government bonds for the fifth consecutive month the temporary repricing of long term treasuries made the yield curve steeper reinforcing the impression of a strong economy at the short end futures contracts showed that markets still expected a slower increase in policy rates and a lower terminal level than the fed consensus that explains in part the reaction to fed chairman jerome powell s unscripted comment in early october that rates were â a long way from neutral at this point probably â the prospect of higher borrowing costs unsettled equity investors and u s stocks promptly dropped from the yearâ s highs fickle in their forgiveness markets initially rose in an outpouring of relief after powell said in early december that rates were â just belowâ the range of neutral estimates where rates would not push economic growth either up or down but this range was fairly wide as of the september fomc meeting leading some fed watchers to argue that powell was simply stating a fact rather than signaling a change in policy whatever the mix of belief and reality its effect on interest rates was dramatic in the fed funds futures market traders soon erased three interest rate hikes that had been lined up on the runway for 2019 the rapid reversal turned out to be a setup for disappointment about the fedâ s last policy meeting of the year the trajectory for benchmark rates dropped only slightly with two quarter point increases in sight for 2019 and another one possible in 2020 the gap with futures derived projections remains wide implied yields indicate no rate hikes at all during 2019 and the possibility of a rate cut in 2020 see figure 1 figure 1 projected interest rate changes for 2019 and 2020 source bloomberg in a nod to market turmoil as well as signs of slowing growth mr powell emphasized during the post meeting news conference that rates were not on a preset course instead of â forward guidanceâ based on explicit signals about its plans the fomc would remain flexible and open to market signals that approach should help make course corrections around the â neutralâ interest rate which changes over time and is not directly observable with the benchmark rate moving up toward the range of neutral estimates â it makes good sense for the fed to become more data dependent â wrote eric winograd of alliancebernstein in an analysis of the fomc meeting it is consistent with past policymaking during times of heightened uncertainty for the fed to react more quickly to incoming information seemingly in contrast powell also sounded steadfast about keeping the bond roll off or quantitative tightening on â automatic pilot â the fed favors predictability in reducing its balance sheet human hands on the qt controls would add another source of uncertainty to intermittent rate increases and less reliance on forward guidance the fed has made smaller drawdowns in its balance sheet several times in the past decade but these mostly coincided with expansion by other central banks see figure 2 if balance sheet programs stay on track into 2019 net purchases by the g4 central

the rich are only defeated when running for their lives c l r james the black jacobins in less than two months the yellow vests gilets jaunes movement in france has reshaped the political landscape in europe for a seventh straight week demonstrations continued across the country even after concessions from a cowing president emmanuel macron while inspiring a wave of similar gatherings in neighboring states like belgium and the netherlands just as el sisi s dictatorship banned the sale of high visibility vests to prevent copycat rallies in egypt corporate media has predictably worked overtime trying to demonize the spontaneous and mostly leaderless working class movement in the hopes it will not spread elsewhere the media oligopoly initially attempted to ignore the insurrection altogether but when forced to reckon with the yellow vests they maligned the incendiary marchers using horseshoe theory to suggest a confluence between far left and far right supporters of jean luc mélenchon and marine le pen to the surprise of no one corporate media pundits have also stoked fears of russian interference behind the unrest we can assume that if the safety vests were ready made off the assembly line of ngos like the raised fist flags of serbia s otpor movement the presstitutes would be telling a different story it turned out that a crisis was not averted but merely postponed when macron defeated his far right opponent le pen in the 2017 french election while it is true that the gilets jaunes were partly impelled by an increase on fuel prices contrary to the prevailing narrative their official demands are not limited to a carbon tax they also consist of explicit ultimatums to increase the minimum wage improve the standard of living and an end to austerity among other legitimate grievances since taking office macron has declared war on trade unions while pushing through enormous tax breaks for the wealthy like himself it was just a matter of time until the french people had had enough of the country s privatization it is only a shock to the oblivious establishment why the former rothschild banker turned politician who addressed the nation seated at a gold desk while paris was ablaze is suddenly in jeopardy of losing power the status quo s incognizance is reminiscent of marie antoinette who during the 18th century when told the peasants had no bread purportedly replied let them eat cake as the masses starved under her husband louis xiv while the media s conspicuous blackout of coverage is partly to blame the deafening silence from across the atlantic in the united states is really because of the lack of class consciousness on its political left with the exception of occupy wall street the american left has been so preoccupied with an endless race to the bottom in the two party culture wars it is unable to comprehend an upheaval undivided by the contaminants of identity politics a political opposition that isn t fractured on social issues is simply unimaginable not to say the masses in france are exempt from the internal contradictions of the working class but the fetishization of lifestyle politics in the u s has truly become its weakness we will have to wait and see whether the yellow vests transform into a global movement or arrive in america but for now the seeming lack of solidarity stateside equates to a complicity with macron s agenda it serves as a reminder of the historically revisionist understanding of french politics in the u s that is long established the middle class dominated left wing in america ascribes to a historical reinterpretation of the french revolution that is a large contributor of its aversion to transformative praxis in favor of incrementalism the late italian marxist philosopher and historian domenico losurdo who died in june of this year offered the most thorough understanding of its misreading of history in seminal works such as war and revolution rethinking the twentieth century the liberal rereading of the french revolution is the ideological basis for its rejection of the revolutionary tradition from the jacobins to the bolsheviks that has neutralized the modern left to this day according to its revised history the inevitable outcome of comprehensive systemic change is robespierre s so called reign of terror or the purges of the stalin era in the soviet union in its view what began with the locke and montesquieu influenced reforms of the constitutional monarchy was hijacked by the radical jacobin and sans culotte factions losurdo explains that counter revolutionaries eager to discredit the image of rebellion overemphasize its violence and bloodshed and never properly contextualize it as self defense against the real reign of terror by the ruling class the idea behind this recasting of history is to conflate revolutionary politics with nazi germany whose racially motivated genocide was truly the inheritor of the legacy of european colonialism not the ancestry of the jacobins or the russian revolution maximilien robespierre s real crime in the eyes of bourgeois historians was attempting to fulfill the egalitarian ideals of republicanism by transferring political power from the aristocracy and nouveaux riche directly into the hands of the working class just as the paris commune did nearly 80 years later it is for this reason he subsequently became one of the most misunderstood and unfairly maligned figures in world history perhaps one day to be absolved the u s reaction to the yellow vests is a continuation of the denial and suppression of the class conflict inherent in the french revolution which continues to seethe beneath the surfaces of capitalism today in today s political climate it is easy to forget that there have been periods where the american left was actually engaged with the crisis of global capitalism in what seems like aeons ago the anti globalization movement in the wake of nafta culminated in huge protests in seattle in 1999 which saw nearly 50 000 march against the world trade organization following the 2008 financial collapse it briefly reemerged in the occupy movement which was also swiftly put down by corporate state repression currently the political space once inhabited by the anti globalization left has been supplanted by the anti globalist rhetoric mostly associated with right wing populism globalism and globalization may have qualitatively different meanings but they nevertheless are interrelated although it is shortsighted there are core accuracies in the former s narrative that should be acknowledged the idea of a shadowy world government isn t exclusively adhered to by anti establishment conservatives and it is right to suspect there is a worldwide cabal of secretive billionaire power brokers controlling events behind the scenes there is indeed a new world order with zero regard for the sovereignty of nation states just as there is a deep state however it is a ruling class not of paranoiac imagination but real life and a right wing billionaire like robert mercer is as much a globalist as george soros ever since capitalism emerged it has always been global the current economic crisis is its latest cyclical downturn impoverishing and alienating working people whose increasing hardship is what has led to the trending rejection of the eu imperialism has exported capital leading to the destruction of jobs in the home sectors of western nations while outsourcing them to the third world over time deep disgruntlement among the working class has grown toward an economic system that is clearly rigged against them where the skewed distribution of capital gains and widespread tax evasion on the part of big business is camouflaged as buoyant economic growth when it came crashing down in the last recession the financial institutions responsible were bailed out using tax payer money instead of facing any consequences such grotesque unfairness has only been amplified by the austerity further transferring the burden from the 1 to the poor before the gilets jaunes the u k s brexit referendum in 2016 laid bare these deep class divisions within the european union one of the most significant events in the continent since wwii it has ultimately threatened to reshape the occident s status in the post war order as a whole brexit manifested out of divisions within britain s political parties especially the tories which had been plagued for years by internal dispute over the eu those in power were blind to the warning signs of discontent toward a world economy in crisis and were shocked by the plebiscite in which the working class defied the powers that be against all odds with more than half voting to leave in general well to do brits were hard remainers while those suffering most severely from the destruction of industry unemployment and austerity overwhelmingly chose to leave in what was described as a peasants revolt by the media the value of the pound sterling quickly plunged and not long after the status of the united kingdom as a whole came into question as britain found itself at odds with scotland s unanimous decision to remain brexit tugged at the bonds holding the eu together and suddenly the collective standing clout of its member states is at stake in a potential breakup of the entire bloc euroscepticism is also by no means a distinctly british phenomenon as distrust has soared in countries hit the hardest by neoliberalism like greece 80 with spain and france not far behind in fact before there was brexit there was fear among the elite of a grexit in response to its unprecedented debt crisis manufactured by the international monetary fund imf the greek people elected the coalition of the radical left syriza to a majority of legislative seats to the hellenic parliament during its 2015 bailout referendum unfortunately the synthetic alliance turned out to be anything but radical and a trojan horse of the establishment syriza was elected on its promise to rescind the terms of greek membership in the eu but shortly after taking office it betrayed its constituency and agreed to the troika s mass privatization even its former finance minister yanis varousfakis admitted that syriza was a controlled opposition and auxiliary of the soros foundation apart from suffering collective amnesia regarding the eu s neoliberal policies apparently the modern left is also in serious need of a history lesson regarding the federation s fascist origins it has been truly puzzling to see self proclaimed progressives mourning britain s decision to withdraw from a continental union that was historically masterminded by former fifth columnists of nazi germany it was in the aftermath of wwii s devastation that the 1951 treaty of paris established the nucleus of the eu in the european coal and steel community a cooperative union formed by france italy west germany and the three benelux states belgium luxembourg and the netherlands the europe declaration charter stated by the signature of this treaty the involved parties give proof of their determination to create the first supranational institution and that thus they are laying the true foundation of an organized europe this europe remains open to all european countries that have freedom of choice we profoundly hope that other countries will join us in our common endeavor the idea of forming a supranational union was conceived by the french statesman robert schuman who during the outbreak of wwii served as the under secretary of state for refugees in the reynaud government when nazi germany invaded france in 1940 schuman by all accounts willingly voted to grant absolute dictatorial powers to marshall philippe pétain to become head of state of the newly formed vichy government the puppet regime that ruled nazi occupied france until the allied invasion in 1944 by doing so he retained his position in parliament though he later chose to resign following the war like all vichy collaborators schuman was initially charged with the offense of indignité nationale national unworthiness and stripped of his civil rights as a traitor more than 4 000 alleged quislings were summarily executed following operation overlord and the normandy landings but the future eu designer was fortunate enough to have friends in high places schuman s clemency was granted by none other than general charles de gaulle himself the leader of the resistance during the war and future french president instantly schuman s turncoat reputation was rehabilitated and his wartime activity whitewashed even though he had knowingly voted full authority to pétain the retention of his post in the vichy government was veneered to have occurred somehow without his knowledge or consent schuman is officially regarded as one of the eleven men who were founding fathers of what later became the eu one of the other major figures that contributed to the federal integration of the continent was konrad adenauer the first chancellor of the federal republic of germany the nuremberg trials may have tried and executed most of the top leadership of the nazi party but the post war government that became west germany was saturated with former third reich officials despite the purported post war denazification policy inscribed in the potsdam agreement many figures who had directly participated in the holocaust were appointed to high positions in adenauer s administration and never prosecuted for their atrocities one such war criminal was the former ministry of the interior and drafter of the nuremberg race statutes hans globke who became adenauer s right hand man as his secretary of state and chief of staff adenauer also successfully lobbied the allies to free most of the wehrmacht war criminals in their custody winning the support of then u s general and future president dwight eisenhower by 1951 motivated by the desire to quickly rearm and integrate west germany into nato in the new cold war the policy of denazification was prematurely ended and countless offenders were allowed to reenter branches of government military and public service their crimes against humanity took a backseat to the greater imperialist priority of rearmament against east germany and the soviets in the years following wwii there was also concern among the elite of anti americanism growing in western europe the annual bilderberg group conference was established in 1954 by prince bernard of the netherlands himself a former reiter ss corps and nazi party member to promote atlanticism and facilitate cooperation between american and european leaders invitations to the bilderberg club meetings were extended to only the most exclusive paragons in politics academia the media industry and finance in 2009 wikileaks revealed that it was at the infamous assembly where the hidden agenda of the european coal and steel community later the eu was set e european unity the discussion on this subject revealed general support for the idea of european integration and unification among the participants from the six countries of the european coal and steel community and a recognition of the urgency of the problem while members of the group held different views as to the method by which a common market could be set up there was a general recognition of the dangers inherent in the present divided markets of europe and the pressing need to bring the german people together with the other peoples of europe into a common market that the six countries of the coal and steel community had definitely decided to establish a common market and that experts were now working this out was felt to be a most encouraging step forward and it was hoped that other countries would subsequently join it at the 1955 conference the rudimentary idea for a european currency or what became the eurozone was even discussed three years before the treaty of rome which established the european economic community without the public s knowledge a european speaker expressed concern about the need to achieve a common currency and indicated that in his view this necessarily implied the creation of a central political authority the mysterious bilderberg gatherings are still held to this day under notorious secrecy and are frequently the subject of wild speculation one can imagine a topic behind the scenes at this year s meeting would be how to address the growth of anti eu populism and uprisings like the gilet jaunes hitlerite expansionism had been carried out on the führer s vision for a european federation in the third reich in many respects the eu is a rebranded realization of his plans for empire building how ironic that liberals are clinging to a multinational political union founded by fascist colluders while the same economic bloc is being opposed by today s far right after its new islamophobic facelift while nationalism may have played an instrumental role in brexit there is a manufactured hysteria hatched by the establishment which successfully reduced the complex range of reasons for the leave eu vote to racism and flag waving they are now repeating this pattern by overstating the presence of the far right among the yellow vests such delirium not only demonizes workers but coercively repositions the left into supporting something it otherwise shouldn t the eu and by default its laissez faire policies thereby driving the masses further into the arms of the same far right echoes of this can be seen in the u s with the vapid response to journalist angela nagle s recent article about the immigration crisis on the southern border the faux left built a straw man in their attack on nagle who dared to acknowledge that the establishment only really wants open borders for an endless supply of low wage labor from regions in the global south destabilized by u s militarism and trade liberalization aligning itself with the hollow symbolic gestures of centrists has only deteriorated the standards of the left participating in such vacuousness and dragged down to the level of liberals there is no doubt brexit and trump pushed the xenophobia button and could not have come about without it however such criticism means nothing when it comes from moral posturers who claim to stand with refugees while supporting the very humanitarian interventionist policies displacing them nativism was not the sole reason the majority voted to leave the eu and many working class minorities also were brexiters of course their fellow workers and migrants are not the true cause of their misery after all it was not just chattel slaves who came to the u s unwillingly but european immigrants fleeing continental wars and starvation as well the crisis in the eu today is no different fundamentally migrants seek asylum on europe s doorstep because of nato s imperial expansion and the unexpected arrival of brexit has threatened to weaken the eu s military arm already desperate to reinvent itself and a new enemy in russia despite its functional obsolescence the shock of the referendum has inconveniently undermined nato s ability to pressure moscow and beijing a step forward for mitigating world peace in the long run and a silver lining to its outcome it is the task of the left to reject the eu s neoliberal project while transmitting the message that capital not refugees is the cause of the plight of the masses it is also necessary to have faith in the people something cynical liberals lack racism may historically be the achilles heel of the working class but underlying brexit the election of trump and the yellow vests is the spirit of defiance in working people albeit one of political confusion in need of guidance if the yellow vests are today s sans culottes like those which became the revolutionary partisans in the french revolution they will eventually need a jacobin club relatively progressive but ultimately reformist figures like mélenchon are no such spearhead and will only lead them down the same dead end of syriza the absence of any such vanguard has forced the working class to take matters into their own hands in the interim if history is any guide the gilets jaunes will be stamped out until a new cadre takes the reins whose objective is as lenin said not to champion the degrading of the revolutionary to the level of an amateur but to raise the amateurs to the level of revolutionaries we also cannot fall into ideological fantasies that we live in permanent revolutionary circumstances or that a spontaneous uprising can become comprehensive simply because of ingenious leadership nevertheless as mao zedong wrote a single spark can start a prairie fire and hopefully the yellow vests are that flame

verifyerrors message verifyerrors verifyerrors something went wrong please try again later verifyerrors twelve months ago the global economic outlook was encouraging strong even 2017 had seen the best year of international gdp growth since the aftermath of the financial crisis and 2018 seemed to offer even better the global cyclical upswing that began midway through 2016 continues to gather strength reported the head of economics at the international monetary fund maury obstfeld stock markets were booming business confidence was high consumer sentiment was robust it looked like the world was finally shaking off the painful memory of the global financial crisis a decade ago now things are looking far less rosy true on the surface not much has changed the international monetary fund expects global growth in 2019 to come in at 3 7 per cent the same as expected for 2018 and 2017 yet this is a downgrade from the 3 9 per cent the fund was expecting eight months ago and the consensus among private sector economists is that it will be only 3 6 per cent us growth is expected to slow quite markedly from 2 9 per cent in 2018 to 2 5 per cent in 2019 as the stimulus from donald trump s unfunded tax cuts wears off expansion projections in the us germany and france have also been shaved down there have also been downgrades for china india brazil mexico and south africa closer to the ground things look even uglier the german italian and japanese economies unexpectedly contracted in the third quarter of 2018 in the most recent official gdp data from those countries the german contraction mainly due to factory closures in its automotive sector was the first since 2015 chinese growth in the third quarter 6 5 per cent year on year was the lowest for a decade survey indicators of activity by sector have slumped in most countries since the summer and stock markets have also wilted dramatically over the past few months the msci world index of shares has slid 15 per cent since september and ended the year down more than a tenth from where it started emerging market stock exchanges are also in a bear market meaning they have fallen more than a fifth since their recent highs the expansion may have peaked warns the imf we have had a good stretch of solid growth by historical standards but now we are facing a period where significant risks are materialising and darker clouds are looming says the fund s managing director christine lagarde what next for global growth so what explains those darkening clouds to put it concisely the answers seem to be trade wars rising us interest rates and brexit donald trump s trade aggression towards china his tariffs on 200bn of imports and threats of more appear to be finally hitting the real economy undermining sentiment among firms harming investment new export orders for manufacturers have fallen into contraction territory in germany and china container port traffic growth has also decelerated sharply despite the rhetoric from washington and beijing the deal between the two nations at the g20 in buenos aires in december is plainly a temporary ceasefire rather than an armistice the imf calculates that trump s threatened car import tariffs on all countries except canada and mexico could hit global gdp in the immediate term by 0 75 per cent the paris based organisation for economic cooperation and development is just as worried it estimates that tariff hostilities could knock up to 2 per cent off world trade by 2021 then there s monetary policy the president s domestic tax cuts have clearly boosted short term gdp growth in the world s largest economy but they have also prompted the us central bank to raise interest rates to head off what it sees as the threat of unstable inflation the federal funds rate now stands at 2 5 per cent and at least two more hikes are priced in by markets for 2019 in the past an inversion of the us borrowing yield curve where 10 year rates dip below two year rates has presaged an american recession weak rises in long yields relative to spiking short term yields this year means that an inversion seems to be getting steadily closer debt falling growth and rising rates expose sovereigns to the risk of shocks moody s credit rating agency the gradual increase in interest rates by the us federal reserve has been enough to raise the value of the dollar undermine confidence in emerging markets and tighten global monetary conditions says gavyn davies of fulcrum asset management this process may or may not end in recession but it is certainly already causing recovery fatigue in most parts of the world economy tightening of the us monetary system tends to hit emerging markets there has been an abrupt stop of capital flows to emerging markets over recent months which has created painful consequences for with large external deficits says adam slater of oxford economics the spectre of monetary tightening and its impact also haunts europe the eurozone economy expanded by just 0 2 per cent in the third quarter of 2018 its slowest quarterly pace in more than four years memories of 2017 when the single currency grew by 2 4 per cent its fastest rate in a decade are long gone the imf projects growth of only 1 9 per cent in 2019 for the eurozone that may be overoptimistic in italy growth is expected to slow from 1 2 per cent to 1 per cent next year despite the avoidance of sanctions from the european commission over its budget plans the populists in rome have backed down on borrowing for now but the fire could yet reignite in the new year and the european central bank has signalled that this slowdown and political strife will not prompt it to re start its 2 6 trillion monetary stimulus programme which ended this month finally there is brexit the imf has pencilled in non catastrophic growth for the uk economy next year of 1 5 per cent up from 1 4 per cent in 2017 but this is of course was predicated on the assumption of a smooth exit from the eu next march or rather entry into a 21 month single market and customs union transition where nothing really changes the bank of england says that if brexit is on the contrary economically disruptive and we get no deal with the eu the uk economy could contract by 3 per cent and in a worst case scenario of a disorderly no deal brexit it could contract by 8 per cent that would make the economic collapse bigger than that in the global financial crisis in 2008 that s a relatively low probability downside risk rather than a baseline of course but on the tenth anniversary of the financial meltdown it s as well to remember that sometimes perceived low probability downside risks materialise and they do so with no mercy the other great lesson from the financial crisis in 2008 is that risks can materialise from unexpected quarters perhaps a political shock could come from another refugee surge from the middle east or north africa or maybe it could come from a devastating cyberattack on business or government support free thinking journalism and attend independent events in the november budget the office for budget responsibility put the odds of another uk recession over the next five years on a historical basis at 50 per cent if the wider world economy does stumble into contraction over the next 12 months it s also important to bear in mind that government debt burdens are significantly higher than they were a decade ago and that interest rates in the advanced world could not fall as far as they did then this may limit the room for stabilising monetary and fiscal measures from governments high debt falling growth and rising rates expose sovereigns to the risk of shocks that undermine debt affordability and sustainability cautions the credit rating agency moody s and as gordon brown observed this year in this era of trade wars and fraying multilateralism we may not have the worldwide cooperation necessary to get us out of another global crisis like 2008 for the world and especially britain 2019 looks set to be a year of living dangerously
2018 was a rollercoaster year for currency markets as divergent monetary policy prompted substantial shifts in fx markets with the us dollar usd outperforming against a host of peer currencies while the pound sterling gbp became increasingly brexit embroiled prompting a decline in the gbp usd exchange rate of around 6 over the course of the year while us dollar strength and stability was apparent throughout the year the us dollar softened into the tail end of 2018 as cracks in robust economic growth began to emerge a tilt towards data dependence from the fed coupled with global economic concerns with regards to trade and politics look set to continue into 2019 with investors predicting an imminent peak dollar the pound sterling suffered significantly in currency markets with a distinct lack of clarity over brexit weighing heavily on investors and economic activity alike while a resolution remains elusive the clock is ticking and for better or worse 2019 promises to yield a solution to the ongoing crisis january pound sterling gbp continues 2017 bull run against lacklustre us dollar usd the start of 2018 saw a bullish pound sterling gbp exchange rate complex appreciate considerably versus a basket of peer currencies continuing the uptrend versus the us dollar gbp usd which dominated throughout 2017 and saw the us dollar slide 8 6 versus the gbp peaking at a high of 1 43455 the strongest level since the uk s eu membership referendum in june 2016 above pound sterling us dollar gbp usd exchange rate january 2018 for the sterling tight labour market conditions with the unemployment rate 4 3 close to 40 year lows coupled with strong purchasing manager index figures across manufacturing construction and services sectors continued to buoy the currency against a usd weighed by low inflation despite three 2017 fed rate hikes and considerable tax reforms the us dollar showed considerable weakness throughout 2017 with the ice dollar index which measures the usd versus the other g7 currencies registering a 10 fall and marking the largest annual decline for the greenback since 2003 advertisement above annual performance of the us dollar usd index economic data in january did little to remove pressure from the dollar as us producer prices fell for the first time in almost 18 months in light of declining costs for services and further tempering inflation expectations for 2018 weak wholesale prices also weighed with mufg chief economist chris rupkey commenting factories aren t producing as much inflation which is sure to bedevil the doves at the fed who are worried about too low inflation today s data strike at the heart of the argument over whether fed officials should let the economy run hot for a while longer with a shallower path of rate hikes despite a rise in unemployment insurance claimants in december 2017 the increase was attributed to seasonal weather restrictions hampering employee efforts to attend work as the labour market overall remained near full employment with jobless claims at a 17 year low of 4 1 meanwhile in the uk robust economic data releases led to speculation over a potential interest rate hike from the bank of england boe with rising expectations of a further quarter point rate hike following november s 25bps hike economist john hawksworth commented if this pattern of solid jobs growth and a gradual pick up in earnings growth were to persist through the year then this could push the mpc towards a further interest rate rise later in 2018 february uk economic data falters gbpusd trades sideways as us fails to capitalise on the brexit front pm may reshuffled her cabinet putting forward her best brexit team in anticipation of the triggering of article 50 and uk eu negotiations addressing the house of lords boe governor mark carney outlined the central bank s unbiased stance around brexit commenting we don t have a bias in terms of the outcome we look at the economic forces however the negotiations go how it affects the exchange rate how it affects the supply side of the economy and how it affects demand although he did make clear indications that arelatively smooth brexit would likely stimulate business investment while the 2017 trend line up remained intact throughout february the gbp usd exchange rate failed to form a higher high during february with a run of successively lower highs as economic data failed to overwhelm investors the gbp usd x rate traded sideways for the majority of the month with price action trading in a narrowing range above pound sterling us dollar gbp usd exchange rate february 2018 uk pmis moderated somewhat with construction manufacturing and services measures already printing beyond forecast drops and the services pmi hitting a 16 month low of 53 0 retail sales grew slower than expected at 0 1 m m versus a forecasted increase of 0 5 contrasting expectations of a decline the consumer price index cpi maintained at 3 0 providing the impetus for a mid month gbp rally the measure of inflation continued to outstrip wage growth which printed a 2 5 increase 3m y and remained stubbornly above the boe s 2 target above uk inflation and wage data source ons labour s shadow chief secretary to the treasury commented on the implications for consumer spending and household debt with inflation remaining around a five year high working people are still seeing their incomes squeezed as wages fail to keep up with prices and household debt levels soar in the us early february data releases were overwhelmingly positive with manufacturing expanding average earning accelerating and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4 1 consumer sentiment also crept up attributed in part to the recent tax cuts commenting director of the university of michigan consumer survey who compiled the findings richard curtin said the tax reform will preserve sentiment at its high levels now so we re more likely not to see a decline over the year ahead than to see declines us inflation measures also ticked up with cpi and core cpi printing increases of 0 5 and 0 3 respectively leading market participants to speculate on the lack of a usd rally alessio de longis of oppenheimerfunds commented we are in an environment where the dollar is weakening regardless of the move in interest rates while others including deutsche bank currency strategist alan ruskin attributed the muted response to riskoff trades placed immediately after the cpi release as having come bouncing back helped by equity resilience march brexit optimism and hints of boe rate hike embolden gbp bulls price action for the pound sterling us dollar gbp usd exchange rate once again turned to the upside in march as key brexit developments helped to boost sentiment for the gbp overall the x rate appreciated from a low of 1 37117 to retake 1 42 towards the end of the month before a slight pullback to see out the month above 1 41 above pound sterling us dollar gbp usd exchange rate march 2018 in response to requests from non tory mps the house of lords conceded the need for a meaningful vote to be part of the brexit process amending the brexit bill to include a vote in the house of commons over any proposed withdrawal agreements chancellor of the exchequer phillip hammond s announcement of a 26b cushion to protect the economy through brexit was also met with positivity the collapse of construction giant carillion impacted confidence and dragged construction output figures which registered a 3 4 m m decline representing the fastest constraction in the sector since october 2016 cpi missed printing 2 7 the lowest level since the previous august the sterling however continued to pressure the us dollar with the gbpusd exchange rate rising unabated highlighting market participant focus on brexit developments as a key exchange rate driver as opposed to domestic economic activity in the us the economy registered its 106th consecutive month of growth according to ism manufacturing data printed early in the month the index hit 60 8 the joint highest level in 5 years alternative economic statistics were a mixed bag with ppi moderating less than expected to 0 2 while core retail sales missed forecasts and the pace of wage growth fell to just 0 1 downplaying concerns over market volatility federal reserve chairman powell reiterated the central bank s intention to hike interest rates further emphasising robust labour market conditions solid consumer spending and accelerating wage growth indicative of usd price action to come powell said after easing substantially during 2017 financial conditions in the united states have reversed some of that easing adding at this point we do not see these developments as weighing heavily on the outlook for economic activity the labor market and inflation indeed the economic outlook remains strong fomc members raised the federal funds rate to 1 75 but comments from powell indicated future hikes would become increasingly data dependent as opposed to the result of theoretical model based analysis spooking investors somewhat april tides turn as us reports strong q1 growth and sterling sentiment wanes buoyed by brexit optimism and continued speculation over a boe rate hike the pound sterling pressured peer currencies in early april pushing exchange rate to local highs versus the us dollar the gbpusd exchange rate hit a 22 month peak of 1 437 with the benefit of hindsight this represented peak sterling for the year with april marking a significant reversal in mid term sentiment for the gbpusd pair above pound sterling us dollar gbp usd exchange rate april 2018 pmi releases early in the month did little to deter sterling bulls as the prospect of a rate hike was supported by the mpc member vote breakdown from the previous month in which 2 of 9 members voted to immediately hike rates the labour market remained a positive factor with unemployment dropping to a fresh 42 month low of 4 2 and average earnings outpacing cpi for the first time in over a year however ecostats released later in the month began to weigh on the sterling as cpi missed forecasts falling to 2 5 the lowest level since april 2017 senior economist at the institute of directors tek parikh commented today s figures show a significant drop in inflation and it is expected to continue to fall over the course of this year this will be welcomed by the business community who have seen high inflation act as a major speed bump on economic growth ever since the beginning of last year prime minister may s brexit plans were also dealt a blow as her own cabinet voted down her customs union proposal albeit by a narrow margin 6 to 5 sensational headlines surrounding pm may s ability to lead ensued heightening political tension and adding significant uncertainty to the brexit outlook in the us advance estimates of q1 gdp exceeded forecasts of 2 0 printing an annual increase of 2 3 alongside solid consumer confidence figures and a rebound in retail sales 0 6 cpi missed registering a decline of 0 1 the first contraction since june 2017 while ppi exceeded forecasted growth increasing 0 3 m m us china trade tension saw some elevation as president trump launched a scathing verbal assault on chinese trade policies as he levied tariffs on several chinese exports and demanded cooperation from china in cutting the trade deficit with the us plans were proposed to hike tariffs on 200b of chinese goods at the start of 2019 us foreign policy also provided a boost to the us dollar upon a change of risk appetite as pressure on north korea resulted in the suspension of continued missile tests which had weighed on global sentiment may gbp usd exchange rate slides as boe moderate growth forecasts price action for the pound sterling us dollar gbpusd exchange rate took a muted tone in may as the x rate slowly and steadily declined from an open just below 1 38 to an end of month close at 1 33 as downgraded boe forecasts confirmed developing gbp pessimism above pound sterling us dollar gbp usd exchange rate may 2018 while the bank rate was held at 0 5 in line with the general consensus among investors the sharp downward revision of growth forecasts took the wind out of gbp bulls sails as growth estimates for 2018 reduced from 1 8 to 1 4 with boe governor carney citing continuing challenges fuelled by hopes of a rate hike ahead of the boe s rates release and monetary policy summary inflation continued to take a hit with the consumer price index extending its moderation to a 1 year low of 2 3 consumer confidence also fell during the month alongside house prices and q1 gdp printed a slim 0 1 growth figure the lowest in 5 years as concerns over the brexit route ahead became increasingly unclear controversy over the irish backstop solution which would see the uk remain in a customs union with the eu should the parties fail to agree to an overarching treaty during the transition period took centre stage in brexit negotiations with hard line brexiteers amongst other overtly opposed to such an arrangement irish prime minster leo varadkar commented if we are not making real and substantial progress by june then we need to seriously question whether we re going to have a withdrawal agreement at all fuelling investor concerns and piling pressure on pm may to address the lacklustre progress of negotiations thus far in the us mixed messages from the fomc curtailed any extravagant usd rallies or sell offs as statements from fomc members leading investors to believe a rate hike could be on the agenda in the next june federal funds rate decision contrasted starkly with minutes indicating a dovish stance reiterating data dependence both cpi and core cpi measures of inflation failed to hit forecasts printing 0 2 and 0 1 respectively as retail sales once again contracted and preliminary gdp q q printed a lower than forecast 2 2 june uk pmis

incurred in the previous month with regards to the pmi figures expectations were tempered somewhat by the supplementary commentary from ihs markit director rob dobson who said a slowdown in new order inflows meant the expansion in production was achieved only by firms working through their backlogs of work weaker than expected sales meanwhile led to the largest rise in unsold stock in the survey s 26 year history hopes for a rate hike were once again heightened as the breakdown of mpc members voting for a hike showed that 3 of 9 supported an immediate upwards adjustment of interest rates an excerpt from the minutes read three members favoured an immediate increase in bank rate these members had a higher degree of confidence that the slowdown in q1 was temporary or erratic and would largely be unwound economic data releases for the us were a mixed bag for the month of june with labour conditions improving moderately as average earnings edged up 0 3 alongside a non farm employment

highlight brexit as a key concern a unanimous vote by monetary policy committee mpc members to raise the uk s official bank rate above 0 5 for the first time since the financial crisis did little to stem the accelerating decline of the pound sterling versus the us dollar in early to mid august as brexit concerns highlighted by mpc meeting minutes overshadowed any gbp optimism above pound sterling

influenced significantly by the response of households businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of eu withdrawal expectations for a no deal brexit saw a marked increase in august with trade minister liam fox predicting a no deal outcome as the most likely scenario while boe governor carney commented that the odds of a disorderly exit were uncomfortably high chancellor of the exchequer phillip hammond did little to alleviate concerns as he voiced an opinion that uk gdp could fall by 10 in the event of a no deal brexit while pm may commented that such a scenario wouldn t be the end of the world the gbp did get some reprieve from the overwhelming brexit negativity later in the month as the eu s chief brexit negotiator michel barnier commented that we

agreement including the current brexit secretary dominic raab and mep jacob rees mogg alongside the submission of letters of no confidence in pm may highlighted government fragility prompting the worst single trading day 15th november for the sterling since october 2016 as the gbp usd x rate tumbled upwards of 1 5 in the space of a few hours the following week the president of the european commission donald tusk provided some support for the gbp as he tweeted i have just sent to eu27 a draft political declaration on the future relationship between eu and uk the commission president has informed me that it has been agreed at negotiators level and agreed in principle at political level subject to the endorsement of the leaders prompting a short lived rally following suit pm may confirmed a technical agreement had been reached between uk and eu negotiators saying we have an agreed text between the uk and european commission before announcing the intention to conduct a meaningful vote on the withdrawal agreement on december 11th for the us dollar usd the start of the month saw a softer greenback in the wake of renewed hope for a us china trade war resolution as presidents trump and xi agreed to a temporary 90 day ceasefire to trade hostilities as a precursor to reopening high stakes trade negotiations the agreement meant a proposed hike of tariffs from 10 to 25 on 200b of imported chinese goods due to take effect at the beginning of 2019 would be delayed as the two sides attempt to reach a mutually agreeable long term solution to the tit for tat tariff war while a statement issued by the white house stated china has agreed to start purchasing agricultural product from our farmers immediately leading chinese diplomat wang yi said discussion on economic and trade issues was very positive and constructive the two heads of state reached consensus to halt the mutual increase of new tariffs adding china is willing to increase imports in

preliminary gdp estimates for q3 printed 3 5 indicating a decrease in the pace of growth from q2 but still on track to hit the annual target of 3 0 analysis of the release revealed a faster pace of

uncertainties weigh amid brexit gridlock pound sterling to us dollar gbpusd price action remained choppy in december with a mid month yearly low of 1 24765 highlighting the significant level of investor uncertainty in the gbp above pound sterling us dollar gbp usd exchange rate december 2018 straining uk eu relations prompted sabre rattling commentary from both sides as pm may found herself between a rock and hard place with the eu staunchly opposing the possibility of reopening negotiations over the uk s withdrawal agreement and mps in the uk refusing to back it donald tusk stated if this deal is rejected in the commons we are left with as was already stressed a few weeks ago by prime minister may an alternative no deal or no brexit at all 5 days of brexit centric debates in the house of commons ahead of the expected 11th december meaningful vote devolved into bitter political infighting with the government being found in contempt of parliament over the partial release of legal guidance sought over brexit upon full release the reason for the government s initial hesitance became immediately clear as the advice highlighted the already controversial irish backstop arrangements as a point of legal concern with the risk of the arrangement which would see the uk tied in to a customs union with the eu enduring indefinitely with little motivation for the eu to reach an accord and no leverage for the uk to seek an alternative the european court of justice ecj responding to a request from a group of scottish politicians ruled in the favour of the uk s ability to unilaterally decide to renege on article 50 essentially halting the uk s exit from the european union should it choose to do so this presented a further stumbling block for pm may s attempts to portray her deal or no deal as the only viable routes with pro eu and pro peoples vote campaigners bolstered as parliamentary debates increasingly highlighted the fierce criticism pm may s withdrawal bill faced in the house of commons with estimates of the meaningful vote results in light of those mps who had publicly declared their intention pointing to an overwhelming defeat pm may called off the vote just a day before it was scheduled to take place prompting a fresh bout of no confidence letters reaching the threshold and triggering a vote of no confidence having survived the vote of no confidence by a margin of 83 votes 200 to 117 pm may immediately returned to brussels to seek assurances over the irish backstop arrangements which would appease enough mps to see her agreement passed commenting on the debates as nebulous and often imprecise jean claude juncker president of the european council joined other eu officials in refusing to offer any assurances until the prime minister stated her requests more clearly returning the uk amidst near frantic levels of brexit panic pm may s cabinet addressed the elephant in the room discussing departmental funding requirements in the event of a no deal scenario similarly the eu laid down 14 contingency plans to provide basic connectivity should an agreement fail to be reached on the data front wage growth in the uk outpaced inflation with a 3m y increase of 3 3 while manufacturing output printed a significant decline of 0 9 m m and gdp for the three months to october rose 0 4 moderating from the previous 0 6 printing in

pound sterling rebound looking at the year ahead it s clear that the fate of the pound sterling whether it be and upside rebound or incurs further losses remains brexit contingent with the nature of the uk s departure from the eu central to the mid term outlook for the gbp as well as the uk economy as a whole while expectations of a smooth transition remain a no deal scenario has increased in likelihood and would become the default arrangement should the uk and eu fail to ratify a deal before march 29th in lieu of an extension for the us dollar economic growth moderated towards the tail end of the year and this moderation is expected to continue onto 2019 with institutional forecasts predicting a peak dollar following a final leg up to give way to peer currencies with regards to the pound sterling us dollar gbpusd exchange rate forecasts vary broadly given a the various potential brexit scenarios and b the unquantifiable factors therein projections range from a 1 10 worst case

key points discussed the texas oil revolution diminishing effectiveness of monetary policy commodity prices and the trade war facade perverse incentives and the inverted credit cycle the chinese debt load forecasts and trading strategies for 2019 in this interview senior market analyst tyler yell speaks to chief economist and best selling author daniel lacalle about his latest work the end of qe in a low growth environment and crude oil expectations for 2019 we will touch on some of the key talking points in this write up but be sure to check out the podcast for the full interview stitcher the texas oil revolution the recent shale boom in the us along with reduced bottlenecks resulted in the us becoming a net exporter of oil for the first time in decades daniel explains how this was made possible tyler yell you wrote two wonderful books one of them is the energy world is flat can you share with the audience some of the key points that drove you to write this well respected book daniel lacalle in the energy world is flat the idea was to debunk the theory that we were going to be living in an environment in which supply would be scarce and we would have tremendous inflation in energy commodities it s an analysis of both the demand and supply environments for oil but also talks about renewable energy the book explores how new technology efficiencies and improvements lead to a disinflationary environment and highlights the radical role of natural gas in this beautifully disinflationary environment this means that supply will be more abundant and lead to a better energy environment for everybody this is the key factor in driving growth it s basically a book that talks about improvements in technology and diversification ty in the book your co author diego parrilla mentions that the last barrel of oil will not be as valuable as one would imagine this just reinforces the 10 forces that you identify in the book that are flattening the energy world could you shed some more light on how these forces are playing out today dl absolutely yes i think it was the ex ceo of exxon rex tillerson who said the energy world did not have a problem of resources it only had a problem with access and development of those resources i think that what has happened in this period of low interest rates and high liquidity there has been a massive improvement that has led to the energy revolution in texas which has propelled the us in very little time from a net importer of oil to essentially being energy independent this very factor has helped drive what we call in the book the energy broadband which is this absolutely massive level of investment in diversification and technology and alternative sources of energy like natural gas and renewables what we are seeing is this beautiful role of competition between the different sources of energy that has contributed to the decline in the average household bill for electricity and gas decline despite high growth in the economy and alleged geopolitical challenges in the supply chain develop your oil trading knowledge with our free guide understanding the core fundamentals of oil trading the diminishing effect of monetary policy ty you wrote another great book escape from the central bank trap can you share with the audience some of the key points that drove you to write this well respected book dl escape from the central bank trap talks about from a constructive perspective the challenges that we are facing after this monstrous increase in liquidity injections central banks balance sheets soaring and lowering interest rates to all time lows the idea of the book is to be critical and at the same time constructive as there are differing opinions on the effectiveness of monetary policy currently ty in reference to these two books one would assume they are different topics but in the same breath a lot of the trouble the central bank is having is that inflation is nowhere to be found and energy is such a key driver of inflation it seems like technology has backed central banks into a corner because inflation is harder to come by what are your thoughts on this dl central planners are looking at the economy with a rear view mirror specifically in terms of how price formation happened in the past therefore they try to implement the same measures that they used in the past in order to drive inflation and growth but these measures don t work anymore technology is working as a fantastic disinflationary factor but also the world is much more interconnected it is a lot more difficult to get those drivers of inflation that existed in price formation and the appearance of technology giants has a key part to play in this central banks through liquidity injections and low rates have been driving absolutely amazing amounts of investment into technology this is similar to what we saw during the tech bubble in that we are now seeing what we call the energy broadband the result of this increased investment will lead to better access to different products and services which will undermine the efforts of the central bank to inflate prices in an attempt to deflate debt at the end of the day monetary policy becomes disinflationary because it is perpetuating overcapacity for a better understanding of quantitative easing qe check out these articles form dailyfx commodity prices and the trade war façade ty recently you were in the ig studio and you made a great point very clear about how trade wars are not the main story with commodities but rather the growth picture as a whole can you shed more light on that see our infographic for a brief history of trade wars dl it is less about trade wars and more about general growth issues it all starts from the incorrect diagnosis of the economy central banks and governments look at the global financial crisis as a problem of demand therefore they push interest rates lower and liquidity higher in order to incentivise demand artificially what ends up happening is that every incremental unit of money supply provides a lower placebo effect in the market what you tend to see is that growth and inflation is lower than anticipated while debt increases the sugar rush that has been created by lowering rates and increasing liquidity tends to remain in the economy but doesn t translate into higher demand growth capital expenditure and industrial production ty following on from your sugar rush analogy i recently presented a podcast show based on what former fed president richard fisher mentioned in an interview back in 2016 in which he basically said that they pumped the markets full of stimulants in a medical sense a patient does not immediately climb down from such a high and bringing this back to markets it seems like this is where we are now related article from tyler yell are capital markets ready to come off a stimulus high dl that s exactly it it puzzles central bankers how quickly the data points worsen and we might see the central bank delaying its decisions we are seeing a diminishing effect on monetary stimulus as we are using the same tools to create excess capacity and excess debt but the reality of what demand needs is completely different simply put another dose of stimulants is not going to get the economy pumped up we are also witnessing money supply continuing to grow despite the fact that central bank balance sheets are winding down where we find ourselves is in the middle of a 20 trillion experiment and we have never been here before markets reacting poorly as central bank balance sheets wind down perverse incentives and the inverted credit cycle ty towards the end of 2018 the bank of japan balance sheet has exceeded the annual output of the economy this is a fitting example of how central banks seem to have hit a wall and hence the signalling effect is disconnected what are your thoughts dl this is something i have discussed with a well know advocate for central bank policies where i asked him why japanese citizens don t spend at the levels central planners would like them to this is because japanese citizens have a long memory and know that the result of large scale money printing is stagflation therefore they prepare for stagnation by spending moderately after the european real estate bubble it seems increasingly unlikely that people are prepared to borrow aggressively to buy a home or take on excessive levels of debt citizens are more aware of the ramifications monetary stimulus ty the signalling effect and the drive that puts entrepreneurs to work is being taken out of the market because of this flood of capital this aligns with something that you have said which is that cheap money overtime becomes expensive in the long run do you agree dl absolutely the reason why money needs to be relatively scarce is because it promotes the creative positive cycle of credit you have a short term credit cycle in which the efficient industries benefit from credit and also the cost of credit penalises the inefficient and over levered so what you do by lowering interest rates and injecting liquidity is you completely change the cycle the short term cycle becomes massively beneficial to over indebted low productivity sectors and to government for current spending this generates a negative effect for high productivity sectors because deficits soar and the tax burden increase for these sectors the long term credit cycle that should be driven by higher productivity growth in stronger industries ends up being corroded investors entrepreneurs and governments actually have a perverse incentive to do what is bad spending more and taking on more debt the chinese debt load china has been aggressively adding to their existing debt what could this mean for markets ty it is difficult to talk about inverted credit cycles without thinking about china you ve mentioned that their economy which has been a driver of global growth would be akin to bursting bubble dominos can you please explain more on that dl think about what we have discussed already the problem of the economy is incorrectly diagnosed as a problem of demand over capacity and levels of investment are incentivised with the reasoning that there is one massive country out there that is going to absorb all of that the us and the european union have been doing this but now china is creating its own overcapacity by doing all of this themselves i m not criticising that but what is shows is that there is a domino effect the reason why i don t believe in a massive crisis in this environment of stagnation is because the imbalances built in china will be dealt with by central planning entities like the chinese government and therefore it is more likely that we will move into a long term stagnation ty why do you think investors fail to grasp the china contagion risk dl there is this very keynesian view that because the massive debt problem seen in china is fundamentally in yuan takin by local banks that it can be managed without contagion by printing and devaluing this doesn t work because at the end of the process you see that devaluation is not a tool for growth and is more likely to result in stagnation devaluation exports disinflation to the rest of the world and locally it damages the purchasing powers of salaries of families that are already highly indebted you may argue that salaries are devalued but so is the existing debt however in reality these two effects do not materialise at the same time and the analysis of inflation can become tricky forecasts and trading strategies for 2019 crude oil price in focus ty turning to commodities the synchronised growth has become unhinged and we may well be moving toward secular stagnation what are your thoughts here and how does that affect crude oil and other commodities in 2019 dl in my opinion we are already starting to see that process if disinflation which has nothing to do with whether the fed hikes rates or if there is a trade war it is something deeper rooted in over indebtedness and over capacity therefore what was seen was not synchronised growth but rather synchronised debt growth when you have synchronised debt growth deficits that were already a problem in important economies will rise further as long as crude oil and other commodity prices are going down the massive wall of debt falling due plus any additional debt is going to subtract a lot of liquidity from the market the biggest bear signal is that all these deficits will be refinanced there is not going to be a debt crisis and defaults as these debts will be refinanced even at higher rates therefore liquidity will be sucked out of other risky assets it was mentioned to me that in 2019 and 2020 you have the equivalent of 2 qes of new debt financing being added to the economy i think that the likelihood of the process of multiple expansion that we saw in the last 10 years will continue to deflate at the same time earnings growth might continue to be positive for many industries for example it s going to be great for eu that the crude oil price leading into 2019 is around 50 a barrel but there is still a gradual move towards stagnation ty from a portfolio manager or even individual trader point of view that the buy and hold strategy days are over and it seems like a lot of the success that we will see will depend on identifying pockets of weakness on the short side as opposed to the robust growth we have seen in tech and other industries of late do you have any thoughts on what type of portfolio managers or strategies might outperform in the future dl i think you need to avoid passive investment you need to be a lot more active and that short term economic cycles are going to be very powerful and attractive i always refer my clients to the long term trend of the nikkei with special focus on the ups and downs it is like throwing a ball down the stairs the bumps are impressive so i think we need to be a lot more active and more short term focused instead of having the mindset that everything will be fine in the long term graph nikkei long term trend exhibiting shorter term swings in price weekly chart we need to avoid in my opinion the two most risky parts of the investment world these are the sovereign bonds of countries experiencing problems with growth and stagnation that are yielding negative real rates as well as avoiding those sectors that are cheap for a reason mega cap conglomerates with no growth so it s going to be a lot less about industries indices and sectors and more about taking those opportunities by being more active but at the same time more cautious keep up to date with the latest insights from daniel be sure to connect with him

source xinhua 2019 01 03 12 55 40 editor wx video player close washington jan 2 xinhua u s economic growth is expected to slow down in 2019 due to factors including the diminishing effect of fiscal stimulus further tightening of financial conditions rising market volatility and trade uncertainty experts have said with annualized growth rates of 2 2 percent 4 2 percent and 3 4 percent for the first three quarters of 2018 respectively and a 2 percent range expected for the fourth quarter the federal reserve estimated that the u s economy would wrap up the year with a 3 percent expansion much higher than the average 2 2 percent annual rate between 2010 and 2017 however economists warned that the boom is by and large led by the u s government s tax cuts and spending increases and that there are signs that the dividends of those measures are diminishing while the fed s monetary tightening will weigh more on u s growth fiscal boost becoming a fiscal drag and more tightening in financial conditions are going to mean that the growth is going to decelerate jeremie cohen setton research fellow at the peterson institute for international economics a washington think tank told xinhua in a recent interview he expected the u s economy to expand at around 2 5 percent in 2019 the slack is diminishing therefore you re going to have more wage pressures he said adding the fed would continue tightening monetary policy as u s inflation is going to overshoot the target of 2 percent a little bit the fed raised interest rates for four times in 2018 and most fed officials envisioned two rate hikes in 2019 it is more likely that the economy will grow in a way that will call for two interest rate increases over the course of next year fed chairman jerome powell told a press conference on dec 19 the fed anticipated that u s economic growth would decelerate to 2 3 percent in 2019 powell also emphasized at the press conference that the fed s policy decisions are not on a preset course there s a fairly high degree of uncertainty about both the path and the destination of any further increases he said but some experts argued that the fed s latest rate hike in december amid market volatility was questionable and an error it felt like a model driven decision occurred despite market turmoil that had continued too long to be ignored tim duy of the university of oregon wrote recently in his fed watch column duy noted that there was no pressing reason for a rate hike other than fed officials insist on defining policy on the back of long run forecasts and feel compelled to follow through with that policy what will add to the downside risks analysts said is the prospect of a protracted stalemate over government budget which has paralyzed a quarter of the federal government for more than a week now leaving some 800 000 federal workers furloughed or working without pay although the impact of the partial government shutdown on the overall economy remains limited for the time being it will no longer be negligible if the closure were to persist especially in a time of market volatility concerns about a loss of growth momentum in asia and europe would also likely weigh on u s growth for the rest of the world there seems to be some air coming out of the balloon that will come back and also affect the u s the international monetary fund s outgoing chief economist maurice obstfeld told reporters in early december meanwhile u s president donald trump s alleged displeasure with powell the stock market turbulence and ongoing trade disputes are all stoking uncertainties in the u s economy heading into 2019 following the imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs worldwide on the ground of national security it is not yet clear whether the u s government will slap new duties on imported cars and car parts in 2019 the european commission warned in a written document sent to the u s commerce department in june that some 300 billion u s dollars worth of u s exports will likely be hit by retaliatory measures from other economies subject to the potential auto tariffs in addition whether the u s government is capable enough to respond to a slowing economy or other contingencies and stabilize the market remains to be seen investors fear that a lack of experience coupled with personnel shortage may lead the u s government to miscalculation and policy failure further unsettling the market the u s treasury department had been blamed by market participants for sending at times muddled and confusing signals according to u s media in a move to quell market volatility treasury secretary steven mnuchin on dec 23 convened individual calls to chief executive officers of six major u s banks the banks all confirmed ample liquidity is available for lending to consumer and business markets the treasury department said in a statement mnuchin s effort to reach out to the private banking sector was not only rare for a senior government official but also of no avail as the dow the s p 500 and the nasdaq all tumbled more than 2 percent on the first trading day following the treasury department s statement the new york times said that mnuchin conducted the type of discussions usually reserved for moments of crisis thomas simons a senior economist at jefferies llc in new york pointed out that technical factors including sell orders driven by tax considerations and low year end volume could exaggerate the plunge in the stock market the first couple weeks of january will be telling as to whether this selling in december was technically related or actually fundamentally based he was quoted by bloomberg as saying despite a lift in major indices on monday u s stocks ended 2018 with the steepest annual declines since the 2008 financial crisis and many have cautioned the coming of a bear market after almost a decade of bull run

pound sterling slides amid global risk aversion despite upbeat pmi the pound sterling gbp struggled throughout wednesday s session against a basket of peers despite a distinct lack of negative high impact economic news or news of a brexit nature as parliament remains in recess until next week a slide throughout the session gave way to a significant downwards spike late on wednesday seeing the gbp depreciate 1 against peers before recovering a majority of the losses but remaining down for the day depreciating across the board the pound sterling acted in distinct contrast to the one data release of the day namely the manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi which printed an above forecast increase to 54 2 with new domestic and export order inflows increasing and a solid increase in stocks of purchases rob dobson director of ihs markit which compiles the survey commented december saw the uk pmi rise to a six month high following short term boosts to inventory holdings and inflows of new business as companies stepped up their preparations for a potentially disruptive brexit going on he added though the overall index figure was higher than last month this should be viewed with some scepticism whilst the road to brexit remains mired in the mud of indecision and disagreement there is likely to be some correction in the sector this year as brexit buffer stocks are depleted and overall output could fall in line with this chief economist at worldfirst jeremy thomson cook commented in response to the release despite this increase in demand confidence remains weak as everyone knows that these increased supplies of raw materials constituent parts and finished goods will eventually run out and supply chain disruption will hurt businesses later down the line regarding brexit rbc s chief currency strategist adam cole wrote to clients very little has moved in the brexit saga over the holiday period parliament has been in recess for the last two weeks and does not return until next monday gbp looked at against a basket of usd and eur remains in the middle of the narrow range that has held since mid december pm may faces an uphill struggle in the weeks ahead as mps debate the current withdrawal agreement ahead of a rescheduled meaningful vote expected in the week commencing 14th january according to sources support for pm may s withdrawal agreement is rising which could lend support to the pound and volatility is expected to remain high as the route ahead makes itself apparent eurozone pmis hamper the euro hinting at economic stangnation advertisement supplementary commentary from andrew harker associate director at ihs markit said december pmi data completed a worrying end to the year for italian manufacturers with firms continuing to struggle to secure new business this is in marked contrast to the start of 2018 when the sector was experiencing strong growth moreover with business confidence at a six year low there appears little sense of optimism that the current soft patch will come to an end in the near future the spanish pmi slumped past forecasts to 51 1 representing the softest pace of growth in the manufacturing sector since august of 2016 economics director at ihs markit commented the manufacturing sector ended 2018 on a rather muted note adding the downward trend was exacerbated by rising economic and political instabilities especially in relation to global tariffs with a final projection that growth will remain stuck in a soft patch during the early part of 2019 french german and euro wide pmis all delivered on forecast with the french pmi continuing to indicate manufacturing sector contraction amidst growing concerns of economic stagnation in the bloc the euro eur picked up in thursday s session partially recouping losses against peer currencies but faces an uphill struggle as markets remain thin in the wake of festive period holidays us dollar on the back foot as government shutdown continues the us dollar usd slid into the year on a muted footing despite robust gains throughout 2018 low liquidity trading conditions made for erratic price action in wednesday s session particularly versus the canadian dollar cad in which the usdcad exchange rate ricocheted between 1 3569 and 1 3665 in a session marked distinctly by risk aversion as apple inc issued a revenue warning in response to declining iphone sales in china investors fled the usd for safe haven assets benefitting the japanese yen jpy particularly on the data front the us final pmi did little to boost investor confidence slipping to a 15 month low of 53 8 amid a weaker rise in new business and the joint softest sector expansion since september of 2017 commenting chief business economist at ihs markit chris williamson said manufacturers reported a weakened pace of expansion at the end of 2018 and grew less upbeat about prospects for 2019 output and order books grew at the slowest rates for over a year and optimism about the outlook slumped to its gloomiest for over two years adding that companies have become increasingly cautious about spending amid rising uncertainty about the outlook the partial government shutdown continues in the us despite a conciliatory tone from president donald trump who tweeted he is ready and willing to work with democrats on a bill which would secure funds for federal departments and also he hopes include funding for a border wall between the us and mexico wednesday s meeting however yielded little progress with democrats standing by their offer of 1 3b for border security considerably less than the 5b sought by the president commenting on the shutdown a white house official said this is going to go on for a while australian dollar decimated in flash crash as investors seek safe haven assets wednesday saw the australian dollar aud suffer some of its worst intraday performance ever amid thin markets and the triggering of automated trades which sent it slumping to multi year lows versus a host of major peers above australian dollar japanese yen audjpy exchange rate head of fx strategy at national australian bank ray attrill described the sharp sudden depreciation in the aud as a flash crash as the aud plummeted 5 against the japanese yen jpy and 4 versus the us dollar usd attrill attributed the dramatic price action to thin markets commenting the fact that over half the move down in both these pairs audjpy audusd has since been retraced is testimony to today s moves being first and foremost a liquidity event alternative theories included a reaction to the sharp spike in risk aversion as the australian dollar is often considered a gauge of risk appetite or a response to weaker than forecast chinese manufacturing pmi data which fell into contraction territory at 49 7 the lack of a resolution in the continued us china trade war continues to weigh on the aud with attrill commenting these talks need to yield agreement to a reasonably comprehensive deal as a minimum prerequisite for a recovery in global risk asset sentiment and a stronger australian dollar adding if so we d expect aussie dollar to be trading back reasonably comfortably above 0 70 before q1 is out new zealand dollar slumps but recovers amid upbeat gdt likewise the new zealand dollar nzd suffered a similar flash crash late in wednesday s session although the drop was not as pronounced and the nzd largely recovered the losses into thursday s session the nzd was partially insulated on the gdt price index release which saw the change in the average price of dairy products sold at auction increase 2 8 the fastest pace of price growth since february 2018 canadian dollar loses out to yen oil recovers marginally the canadian dollar cad had a mixed session on wednesday appreciating versus the pound sterling gbp euro eur and antipodean currencies aud nzd while a volatile range dominated the usdcad pair and the loonie lost out substantially versus the japanese yen jpy with the canadian dollar japanese yen cadjpy exchange rate at one point declining by 3 8 domestic economic data took a back seat to global risk aversion as investors panicked the manufacturing pmi release saw activity slow in the sector printing 53 6 down from 54 9 president and ceo at the supply chain management association scma commented december data signalled a loss of momentum for manufacturers at the end of the year with stagnating export sales and softer energy sector demand the key factors behind an overall slowdown in production growth adding that global trade tensions has led to greater risk aversion among clients with business confidence dropping to its lowest level in almost 3 years elsewhere the price of oil saw an upside break to a weekly high during wednesday s session reacting 56 barrel before settling back down to 54 into thursday s session despite the marginal gains the price remains almost 40 lower than the 2018 peak and continues to weigh on the loonie

u s economic growth is expected to slow down in 2019 due to factors including the diminishing effect of fiscal stimulus further tightening of financial conditions rising market volatility and trade uncertainty experts have said with annualized growth rates of 2 2 percent 4 2 percent and 3 4 percent for the first three quarters of 2018 respectively and a 2 percent range expected for the fourth quarter the federal reserve estimated that the u s economy would wrap up the year with a 3 percent expansion much higher than the average 2 2 percent annual rate between 2010 and 2017 however economists warned that the boom is by and large led by the u s government s tax cuts and spending increases and that there are signs that the dividends of those measures are diminishing while the fed s monetary tightening will weigh more on u s growth fiscal boost becoming a fiscal drag and more tightening in financial conditions are going to mean that the growth is going to decelerate jeremie cohen setton research fellow at the peterson institute for international economics a washington think tank told xinhua in a recent interview he expected the u s economy to expand at around 2 5 percent in 2019 the slack is diminishing therefore you re going to have more wage pressures he said adding the fed would continue tightening monetary policy as u s inflation is going to overshoot the target of 2 percent a little bit the fed raised interest rates for four times in 2018 and most fed officials envisioned two rate hikes in 2019 it is more likely that the economy will grow in a way that will call for two interest rate increases over the course of next year fed chairman jerome powell told a press conference on dec 19 the fed anticipated that u s economic growth would decelerate to 2 3 percent in 2019 powell also emphasized at the press conference that the fed s policy decisions are not on a preset course there s a fairly high degree of uncertainty about both the path and the destination of any further increases he said but some experts argued that the fed s latest rate hike in december amid market volatility was questionable and an error it felt like a model driven decision occurred despite market turmoil that had continued too long to be ignored tim duy of the university of oregon wrote recently in his fed watch column duy noted that there was no pressing reason for a rate hike other than fed officials insist on defining policy on the back of long run forecasts and feel compelled to follow through with that policy what will add to the downside risks analysts said is the prospect of a protracted stalemate over government budget which has paralyzed a quarter of the federal government for more than a week now leaving some 800 000 federal workers furloughed or working without pay although the impact of the partial government shutdown on the overall economy remains limited for the time being it will no longer be negligible if the closure were to persist especially in a time of market volatility concerns about a loss of growth momentum in asia and europe would also likely weigh on u s growth for the rest of the world there seems to be some air coming out of the balloon that will come back and also affect the u s the international monetary fund s outgoing chief economist maurice obstfeld told reporters in early december meanwhile u s president donald trump s alleged displeasure with powell the stock market turbulence and ongoing trade disputes are all stoking uncertainties in the u s economy heading into 2019 following the imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs worldwide on the ground of national security it is not yet clear whether the u s government will slap new duties on imported cars and car parts in 2019 the european commission warned in a written document sent to the u s commerce department in june that some 300 billion u s dollars worth of u s exports will likely be hit by retaliatory measures from other economies subject to the potential auto tariffs in addition whether the u s government is capable enough to respond to a slowing economy or other contingencies and stabilize the market remains to be seen investors fear that a lack of experience coupled with personnel shortage may lead the u s government to miscalculation and policy failure further unsettling the market the u s treasury department had been blamed by market participants for sending at times muddled and confusing signals according to u s media in a move to quell market volatility treasury secretary steven mnuchin on dec 23 convened individual calls to chief executive officers of six major u s banks the banks all confirmed ample liquidity is available for lending to consumer and business markets the treasury department said in a statement mnuchin s effort to reach out to the private banking sector was not only rare for a senior government official but also of no avail as the dow the s p 500 and the nasdaq all tumbled more than 2 percent on the first trading day following the treasury department s statement the new york times said that mnuchin conducted the type of discussions usually reserved for moments of crisis thomas simons a senior economist at jefferies llc in new york pointed out that technical factors including sell orders driven by tax considerations and low year end volume could exaggerate the plunge in the stock market the first couple weeks of january will be telling as to whether this selling in december was technically related or actually fundamentally based he was quoted by bloomberg as saying despite a lift in major indices on monday u s stocks ended 2018 with the steepest annual declines since the 2008 financial crisis and many have cautioned the coming of a bear market after almost a decade of bull run

national elections in early 2019 and political leaders need to abandon populist campaign agendas to harness the global opportunities that are knocking at india s door the myopia underpinning partisan and nonsecular politics must be replaced with a more inclusive equitable and global economic and social perspective nandita baruah country representative indonesia in 2019 185 million indonesians will exercise their constitutional right to vote electing a president a vice president and members of the national legislature identity politics have become increasingly prominent in indonesia s social and political discourse in the last decade sowing division between majority and minority communities democracy is increasingly framed as majoritarian rule and surveys have shown that political and social intolerance are on the rise while promoters of democracy encourage voters to cast their ballots based on programmatic proposals from the parties and candidates louder messages amplified by social media emphasize the primordial ties of religion and ethnicity the work to protect democratic values of inclusion has never been as crucial as it is right now in the world s most populous muslim country how politicians campaign and how the public responds to their messages will be an important clue to indonesia s direction in 2019 and beyond sandra hamid country representative korea in 2019 the third year of the moon jae in administration south korea stands at a social economic and foreign policy crossroads the sense of a narrowing window of opportunity could persuade south korea north korea and the united states to compromise on the nuclear issue despite prevailing skepticism and the growing tension between u s pressure and the south s desire to seize the last chance in a generation to engage the north south korea also faces the challenge and opportunity to align its development assistance with global trends which have shifted from top down government focused official development assistance oda to the bottom up partnership friendly and public private approaches of the sustainable development goals sdgs the shift from an oda to an sdg mindset could be tested in the moon administration s new southern policy directed towards asean countries and india economically south korea is wrestling with the structural implications of reorienting its economy from manufacturing to services while the chaebols continue to act as both enablers of and obstacles to growth they will be tested in the new year as the global economy slows down the economy is showing early signs of stress including declining employment figures and residential property construction orders for the past two years the economic risk is compounded by growing household debt as interest rates will face pressure to rise meanwhile changing demographics remain a source of anxiety as south korea s population ages stoking intergenerational tensions over jobs public benefits and other resources kwang kim country representative laos infrastructure boomed in laos in 2018 with the lao china railway reaching 20 percent completion and deals struck for two expressways the first ever in laos and a national backbone power transmission line these are all important pieces of the connectivity puzzle assets that will help laos to achieve its stated goals of being land linked and the battery of asia however 2018 also brought a tragic reminder of the risks of large scale infrastructure development in the form of the xe pian xe namnoy dam collapse going forward laos must seek a balanced path that addresses key infrastructure needs while protecting the critical ecosystems that are so inextricably linked to lao culture and livelihoods nancy kim country representative malaysia following the unprecedented result of the nation s 14th general election in may malaysia experienced a change of regime for the first time in 60 years in this new era now famously dubbed new malaysia malaysians will be closely following the ruling coalition s progress in fulfilling their campaign promises especially the promise of structural political and economic reforms as the government further articulates the content and strategies of the new malaysia agenda the nation s 2019 wish list includes greater rule of law and a thriving and robust economy backed by a just society the new government s success or failure in this project could largely determine whether malaysia will be able to consolidate its recent democratic gains herizal hazri country representative mongolia mongolia enters 2019 still reeling from a major corruption scandal involving misuse of the national small and medium enterprise fund and wracked by political infighting within the ruling mongolian people s party these two factors make it likely that government instability will persist until the 2020 elections 2018 was a year of continued economic recovery and mongolia has been effectively implementing an international monetary fund package since 2017 so the economic outlook for 2019 remains positive for now however an uncertain outlook for the chinese economy on which mongolia remains heavily dependent and limited progress on key reforms due to government fragility and a divided parliament put the economic recovery of the last two years at risk preparations will soon begin for the critical 2020 national elections and major sources of public dissatisfaction will dominate the national discourse in 2019 including the extreme air pollution in ulaanbaatar and other cities and the public s growing frustration with corruption mark koenig country representative myanmar put simply 2018 was a difficult year for myanmar the fallout from the rohingya crisis has increased as the un and assorted parliaments and governments have labelled it genocide and applied targeted sanctions while humanitarian access and diplomatic dialogue have improved the situation on the ground remains dire with rohingya refugees in bangladesh refusing to leave domestically the nld government of aung san suu kyi faces growing criticism over the lack of movement in the peace process and the slow pace of reforms particularly economic ones as the country struggles both domestically and internationally many wonder if myanmar s historic effort to reform and democratize is being lost in transition nevertheless aung san suu kyi and her party remain popular overall if she can secure greater international involvement in resolving the rohingya crisis for instance through the un and asean encourage greater economic growth and catalyze some high profile reforms such as to the banking sector and local public administration both international support and myanmar public opinion will likely be reinvigorated matthew arnold country representative nepal power sharing and self rule will again be the center of attention in 2019 as nepal s three tiers of government continue to flesh out their working relationships the crucial aspect to watch will be the provincial governments as they work to demonstrate their still undefined political and administrative worth to both the 753 local governments and the federal government while the provincial governments will be the front lines of these developments the greatest gains are likely to be had at the local level hopes are high in municipalities across nepal as local authorities with new powers under the 2015 constitution feel pressure to deliver on last year s campaign promises of inclusive democratic governance and economic growth both central to the historic grievances of exclusion that fueled nepal s decade long internal conflict mid march is the constitutional deadline for revision of hundreds of federal laws that will set a new legal framework for the country but antagonisms between elected politicians and the bureaucratic leadership that has managed the country over two decades of instability will remain a challenge meghan nalbo country representative pakistan with a newly elected government firmly in place after july general elections economic stabilization inclusive growth and good governance will remain naya new pakistan s priorities for 2019 sofia shakil country representative the philippines global headlines on the philippines in 2019 will likely be dominated by president duterte his continuing war on drugs and a plebiscite in january and february over new regional autonomy and a path to peace for conflict affected areas of mindanao domestic headlines will be dominated by a nonstop festival of democracy for the midterm elections on may 13 when more than 18 000 elected positions will be up for grabs support for democracy remains high registrations of new voters surpassed expectations adding 2 5 million people to the voter rolls for a total of more than 60 million of whom 70 75 percent are expected to turn out among the key economic challenges for the year ahead are curbing the currently high rate of inflation creating jobs and delivering on infrastructure promises alongside maintaining consistency in economic leadership amidst the expected postelection changes in the cabinet sam chittick country representative sri lanka sri lanka is just emerging from a constitutional crisis that destabilized the country for over 50 days on october 26 citing irreconcilable differences and the national interest president maithripala sirisena sacked the prime minister and unilaterally appointed former president mahinda rajapaksa in his place the resulting crisis provoked unprecedented public protests and resistance until a definitive decision by the supreme court compelled the quarreling political leaders to adhere to constitutional norms as sri lanka now struggles to hold together the fractured pieces of its 71 year old democracy 2019 will be a crucial year there is no doubt that the power struggle at the top will continue unabated particularly since provincial parliamentary and presidential elections are due in the next two years the united national party its government reinstated by the court has one last chance to demonstrate its commitment to the good governance accountability and anticorruption agenda it was elected on the president and the reinstated prime minister will need to find a way to work together most importantly sri lanka has emerged from the crisis fundamentally changed a newly activated electorate with high expectations is poised to demand change and will no longer tolerate the parochial interests of the political elite the future of sri lanka will thus hinge on the ability of this spontaneously mobilized electorate to remain steadfast in defense of their democratic rights dinesha de silva country representative thailand thailand is about to take center stage in world affairs once again as asean chair in 2019 thailand is likely to preside over increasingly complex regional relations as the centrifugal force of the u s china rivalry puts pressure on the 10 member bloc negotiations over the critical regional comprehensive economic partnership trading bloc and the south china sea code of conduct could come to fruition during thailand s tenure the chance of a refugee or regional security crisis is also high thailand has been preparing for this moment for a decade and it has a talented and capable group of diplomats and officials who will be keeping the agenda on track the big question of course will be the political leadership nearly five years after a military coup thailand will have an election on february 24 while the election itself is likely to be relatively smooth the critical moment will be in the two or three months after the election as three major political factions try to cobble together a majority coalition if it can emerge from this test with a widely accepted and stable government this will be a breakthrough year for thailand after nearly 15 years of political instability and uncertainty thomas parks country representative timor leste 2019 is looking to be a crucial year politically and economically for timor leste historic early elections in 2018 led to a political impasse between the coalition amp government and the fretilin opposition at stake are the appointments of eight ministers still waiting to take office and a cabinet reshuffle is possible early in the year another critical area to watch will be the final shape of the 2019 budget currently the largest ever proposed it includes a partial buyout of the 50 billion greater sunrise gas field and a plan to buy more in 2020 for a 56 percent stake in the joint development underlying all of this is the urgent need to continue diversifying the economy raise educational standards and decentralize service delivery to better reach the 40 percent of timorese still living in poverty todd wassel country representative vietnam vietnam conducts energy planning by matching short and long term demand projections with available technologies and energy sources as we enter 2019 the declining cost of renewable energy which can now compete with coal and the equally declining cost of grid connected battery storage which can now compete with gas as a means of meeting peak demand have unhinged this planning process reaching out to these new technologies carries risks but not doing so could leave the country with stranded assets security risks and increasing sovereign debt as planning for power development plan viii moves forward an array of domestic and international pressures weigh on vietnam s leadership finding a compromise that balances vietnam s energy needs with its commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will not be easy no one will be satisfied but that unfortunately is the only available course of action michael digregorio country representative
t he euro is a survivor the new currency brought into being on january 1st 1999 has defied early critics who thought it doomed to failure it has emerged from its turbulent teenage years intact cheating a near death experience the debt crisis of 2009 12 it is now more popular than ever with the public but fundamental tensions attended its birth although the euro has made it this far they still hang over it if europe s single currency is to survive a global slowdown or another crisis it will require a remodelling that politicians seem unwilling or unable to press through listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element to its supporters the bold economic experiment was the culmination of half a century of european co operation and a crucial step towards an ever closer union that would unite a continent once riven by conflict nations with a common currency never went to war against each other said helmut kohl germany s chancellor who together with france s president françois mitterrand championed monetary union in the 1990s to cement deeper political and economic integration each member brought its own hopes and fears to the union to the french it was a way of taming the economic might of a newly reunified germany and the power of the bundesbank to the germans who feared they would eventually foot the bill for profligate southerners the prize was a stable currency and an end to competitive devaluations by italy to the italians greeks and other southerners monetary union was a means of borrowing the inflation fighting credibility of the bundesbank on which the european central bank ecb was modelled the most vocal critics of the euro many in america saw a foolhardy plan crafted by naive politicians the currency union would shackle together economies that were too different in structure while taking away a weapon to fight asymmetric downturns that hit individual members such as a local housing bust by giving up the ability to devalue currencies the only way to adjust would be through painful and politically troublesome cuts to real wages unlike america which also shares a monetary union there would be no federal budget to help stabilise demand across state borders milton friedman gave the euro no more than ten years before it collapsed and took the eu with it neither its staunchest advocates nor its harshest critics have proved correct the currency area has grown to 19 countries and ranks as the world s second largest economy when measured using market exchange rates behind only america but the euro has only muddled through political will particularly at its franco german core meant that just enough was done to ensure that the euro survived the debt crisis but none of the union s fundamental problems was solved as it enters its third decade the question is whether the currency can withstand the next upheaval currency affairs to do so will require the right economic tools to overcome the euro area s weaknesses these became obvious after debt crises engulfed greece then ireland portugal and spain the unresolved conflicts of the past 20 years has meant too little integration and too little reform crucial gaps in its structure are yet to be fixed and its ammunition is limited at the same time europe is politically more divided in many countries mainstream leaders are succumbing to populists divisions have widened between the fiscally disciplined north and the south which advocates redistribution across borders the deeper cross border integration of economies banks and capital markets that would alleviate domestic economic difficulties has not materialised the euro s architects hoped that deeper integration would make the pain of real wage adjustment easier to bear but the external discipline of a single currency has not as hoped forced governments to undertake much reform to labour and product markets to improve competitiveness and so bring economies into line members trade more with each other but compared with grand expectations the gains have been modest labour mobility is still low financial integration has been limited too in america capital and credit flowing from the rest of the country cushion the impact of a downturn in any one state but a single capital market has not fully developed in the euro area according to the oecd a rich country club the corporate bond market amounts to a tenth of gdp compared with over two fifths in america a study by the european commission in 2016 found that integration of capital and labour markets helped to cushion the blow of half of asymmetric shocks in america but only a tenth in the euro area no sense of togetherness what banking integration has occurred has amplified risks not spread them banks have done little direct lending to firms and households across euro area borders lending in the 2000s was of the flighty interbank sort that could easily be withdrawn this fed macroeconomic imbalances net foreign liabilities in portugal greece and spain rose to 80 or more of gdp by 2008 but capital fled swiftly once the global financial crisis got under way foreign debts suddenly could not be rolled over and crisis erupted without deep integration the burden of adjustment falls on member states that are already stricken greece was engulfed by crisis after it overspent and hid its fiscal deficits the crisis spread to ireland poleaxed by reckless banks and spain which suffered a property bust matters were made worse in an infernal loop of doom as governments struggled to borrow enough to support failing banks while banks were beset by the tumbling value of the government debt they held greece ireland portugal spain and cyprus needed bail outs in return northern countries insisted on stringent austerity measures and onerous structural reforms the euro area has become more balanced economically as a result of these measures gaps in competitiveness that ballooned during the first decade of the currency s existence have since narrowed as wages have been slashed and collective bargaining practices reformed in southern states almost every country apart from france estonia and spain is now running a primary fiscal surplus ie before interest payments ireland portugal and spain ran current account deficits before the crisis but are now running surpluses nevertheless as the euro area enters its third decade it is still vulnerable to another downturn and underlying tensions are unresolved if not sharpened past imbalances have left large debts that are only slowly being chipped away greece portugal and spain have big external debts see chart 1 fiscal firepower is limited seven countries have public debt around or over 100 of gdp see chart 2 the euro area has no budget of its own to soften the blow the wider eu has one but it is small at 0 9 of gdp and is not intended to provide stimulus as fiscal policy provided too little stimulus when it was required the ecb bore the burden in 2015 after much delay it began a programme of quantitative easing its purchases of securities such as government bonds from banks eventually encouraged more lending and kick started recovery even that took a fight german horror of monetising debt led the ecb to set limits on the amount of a country s debt it could own even so german critics launched legal complaints that the bank was breaking eu law by monetising debt it was only in december 2018 that the european court of justice ruled that the scheme was legal thanks in part to its ownership limits the bank s ability to provide stimulus in the next downturn will be constrained short term interest rates are already negative the bank s balance sheet of 4 5trn 5 1trn is vast and holdings of german sovereign bonds are already nearing its ownership limit of 33 it will take years before interest rates let alone the balance sheet return to normal should a recession strike before then the bank will have to rethink its toolkit morgan stanley a bank puts the ecb s firepower at 1 5trn if it increases its ownership limit of sovereign bonds to 50 and widens its private sector asset purchases to include bank bonds but such a redesign could be difficult increasing holdings of sovereign debt would risk dividing the bank s governing council and provoking fresh legal challenge by critics in 2012 mario draghi the ecb s president said he would do whatever it takes to save the euro committing to buy unlimited amounts of government bonds if sovereigns hit trouble but the bank s governing council may be split when it comes to putting such a scheme into practice jens weidmann the bundesbank s chief and a contender to become the next leader of the ecb has opposed it northerners still fear paying profligate southerners bills either through debt monetisation or bail outs for the germans and the more hawkish new hanseatic league a group of eight small northern members the debt crisis highlighted the importance of a national discipline that they fear is still lacking in the south southern discomfort at the same time southerners feel they are bearing all the pain of recovery the politics of monetary union is more febrile as a result after eight years of eye watering austerity greek gdp per person is still far below its level in 2007 in real terms see chart 3 in 2015 syriza a left wing party came to power promising to end austerity before spectacularly reversing course when it became clear that greece needed a third bail out the hope that lawmakers in italy would be forced into making growth enhancing reforms has been dashed the economy was limping even before currency union public debt is a daunting 130 of gdp income per head in real terms is no different than in 1999 the stagnation raises the question of whether italy can grow within the euro area says jeromin zettelmeyer from the peterson institute for international economics and the eu has become the italian government s external enemy in june 2018 a populist coalition took office seeking to overturn pension reforms and promising to increase public spending provoking a stand off with brussels before italy backed down in december after the previous crisis politicians struggled to cope their successors are even less well equipped or less well intentioned political developments both within the euro area and without could restrain the economic response to the next downturn and are holding back much needed institutional reform emergency action was taken during the debt crisis a sovereign bail out fund was cobbled together for instance such steps had been urged by the imf and america s president barack obama the federal reserve helped to provide dollar liquidity similar engagement or encouragement is unlikely while donald trump is in the white house political differences between the north and south mean that three institutional flaws remain unresolved private sector risk sharing through banks and capital markets is insufficient the doom loop connecting banks and sovereigns has not been fully severed and there is no avenue for fiscal stimulus don t bank on it europe s banks like those across the atlantic have improved their liquidity and capital positions since the financial crisis the total amount of bad loans although still high in greece and italy is falling in 2012 the euro area introduced reforms to create a banking union in order to integrate national systems and loosen the ties between banks and sovereigns big banks are now supervised by a central authority and a resolution fund is responsible for winding down failing banks so that national governments are not as exposed to big ones that collapse lenders remain stubbornly national however branches and subsidiaries that operate across borders make up only a tenth of the euro area banking sector s assets banks cannot use deposits in one country to lend in another because national regulators do not want to be on the hook for loans to improvident foreigners an eu wide deposit guarantee scheme would allay that fear but has yet to be agreed at a meeting of heads of state on december 14th a discussion of the scheme first proposed in 2012 was kicked further into the long grass fiscal hawks insist that banks bring down non performing loans before risks are shared across countries political differences have also prevented the doom loop from being broken fully a side effect of stricter rules on banks capital which deems sovereign debt as riskless is that banks have loaded up on it big banks in italy portugal and spain hold around 8 10 of their assets in these bonds jitters about the sustainability of a country s debt could worsen banks balance sheets translating into fears about their solvency but limits on banks sovereign exposures backed by northerners were not even discussed in december highly indebted italians detest limits fearing the loss of a steady source of demand for their debt and a rise in borrowing costs fiscal policy is another political battleground it is meant to be a matter for member states but to avoid imbalances building up they are required to obey the eu s rules which include running fiscal deficits of less than 3 and public debt below 60 of gdp that has led to clashes between the european commission which polices the rules and is backed by hawks and other national governments which want to enact stimulus or deliver on election promises some economists think that national fiscal policy alone is insufficient particularly if countries that most need stimulus are constrained by fears of provoking bond markets country level rules cannot force the miserly or the better off to spend more for the good of the currency area in 2017 emmanuel macron france s president proposed a euro area budget to help stabilise demand in countries hit by an asymmetric downturn but northern hawks see little need for such a function for them national public finances suffice a heavily watered down version of mr macron s budget proposal was agreed in december but rather than drawing on new funds it will sit within the existing eu budget and focus on convergence and competition rather than stabilising demand the prospects for meaningful change may seem bleak but it could still happen thinks daniele antonucci of morgan stanley he reckons that investors are too pessimistic about reform and that there is a chance that the bloc will enact a euro area budget with a stabilisation function over the next ten years mr macron s budget proposal was considered taboo only a year ago he says now that a version has been agreed it leaves scope for expansion never let a crisis go to waste if the euro s past is a guide change only happens during a crisis the previous one revealed a willingness of the franco german core to save the euro at any cost that willingness remains and cannot be underestimated laurence boone of the oecd who was an adviser to françois hollande mr macron s predecessor thinks that the eu budget already contains tools such as cohesion and investment funds that could be enlarged and repurposed to stabilise the euro area if it hit trouble the euro s public popularity should help as should the quietening of calls for leaving the euro in countries where it once seemed possible parties that flirted with exit such as the front national in france and the northern league in italy now seek change from within britain s agonising brexit drama may have served as a warning other events though could easily conspire against immediate action mr macron has been weakened his recent concessions to gilets jaunes protesters means that france will probably violate european fiscal rules angela merkel germany s chancellor who led the euro area s emergency response during the crisis is due to step down in 2021 reform minded european officials such as mr draghi depart this year if crisis engulfs italy the bloc s third largest member even franco german determination to save the euro may not be enough political fragmentation means there is no guarantee that the next crisis will deliver the leap in integration needed to keep the euro safe the economics of currency union was always going to be hard for politicians to manage in its first 20 years they did enough to keep the euro alive the next 20 years will be less forgiving a crisis will inevitably strike and if politicians do not see through reform they may well oversee the euro s demise

at year end president trump signed the first step bill for reform of the federal prison system the bipartisan bill which passed both the house of representatives and the senate by overwhelming votes pairs changes in sentencing laws with investments in in prison education and training programs and expansion of early release credits the bill is well named though welcome it is a very very modest first step the new york times estimated that it will immediately reduce the number of people in federal prisons by only about 7000 inmates and it will have no impact on hundreds of thousands of inmates of state and local prisons and jails the overwhelming bipartisan approval of the bill reflects the emergence over the last few years of an unlikely coalition for reform uniting conservatives and liberals from charles koch to george soros and from the fraternal order of police to the american civil liberties union driven by widespread public support for reducing the prison population and by the financial burden of maintaining such a large prison system reforms have been implemented in many states over the last few years the immediate causes of our incarceration epidemic are generally understood the first step proposal and other similar state level reforms generally reflect this understanding they focus on the operations of the criminal justice system itself on the impact of the war on drugs and on racial inequities throughout the criminal justice system state level reforms have included reduced mandatory sentences more sentencing flexibility for judges increasing drug and mental illness treatment alternatives to prison reducing the post release impact of imprisonment by banning employers from asking about prison histories providing body cams for police supporting community policing and improving police training the first step act makes retroactive earlier reductions in the disparity between federal sentences for crack cocaine and powder cocaine eases the three strikes rule so that people with three or more convictions automatically get 25 years instead of life makes it easier for judges to avoid handing down mandatory minimum sentences increases opportunities for inmates to earn good time credits to reduce their prison time and improves conditions in prisons including banning the shackling of women during childbirth and requiring that inmates be placed in prisons closer to their families expand ap photo sean rayford file these are all worthy changes but their impact will be limited although the new york times called the first steps measure the most substantial rewrite of the nation s sentencing and prison laws in a generation even a far more rigorous and sustained effort along these lines would only reduce the prison population by about 25 percent over the next decade that would leave us with an incarceration rate at mid 90s levels still more than double that of any of the countries that are remotely like the u s in level of economic development to make the u s more like a normal country with respect to incarceration requires that we understand the sources of mass incarceration at a deeper level for starters the increase in prison population was not due to high rates of crime the u s crime rate is not unusually high compared to that in western europe but our incarceration rate is three or four times higher today though the crime rate is lower than at any time since the mid 60s we lock up seven times as many people as then the best known effort to understand the prison crisis at a deeper level is michelle alexander s argument that incarceration is the new jim crow alexander argued that mass incarceration is a racially motivated system for locking the black population into an inferior economic and political status alexander s thesis has become close to gospelamong black activists and the left but on closer examination it is incomplete alexander was certainly right to start with the role of racism overt and institutional in the incarceration crisis discriminatory practices at every level of the criminal justice system have contributed to black americans being incarcerated in state prisons at a rate more than five times that of whites as alexander also observed the impact of mass incarceration on the black community goes far beyond the sum of its impact on individuals high rates of incarceration of black have disrupted families increased poverty in black communities and redrawn the pathway through young adulthood but alexander s racialized take on the history of incarceration illuminates only part of the larger story the soaring prison population was driven by forces far beyond the need to control blacks per se and even the racial disproportion in incarceration rates was driven by class as much as by race in insisting on the role of class i am not taking sides in the class politics vs identity politics debate roiling the democratic party race is not reducible to class and no politics that calls itself progressive can subordinate the needs of blacks to those of poor and working class whites but it is impossible to separate race and class in america an enormously disproportionate part of the poorer sectors of the working class is black and an enormously disproportionate portion of the black population is poor and working class this disproportionality of course represents the ultimate in structural racism but as an explanation of the unequal burden of mass incarceration on blacks it is at a distant remove from alexander s insistence that mass incarceration is an intentional effort to control black americans and drive a wedge between blacks and whites alexander is right in stressing that incarceration is a form of social control of blacks but it is equally a reflection of class based repression first it is not black americans in general but poor uneducated and undereducated black americans who have been targeted by the criminal justice system almostall of the increase in the risk of imprisonment falls on those with just a high school education incredibly a black male dropout born between 1965 and 1969 had nearly a 60 percent chance of serving time in prison by the end of the 1990s up from 17 percent only twenty years earlier but despite media attention to arrests of high profile black men such as harvard professor henry louis gates who was held for allegedly breaking into his own home the likelihood of a black man aged 30 to 34 with at least some college serving time in prison actually decreased between the late seventies and the late nineties second alexander argues that the rise in incarceration was driven by the heavily racially motivated drug war however drug offenders make up only a bit over one sixth of the prison population third the war on drugs and later demands to get tough on crime reflected class divisions within the black community as well as white anxieties as james forman jr and other have pointed out a wide range of middle class black leaders joined in the demand for getting tough on drug crimes and gun possession in the early 1970s pushed for stricter sentencing in the early 1980s and many supported clinton s further toughening up in the 1990s fourth from the early 70s on blacks were indeed increasingly disproportionately represented in prisons but they were also flooding in to the military and graduating high school and attending college at an increasing rate if the increasing proportion of the prison population that was black counts as evidence of racism what are we to make of the increasing proportion of the military and school population that was black finally although the figures vary enormously from state to state nationwide blacks make up only 38 percent of those with prison records while this is far greater than the percentage of blacks in the overall american population nothing in alexander s model explains why we have more than 900 000 white men locked up almost exactly the same as the number of black men or why more than two and one half times as many white women as black are currently in prison or why the rate of incarceration among black men has actually declined more than 20 percent since 2000 while the rate for white men has grown slightly somewhat bizarrely alexander is reduced to explain the incarceration of whites as collateral damage poor uneducated and undereducated whites as well as blacks have been the victims of america s rush to incarceration a white man whose income places him in the lowest fifth of the income distribution has a 43 percent probability of having been arrested that is certainly less than for black men but in absolute terms is still shockingly high most of the disproportion in incarceration rates between blacks and whites reflects the differences in the proportion of blacks and whites in upper middle and lower classes using income as a measure of social class if we imagine that the class composition of the black population were the same as that of the white population almost two thirds of the difference in the percent jailed for more than one month and 85 percent of the difference in the percent jailed after arrest would disappear using educational level as a surrogate for class gives similar results for many white communities the cumulative impact of the rise in incarceration in absolute terms if not as devastating as it is for black communities is still great poor white communities in the united states are in trouble racked by rising rates of suicide opioid addiction alcoholism firearm deaths divorce and teen pregnancy and by declines in health mental health and overall mortality rates especially among those with lower education the rapidly rising rate of incarceration of young white men is but one more part of the calamity facing these communities the rise of trump support in precisely the same communities at precisely the same time is hardly a coincidence although the incarceration crisis is a racial issue it is also a class issue within black america as well as within america as a whole mass incarceration is primarily about the systematic management of the lower classes regardless of race so why did incarceration grow at such an astounding rate the drive to get tough on crime from the early 70s on has had three main sources the need to restore social control in the face of the disruptive social movements black and white of the 60s and early 70s the need to warehouse the growing numbers of poor people black and white who were no longer economically useful and political opportunism step back a moment why do people for the most part at least follow the explicit and implicit rules of society what makes social arrangements more or less stable sociologists describe this as the problem of social control black and white americans have long experienced diverging patterns of social control for blacks coercive often violent modes of control have dominated at least until the 60s for whites a mix of coercive and non coercive modes have prevailed in the south where the vast majority of black americans lived until after world war ii the legal restrictions and extra legal violence of the jim crow system prevailed into the 1960s in the north blacks experienced restrictive housing policies job discrimination unequal treatment at the hands of the law and sometimes mob violence as early as the 1940s blacks were imprisoned at a rate three times as high as whites nationwide and in many states more than one in 20 black men were in prison as early as the 1940s white americans were also sometimes subject to coercive measures but from the inception of the new deal through the late 60s it was a modicum of economic security and the prospect of upward social mobility that ensured their allegiance rising productivity ensured that companies could offer job security higher wages and pensions while still earning healthy profits federal subsidies enabled home ownership and asset building unemployment insurance social security and company provided health benefits offered protection against the worst economic risks unions representing close to one third of private sector workers were incorporated into the democratic party power structure black americans were largely though not entirely excluded from these social benefits in the mid and late 1960s the old mechanisms of social control stopped working for both black and white first a wave of social unrest broke out the civil rights movement in the south blew apart the old jim crow system then came the riots and a huge wave of black community organizing and black political activity in the north there was a growing level of white unrest as well and not only among students many poor white as well as poor black communities mobilized around issues such as school quality and school lunches unemployment vietnam veterans rights and emergency room care the war on poverty both subsidized and promoted community organizing then in 1970 71 the largest strike wave in the u s since 1946 broke out one in every 20 american workers went on strike in each of those years expand national archives records administration by the late 60s the new left had emerged centered among students and young professionals andengaging in increasingly militant and increasingly radical anti war and anti imperialist activity the counter culture and then the women s liberation movement and the gay movement and the environmentalist movement emerged even the military was not immune to discontent white and black gi s and vets played a major role in the growing anti war storm these movements demanded radical changes in american society and culture the new left and civil rights movement demanded the replacement of authoritarianism and hierarchy by blessed community and participatory democracy the women s liberation movement demanded not only equal pay and abortion rights but the reconceptualization of the family and a fundamental revolution in human relationships the gay liberation movement demanded not only toleration but a transformation of conventional sexual behavior and assumptions about gender the environmental movement challenged both corporate hegemony and the very idea of man s control over nature despite their nowadays often being seen as the sources of increasingly parochial identity politics the varied movements of the 60s and early 70s often worked together and shared a vision of a better society that would be brought about through the common efforts of a range of groups and movements many working and middle class whites responded to the disorder in the streets the rapid changes in sexual behaviors gender roles and other cultural expectations and the upheavals of the old racial ordering of society with anxiety and fear elites in business and government also responded with more than a little sense of panic in the early and mid 60s presidents kennedy and johnson saw extending the non coercive modes of social control that had worked so well for so many years with the white working class as the way to damp down the unrest so we got the civil rights act the voting rights act a vast expansion of the welfare rolls the war on poverty medicare and medicaid the housing rights acts the elementary and secondary education act and a host of other reforms but no sooner were these reforms enacted than they were threatened first came the recessions of 1969 1970 and 1973 1975 and the stagflation of the later 70s wages stagnated and inequality grew the minimum wage and welfare benefits were eroded by inflation and great society social programs were cut back conservatives had never fully embraced the non coercive approach to regaining social control the pivotal figure was richard nixon nixon ridiculed the idea that social disorder had causes in social conditions social order would be reinstated he insisted not by quadrupling funds for any governmental war on poverty but convicting more criminals whatever his hopes or intentions with the militant movements of both people of color and whites continuing to grow and a democratic controlled congress nixon had little option but to continue to expand the welfare state and civil rights protections he supported the earned income tax credit indexing social security benefits and proposals for national health insurance and for a minimum guaranteed income but at the same time nixon saw the white backlash against the gains of black americans and middle american anxiety about social cultural and racial unrest as a political opportunity hisracially oriented southern strategy and his efforts to whip up fears of crime and drugs were first and foremost strategies to gain electoral power explicit concerns about drug abuse and crime often seen as sources of the law and order drive that was to come initially played a very minor role in 1971 just before president nixon announced the war on drugs fewer than 4 percent of americans saw drugs as the most important problem facing america and concerns about crime were almost as low nixonalso threw direct repression into the mix the fbi s cointelpro program and similar programs at the state and local level targeted a wide range of groups and individuals that the fbi deemed subversive including anti vietnam war organizations civil rights and black nationalist movements black power and militant latino groups and the new left the private sector too embraced a more repressive strategy big industry s earlier relative toleration of unions collapsed and companies and conservatives in government went on an anti union rampage nixon s war on drugs and the crackdown on crime were not simply aimed at black unrest they were neither separate from nor distinct from the broader program to restore order as nixon s counsel and assistant to the president for domestic affairs john erlichman put it the nixon campaign in 1968 and the nixon white house after that had two enemies the antiwar left and black people by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin and then criminalizing both heavily we could disrupt those communities we could arrest their leaders raid their homes break up their meetings and vilify them night after night on the evening news did we know we were lying about the drugs of course we did the new get tough on crime mood spread to the state level as well new york s governor nelson rockefeller had previously seen drugs as a social problem backing expanded drug rehabilitation job training and housing but in late 1972 he did an about face for drug pushing life sentence no parole no probation he told an aide new york s new harsh rockefeller drug laws quickly spread throughout the country the overall impact of the nixon era shift to repressive modes of social control was substantial though only a small number of social and political activists black or white were incarcerated a lot of people went to jail for smoking marijuana by the early 70s meetings of activists to plan militant actions were accompanied by paranoia and suspicion the various movements of the era died down for a variety of reasons but among them was the chilling impact of the shift to repressive social control the era of mass incarceration had begun nixon s own ability to implement his plans was soon fatally weakened by watergate gerald ford his successor was an unelected president with a democrat controlled congress and his successor the centrist jimmy carter lacked any clear policy vision and goals nevertheless after years of remaining stable in the nixon ford carter years the prison population grew by 55 percent by the mid 1980s it looked as if social control had been re established reagan not only won by a landslide but the republicans controlled the senate reagan s election signaled the end of unions as a powerful force the full defeat of left wing and black insurgencies the taming of radical versions of feminism the rise of the culture wars aimed especially at women and the gay movement a determined effort to further roll back the welfare state government was the problem not the solution and a stepping up of the war on drugs now aimed predominately at the black community then came the crack epidemic which turned even many middle and working class blacks into proponents of get tough policies targeting drugs and violence expand pat sutphin the times news via ap by the 80s a new problem was becoming clearly visible as well the unemployment rate had been slowly creeping up even before the stagflation of the 1970s and the male labor force participation rate the percentage of men who were either employed or actively seeking work had been steadily dropping there seemed to be a growing number of people for whom there was no place in the economy how could people who could no longer even hope for a job be contained faced with declining job opportunities many people when laid off simply left the work force entirely over the 1970s and 1980s the average retirement age dropped by three years others remained in school longer or returned to school the number of americans over the age of 16 who were enrolled in school grew from eight million in 1970 to almost 14 million by 1990 although the increase in the number of years spent in school partly reflected the need for more education or skills for the job market the increase in number of school years for the average american far outpaced the growth of jobs requiring more education prisons provided another solution to unemployment and underemployment not only could prisons warehouse the useless part of the population but since unemployment figures do not include those incarcerated they disguised the depth of the nation s economic problems the use of prisons to sop up the unemployable part of the population was not a self conscious policy deliberately instituted with that goal in mind rather it was an inevitable result of the shift from non coercive to coercive forms of social control unemployed and underemployed people are concentrated in poorer neighborhoods where crime rates are higher more intense law enforcement policies the absence of alternatives to incarceration e g drug treatment and stricter sentencing guidelines were automatically centered on the economically surplus population regardless of the specific reasons the rise in the prison population accelerated up 76 percent under reagan and up another 40 percent in george h w bush s four years when the democrats finally returned to power in 1992 they had neither the means nor the inclination to reverse these policies bill clinton was a weak president elected with only 43 percent of the vote independent ross perot and republican george h w bush combined for 57 percent unlike previous democratic presidents clinton lacked a powerful union base and operated in a political environment shaped by the post civil rights acts realignment of american party politics after 1994 the republicans controlled both houses of congress and ideologically clinton was a centrist more concerned about the concerns and values of white middle class americans than with the needs of the poor clinton unsuccessfully pushed for a few social welfare programs most notably health care reform but he had or felt he had little choice but to reinforce the repressive approach to social control the personal responsibility and work opportunities act threw millions off welfare as we have come to know it the defense of marriage act undercut the gay movement and the violent crime control and enforcement act provided for 100 000 new police officers 9 7 billion in funding for prisons new categories of crimes and the three strikes provision the prison population continued to rise another 52 percent years later michelle alexander would argue that to a large extent it was the clinton administration and the so called new democrats who are largely responsible for the emergence of this new caste like system but both the rise in the prison population long preceded his presidency the percentage of the growth attributable to war on drugs declined under clinton and the rate of increase in incarceration actually slowed in his second term so what needs to be done to end our half century long incarceration nightmare the first step of the solution to use the language of the new federal reform law is to address the immediate causes of the rise in incarceration at federal state and local levels but to get the numbers below that will require distinguishing the social control functions of policing from the legitimate control of serious crime and substituting non coercive means of social control for repressive ones at the most simplistic level people behave as they are supposed to for one of two reasons either they want to behave or they are made to behave the first non coercive approach was the dominant mode of the three decades following world war ii initially for whites but increasingly for blacks as well but after the early seventies the non coercive mechanisms steadily increasing wages and benefits gains in economic and social equality upwards social mobility a widespread sense of empowerment came under attack or were allowed to erode republicans and democrats alike shifted to a more coercive approach simultaneously the coercive mechanism above all the threat or reality of incarceration grew the alternative to incarceration is inclusion this is not the place for laying out the details of a program that would provide the basis for a return to non coercive patterns of social control the outlines undoubtedly would include policies aimed at providing job opportunities at a living wage creating and maintaining a durable social safety net providing affordable and non discriminatory housing providing decent well funded public schools and training programs making post secondary education both colleges and training programs financially accessible to all without creating a massive burden of debt providing low cost high quality easily accessible health and mental health care for all including drug abuse treatment providing policing that emphasizes connections between police and the communities they serve addressingpolitical and economic disempowerment and inequality e g ending barriers to unionization gerrymandering unrestricted corporate funding of elections disenfranchising of ex felons and combatting racial inequities in all of these areas as well as in the criminal justice system this is of course a general program for progressive change to gain political assent as well as for moral and practical reasons such programs would have to address the needs of white as well as black working class people the specifics of such a program can be argued on many grounds but purely from the perspective of the incarceration crisis anything less is spitting in the wind

according to an old proverb success has many fathers but failure is an orphan that proved to be all too true of the 2008 09 great recession in its aftermath nobody in the policymaking financial or academic communities stepped forward to accept responsibility for the worst global economic setback in the past 70 years it is most unlikely that anyone most certainly not president trump who is already blaming federal reserve chairman jay powell will take credit for the current u s stock market free fall which after the worst december since the great depression is all too likely to be not just a correction but an overdue unwinding of years of excess mosads whether the damage remains limited to markets or spills over into the general economy remains to be seen however we could very well be on the verge of another global economic and financial crisis a striking aspect of the present stock market meltdown is that it is occurring so soon after president trump kept boasting that his actions were leading to the stock market shattering records and after former federal reserve chairwoman janet yellen assured us that we would not see another global economic crisis in her lifetime it is also occurring against the backdrop of the academic economic community again distinguishing itself by its virtual silence about the dangers of bubbles and of bankers continuing to make very risky loans as the music played on it should have come as no surprise that sooner or later the global financial markets would unwind as violently as they now seem to be doing considering how far they were allowed to get out of line with their underlying values it was only a matter of time before a market bust was going to occur it was not simply that nothing was done to stop global stock market valuations from reaching levels seen only three times in the past 100 years it was also that government bond yields were allowed to drop to historically low levels and nothing was done to stop financial institutions from making very risky loans to unworthy borrowers at unusually low interest rates one can perhaps partly excuse the world s major central banks including the federal reserve for having set in motion our present boom bust cycle by its highly unorthodox monetary policy response to the great recession with the economy then in danger of succumbing to a deflationary spiral with interest rates having gone as low as possible and with strong political opposition to fiscal stimulus the world s central banks had little option but to buy government bonds on an enormous scale to encourage investors to take on additional risk at the time that seemed to be a price worth paying even though it came at the risk of distorting financial market prices and creating a global market bubble less easy to excuse was the fed s failure in 2017 to remove the low interest rate punch bowl when the global economic party was showing clear signs of getting out of hand with the american economy having reached close to full employment with a 25 percent jump in equity prices and with a 10 percent dollar depreciation why was the fed so reluctant to increase rates a more aggressive monetary policy in 2017 might have brought sense back to the market and reduced the chance that the american economy might overheat and bring inflation in its wake it is even more difficult to excuse the trump administration and the republican led congress for providing us with a large unfunded tax cut at precisely the wrong time in the economic cycle with unemployment very low and with the economy growing at a healthy clip the last thing the economy needed was a fiscal stimulus that might stoke fears of inflation and force the federal reserve to raise interest rates it is certainly not helping matters now at a time of heightened market volatility to have president trump so publicly blaming jay powell for the stock market bust when public confidence so urgently needs to be restored this is all more so the case considering that it was trump s overly expansive fiscal policy that forced the fed to raise interest rates to avoid the risk of economic overheating mossecondads the academics and bankers also deserve blame for having learned so little from the world s last boom bust cycle is it too much to ask of academic economists to learn that excessive asset price inflation is not consistent with long run economic stability and that their role should be to sound the alarm when bubbles are forming is it too much to ask of the financial sector to remember that making reckless loans gets us all into deep trouble when the music eventually stops playing i raise all these questions not so much as an exercise in finger pointing as in the hope that over the months ahead policymakers and economists will draw the right lessons about how we got into this very difficult economic and financial market situation only then will there be some chance that we might escape these boom bust cycles which now appear to be occurring on all too regular a basis desmond lachman is a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute he was formerly a deputy director in the

international gdp growth since the aftermath of the financial crisis and 2018 seemed to offer even better the global cyclical upswing that began midway through 2016 continues to gather strength reported the head of economics at the international monetary fund maury obstfeld stock markets were booming business confidence was high consumer sentiment was robust it looked like the world was finally shaking off the painful memory of the global financial crisis a decade ago now things are looking far less rosy true on the surface not much has changed the international monetary fund expects global growth in 2019 to come in at 3 7 percent the same as expected for 2018 and 2017 yet this is a downgrade from the 3 9 percent the fund was expecting eight month ago and the consensus among private sector economists is that it will be only 3 6 percent us growth is expected to slow quite markedly from 2 9 percent in 2018 to 2 5 percent in 2019 as the stimulus from donald trump s unfunded tax cuts wears off expansion projections in the us germany and france have also been shaved down there have also been downgrades for china india brazil mexico and south africa closer to the ground things look even uglier advertisement the german italian and japanese economies unexpectedly contracted in the third quarter of 2018 in the most recent official gdp data from those countries the german contraction mainly due to factory closures in its automotive sector was the first since 2015 chinese growth in the third quarter 6 5 percent year on year was the lowest for a decade survey

recent highs related stories the expansion may have peaked warns the imf we have had a good stretch of solid growth by historical standards but now we are facing a period where significant risks are materializing and darker clouds are looming says the fund s managing director christine lagarde what next for global growth so what explains those darkening clouds to put it concisely the answers seem to be trade wars rising us interest rates and brexit donald trump s trade aggression towards china his tariffs on 200bn of imports and threats of more appear to be finally hitting the real economy undermining sentiment among firms harming investment advertisement new export orders for manufacturers have fallen into contraction territory in germany and china container port traffic growth has also decelerated sharply despite the rhetoric from washington and beijing the deal between the two nations at the g20 in buenos aires earlier this month is plainly a temporary ceasefire rather than an armistice the imf calculates that trump s threatened car import tariffs on all countries except canada and mexico could hit global gdp in the immediate term by 0 75 percent the paris based organisation for economic cooperation and development is just as worried it estimates that tariff hostilities could knock up to 2 percent off world trade by 2021 then there s monetary policy the president s domestic tax cuts have clearly boosted short term gdp growth in the world s largest economy but they have also prompted the us central bank to raise interest rates to head off what it sees as the threat of unstable inflation the federal funds rate now stands at 2 5 percent and at least two more hikes are priced in by markets for 2019 in the past an inversion of the us borrowing yield curve where 10 year rates dip below two year rates has presaged an american recession weak rises in long yields relative to spiking short term yields this year means that an inversion seems to be getting steadily closer advertisement the gradual increase in interest rates by the us federal reserve has been enough to raise the value of the dollar undermine confidence in emerging markets and tighten global monetary conditions says gavyn davies of fulcrum asset management this process may or may not end in recession but it is certainly already causing recovery fatigue in most parts of the world economy tightening of the us monetary system tends to hit emerging markets there has been an abrupt stop of capital flows to emerging markets over recent months which has created painful consequences for with large external deficits says adam slater of oxford economics the spectre of monetary tightening and its impact also haunts europe the eurozone economy expanded by just 0 2 percent in the third quarter of 2018 its slowest quarterly pace in more than four years memories of 2017 when the single currency grew by 2 4 percent its fastest rate in a decade are long gone the imf projects growth of only 1 9 percent in 2019 for the eurozone that may be overoptimistic in italy growth is expected to slow from 1 2 percent to 1 percent next year despite the avoidance of sanctions from the european commission over its budget plans the populists in rome have backed down on borrowing for now but the fire could yet reignite in the new year and the european central bank has signaledthat this slowdown and political strife will not prompt it to re start its 2 6 trillion monetary stimulus programme which ended this month advertisement finally there is brexit the imf has penciled in non catastrophic growth for the uk economy next year of 1 5 percent up from 1 4 percent in 2017 but this is of course was predicated on the assumption of a smooth exit from the eu next march or rather entry into a 21 month single market and customs union transition where nothing really changes the bank of england says that if brexit is on the contrary economically disruptive and we get no deal with the eu the uk economy could contract by 3 percent and in a worst case scenario of a disorderly no deal brexit it could contract by 8 percent that would make the economic collapse bigger than that in the global financial crisis in 2008 that s a relatively low probability downside risk rather than a baseline of course but on the tenth anniversary of the financial meltdown it s as well to remember that sometimes perceived low probability downside risks materialise and they do so with no mercy the other great lesson from the financial crisis in 2008 is that risks can materialise from unexpected quarters perhaps a political shock could come from another refugee surge from the middle east or north africa or maybe it could come from a devastating cyberattack on

at the core of mmt is an accurate observation of how money works that any serious economist has been aware of since the end of the gold standard the creation of free floating currencies this basis gives mmt credibility the premise of mmt is that a sovereign government with its own free floating currency and central bank can never go bust as it can produce new money and spend as it likes wouldn t it be great if i could end this column here unfortunately i can t because even though this is correct there are many real life practical restrictions on spending and significant negative side effects with its use firstly if a government can spend what it wants there is no restriction on unhinged leaders spending in a way that kills the planet for example trump could build that wall without the need for a deeply damaging government shutdown in the short term this would boost the us economy and create jobs however all economic activity comes with an environmental cost and a building project of that size would significantly increase the carbon output of the usa at a time when it needs to radically reduce it if every country behaved that way the world would further deplete it s finite natural resources driving us to the co2 tipping point disastrously quickly politicians throughout history have been deeply flawed when it comes to understanding complex cause and effect systems so what is to stop bad leaders spending trillions on white elephant projects just to get elected triggering those huge environmental costs read more why it s time to get real about downsides of immigration secondly right wing populist leaders observing that the public sector has unlimited ability to fund the government s socioeconomic agenda might not bother taxing business at all the uk s conservative government has been trying to gradually transfer the balance of taxation from business onto the individual for years this would allow them to do it in one fell swoop likewise a socialist populist could cut income tax but maintain business taxes if the economy failed under either of these scenarios then the electoral swings from left to right would become massively polarising thirdly mmt means no limit on military spending and effectively guarantees a new global arms race the fact that nuclear weapons are expensive to develop is one of the key reasons we are still breathing making this cheaper will have disastrous consequences any government with a large military complex will eventually use that military might when the global economy collapses as it must do when competition for natural resources intensifies and when the planet overheats fourthly if a nation were to utilise mmt to replace taxation the value of its currency would sink like a stone brexit has demonstrated how dependent the uk is on imports of food medicines and industrial components the value of the pound sets the cost of those imports if the supply of money becomes high enough to dilute the value of currencies held by individuals corporations and countries they will disinvest the pound will rapidly lose value and purchase less than it did before no problem we just print more money said one mmt evangelist to me recently yes but then you end up paying a thousand pounds for bread it s called hyperinflation in the case of the pound it would lose its international reserve currency status whereby nations all over the world hold stocks of reserve currencies to settle international debts because it has traditionally been a strong and stable currency if governments can spend whatever they want and know that they can always print money to get out of trouble then banks would behave recklessly as they can just be bailed out read more would the uk vote remain this time don t be so sure finally mmt removes all discipline in the economy from individuals corporations and politicians which would impact negatively on inflation the environment and the supply of labour an economic bubble would inflate and this would be the bubble not just to end all bubbles but to end all civilisation when it crashes there are six reasons why mmt is a good theory but a bad iconic mantra and it s certainly not the answer for an independent scotland once it launches its own currency it s true that when the banking system collapsed governments all over the world printed new money indeed the uk government s 375bn money printing exercise saved the uk economy from collapse the popularity of mmt comes from observing that this injection of new money didn t instantly create hyperinflation and crash the economy the reason it worked was that everyone did it at the same time and the uk government gave that new money to the banks not the people this meant falsely inflated stock prices and the value of the assets of the rich and widening inequality but it didn t stimulate the real economy and cause inflation for years i have been in favour of controlled quantitative easing new money creation for special infrastructure projects where there is a market failure creating a citizen s bank to maintain banking services to rural areas upgrading broadband and communications infrastructure debt forgiveness for the people who were damaged by the banking crisis and austerity because it wasn t fair to just bail out the rich working in unison with the rest of the world and in a controlled way we could boost carbon reduction in time to save the planet with a massive cash injection that didn t take from other spending areas so in rejecting mmt as a replacement overarching economic theory we must still accept that at its core there is an idea we can utilise as an ingredient in the new economic mix required to replace neoliberalism what mmt offers us is not an approach to money creation that solves the world s problems but rather support for an observation that i have made many times in this column that there is far more monetary policy flexibility available than politicians and economists have traditionally believed read more rebirth of a scottish stock exchange can unlock our potential
here s our summary of key events over the holiday that affect new zealand with news markets are in the grip of risk aversion this big news overnight has been the announcement by apple that sales and profits are under pressure in the absence of other news this has caused markets to become more risk averse in early afternoon trade the s p500 is down 2 0 and the bond markets have turned suddenly bearish most american economic data is not good either the closely watched ism factory survey took a very sharp turn worse especially for new orders there was a sharp and unexpected rise in jobless claims last week and the weakness in new mortgage applications got worse to be down almost 10 on a seasonally adjusted basis and 6 lower than the same time a year ago the only bright spot is the adp data for december which came in better than expected we are expecting a given there will be no non farms payrolls report tomorrow despite due to the us federal government shutdown this data will stand on its own for a while recall the adp november data was unexpectedly weak and much weaker than the official non farm data so today s result may just be a rebalancing markets are expecting a modest 180 000 rise one us canary reflecting the general pullback is that manhattan home prices now average less that us 1 mln for the first time since 2015 in china beijing has given approval for two big new intercity rail projects which will add another us 34 bln in stimulus to their cooling economy and we should note that china has landed a spacecraft on the far side of the moon china has also deployed a new hyperersonic weapon to launch missiles so fast they are likely to render defenses unable to respond china is also clamping down even harder on negative information yesterday the shanghai stock exchange closed unchanged even after the apple news hong kong and tokyo both posted minor losses in europe stocks were generally 1 lower overnight in italy the ecb placed an italian bank into official administration and it looks like the new populist italian government will bail it out exactly the reverse of the firebrand positions they took when campaigning apple may have all the limelight today but google is in the news too according to a filing at the netherlands chamber of commerce google moved almost 20 bln through a dutch shell company to bermuda in 2017 as part of an arrangement that allows it to reduce its tax bill in australia following the hayne inquiry directors are being denied d o insurance or events like the hayne inquiry are becoming exclusions this is likely to reduce the willingness of many directors to continue in their governance roles the flow on impact could be very serious for australian and new zealand corporate governance standards at financial institutions and in a further consequence home loan flows are slowing sharply as lenders try to work out how to stay on the right side of the hayne commission recommendations and they are even released yet this risks of getting lending standards wrong are now sky high and so a very conservative approach is being adopted in the absence of new guidance the result is that there is a housing credit crunch the ust 10yr yield had dived 8 bps today to stand at 2 59 and that is after the previous 7 bps fall their 2 10 curve however is still at 16 bps this is a very major bond market event taking the 10yr yield back to its lowest in almost a year bond markets have completely discounted the fed s latest position the australian govt 10yr is also lower again down 4 bps to 2 19 on top of the previous 14 bps drubbing the china govt 10yr is only 1 bp lower at 3 19 today while the new zealand govt 10yr has fallen sharply as well down 7 bps to 2 32 on top of yesterday s 4 bps drop things are no better on local interest rate swap markets yesterday the two year fell 3 bps to 1 94 and its lowest since november the five year is now at 2 15 a 6 bps daily drop while the ten year was down 8 bps to 2 57 that is its lowest since september 2016 the flattening of this 2 10 curve has it at just 62 bps and its flattest since october 2016 in light of all this risk aversion gold just keeps on rising and is now at us 1 291 another us 8 oz gain us oil prices are a bit lower at just over us 46 50 bbl while the brent benchmark is just under us 55 50 bbl opec output cuts have started the kiwi dollar starts today firmer against the greenback at 66 9 usc on the cross rates we are at 95 5 auc and at 58 7 euro cents that puts the twi 5 at 71 3 yesterday we got an object lesson in the effects of illiquidity in markets and the false signals they can deliver after the apple announcement these thinly traded holiday markets thrashed the aussie dollar and shoved the japanese yen higher at one point the nzd traded at over 98 4 auc automated trading may have been behind the sudden gyrations bitcoin is a little softer us 3 785 a 1 6 decline since this time yesterday this rate is charted in the exchange rate set below the easiest place to stay up with event risk today is by following our economic calendar here

source imgflip i recently launched my new deep value dividend growth portfolio or dvdgp this represents the culmination of 23 years of investing experience and over four years of professional knowledge i ve gleaned while being an analyst investment writer the portfolio is designed to answer the burning question that readers have been asking me in recent weeks and months where is the best place to put new money today the portfolio is specifically tailored to all investors both conservative retirees as well as younger investors still building their long term wealth dvdgp is 100 focused on low risk sleep well at night or swan stocks that are designed to provide safe and growing income no matter what the economy industry conditions or interest rates are doing our strategy is focused on three time tested and proven investing strategies safe yield strong payout coverage balance sheets and quality management steady payout growth over time clear long term growth runway a good discount to fair value high margin of safety and long term valuation boost i literally couldn t have launched this portfolio at a better time because we just experienced the worst correction since the great recession as a result almost all sectors are undervalued and even grade a blue chips are trading at some of their best valuations in years that includes blue chip mlps like enterprise products partners nyse epd magellan midstream partners mmp and mplx nyse mplx all of which i recently bought for the dvdgp let s take a look at why wall street has once again turned hyper bearish on these great high yield income growth stocks and why the market is almost certainly wrong more importantly learn why these three blue chips in particular from today s great valuations 16 to 33 discount to fair value are likely to deliver not just generous safe and growing income in the coming years but likely also market beating total returns of about 15 to 17 or to put another way thanks to the market s latest irrational short term freakout all three of these high yield blue chips are very strong buys for your diversified income growth portfolio why wall street is so bearish on mlps right now there are three reasons a stock can crash general market weakness an industry bear market and fundamental problems at the company mlp level source wealth of common sense data as of december 23rd 2018 thanks to a perfect storm of negative factors including political chaos in dc fears over the fed hiking us into a recession and trade uncertainties the overall stock market just had one of its weakest quarters ever as a result almost every sector went from historically overvalued a year ago to historically undervalued energy in particular has been the hardest hit in recent weeks and become the most undervalued source of quality bargain hunting you can find today source iea that s thanks to worries over a global oil glut in 2019 causing one of the fastest oil crashes in decades a shocking 45 decline in just two months this has been especially rough on mlps because the last oil crash mid 2014 to early 2016 was brutal enough to kick off an industry bear market that s now in its fifth year part of the reason that mlp investors have been fleeing in droves is fear that a severe and prolonged oil crash will bankrupt many oil gas producers and thus potentially put at risk the long term volume committed contracts that underpin mlp distributable cash flow or dcf dcf is the industry equivalent of free cash flow and what pays the distributions in recent weeks the combination of crashing oil prices and overall financial market fear has caused junk bond spreads junk bond yield minus yield on investment grade debt to soar if that were to continue then weaker oil gas producers might indeed face much higher debt refinancing costs in the future which might cause some to go bankrupt but while these broader market and industry conditions are based on real risks fears of slowing growth and energy industry bankruptcies as usual wall street is letting worries over worst case scenarios cause it to irrationally price an industry that s not dying but thriving and why wall street is dead wrong first let s address the broader market fear of slowing us economic growth which is largely a function of fed tightening and trade uncertainties it s certainly true that 2018 s 3 gdp growth as high as 4 2 in q2 2018 isn t going to be repeated however it s important to remember that most economists expected slower but still positive growth in 2019 and 2020 for 2019 estimates range from 2 3 the fed to 2 7 nyse imf with factset research right in the middle at 2 5 that s even with growth slowing by q4 to just 2 and even further into 2020 1 8 growth forecast for that year source factset research that s expected to drive slower but still above historically average earnings growth in 2019 as well as 2020 note that in recent weeks earnings estimates that have been steadily falling due to growth concerns from 10 5 to 7 8 have stabilized around 8 for the entire s p 500 but what about energy won t crashing oil prices cause energy earnings to be decimated and thus imperil mlp contracts cash flows and distributions source factset research in fact even with us oil prices stabilizing around 45 down from 76 in early october energy earnings are expected to grow almost 10 making it the third fastest growing sector next year what about the risk that oil prices crash even further and thus prove those estimates wrong well for that to be true two things would have to happen first the expected oil glut in 2019 would have to worsen due to weaker oil demand growth caused by a global recession source forexlive however no major global economic forecasts call for a global recession in 2019 or 2020 in fact no large economy is expected to fall into a recession just suffer slower growth due to the risk factors that we re currently facing that s why the international energy administration s latest 2019 oil demand growth forecast is unchanged at 1 4 million bpd and as for the oil glut we can t forget that this was largely triggered by a temporary event notably opec boosting oil production by 1 2 million bpd ahead of iranian oil sanctions that us waivers have made unnecessary those expire in four months opec and russia recently agreed to cut production by 1 2 million in january to undo those previous increases that is combining with alberta s government ordering canadian oil companies to cut production by 8 7 over 300 000 bpd to stabilize oil prices which are no longer crashing this highlights one of the biggest differences between this oil crash and the last one in 2015 opec tried to crash oil prices on purpose to bankrupt us shale at the time us oil producers were highly leveraged and breakeven prices were about 85 for most shale formations the oil crash which bankrupted about 100 companies out of 3 000 shale producers caused the entire industry to deleverage rapidly and focus on growing production purely out of operating cash flow source pioneer natural resources investor presentation thanks to much lower interest costs and new fracking 3 0 technology breakeven prices have now plummetted to 30 or below for most major shale formations opec now realizes it can t win a protracted price war with us shale thanks to the much stronger financial fundamentals of the industry that s why not just did opec russia agree to cut production but saudia arabia has agreed to cut its production by an extra 20 and the uae oil minister recently told reuters that opec is willing to call a special meeting to deepen and extend cuts even further â what if the 1 2 million barrels of cuts are not enough i am telling you that if it is not we will meet and see what is enough and we will do it the plan to cut oil production is well studied but if it does not work we always have the power in opec to call for an extraordinary meeting if we are required to extend for another six months we will do it i can assure you an extension will not be a problem â suhail al mazrouei uae oil minister essentially opec is now willing to do whatever it takes to stabilize oil prices because after the last oil crash devastated its member s financial reserves most country s in the group simply can t afford to balance their budgets at low oil prices source statista current brent price 53 that stabilization via cuts is why the us eia is forecast us oil to average 54 in 2019 and brent to average 61 note that most us oil producers mlp customers have now budgeted continued production growth at 40 to 50 us oil prices source eia combine much stronger us oil companies with lower breakeven prices and a modest recovery in crude expected this year and analyst forecasts for continued earnings growth for oil stocks are indeed reasonable and let s not forget that mlps are not a commodity sensitive industry but a volume focused one and when you combine all those facts with the strong individual business models and balance sheets of these three mlp blue chips the result is a fantastic long term buying opportunity enterprise products partners the granddaddy of mlp blue chips is poised to profit ipoing in 1998 enterprise is one of america s oldest and largest mlps with a massive and vertically integrated system of midstream assets that services nearly every major oil gas formation and every part of the fossil fuel value chain source enterprise products partners investor presentation that system is the result of over 64 billion of well managed and executed capex and acquisitions over the past two decades enterprise s wide moat asset base is so essential to the energy industry that typically oil or gas will pass through at least six of the company s assets between being extracted and making its way to the end consumer and thanks to massive continued growth in us oil gas and natural gas liquid or ngl production enterprise s actual financial results in 2018 are setting new records source enterprise products partners investor presentation that includes retained dcf dcf minus distributions of over 1 5 billion that puts the mlp on track to retain about 2 1 billion in 2018 to reinvest in future growth and let s not forget that due to almost all its cash flow being under long term 15 for its ngl assets and usually volume committed contracts 100 for ngl assets epd s cash flow has been extremely stable even in the face of the second worst oil crash in over 50 years 76 plunge in crude between 2014 2016 source enterprise products partners investor presentation that has resulted in the mlp delivering remarkable distribution growth including 20 consecutive years of increases and payout hikes for 57 consecutive quarters source enterprise products partners investor presentation now it s true that recently epd has pulled back on the rate of its distribution hikes to just 2 4 that s part of management s long term plan to de risk the business model even further by switching to a self funding business model that means that going forward enterprise wants to retain enough cash flow to replace all of the equity issuances other than drip it has used to fund organic growth in the past or to put another way enterprise wants it enormous long term growth potential to be 100 independent of its stock price in the first 9 months of 2018 epd funded 49 of its capex with retained cash flow 37 with debt and 14 with its drip the mlp s official target is to fund 50 of growth with retained cash flow and in q3 it officially hit and surpassed that target management which owns 32 of its units says that in 2020 the mlp will re evaluate its capital allocation plans to either accelerate distribution growth start repurchasing its undervalued units or both as part of that plan which is now about 1 year ahead of schedule the company has focused on strengthening its balance sheet already one of the safest in the industry even further source enterprise products partners investor presentation in 2016 when the average mlp had a leverage ratio of about 6 5 epd s peaked at 4 4 credit rating agencies and bond investors consider 5 0 or below a safe level given the stable and commodity insensitive nature of mlp cash flow enterprise s leverage ratio recently hit 3 6 and management s new long term goal is just 3 5 that s likely good enough to earn it an upgrade to an a credit rating which would be an industry first source enterprise products partners investor presentation further cementing its long term payout safety is the fact that enterprise has been refinancing its debt in recent years in a rising rate environment to focus on locking in low interest rates for decades that s why 99 of its debt is now fixed and half of its bonds are for 30 years yet despite an average bond duration of almost 20 years longer than the duration of its contracts the mlp s average cost of debt is just 4 7 or roughly 1 3rd its returns on invested capital source enterprise products partners investor presentation and thanks to one of the best management teams in the industry has been able to consistently grow while retaining stable and high roic over time in fact over the past decade the mlp s unlevered roic has averaged 12 among the highest in the industry that s what keeps its dcf unit growth so steadily and makes it a high yield income growth investor s dream stock source enterprise products partners investor presentation today enterprise is working on over 6 billion in high margin growth projects 82 of that is focused on ngls and petrochemicals which are booming thanks to america s low cost advantage courtesy of cheap natural gas fueling strong export demand to emerging markets and the mlp continues to add new projects to its backlog which is why ceo jim teague over 40 years of industry experience announced during the last conference call that enterprise is doubling down on ngls even more we announced two additional growth projects this morning including these projects we currently have 6 6 billion of growth capital projects under construction that are scheduled to be completed and begin generating new sources of cash flow between now and 2020 jim teague why is enterprise betting so heavily on ngls because they serve as the feedstock for high margin petrochemicals like ethylene and propylene demand for these chemicals is booming thanks to strong demand growth from all over the world but especially china and india source enterprise products partners investor presentation enterprise has positioned itself to be a leading one stop shop for the ngl petrochemical industry thanks to having so much of its gathering processing and transportation infrastructure located in texas specifically the booming permian basin 70 of future ngl growth is coming from texas and literally no mlp is better positioned to profit from this secular trend source enterprise products partners investor presentation but being so large and diversified epd isn t just betting on ngl and petrochemical exports rather enterprise is also poised to help america become one of the world s largest energy exporters including in oil ngls and refined products source enterprise products partners investor presentation today enterprise s total export capacity is 5 million bpd but it plans to expand that by 60 in the coming years that includes increasing its oil export capacity by 2 million bpd by 2021 that s to help serve america s oil export market which is what s allowing us shale production to grow at such a prodigious rate source enterprise products partners investor presentation between 2018 and 2025 us oil exports are expected to more than triple and make america the second largest oil exporter in the world behind saudi arabia within just six years because us oil is sweeter than what our own refineries can handle exports are the primary way that us shale production can grow until our old refineries are converted to handle the low sulfur crude but thanks to that export boom opec hardly a fan of us shale expects america s shale production to double by 2029 to a staggering 16 million bpd source eia 2018 long term forecast and thanks to the fact that natural gas and ngls are produced alongside crude that means that america s epic energy boom expected to last for decades is going to require massive infrastructure investments over the coming years 100 billion in new midstream demand by 2021 791 billion by 2035 50 for oil 50 for gas and ngls 1 0 trillion by 2050 the bottom line is that enterprise s toll booth business model with its long term and volume committed contracts means rock steady cash flow no matter what commodity prices are doing and with one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry that keeps getting better over time a large and growing backlog of growth projects and a low risk self funding business model enterprise products partners is an exceptional high yield swan stock that you can rely on in all market economic industry environments magellan midstream partners a time tested blue chip you can trust while enterprise is the king of us ngls magellan which ipod in 2001 is the king of refined product pipelines the mlp owns 9 700 miles of refined product gasoline diesel jet fuel pipelines 53 terminals and 44 million barrels of storage capacity mostly focused on the midwest in half of its 15 state service base magellan s network provides 40 of all refined products used in total magellan s network connects to 50 of us refining capacity source magellan investor presentation the reason the mlp began by focusing on refined products is the highly favorable economics of that industry specifically us refined product demand is extremely stable but also a slow no growth industry as a result magellan s network is very wide moat because rivals are not willing to invest billions to recreate it which gives it strong pricing power historically this allows magellan to hike its pipeline tariffs by 2 to 3 per year and sometimes like in 2018 up to 4 4 without losing market share but while refined products are a wide moat and highly lucrative business magellan needs other industries to grow its cash flow and distributions this is why since 2010 the mlp has been focusing on serving the rapid growth of america s shale oil industry source magellan investor presentation in the past eight years magellan has invested 5 4 billion into constructing 2 200 miles of crude pipelines and 33 million barrels of storage capacity this is focused on critical geographic areas including cushing oklahoma where us oil is priced and the permian basin source rattler midstream s 1 the permian according to analyst firm rystad energy could hold up to 250 billion barrels of recoverable remaining reserves about half of which is profitable to extract at 40 crude prices or below 45 current price magellan s pipelines are focused on connecting the key permian drilling sites to export terminals on the texas gulf coast primarily in houston the mlp also has pipelines connecting the prolific eagle ford basin to export capacity in corpus christi source magellan midstream partners investor presentation thanks to its diversification efforts in oil and oil exports today slow no growth refined products account for just 54 of magellan s cash flow source magellan midstream partners investor presentation like with enterprise and most mlps magellan s cash flow is nearly entirely insensitive to commodity prices just 7 of operating cash flow is exposed to volatile oil prices its highly stable cash flow plus aggressive investments over time have allowed magellan to deliver 17 consecutive years of distribution growth including 66 consecutive quarterly payout hikes source magellan midstream partners investor presentation that fast and consistent distribution growth made possible by magellan being the first mlp in america to eliminate its idrs enterprise and mplx have as well and adopt a self funding business model has made this mlp into a fantastic market beating high yield investment over time such amazing performance is courtesy of stellar management led by ceo and chairman michael mears mears has been with magellan for about 30 years before it ipod it was his forward looking leadership that allowed the mlp to eliminate its idrs back during the financial crisis at low cost and thus greatly lower the mlp s cost of capital making future investment more profitable source magellan investor presentation what s even more impressive is that magellan has managed to master self funding with the lowest coverage ratio in the industry among self funding peers historically the mlp s dcf has been 1 2 yet it s still managed to avoid issuing new equity since buying out its idrs in 2010 for context most self funding mlps maintain coverage ratios of 1 4 to 1 9 going forward magellan expects to achieve 5 to 8 distribution growth via its laser like focus on the most profitable projects all while maintaining its historically safe 1 2 coverage ratio in this industry 1 1 or above is low risk source magellan midstream partners investor presentation at first glance you might think that a 2 5 billion backlog with another 500 million in the shadow backlog projects awaiting contracts isn t much and compared to epd s 6 6 billion in ongoing growth efforts it s indeed small however off magellan s smaller asset base the mlp s most aggressive spending ever still managed to deliver 20 yoy dcf growth in q3 2018 magellan s latest growth project is a 600 mile pipeline connecting the permian to both its export terminal in houston as well as energy transfer et s louisiana facility source magellan investor presentation that 2 billion project 500 million is mmp s share is a joint venture between magellan energy transfer mplx and delek logistics partners dkl the initial capacity is set at 1 million bpd but the consortium is conducting an open season to see if it can t obtain enough contracts to expand that significantly the pipeline is expected to be fully operational by mid 2020 meanwhile magellan s shadow backlog which for years was listed as over 500 million is now well over 500 million and includes another pipeline between cushing oklahoma and houston a pipeline from houston to corpus christi expanded oil export terminal in corpus cristi capable of handling very large crude carriers with 2 million bpd of capacity per ship source magellan investor presentation magellan management is focused on only the highest margin projects specifically targeting 12 5 to 16 7 ebitda yields vs industry average of 10 to 12 5 disciplined capital allocation is a key reason for magellan s past success and what will continue to make this a good high yield income stock in the future even more impressive is that magellan has managed to self fund its growth while maintaining one of the lowest leverage ratios in the industry management s policy is to never exceed 4 0 and in q3 the leverage ratio hit 2 3 one of its lowest levels ever magellan leverage ratio over time source magellan investor presentation the mlp plans to raise that substantially in the future by potentially tapping its 1 billion revolving credit facility which has remained untouched for years but even if the leverage ratio rises to management s self imposed 4 0 limit that will still make for one of the strongest and safest balance sheets in the industry the point is that magellan is a legendary mlp blue chip with an impressive track record of delivering generous safe and fast payout growth no matter what the stock market economy or oil prices are doing and thanks to its biggest growth backlog ever and access to plenty of low cost capital to execute on those growth plans magellan s future looks bright indeed mplx the industry s newest blue chip is on its way to becoming the epd of tomorrow mplx was launched in 2013 by marathon petroleum mpc which is now america s largest independent refiner originally it was supposed to be a drop down oriented mlp that just raised debt and equity capital from investors to buy marathon s logistics infrastructure which included 10 000 miles of crude and refined products pipelines 62 light product terminals in the midwest gulf coast and southeast 56 million barrels of refined product storage capacity marine operations that include 20 owned towboats and more than 255 owned and leased barges those assets would come with five to 10 year volume committed contracts that would ensure stable cash flow to support mplx s generous and fast growing distribution source mplx investor presentation but while mplx s logistics storage business still accounts for 65 of cash flow the mlp has set its sights on becoming the future epd that began with the 2015 15 6 billion acquisition of markwest the dominant natural gas and ngl mlp in the prolific marcellus utica shale of pennsylvania ohio and west virginia thanks to markwest as well as several years of organic growth to expand those assets mplx is now a dominant natural gas and ngl mlp as well with 5 9 billion cubic feet per day of gas gathering capacity 8 9 billion cubic feet per day of gas processing capacity 610 000 barrels per day of ngl fractionation capacity note that not all of that gas ngl capacity is just in the marcellus utica mplx has since diversified into oklahoma s scoop stack formation and is now starting to provide for the gas ngl needs of the permian as well source mplx investor presentation those gas ngl contracts are for 10 to 15 years in duration and have allowed mplx to achieve remarkable cash flow growth as well as a steadily rising distribution coverage ratio and keep in mind that mplx s dcr which hit 1 47 in q3 is despite growing its payout at 18 cagr since its ipo source mplx investor presentation even during the 2014 2016 oil crash mplx not just avoided a payout cut but continued to grow its distribution at a fast and sustainable rate in fact it s now raised its payout for 23 consecutive quarters the markwest acquisition meant that mplx had a toehold in two of america s three booming energy markets source mplx investor presentation however in order to become a fully integrated industry blue chip management needed to make two changes the first was buying out mpc s idrs as well as the rest of its logistics infrastructure in 2017 that was part of an epic 12 billion acquisition year that left mplx with permanently lower costs of capital as well as a self funding business model those massive acquisitions combined with strong volume growth in its markwest assets means that mplx s dcf growth in the first nine months of 2018 was 79 one of the fastest growth rates in the industry and thanks to its rising coverage ratio mplx is now on track to retain nearly 1 billion in annual cash flow to fund its growth that growth includes the mlp s bigger focus on crude pipelines of which it owns 4 500 miles worth as well as numerous joint venture stakes like with magellan mplx s crude pipelines are focused on the permian where production is expected to double over the next five years and where new takeaway capacity is in highest demand source mplx investor presentation but in addition to serving the permian s exploding oil takeaway needs mplx wants to become vertically integrated like enterprise that means it s also participating in joint ventures to serve that mega formation s natural gas and ngl needs via the 450 mile whistler natural gas pipeline 2 billion cubic feet per day capacity in service q4 2020 a 170 mile natural gas pipeline for industrial customers also in service q4 2020 a 400 mile ngl pipeline two new ngl fractionators with 150 000 bpd of capacity each and starting in q3 2018 mplx like epd also got into the energy export business source mplx investor presentation that s when mplx spent 450 million on the mt airy export terminal which included 4 million barrels of storage capacity and 120 000 bpd of export capacity not just does management plan to increase that capacity to 10 million barrels of storage and 240 0000 bpd of export capacity in the future but it s already secured the permits to do so and mt airy is just one of five export locations that mplx plans to focus on in the future so that it can cash in on us exports of both ngls and crude oil in total mplx plans to spend 6 6 billion between 2018 and 2020 on organic growth projects including 4 2 billion in 2019 and 2020 source mplx investor presentation that is expected to drive 8 2 annualized dcf growth over the next two years and management will be rewarding investors with quarterly 0 01 distribution hikes that translates into about 6 distribution growth which is slightly below the growth rate of dcf unit source mplx investor presentation that should help the mlp boost its already safe coverage ratio from 1 47 to about 1 53 by 2020 assuming the same distribution growth in 2020 which in turn would mean mplx will be retaining 1 2 billion per year in cash flow within two years that s enough to fund 57 of its growth spending plans assuming 2 1 billion in long term growth capex which will help the mlp maintain one of the lowest leverage ratios among blue chip mlps 3 8 in q3 2018 that s a fortress like balance sheet that is why mplx has recently been able to sell new bonds at highly attractive rates 2 25 billion in 10 year bonds at 4 8 interest rate 1 5 billion in 30 year bonds at a 5 5 interest rate the mlp also has 2 3 billion in liquidity under its revolving credit facilities to leverage its large amount of retained cash flow but keep in mind that this guidance doesn t include the potential future acquisition of andeavor logistics lp andx in may 2018 marathon bought andeavor andv in a 23 billion deal that left it the largest independent refiner in america andeavor s mlp andx happens to own substantial assets including 1 500 miles of refined product pipelines 47 million barrels of oil storage capacity 1 7 billion cubic feet day of natural gas processing capacity 4 500 miles of oil gas pipelines in addition andx is working on 3 billion in organic growth projects and additional drop down opportunities of legacy andv assets andeavor logistics assets are concentrated in the permian and north dakota s bakken so purchasing andx something management eventually plans to do would further strengthen mplx s goal of becoming the new epd by diversifying into yet more hot shale formations the point is that mplx has managed to evolve from a drop down oriented refiner focused mlp into a true vertically integrated blue chip one with its finger increasingly in every part of america s booming energy industry that bodes well for its long term growth prospects in fact epd mmp and mplx all offer what i consider to be a near perfect combination of generous safe and steadily growing income that should translate into some of the best total returns of any blue chip you can find today payout profiles safe moutherwatering yields and great total return potentials the most important part of any

expansion when the market calms down and stops ignoring these mlps objectively excellent and fast improving fundamentals how much of a valuation boost are we talking for that i turn to my favorite valuation method for blue chip income stocks dividend yield theory or dyt since 1966 dyt has proven highly effective for stable business model companies as proven by asset manager newsletter publisher investment quality trends source investment quality trends iqt has been exclusively using dyt on blue chip dividend stocks to deliver decades of market beating total returns and with 10 less

dividends dividend yield theory gordon dividend growth model fast graphs moneychimp mmp has the greatest upside to fair value and epd the least but all three stocks are likely to deliver fantastic total returns well in excess of the market s historical total returns in the coming years that kind of margin of safety means that all three are very strong buys for anyone comfortable with their risk profiles risks to consider while all three of these stocks are low risk from a payout safety perspective that doesn t mean investors shouldn t be aware of several challenges they might face in the future magellan and mplx are both betting big on crude pipelines in the permian and for good reason however with so many mlps building pipelines as fast as possible takeaway capacity is going to rapidly increase starting in the second half of 2019 a lot more capacity means that market rates for pipelines are likely to decline for example in q3 magellan renegotiated 50 of its permian longhorn pipeline capacity bringing total contracted capacity to 100 however that was at a rate of 1 75 per barrel compared to 2 25 on its remaining 50 capacity eight year average contract duration remaining this means that this key pipeline now has an average remaining contract of five years at a lower market rate of 2 per barrel of oil transported this highlights that while long term and volume committed contracts make for great cash flow stability eventually contracts expire and then mlps need to renegotiate them while overcapacity is not a big risk to the industry no projects begin construction without most capacity already contracted for cash flow growth rates can face headwinds if future market rates are lower than expected and as for enterprise its biggest risk is betting so heavily on ngls to drive its growth while its ngl projects specifically fractionators are all 100 contracted for 15 years future growth in ngls is dependent on continued strong economic growth in emerging markets driving high import demands for petrochemicals however china s economy already slowing due to several secular trends has been hit hard by the trade war with the us as a result markit s latest manufacturing survey report came in at 49 7 down from 50 2 in november 50 is neutral and a reading below 50 indicates that china s manufacturing industry a key user of petrochemicals is now contracting source bloomberg that is confirmed by the latest chinese manufacturing pmi which is also below 50 and has been declining rapidly for most of 2018 similarly falling chinese wholesale inflation is a bad sign that china s growth rate is falling faster than previously anticipated while this isn t a short term risk for epd or mplx should china s growth rate over time come in below expectations than the big growth runways those mlps currently see in ngls could be significantly shortened finally with regards to mplx while the lack of idrs and a self funding business model makes this a low risk stock there is one negative scenario in particular investors need to keep in mind specifically that if mplx becomes too overvalued then marathon might end up buying it in an mlp rollup as valero vlo did with its mlp valero midstream partners vlp the good news is that there are key differences between vlp and mplx specifically that vlp was a drop down focused mlp that still had idrs that made profitable future growth harder mplx has completed all of its marathon drop downs and is 100 focused on organic growth which it can self fund with ease thanks to a lack of idrs however with the andeavor logistics acquisition potentially looming in its future uncertain terms could keep unit price suppressed investors need to still keep this low but not zero probability scenario in mind specifically the risk is that those buying mplx for its 8 4 yield and long term 6 payout growth might end up owning shares of far lower yielding marathon 3 1 yield what s more marathon while a great refiner has a far more volatile business model that will make long term dividend growth less predictable relative to mplx s quarterly hikes and of course should mpc buyout mplx then that would be a taxable event which could mean that long term investors might see some negative tax implications as well bottom line short term market hysteria about energy stocks means today is the perfect time to buy these 3 high yield blue chips i ll be the first to admit that the length and severity of the mlp bear market have shocked even veteran investors like me despite objectively great fundamentals and the best long term industry growth runway in history wall street continues to hate on even the highest quality blue chip mlps however as benjamin graham buffett s mentor and the father of value investing points out in the short run the market is like a voting machine tallying up which firms are popular and unpopular but in the long run the market is like a weighing machine assessing the substance of a company benjamin graham as it turns out the long term made up of many short term periods can result in long industry bear markets that ignore even fantastic fundamentals and ridiculous valuations that s especially true when you get a perfect storm of negative factors such as two oil crashes four market corrections and a negative regulatory rule change that spooked easily frightened retail investors but didn t actually affect most mlps but ultimately the most fundamental truth of investing is that a stock s intrinsic value is based on the cash flow and income it generates for investors enterprise product partners magellan midstream partners and mplx are all industry leading blue chips with proven track records of delivering generous safe and growing income even in the most extreme economic or industry conditions not just are their commodity insensitive and recession resistant cash flows a solid source of income you can depend on but their low risk self funding business models mean they can continue growing strongly for decades no matter what the irrational and fickle stock market decides to do and with each of these mlp blue chips now trading at some of their best valuations in years or in some cases ever each is a very strong buy for your diversified income growth portfolio that s why i added each to my new deep value dividend growth portfolio in the past few weeks because with their excellent and improving fundamentals i think these mlps might be some of the hottest income stocks of 2019 but more importantly generate 15 to 17 long term total returns over the coming decade

2020 to beat trump democrats must counter his lies with realistic solutions ome senators have started to discuss a federal jobs guarantee a promise that in certain formulations means that anyone who wants could have a government job paying 15 an hour with great benefits sound too good to be true it is proponents of a jobs guarantee are smart people with good motives but they surely recognize that it is not a realistic policy similarly a promise of universal free college has an appealing ring but it s not a progressive prioritization of the educational needs of struggling families realistic

index december 2018 december s drop in regional reports correctly signaled significant slowing in ism s manufacturing index slowing growth is evident through most of the report but is centered unfortunately in new orders with factory data to grow scarce given the closure of the commerce department and bureau of economic analysis the ism will gain further in importance and today s results are clearly negative and point to marked year end slowdown for what nevertheless was a leading sector of the 2018 economy and ism manufacturing index decreased sharply to 54 1 in december the ism manufacturing index indicated expansion in december this was well below expectations of 58 0 and suggests manufacturing expanded at a slower pace in december than in november and but based on these surveys and the district federal reserve surveys one would expect the fed s industrial production index growth rate to be lower than last month overall surveys do not have a high correlation to the movement of industrial production manufacturing since the great recession both surveys trended lower this month and were in agreement with the regional federal reserve surveys and us factory gauge

for insured workers remains unchanged at a very low 1 2 percent and offers a reminder that demand for labor remains very strong two states had to be estimated in the week including california for a

some believe the bond market is right to anticipate a much more sluggish us economy arguing that after delivering four interest rate increases in 2018 the federal reserve may now be finished for them the more pressing question is whether the us yield curve inverts a historically reliable indicator of a recession that occurs when short term bond yields rise above those for longer dated bonds we do not actually expect the curve to invert in 2019 not least because the fed is itself likely to regard a flatter curve as a warning sign analysts at credit suisse note the meeting of fed policymakers in late january will be a key early date in the calendar how will european markets cope with the end of qe while the us treasury market will do much to set the direction for other sovereign bonds the outlook for european government debt will also be shaped by the european central bank s decision to end the multitrillion euro bond buying programme that it began in 2015 advertisement as the ecb s purchases helped depress yields the absence of such a large buyer should logically exert some upward pressure but some are sceptical that yields for some eurozone countries will climb significantly for a start the ecb will continue to reinvest the proceeds of maturing debt that it already owns meaning its portfolio will remain at about the current 2 6trn 4 3trn level the largely balanced fiscal position in some core eurozone countries notably germany offers another potential countervailing force to the ecb s absence as there will be a limited new supply of debt for investors to digest overall the reinvestment programme will remain supportive for european bond yields because the scarcity issue is not going to disappear soon for core bonds said michael grady head of investment strategy at aviva investors for european fixed income investors much will depend on the performance of the eurozone economy which disappointed last year after a surprisingly upbeat 2017 should global trade tensions a messy brexit or a deterioration in relations between italy s populist government and brussels scupper economists expectations for a rebound then catalysts for a move higher in german yields becomes even harder to find however a sluggish eurozone economy could yet feed into a potentially different dynamic for countries such as italy which has substantial amounts of fresh debt to sell after being at loggerheads with brussels for much of last year over its spending plans bond investors could also be challenged by may s european parliament elections in which voters have thrown their support behind parties pushing expansionary fiscal policies centrist politicians are still struggling to head off populist parties said karen ward at jpmorgan asset management advertisement will there be a last hurrah for us stocks the last year for us stocks was bookended by a melt up and a near meltdown as 2019 starts a key question for investors is whether us stocks have already seen their peak for this economic cycle even if the answer is yes it begs the question of whether the market will still see a bounce in the first quarter that will be painful for fund managers to miss equity strategists at barclays say they see two scenarios their base case is a last hurrah followed by an eventual sell off as recession hits after two years but there is an alternative scenario where equities have already peaked and will continue drifting down as they have done historically a year before recession starts the macro risks are multiple and well known the fed stalls the economy by raising rates too high beijing and washington s temporary trade truce unravels or cooler growth outside the us saps corporate profits david donabedian chief investment officer at cibc private wealth management said these will prove relevant if they affect what really matters corporate earnings growth wall street analysts expect profits for s p 500 companies to grow 8 3 per cent in 2019 as measured by earnings per share down from an expected 20 5 per cent in 2018 according to factset advertisement and for analysts at jpmorgan for example that order of profit growth will help send the s p 500 up 15 per cent in 2019 as fears of a buckling us economy prove overblown a similar debate is animating the corporate bond market where investors in both us investment grade and high yield bonds nursed losses in 2018 some fund managers already see opportunities it s a substantial increase in yields said ed perks chief investment officer for multi asset solutions at franklin templeton if you subscribe to the idea that the backdrop remains conducive for corporate fundamentals it s pretty attractive will china s renminbi extend its slide the performance of the chinese renminbi remains a wild card for global investors those who believe the official gdp figures are overstating the strength of the economy believe beijing will in the end let the renminbi fall further in 2019 raymond ma a fund manager at fidelity international said that possibility would also keep the chinese stock market the worst performing major stock market in 2018 on edge whether beijing and washington can reach an agreement that holds on trade will also be central to the renminbi s fate it is worth noting that while the broad consensus among foreign exchange strategists is that the dollar will falter in 2019

gold looking back looking ahead 2019 â how low can gold price go each year we are treated to calls for gold s next big move we heard it last year and the year before too and the year before that it may not be a broken record but it is the same song predictions for gold s price are more than guesses but they might as well be just guesses that s unfortunate because no small amount of time is spent trying to analyze gold and it is time wasted the analysis is faulty not only is it faulty it is sometimes overly complex the complexity exacerbates the problem how do you analyze something that cannot be analyzed this type of investment assets that will never produce anything requires an expanding pool of buyers who in turn are enticed because they believe the buying pool will expand still further owners are not inspired by what the asset itself can produce it will remain lifeless forever but rather by the belief that others will desire it more avidly in the future warren buffett feb2012 buffet is both right and wrong he is wrong in characterizing gold as an investment but then of course so is nearly everybody else gold is not an investment but he is right that it will never produce anything and that it will remain lifeless forever the claim that owners are inspired by the belief that others will desire it more avidly in the future is more telling it points up the critical flaw in nearly all analysis about gold even those who recognize gold s role as money miss the boat on this one no matter how much others desire it more avidly in the future gold s value will not increase the value of gold is stable and unchanging gold is not subject to traditional laws of supply and demand its value is in its use as money as money it is the measure of value which has been used historically to price other goods and services analysts and investors who expect to profit from large increases in the price of gold do not understand this if they did they would temper their expectations a higher gold price is a reflection of a weakening u s dollar it does not mean that gold is more valuable that is because as the dollar continues to weaken over time it requires more and more dollars to pay for goods and services for owners of gold the higher price compensates for the higher cost of living but what if gold prices were to decline what could bring that about and how low could gold go there is only one reason for declines in the price of gold and it is the exact opposite of the only reason that gold prices go up declines in the price of gold are a reflection of increasing strength in the u s dollar in other words the price of gold reflects inversely the strength or weakness of the u s dollar some people assume that somewhat higher gold prices over the past several weeks are at least partially attributable to money fleeing stocks and moving into gold it is possible that some investors may have acquired gold with proceeds from the sale of stocks but there is no correlation between lower stock prices and higher gold prices see gold vs stocks ratios do not imply correlation some think that a weakening economy will somehow translate to higher gold prices it won t and regardless of the direction of interest rates there is no impact on the price of gold trade tariffs no world war iii no it is all about the u s dollar fear of a credit implosion is another reason that some expect higher prices for gold wrong again a credit collapse would wipe out trillions of dollars of worthless debt and clip asset prices of stocks bonds real estate commodities and gold by anywhere from fifty to ninety percent there would be less dollars available for use to have and to hold and with which to purchase the goods and services that we need and want but the remaining dollars would be more valuable they will purchase more than they would before the collapse however there will be less of them to go around do you think the dollar is about to tank fine then move your dollars into gold but don t expect to get rich the worse it gets for the dollar the more you will need gold just to survive on the other hand if you think the u s dollar will remain relatively stable or even increase in value as a result of deflation then don t expect higher prices for gold so if the dollar were to increase in value significantly just how low might the price of gold go gold prices 100 year historical chart as you can see in the chart above there is a long term forty eight year uptrend in gold s price dating back to december 1970 when gold was priced at 36 00 per ounce if gold s price were to decline back to that uptrend line within the next couple of years then the price range indicated is roughly between 850 1000 00 per ounce that may sound distressing to some but it could be a lot worse the chart below is the same one hundred year history on an inflation adjusted basis the possible downside target changes to somewhere between 550 600 00 per ounce how low can gold go a lot lower than most want to admit under reasonably normal conditions maybe 850 00 900 00 per ounce 850 00 was the january 1980 high point there is the possibility that it could go lower or it might find a floor at 1000 00 per ounce there are several scenarios but there is only one thing you need to focus on the u s dollar if the dollar heads lower and accelerates its long term decline then the price of gold will reflect that by moving higher if on the other hand the dollar continues to stabilize and strengthen then gold s price will reflect that by moving lower my best guess for 2019 stronger dollar lower gold prices also see gold and the need to explain price action kelsey williams is the author of two books inflation what it is what it isn t and who s responsible for it and all hail the fed by

the central theme in the investment outlooks for 2019 by goldman sachs bank of america merrill lynch morgan stanley and citigroup is for a recovery in emerging market assets particularly equities jp morgan chase however was the only one of the five investment banks surveyed by business day nigeria s largest english language newspaper to adopt a cautious stance as it cast a worrying look on the impact of a stronger dollar in the early part of the year and volatile oil prices while global growth accelerated 2018 was harsh to emerging market assets including nigerian equities although the naira was relatively unscathed compared to other currencies nigerian equities lost 18 percent as foreign capital fled emerging markets on the back of rising interest rates in the united states and slower global growth the new year however holds better prospects for emerging markets as asset prices and market expectations have adjusted significantly lower versus a year ago offering a better deal and creating the potential for positive surprises goldman sachs valuations look more attractive after a challenging year for assets and we believe 2019 offers some important advantages relative to 2018 the asset management unit of goldman sachs said in an outlook report we remain pro risk heading into 2019 until we see clearer signs of a deterioration in fundamentals goldman has a preference for equities especially in emerging markets where the period of growth moderation is likely behind us the us based bank however emphasizes dynamism and selectivity in investing goldman also sees potential return particularly in emerging market currencies based on estimates of fair value em currencies appear undervalued by 12 and 23 percent when aggregated using the msci em and gbi indexes respectively the magnitude of this undervaluation is similar to what we observed in early 2016 and in the early 2000s both periods were followed by good returns for em currencies em equities are trading at an attractive 25 percent discount to dm equities while offering potentially higher expected earnings growth the goldman team said the bearish run is over for emerging markets according to james lord an investment strategist at morgan stanley who says he sees brighter days ahead where total fixed income returns should be comparable with 2017 it has been hard slog for em investors in 2018 but we believe that markets have turned a corner and a better year waits ahead lord said according to lord and his team weaker growth outlook in the us should help to rebalance capital flows back into em that in recent quarters have left seeking the higher returns provided by usd assets the expected rebalancing in global growth and capital flow dynamics comes at a time when valuations in em are cheap we turn bullish on em local markets and raise em credit to neutral from bearish our us economists expect the first quarter of 2019 to be the high point which suggests that the biggest risk to our bullish local markets view is in 1q lord added on appetite for sovereign credit lord said credit selection is important in sub saharan africa as a lot of the cheapness is on back of rising concerns about debt sustainability citigroup like the others citigroup expects the sharp emerging market equity underperformance in 2018 to reverse at least partially in 2019 underpinning our view is the likelihood of on going asian growth accompanied by contained inflation moderating us growth limiting the extent of us rate rises and dollar strength and significant easing in china helping to offset most of the drag from trade tensions said david bailin the chief investment officer at the american investment bank also strongly bearish investor positioning particularly in china is likely to reverse as investors diversify away from the us market against this backdrop we believe the markets and sectors that sold off most heavily in 2018 but which still have solid growth prospects are likely to outperform bailin added bank of america merrill lynch bofa merrill lynch global research forecasts modest gains in equities and credit a weaker dollar widening credit spreads and a flattening to inverted yield curve signaling a tighter squeeze on liquidity that calls for higher levels of volatility this comes against a backdrop of slowing but still healthy economic growth mild inflation except in the u s where inflationary pressures are building and a notable slowing in global eps growth from the torrid pace of 2017 and 2018 jp morgan chase jp morgan was probably the most conservative of the five banks in its outlook expectations of further dollar strength early in the year will likely restrain em assets according to david kelly managing director and chief global strategist at jp morgan however kelly admits that as chinese data stabilizes the fed pauses and the dollar s climb reverses later in the year em assets may finally have some room to take off he however warns that as global liquidity continues to be drained next year not all em planes will fly at the same altitude investors are likely to continue being very selective focusing on countries where economic growth differentials are widening versus developed markets fiscal policy remains responsible and external vulnerabilities are kept in check kelly said moving into 2019 kelly thinks bond yields may rise relative to stock dividend yields and earnings growth should slow given that rising interest rates historically drag on equity performance in conclusion jp morgan fingered good quality fixed income exposure and dimming down credit risk in 2019 the bank will maintain equity exposure but also urges investors to stay diversified in anticipation of elevated volatility
amlo s policy proposals are not so much radical or innovative as retro steeped in nationalist symbolism his economic plans in particular echo the country s leftist leaders of the 1970s whose profligate spending contributed to the 1982 debt crisis specifically he has suggested considerable public reinvestment in mexico s corrupt unwieldy energy giant pemex implicated in the region wide odebrecht scandal a revival of the agricultural sector which was in steep decline even before the market reforms and increased public spending after decades of financing development via oil revenues and foreign loans such increased spending cannot now occur sustainably without tax reform something amlo so far has resisted few members of the recent pink tide of leftist leaders in latin america have attempted to tackle the pervasive issue of tax reform preferring to gamble on the short termism of commodity booms the reasons for this impasse are various in many countries millions work in the untaxed informal economy the middle class resents paying taxes to governments they correctly perceive as corrupt and rapacious tax evasion among the rich is rampant but failing to broaden the tax base has also had consequences even moderate governments in brazil and argentina have driven their countries into minor crises through reckless spending in recent years ultimately wiping out the economic gains for the poor upon which they had defended their records and opening the door for dangerous right wing populists like brazil s jair bolsonaro in these and other respects amlo more closely resembles the ambiguous latin american leftists of yesteryear than bernie sanders or british labour party leader jeremy corbyn to whom his supporters often compare him and the latter with whom he has a personal friendship in addition to a certain realism regarding public finances sanders and corbyn recognize the fundamental role of the rule of law in their countries understand the importance of checks and balances and are more than willing to expel corrupt figures from their own ranks conversely amlo has dismissed growing demands for an independent attorney general and anti corruption prosecutor stating openly that the president alone should dictate who among the corrupt falls and flourishes he has twice in 2006 and 2012 claimed fraud upon losing an election without sufficient evidence he has dubbed journalistic critics members of the prensa fifí or fancy press a troubling stance in a country where journalists are murdered with impunity already boasting majorities in both houses of mexico s congress he has repeatedly touted the possibility of dismantling some of the country s few genuinely independent institutions such as the national electoral institute the national transparency institute and the national human rights commission all of which have been important if flawed building blocks in mexico s transition to democracy

the turkish lira last week ended one of the most turbulent weeks in its history settling uneasily at six to the dollar turkey s borrowing spree and president recep tayyip erdoğan s insistence on low interest rates hastened the lira s fall but more trouble could be around the corner as a spat rumbles on between erdoğan and his equally capricious american counterpart donald trump such are the trade political and person to person contacts between turkey central asia and the caucasus that many fear the rot could spread trading trouble turkey s trade with kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan has been growing steadily despite some hiccups caused by the creation of external tariff barriers under the moscow led eurasian economic union ankara s business ties with tajikistan which does not share a turkic language like the other central asian states have steadily grown as well but it is uzbekistan that has offered the most promise as a result of the gradual opening up effected by president shavkat mirziyoyev who has worked hard to mend strained ties with turkey as part of his global charm offensive the textile industry is seen as one of the strongest potential areas for growth in turkish central asian trade and it is a useful bellwether for understanding what impact the currency crisis will leave when last september uzbekistan caved after many years of resistance and allowed its domestic currency the som to float freely the devaluation suddenly offered the prospect of significantly cheaper uzbek cotton for turkish buyers but the lira s sustained fall means that while one lira bought 2 300 uzbek som in september 2017 compared to 1 200 som in august of that same year the lira has now fallen back to 1 300 neighboring kyrgyzstan has put up a reasonably strong defense of its currency which is also affecting the textile sector small scale clothes making studios are a precious and rare job generator the kyrgyz som has so far maintained its position which means that turkish goods in particular clothing have become cheaper for kyrgyz people aziz soltobayev chief executive of kyrgyzstan s leading e commerce platform svetofor info told eurasianet but this will have the opposite effect for kyrgyzstan s light industry cheaper imported clothing from turkey could significantly reduce the competitiveness of kyrgyz textiles in the local market caucasus concerns elsewhere the lira s fall is already pushing down the georgian lari and the azeri manat georgia based investment bank galt taggart lowered its forecast for the georgian lari in light of turkey s turbulence although it is also insisted contagion should be contained given georgia s reliance on imports for secondary goods the lira s weakening will have some benefits at the same time any upside will be mitigated by the fact that turkish firms are among the largest foreign investors in georgia azerbaijani economist gubad ibadoglu told eurasianet that the lira s depreciation would not only impact the competitiveness of azerbaijan s non oil sectors but would also hit the all important socar state oil and gas company according to ibadoglu socar s investments in turkey have totaled 19 billion but as they are denominated in lira they are set to depreciate in line with the lira against the dollar and baku s sovereign wealth fund the state oil fund of the republic of azerbaijan or sofaz has around 0 9 percent of its holdings in turkish government bonds which have fallen precipitously this year azerbaijan has more exposure to the turkish banking sector than other caucasian and central asian states the lira crisis is likely to have a particularly strong impact on turkey s banks given their propensity for taking loans in dollars and euros the turkish subsidiary of azerbaijan s pasha bank long tied to azerbaijan s ruling aliyev family issued 25 million in new bonds just this june remittance reliance one country in a rather unique position is turkmenistan as the sole remaining eurasian state that refuses to lift its dollar peg the official 3 51 turkmen manat to the dollar rate is far below black market price for the currency and further maintaining the peg will all but eradicate any regional competitiveness turkmenistan may be particularly affected however by the lira s weakness given there is every reason to believe turkey has become a reliable source of remittances reliable figures are all but impossible to come by but as turkmenistan s economy tanks turkey serves as a natural destination for laborers and small time shuttle traders the erosion of the lira s value will cause the value of remittances to fall drastically so long as ashgabat refuses to budge on its own currency the negative effect on remittances is being felt in other places too studies of migration patterns have documented how turkey is a particularly tempting destination for azerbaijanis turkey s role in georgia s remittances flow has been growing sizably in recent years as well uzbekistan tajikistan kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan are likely to be less impacted comparatively speaking although the lack of hard data makes this difficult to assess armenian anxieties armenia is the most insulated from trade and remittance impacts related to the lira s fall the lack of formal relations between ankara and yerevan have long hindered cross border investment less than 0 1 percent of remittances come from turkey armenia is not wholly insulated from the lira s woes however with the ever worsening fall out in relations between turkey and the united states there are some who believe ankara could make a turn to russia turkey s refusal to countenance u s calls for a reconsideration of plans to purchase russia s s 400 missile system have recently led to questions about whether turkey could leave nato altogether these are all troubling developments for yerevan which implicitly relies for its security guarantees on russia through its collective security treaty organization obligations the story of the lira is as much about politics as economics the situation with the lira in turkey cannot be viewed in isolation from the political context in the country region and world as a whole almaty based economist denis krivosheyev told eurasianet investors are withdrawing money from the country believing not without reason that a dictatorship is coming in which a free market is impossible as to whether it would lead to a wholesale geopolitical shift for eurasia krivosheyev said erdoğan s threats to create a united front against the dollar should not be taken seriously to believe russia will join turkey in this matter is ill advised after all krivosheyev continued the elites keep their money in dollars as always

canadians are finally getting a taste of what a world with rising interest rates will look like and one thing is painfully clear we re not ready for what happens next tighter mortgage rules combined with rising interest rates means it s getting harder for people to obtain the large mortgages necessary to get into the market photo illustration by ed freeman getty images kirk marsh first noticed the mood start to turn in vancouver s housing market a year ago as a real estate investor who buys homes and condos then fixes them up for resale marsh has an excellent vantage point on the market since giving up his old job in tech three years ago to flip real estate sitting at a desk was killing me he says marsh has bought and sold six detached homes and condominiums across the b c lower mainland it s not like tv shows where you see them making 100 000 or more each time it s just not like that he says but he s done well always able to find buyers and come out ahead or that s how it used to be today everything has stalled he says while visiting open houses over the past year looking for his next flip marsh watched the frothing crowds and bidding wars steadily dwindle away there s just nobody showing up at the open houses now he says especially downtown usually you d see a group of very aggressive people coming out but he s also keenly aware of the slowdown because he s trying to unload a renovated two bedroom condo in new westminster just east of vancouver the unit with an asking price of 569 000 had been sitting on the market for two months as of mid december with almost no interest marsh is torn when it comes to the health of the market on one hand the strong local job market and inflow of new residents to the region lead him to believe the fundamentals remain strong for vancouver real estate but he also knows that ottawa s tighter mortgage rules combined with relentlessly rising interest rates means it s getting harder for people to obtain the large mortgages necessary to get into the market i don t know where the buyers are going to come from he admits and that worries me he s far from alone the willingness of consumers to borrow and spend on houses cars furniture restaurants you name it has been canada s primary economic engine for more than a decade after canada emerged from the great recession relatively unscathed we were the envy of the world thank households for that when turmoil and uncertainty held back business investment and crushed exports canada s economy continued to grow while unemployment fell thank households for that too it was plain to see what fuelled this consumption cheap debt interest rates spent most of the past two decades going down and were at or near four alarm emergency lows since the great recession canadians took their cue and gorged on debt we now owe 2 16 trillion in mortgage credit card and other consumer debt an 80 per cent jump from 2008 and an amount that now exceeds the value of the entire canadian economy even americans didn t go that overboard during their housing bubble now rates are rising and many heavily indebted households are feeling crunched in 2018 the bank of canada increased its benchmark rate three times to 1 75 per cent another two or three hikes are expected in 2019 for the first time in a quarter century households are having to renew their mortgages at rates that are higher than when they first signed at the same time the federal government has steadily tightened mortgage standards federally regulated lenders must put potential borrowers through stress tests whether they re applying for an insured or uninsured mortgage to determine their ability to repay the new mortgage rules have reduced the amount canadians can afford to borrow by around 20 per cent sending home sales tumbling across much of the country it s a one two punch that has shaken the foundations of the housing market put an immediate dent in consumer spending and left economists and market observers wondering how deep the hit to the economy will be maybe it s just a moment and the market will rebound again like it has in the past but maybe this is finally the perfect storm says steve saretsky a vancouver real estate agent i think we re seeing the catalyst for a correction that everyone s been talking about for 10 years when the governor of the bank of canada stood to deliver a speech in edmonton about his latest rate hike the reception was frosty while the goal of the hike was to cool an overheated economy oil prices were sliding and households were already struggling to absorb a series of earlier increases the governor stood firm it is not the bank s job to be popular while the current governor stephen poloz may share that conviction the governor who delivered that speech was gerald bouey the year was 1981 and in the span of just seven weeks bouey had cranked up rates seven times his latest hike put the bank rate at a stunning 18 75 per cent yet bouey wasn t done rates would climb to 21 per cent as the bank strained to tame runaway inflation that era looms large in the minds of older canadians but a whole generation has grown up and entered the workforce and the house hunting race never knowing a time when rates were above five per cent the fact is that rates don t have to rise to anywhere close to double digit levels to create havoc with household finances because households now carry so much more debt than they did then each quarter when statscan releases its closely watched household debt data the most talked about metric is always the debt to income ﬁgure a measure of the amount of leverage the average canadian carries relative to their disposable income it steadily climbed in the post recession era to 169 per cent meaning households carried 1 69 in debt for each 1 of income surpassing the debt to income peak reached in the u s before that country s housing crash then in december came sobering news statscan acknowledged it had overestimated the available income canadians had with which to pay their debts in one fell swoop the debt to income ratio jumped to 173 8 per cent and that s just the national average a recent report by canada mortgage and housing corp cmhc revealed the debt to income ratio in toronto stands at 208 per cent and even higher in vancouver at 242 per cent burdened with such massive debt loads each incremental hike carries a heavier punch and because rates are rising from such a low base the impact of each hike on consumers is amplified canada s interest rate might still seem low at 1 75 per cent but households are now paying nearly 15 per cent more in interest payments on mortgages and consumer debt than they were just a year ago according to statscan data that s the quickest pace that interest payments have grown since 2006 and it s nearly 10 times faster than the post recession average this is already translating into thousands of dollars in extra debt payments each year for households in toronto and vancouver the average monthly mortgage payment increased by 102 and 113 respectively from 2017 to 2018 according to cmhc data gathered from equifax the consumer debt rating agency now consider those households that also have auto loans credit card debt and home equity lines of credit their monthly debt obligations defined as the minimum payment needed to avoid becoming delinquent climbed by an average of 211 in toronto and 214 in vancouver on an annual basis that s an additional 2 500 going toward debt repayment a survey last fall by ipsos canada on behalf of insolvency trustee mnp found one in three canadians worry that rising rates could push them into bankruptcy yet so far delinquency rates in most parts of the country have remained near their all time lows that s because it can take several years for rising rates to be reflected in insolvency figures says scott terrio a consumer insolvency expert with hoyes michalos associates when the credit cycle starts to turn it s like turning the titanic he says maybe that s not the best analogy but maybe it is going from the heady days of people getting as much credit as they want to possible recession takes several years terrio has a front row seat to the process and says lenders are taking a tougher stance with borrowers than they were a few months ago he s started to see more clients come into the office who were rejected for consolidation loans by their banks even though they d been loyal customers for 30 years banks and other lenders are also going after customers more aggressively when they miss payments one of terrio s recent clients saw the payments on her line of credit climb by 200 a month it was enough to decimate her finances there s a whole echelon of the canadian middle class who have precarious incomes and live so close to the edge that 200 is a big deal he says there are a lot of homeowners in canada who are asset rich but cash poor after national house prices began to skyrocket in 2015 climbing 15 per cent annually and by as much as 30 to 40 per cent in some red hot markets regulators and governments scrambled to cool things down poloz tried to jawbone households into coming to their senses particularly those in toronto and vancouver in these two areas we see a rate of price increase that would be very difficult to match up with any definition of fundamentals that you could point to he warned in 2016 when people say well i need to buy a house because i m worried that prices are going to go up this much again next year and i ll be priced out of the market in our opinion the fundamentals do not justify that kind of extrapolation if frantic homebuyers even heard poloz over the din of bidding wars they didn t show it less easy to ignore were a series of government measures brought in across the country there were stricter capital requirements for mortgage lenders foreign buyer taxes in b c and ontario and the city of vancouver s vacant home tax while the cmhc increased mortgage insurance premiums the biggest change however are tougher mortgage stress tests introduced in 2016 and 2017 by the federal government and the office of the superintendent of financial institutions canada s banking regulator for both insured and uninsured mortgages now regardless of the size of the down payment borrowers must qualify at a higher rate than they ll actually pay on their mortgage in the case of uninsured mortgages that is either the rate offered by the bank plus two per cent or the five year benchmark rate published by the bank of canada whichever is higher the goal to head off a potential financial crisis by making sure households carrying huge debts can keep making their payments when rates rise whether it was the rule changes rising interest rates or the inevitable demise of unsustainable real estate mania or a combination of all three housing markets are cooling the pace with which canadians are taking out mortgages has slowed to its lowest level since 2001 meanwhile the canadian real estate association reported in december that national home sales are projected to post a double digit decline in 2018 falling to the lowest level in five years despite supportive population and job growth certain parts of the country are getting hit harder than others croft axsen a mortgage broker in calgary a city still grappling with the fallout of the oil crash doesn t hide his frustration with the way tighter lending rules meant to cool toronto and vancouver are affecting his city we have 100 people a month who we re telling we can t get them a mortgage even though at any time in the past 30 years we d have been able to he says axsen lists off recent examples of clients who left empty handed a retired couple who rent and have 350 000 in savings but failed to qualify or the self employed homebuilder who made payments on a 1 million mortgage for five years but now only qualifies for a mortgage of 300 000 is so self righteously pompous about tapping the brakes on vancouver and toronto yet other housing markets are now in recessions he says wherever homeowners are the new mortgage rules are likely to deliver an unpleasant surprise when it comes time for them to renew says ron butler a mortgage broker in toronto if a household keeps their mortgage with the original lender at renewal they won t be subject to a stress test on their finances that s not the case if they move their mortgage to another lender with a more favourable rate even if no additional money is being borrowed butler estimates about a fifth of households trying to renew would fail the stress test if they tried to move their mortgage these are typically younger households with very large mortgages and lower incomes he says feeling trapped more borrowers are staying put if you re one out of five people you re paying more because of the interest rate increases and you re paying even more because of these rules he says as more households fail to qualify for mortgages from traditional lenders some are turning to private lenders which is adding a new dimension of risk to canada s housing market a recent analysis by the bank of canada showed that the quality of new federally regulated mortgages has improved since the tighter lending rules were put in place in 2016 mortgages with a loan to income ratio of more than 450 per cent meaning mortgages that are four and a half times greater than annual income accounted for 21 per cent of all new mortgages that share has now fallen to 6 2 per cent the problem is that unregulated lenders have picked up the slack the bank s report found that roughly nine per cent of new mortgages in toronto are now being signed with private lenders meanwhile 20 per cent of refinancings in toronto in the second quarter were with private lenders a 67 per cent jump in just two years according to research by realosophy a toronto brokerage and teranet which operates ontario s land registration system similar data isn t available for other cities that s a huge red flag says john pasalis president of realosophy borrowers are going to these significantly more expensive lenders to take on more debt largely to finance consumption lifestyles they can t afford and investment properties private lenders are considered lenders of last resort because they re willing to take on riskier loans to homebuyers and homeowners who ve been rejected by the banks as such they also get away with charging far higher rates from seven to nine per cent for first mortgages and in the double digits for second mortgages private or shadow lenders also tend to go after delinquent borrowers more ruthlessly than the banks and if there s a slowdown pasalis says private lenders are likely to pull back there s nowhere for people to go after that he says if you can t refinance your house you have to sell these pressures will not only keep a lid on house prices in canada but are likely to start dragging the market back down to earth as rate hikes take their full effect and for an economy so dependent on household spending that s going to hurt we just went through a three year period up until the middle of 2017 when every year everybody s house was worth a lot more so they felt wealthier and they spent says butler now that s gone and that wealth effect is being sucked out of the canadian economy remember that additional 2 500 some households are now spending on debt payments each year there s another way to look at that as 2 500 they are not spending on other things many economists have been surprised by how quickly the impact from rate hikes has rippled through the economy in a recent report cibc economist royce mendes notes it historically takes six quarters for the full effect of a rate hike to show up in slower spending yet it hadn t been that long since poloz s first hike in july 2017 before the first pinch was felt the fact that the effects are showing up sooner this time around could simply be a sign that the storm will pass quicker mendes writes but more likely it s a reflection that models based on historical evidence will tend to underestimate the effects of rate hikes on the canadian household sector in its current indebted state in other words we re in uncharted territory consider for example the auto market canadians have always loved their cars and trucks and thanks to the availability of cheap loans with 84 month terms our tastes have grown more luxurious in the past few years elite brands like bmw mercedes and lexus currently account for about 12 per cent of all vehicle sales but dealerships are now seeing fewer customers walk through their doors the number of vehicles sold in canada outright shrank in october compared to the year before it marked the eighth straight month of declines the longest stretch of negative sales since the great recession mendes s report notes that other retail sectors are also being hit much earlier than expected stores selling home electronics appliances and building materials have all seen sales shrink in november lowe s said it is closing 31 underperforming stores in canada compared with 20 store closures across the entire u s the one area of the economy that continues to hold up strong in the face of rising rates has been jobs unemployment in canada sits at just 5 6 per cent the lowest level since statscan began tracking it on a monthly basis in 1976 but even that looks precarious given the slowdown in the housing market close to eight per cent of jobs in canada are in the construction sector in b c it s nearly one in 10 both are record highs dating back to the 1970s if the slowdown in the real estate sector continues and the cranes start disappearing from city skylines canada s job market could quickly start to look less rosy well before that happens we re likely to see the job market hit as households put their budgets on an extreme diet terrio says homeowners will go to extreme lengths to avoid missing mortgage payments in the past that meant borrowing more as that avenue closes many will have to dramatically cut costs a sudden pullback in consumer spending would lead to higher unemployment which in turn takes what might be a managed soft landing for the housing market and turns it into a deeper correction or crash will interest rates keep rising poloz warned canadians in october to get used to the idea of three per cent interest rates to get to that level the bank would have to raise rates five more times but poloz has also taken a more dovish stance of late getting there is a journey and we expect over time to get there he said in mid december but it can be interrupted or it could be sped up depending on how the economic data evolve for his part ben rabidoux an independent analyst with north cove advisors thinks the bank of canada has underestimated the hit to consumption and residential investment that s coming and for that reason the bank is likely to be more cautious in the year ahead than it was even just a few months ago those two things were nearly the entirety of canada s growth since the last recession he says the problem for the bank however is that if the u s federal reserve keeps raising rates as it did in december and canada doesn t follow suit the loonie could plunge you either decimate the currency or your rates rise in line with the u s he says that s the nightmare scenario for the bank of canada as for butler the mortgage broker he offers what he calls his mr t prediction for canada s mortgage market in 2019 echoing the mohawked actor playing clubber lang in rocky iii when asked his prediction about the upcoming fight he says pain i predict pain more about real estate

reading time 6 minutes part of a continuing series on how latin america can overcome a decade of slow economic growth six presidential elections one recession meager growth cheap oil all with higher interest rates in the u s and global trade tensions making investors skittish about emerging markets that s what to expect for latin america in the new year said mauro leos associate managing director at moody s investors service leos spoke to aq to offer his views on what will impact the region overall and in chile colombia argentina brazil mexico and peru specifically the conversation has been edited for clarity and length americas quarterly since late 2018 there have been talks of a downturn in the u s economy where markets plunged towards the end of the year looking at latin america what impact do you expect from external risks mauro leos we see 2019 as a transition year the relevance of the international context and particularly the u s economy will be more significant in 2020 even if there is agreement with china the most likely scenario is that trade tensions will continue trade tensions have an impact in terms of growth of course but what is more relevant is the financial market reaction to that investors funds and bondholders become more reluctant or less willing to lend to emerging economies and spreads are higher the question becomes to what extent countries and the region in general will be prepared to deal with a more complicated 2020 particularly in those cases where you have new governments aq what can we expect for regional credit ratings in 2019 leos we have stable credit prospects in 2019 you have countries making a comeback like chile with improved business sentiment and confidence and now high growth prospects you also have the case of colombia where the more market friendly candidate was elected although we have seen that president iván duque has had some problems pushing his economic tax program through congress argentina had a crisis but there was support from the imf that provided some stability and the question now is what lies ahead and last but not least brazil and mexico aq shall we look at the countries you mentioned you say chile is making a comeback what is the engine for that leos in chile we see a strong correlation between investor sentiment and actual investment and therefore economic growth we are seeing this across a broad spectrum of activities but particularly when it comes to increased domestic consumption energy has been an important segment when it comes to new investments and the fact that the new administration is trying to adopt more investor friendly regulations is one of the factors that will continue to lead to increased investment in this area energy is strategic for chile given their limitations in terms of energy independence and this is a way to address a strategic factor and at the same time promote growth by increasing investments aq oil exports play an important role in colombia where president iván duque meanwhile is facing a lot of political uncertainty does that put colombia s credit rating in jeopardy leos it is a complicated picture when it comes to general market sentiment duque s election was good news colombia is one of the few countries where we see an upward trend in economic growth even if it is relatively modest 1 5 percent in 2017 for 2018 we expect about 2 5 percent and project more than 3 percent for 2019 that is the good news on the other side you have all the problems that duque has had in his dealings with congress on his tax reform duque s reform was a bit different than usual tax plans because the intention was to lower corporate taxes and give a supply side push it seems that they underestimated the opposition that was going to happen against their proposal aq their own laws require them to reach a fiscal balance target leos we have said before that it was very difficult for us to see how any government would be able to deliver on the targets that are incorporated in the fiscal responsibility laws which contemplate declining deficit over the next few years when you do the numbers you have to come up with very optimistic projections for growth and for oil prices the question is where is the guidance for fiscal policy is going to come from if it is not the fiscal responsibility law then what is it going to be while revenues play an important role there is the spending side it is going to be quite complicated for colombia to be able to reduce its deficit just relying on higher revenues in spite of this going back to drivers of growth you have positive prospects when it comes to the toll roads project the same goes for oil and the fact that ecopetrol is in a better position financially than before infrastructure spending to some extent has a life of its own and the improved performance in the oil sector are factors that will support growth in the near term partly compensating for the bad news coming from the discussion between congress and the president aq in argentina this is a presidential election year while they are implementing austerity measures what will you be looking at leos there are two elements that you need for things to work in argentina the imf and macri the problem is the adjustment required will impose a severe cost in terms of economic activity they re facing restrictions not only on fiscal policy but on monetary policy as well so the question is how severe the recession will be our current estimates are not different from others a contraction of about 2 percent it is very difficult to adopt a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy in an election year their expectation or their hope is that the recession won t be more severe than expected and that by mid year there will be signs of improvement but they ll enter 2019 with a weak economy and continuous adjustment if they want to be less restrictive then they risk failing to deliver on their commitment to the imf on the other hand there is the risk of social and political implications compromising macri s ability for re election all we can say right now is that the first four to six months are going to be very rough for economic activity and the impact on employment and its political implications are significant in spite of the challenges our scenario is that macri will be able to survive politically and the imf agreement will remain in place aq what about the two newcomers the shift in direction for both mexico and brazil leos in brazil you have two underlying problems the first is a pretty depressed economy that after two consecutive years of recession contracting about 3 5 percent a year has been unable to report substantial growth the other is fiscal with large deficits and increasing debt ratios in this context enters president jair bolsonaro it is clear that investor sentiment has changed for the positive with his arrival but the question remains of what his administration is going to be like what is unique in brazil is the ultra liberal agenda economically some things may be adjusted in time but at least in the last 20 years we have never seen anything like this an extreme agenda in terms of market friendly policies this could mark a major departure from what we have seen in brazil before this is a new era for brazil the question really comes from how much the new administration will be able to deliver mexico is the complete opposite the economy is starting from a relatively stable position when it comes to growth and a strong position when it comes to fiscal health with declining deficits and debt ratios mexico also has a well established name in financial markets in terms of policy credibility president andrés manuel lópez obrador amlo represents a break with the past when it comes to almost anything but interestingly his message has been very clear that it is regime change with one exception fiscal responsibility the big question if he will remain fiscally responsible in light of all the things he said he wants to do and there s a certain skepticism from the markets and investors a lot has been said about the airport referendum the consultas but that it is a bit of a puzzle to me the only thing relevant is that the market has given a lot of weight to it but he is just doing what he said he was going to do strictly speaking there was no surprise but the reaction was very negative aq peru just had its own referendum but on anti corruption measures how much do you look at the governance issue and how much does that affect their credit rating leos corruption is negative any way you look at it we ve always pointed out that one of the limitations for peru s prospects had to do with weak institutions so this may be an indication that they are moving in the right direction but as you start to address corruption and define new rules there is a period of stand still all participants contractors financial institutions the regulators and local and regional governments are going to be learning the ropes if you go back to brazil and the beginning of lava jato this was one of the factors that contributed to the two year recession something that brazil hasn t yet been able to come out of but specifically in the case of peru there will be an improvement it s one of the countries we have seen steady growth throughout the years in spite of being exposed to shocks tornaghi is managing editor of aq

consumers would support an era of synchronized global growth the sharp slowdown in china and weakness elsewhere also threaten to leave u s consumers whose spending accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity and who so far have been eager to spend in an era of rising household incomes and wages as the chief bulwark against a broader world downturn there is an inconsistency between the u s acting as a locomotive for the world and the objective of the trump administration s policy to reduce the trade deficit that s another reason why it will be challenging for the u s consumer to act as world locomotive said catherine mann global chief economist at citi and the oecd s former chief economist we are looking at this balance between the strong domestic activity and the weaker external activity in the united states germany and elsewhere she said and also the effectiveness of chinese policy to turn the trajectory of the economy there other drivers of u s growth including government and business spending and net exports are all sagging or expected to do so in coming months the u s economy the world s biggest is expected to slow from a very robust 2018 but should remain strong until about mid 2020 when economists polled by reuters expect it to settle at 1 8 percent in october the international monetary fund cut its 2019 global growth forecast to 3 7 percent citing the trade war and in december citi trimmed its prediction to 3 1 percent what was hailed just a year ago as an era when the world s major economies would all grow together has evolved in a more volatile direction with the united states juiced along by tax cuts and government spending while the rest of the world sputters businesses amid uncertainty have held back on the sort of investment that could boost long term growth while governments globally struggle with a combination of high debt levels and mounting infrastructure needs market alarms the u s federal reserve s interest rate increases have caused investors to move in and out of various markets hitting some emerging markets hard it has also helped spark severe volatility in the u s stock market and a months long selloff that analysts said signaled worries over a pending recession apple inc shares tumbled 9 96 percent on thursday to their lowest level since mid 2017 after the company slashed its sales forecast apple s announcement triggered memories of a technology led market decline in 2000 that preceded a mild recession it s oh so reminiscent said david rosenberg an economist at gluskin sheff associates inc saying it was further evidence of a deteriorating outlook for chinese manufacturing that will weigh on the global economy on thursday one fed official said further planned rate hikes should be halted until that large assortment of global issues gets resolved i would be an advocate of taking no action in the first couple of quarters this year dallas fed president robert kaplan told bloomberg television in december fed policymakers forecast a median of two more hikes this year u s isolation while trump has put a march 1 deadline on striking a trade deal with beijing concerns extend beyond china to europe where a deal for britain s exit from the european union known as brexit has not been agreed with less than three months to go before the march 29 deadline but the impact of china is enormous chinese growth feeds into a variety of global prices such as oil metals and microchips driving investment and spending decisions worldwide evidence is piling up that tension between the world s two largest economies has dampened business confidence and depressed investment it could mark a turn from most of 2018 when many economists and officials said the trump administration s higher trade tariffs had yet to seriously hurt u s growth kevin hassett the white house economic adviser said on thursday the sharp drop in chinese economic growth will hit u s profits but sales for apple and other firms should rebound once a trade deal is struck the u s manufacturing sector has begun to slow and the institute of supply management s survey of corporate purchasing managers on monday showed the largest monthly decline since the depths of the recession in december 2008 a dallas fed quarterly survey of energy firms showed a marked slowdown at the end of 2018 the rest of the world is slowing especially europe and china but the u s has enough momentum said mohamed el erian the chief economic adviser of asset manager and insurer allianz the problem is policymakers are not sensitive

amlo s policy proposals are not so much radical or innovative as retro steeped in nationalist symbolism his economic plans in particular echo the country s leftist leaders of the 1970s whose profligate spending contributed to the 1982 debt crisis specifically he has suggested considerable public reinvestment in mexico s corrupt unwieldy energy giant pemex implicated in the region wide odebrecht scandal a revival of the agricultural sector which was in steep decline even before the market reforms and increased public spending after decades of financing development via oil revenues and foreign loans such increased spending cannot now occur sustainably without tax reform something amlo so far has resisted few members of the recent pink tide of leftist leaders in latin america have attempted to tackle the pervasive issue of tax reform preferring to gamble on the short termism of commodity booms the reasons for this impasse are various in many countries millions work in the untaxed informal economy the middle class resents paying taxes to governments they correctly perceive as corrupt and rapacious tax evasion among the rich is rampant but failing to broaden the tax base has also had consequences even moderate governments in brazil and argentina have driven their countries into minor crises through reckless spending in recent years ultimately wiping out the economic gains for the poor upon which they had defended their records and opening the door for dangerous right wing populists like brazil s jair bolsonaro in these and other respects amlo more closely resembles the ambiguous latin american leftists of yesteryear than bernie sanders or british labour party leader jeremy corbyn to whom his supporters often compare him and the latter with whom he has a personal friendship in addition to a certain realism regarding public finances sanders and corbyn recognize the fundamental role of the rule of law in their countries understand the importance of checks and balances and are more than willing to expel corrupt figures from their own ranks conversely amlo has dismissed growing demands for an independent attorney general and anti corruption prosecutor stating openly that the president alone should dictate who among the corrupt falls and flourishes he has twice in 2006 and 2012 claimed fraud upon losing an election without sufficient evidence he has dubbed journalistic critics members of the prensa fifí or fancy press a troubling stance in a country where journalists are murdered with impunity already boasting majorities in both houses of mexico s congress he has repeatedly touted the possibility of dismantling some of the country s few genuinely independent institutions such as the national electoral institute the national transparency institute and the national human rights commission all of which have been important if flawed building blocks in mexico s transition to democracy

2018 the fund was down approximately 17 8 while the s p 500 was down approximately 4 4 and the russell 2000 stocks were down approximately 11 0 since inception on june 1 2011 the fund is up approximately 64 1 net while the s p 500 is up approximately 118 6 and the russell 2000 stocks is up approximately 76 7 since inception the fund has compounded at approximately 6 8 net annually vs 10

fund s exact performance figures from its outside administrator within a week or two meanwhile for existing investors i continue to waive the annual management fee until the entire fund regains its high water mark get the full ray dalio series in pdf get the entire 10 part series on ray dalio in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q3 hedge fund letters conference scoops etc since 2017 when the fed began raising rates in earnest and both the fed and ecb announced timeframes to begin quantitative tightening i d been anticipating a bear market it seemed obvious to me and perhaps to you that this entire bull market was based on artificially low interest rates used to justify egregious earnings multiples on stocks and to create those earnings via cheap mortgages auto loans debt financed stock buybacks etc and that once rates began to normalize and excess liquidity was withdrawn stocks would sell off heavily i also believed wrongly that stocks would start discounting those higher rates and that liquidity withdrawal a while ago and the fund thus suffered through two years of awful performance however after lamenting for much of that time in this russell 2000 stocks space about being unable to find anything cheap enough to buy i m happy to report that thanks to q4 s broad market correction i was able to add multiple new deep value microcap long positions to our portfolio as to where the broad market goes from here i think the answer is probably lower as the economic slowdown is still in its early stages yet on a short term basis the market is very oversold and therefore a rally before new lows wouldn t surprise me thus in mid december a bit too early i closed out our iwm short position not wanting to give back the hard earned gains we had from it i did not however reduce our tesla short position and don t expect to until tsla zero but if i think stocks are eventually going lower why am i buying here three reasons the companies i bought in russell 2000 stocks were so cheap and so beaten down 40 to 50 off their 52 week highs and even further from their all time highs that i think they ve likely bottomed if i m wrong and they get cheaper absent fundamental change i ll buy more due to the federal government s massive deficit spending and a ratio of household debt to income that s at a 16 year low albeit at 100 not particularly low on an absolute basis i don t expect the looming recession to be particularly severe broadly speaking not just russell 2000 stocks but even larger caps are no longer that expensive with a trailing s p 500 gaap pe ratio in the 19s the oft quoted non gaap one is much lower which i expect to drop into the 18s once q4 2018 earnings are reported definitely not cheap but no longer in bubble territory we continue to own the powershares db agriculture etf ticker dba which i first bought late in 2017 because agricultural products were the most beaten down sector i could find the dbiq diversified agriculture index on which dba is based is at its lowest level since 2002 that wasn t a buggy whip something on the way to obsolescence or cyclical from a demand standpoint in november i added to the position anticipating a bounce following a favorable outcome from the trump xi jinping trade summit in early december but that bounce hasn t yet materialized because although china agreed to immediately resume some agricultural purchases the amount bought so far has been nowhere near enough to absorb the market s excess supply nevertheless i remain confident that a u s ag favorable deal will occur during the current 90 day negotiating period with china as trump is very conscious of the fact that farm states constitute a significant part of his political base and isn t shy about demonstrating that on twitter and this past weekend trump indicated that real progress was being made meanwhile ag prices are so beaten down that i don t think there s much downside from here however if no trade deal is made with china i ll likely reduce the position size elsewhere among our short positions we continue since late 2012 to hold a short position in the japanese yen via the proshares ultrashort yen etf ticker ycs as japan continues to print 6 of its monetary base per year after nearly quadrupling that base since early 2013 in fact of the world s three largest central banks the fed ecb and boj the boj is now the only one not on a path to tightening one result of this insane policy in 2018 the boj bought approximately 67 of jgb issuance and in 2019 anticipates buying 70 is there are days when no 10 year jgbs trade in the cash market the boj s balance sheet is now larger than the entire japanese economy it owns approximately 44 of all government debt and over 75 of the country s etfs by market value just the interest on japan s debt consumes 9 2 of its 2018 budget despite the fact that it pays a blended rate of less than 1 what happens when japan gets the 2 inflation it s looking for and those rates average say 3 interest on the debt alone would consume over 27 of the budget and japan would have to default but on the way to that 3 rate the boj will try to cap those rates by printing increasingly larger amounts of money to buy more of that debt thereby sending the yen into its death spiral when we first entered this position usd jpy was around 79 it s currently in the 109s and long term i think it s headed a lot higher ultimately back to the 250s of the 1980s or perhaps even the 300s of the 70s before a default and reset occur we continue to hold a short position in the vanguard total international bond etf ticker bndx comprised of dollar hedged non us investment grade debt over 80 government with a ridiculously low sec yield of 1 04 at an average effective maturity of 9 3 years as i ve written since putting on this position in july 2016 i believe this etf is a great way to short what may be the biggest asset bubble in history as with eurozone inflation now printing just under 2 annually these are long term bonds with significantly negative real yields in october the ecb reduced its bond buying program from 30 billion month to 15 billion and has now eliminated it completely thereby removing the biggest source of support for those bonds bubble prices currently the net borrow cost for bndx provides us with a positive rebate of approximately 1 5 a year more than covering the yield we pay out and as i see around 5 potential downside to this position vs our basis plus the cost of carry vs at least 20 unlevered upside i think it s a terrific place to sit and wait for the inevitable denouement happy new year and here s to a much better 2019 thanks and regards mark spiegel
reading time 6 minutes part of a continuing series on how latin america can overcome a decade of slow economic growth six presidential elections one recession meager growth cheap oil all with higher interest rates in the u s and global trade tensions making investors skittish about emerging markets that s what to expect for latin america in the new year said mauro leos associate managing director at moody s investors service leos spoke to aq to offer his views on what will impact the region overall and in chile colombia argentina brazil mexico and peru specifically the conversation has been edited for clarity and length americas quarterly since late 2018 there have been talks of a downturn in the u s economy where markets plunged towards the end of the year looking at latin america what impact do you expect from external risks mauro leos we see 2019 as a transition year the relevance of the international context and particularly the u s economy will be more significant in 2020 even if there is agreement with china the most likely scenario is that trade tensions will continue trade tensions have an impact in terms of growth of course but what is more relevant is the financial market reaction to that investors funds and bondholders become more reluctant or less willing to lend to emerging economies and spreads are higher the question becomes to what extent countries and the region in general will be prepared to deal with a more complicated 2020 particularly in those cases where you have new governments aq what can we expect for regional credit ratings in 2019 leos we have stable credit prospects in 2019 you have countries making a comeback like chile with improved business sentiment and confidence and now high growth prospects you also have the case of colombia where the more market friendly candidate was elected although we have seen that president iván duque has had some problems pushing his economic tax program through congress argentina had a crisis but there was support from the imf that provided some stability and the question now is what lies ahead and last but not least brazil and mexico aq shall we look at the countries you mentioned you say chile is making a comeback what is the engine for that leos in chile we see a strong correlation between investor sentiment and actual investment and therefore economic growth we are seeing this across a broad spectrum of activities but particularly when it comes to increased domestic consumption energy has been an important segment when it comes to new investments and the fact that the new administration is trying to adopt more investor friendly regulations is one of the factors that will continue to lead to increased investment in this area energy is strategic for chile given their limitations in terms of energy independence and this is a way to address a strategic factor and at the same time promote growth by increasing investments aq oil exports play an important role in colombia where president iván duque meanwhile is facing a lot of political uncertainty does that put colombia s credit rating in jeopardy leos it is a complicated picture when it comes to general market sentiment duque s election was good news colombia is one of the few countries where we see an upward trend in economic growth even if it is relatively modest 1 5 percent in 2017 for 2018 we expect about 2 5 percent and project more than 3 percent for 2019 that is the good news on the other side you have all the problems that duque has had in his dealings with congress on his tax reform duque s reform was a bit different than usual tax plans because the intention was to lower corporate taxes and give a supply side push it seems that they underestimated the opposition that was going to happen against their proposal aq their own laws require them to reach a fiscal balance target leos we have said before that it was very difficult for us to see how any government would be able to deliver on the targets that are incorporated in the fiscal responsibility laws which contemplate declining deficit over the next few years when you do the numbers you have to come up with very optimistic projections for growth and for oil prices the question is where is the guidance for fiscal policy is going to come from if it is not the fiscal responsibility law then what is it going to be while revenues play an important role there is the spending side it is going to be quite complicated for colombia to be able to reduce its deficit just relying on higher revenues in spite of this going back to drivers of growth you have positive prospects when it comes to the toll roads project the same goes for oil and the fact that ecopetrol is in a better position financially than before infrastructure spending to some extent has a life of its own and the improved performance in the oil sector are factors that will support growth in the near term partly compensating for the bad news coming from the discussion between congress and the president aq in argentina this is a presidential election year while they are implementing austerity measures what will you be looking at leos there are two elements that you need for things to work in argentina the imf and macri the problem is the adjustment required will impose a severe cost in terms of economic activity they re facing restrictions not only on fiscal policy but on monetary policy as well so the question is how severe the recession will be our current estimates are not different from others a contraction of about 2 percent it is very difficult to adopt a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy in an election year their expectation or their hope is that the recession won t be more severe than expected and that by mid year there will be signs of improvement but they ll enter 2019 with a weak economy and continuous adjustment if they want to be less restrictive then they risk failing to deliver on their commitment to the imf on the other hand there is the risk of social and political implications compromising macri s ability for re election all we can say right now is that the first four to six months are going to be very rough for economic activity and the impact on employment and its political implications are significant in spite of the challenges our scenario is that macri will be able to survive politically and the imf agreement will remain in place aq what about the two newcomers the shift in direction for both mexico and brazil leos in brazil you have two underlying problems the first is a pretty depressed economy that after two consecutive years of recession contracting about 3 5 percent a year has been unable to report substantial growth the other is fiscal with large deficits and increasing debt ratios in this context enters president jair bolsonaro it is clear that investor sentiment has changed for the positive with his arrival but the question remains of what his administration is going to be like what is unique in brazil is the ultra liberal agenda economically some things may be adjusted in time but at least in the last 20 years we have never seen anything like this an extreme agenda in terms of market friendly policies this could mark a major departure from what we have seen in brazil before this is a new era for brazil the question really comes from how much the new administration will be able to deliver mexico is the complete opposite the economy is starting from a relatively stable position when it comes to growth and a strong position when it comes to fiscal health with declining deficits and debt ratios mexico also has a well established name in financial markets in terms of policy credibility president andrés manuel lópez obrador amlo represents a break with the past when it comes to almost anything but interestingly his message has been very clear that it is regime change with one exception fiscal responsibility the big question if he will remain fiscally responsible in light of all the things he said he wants to do and there s a certain skepticism from the markets and investors a lot has been said about the airport referendum the consultas but that it is a bit of a puzzle to me the only thing relevant is that the market has given a lot of weight to it but he is just doing what he said he was going to do strictly speaking there was no surprise but the reaction was very negative aq peru just had its own referendum but on anti corruption measures how much do you look at the governance issue and how much does that affect their credit rating leos corruption is negative any way you look at it we ve always pointed out that one of the limitations for peru s prospects had to do with weak institutions so this may be an indication that they are moving in the right direction but as you start to address corruption and define new rules there is a period of stand still all participants contractors financial institutions the regulators and local and regional governments are going to be learning the ropes if you go back to brazil and the beginning of lava jato this was one of the factors that contributed to the two year recession something that brazil hasn t yet been able to come out of but specifically in the case of peru there will be an improvement it s one of the countries we have seen steady growth throughout the years in spite of being exposed to shocks tornaghi is managing editor of aq
