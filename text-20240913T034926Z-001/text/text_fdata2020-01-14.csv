argentina facing another debt crisis latin america january 14 2020 éric toussaint after four years of brutal neoliberal policies under mauricio macri as president argentina is again facing a major debt crisis let us remember that when macri started his mandate in december 2015 he accepted all the injunctions formulated by a new york magistrate who had ruled in the favor of vulture funds against argentina this has made it possible for those investment funds specializing in repurchasing sovereign securities at cut prices to garner 4 6 billion a 300 profit to compensate these vulture funds mauricio macri borrowed on the financial markets he claimed that everything would be fine since implementing neoliberal policies would make argentina more attractive to foreign investors and lenders international mainstream media supported him when invited to comment experts in economics presented macri s argentina as a success story issuing in 2017 bonds that would come to maturity one hundred years later 2117 was hailed as the ultimate proof of macri s pro market neoliberal success in fact the success of those bonds had a completely different explanation the interest rate every year for one hundred years is 7 25 with an actual return on the initial purchase price of 7 917 for the bonds were sold at a cut price to attract investors at the same time in early june 2017 bankers could borrow at 0 from the european central bank ecb the bank of japan and the swiss national bank at 0 25 from the bank of england and at 1 00 from the federal reserve in the us while investment funds had huge amounts of cash and return on public debt securities in the north was very low or even negative argentine bonds at 7 25 over one hundred years was a godsend their success was thus in no way evidence of the argentine economy s good health there is such a huge amount of capital intended for speculation and not for productive investment that any state that issues sovereign securities with a return that is higher than average is likely to find takers 100 year bonds at 7 25 here is an example of comments to be found in the press heralding the 100 year bonds argentina sold 2 75 billion of a hotly demanded 100 year bond in us dollars on monday just over a year after emerging from its latest default according to the government the south american country received 9 75 billion in orders for the bond as investors eyed a yield of 7 9 percent in an otherwise low yielding fixed income market where pension funds need to lock in long term returns this reuters report clearly celebrates the country s achievement one year earlier in april 2016 reuters reported marking a rare bright spot among gloomy emerging markets argentina sold 16 5 billion of sovereign debt on tuesday in its first international bond issue since its record 2002 default investors seemed convinced of strategy argentina received offers worth 68 6 billion from investors around the world anybody will understand from such hyperbolic comments that major capitalist corporations all over the world were on the lookout for opportunities to obtain high yield by purchasing high risk securities it does not tell anything about argentina s economic health potential lenders such as investment funds or major banks thought that argentine securities would be guaranteed by the state of argentina and that if necessary they could seek favorable adjudication in the jurisdiction of new york they were right since the loan agreements were made in accordance with the law of the state of new york anyway they were also convinced that in case of necessity the international monetary fund imf would bail out the government of argentina so that it may repay its debt to private funds as it had always done another argument was the following argentina s underground resources are significant and if hard pressed argentina could increase production in order to meet lenders expectations in short in 2016 2017 while argentina s real economy was collapsing the government managed to find lenders and its right wing government was praised in international media as well as by the imf and by other governments in the hold of big capital but the situation took a turn for the worse in 2018 as a consequence of several negative factors resulting from macri s policies such as a steep rise in the amount of interests to be paid which had to be financed by ever new loans massive flight of capital that was made possible by a most lax policy of complete freedom for capital to leave the country it showed that argentine capitalists had limited confidence in macri s future and preferred shopping elsewhere including buying argentine external debt securities in us dollars on wall street currency reserves sharply dropped production started to decline and argentina slipped into recession employment plummeted most people s purchasing power dropped as a consequence of the government s and bosses attacks as a result domestic consumption that accounted for 70 of argentina s gdp also dropped the argentine peso gradually sunk while 22 pesos bought one euro on 1st january 2018 32 pesos were needed on 16 june 2018 in this context in june 2018 macri called on the imf as foreign investors and argentine capitalists had anticipated the total credit promised by the imf rose to 57 billion with 44 1 billion actually paid up to now as a first step in june 2018 the amount of 50 billion had been announced and a few months later as the situation had not improved 7 billion more were added this is the highest ever loan granted by the imf the imf s loan to greece in 2010 was 30 billion as usual the imf demanded even stricter austerity policies that were even more unpopular than those already introduced by macri in october 2019 the argentine people turned away from macri and elected the peron political movement back into office after an intermission of four years alberto fernandez became president and cristina fernandez who was president from 2007 to 2015 vice president alberto and cristina are not related the cadtm s latin american and caribbean network cadtm ayna held its 8th annual assembly in preparation of alberto fernandez succeeding mauricio macri as president 10 december 2019 i participated in the meeting as well as in several talks and debates including one at the parliament of argentina i also gave four interviews fifteen minutes live on a popular private and anti macri tv channel a video for an information website canalabierto com ar connected with the main civil service trade union canal abierto one on the main website of the revolutionary left la izquierda diario the daily paper of the left which has an average of two million visits per month and one to the main center left newspaper pagina 12 the rate of poverty strongly increased over the four years of macri s mandate going from 27 to 40 of the population in the days before macri left the presidency to the two fernandezs debt repayment was the most debated issue on the other hand we should emphasize that social and political movements in argentina are massive and well organized trade unions are still powerful the feminist movement is still able to mobilize on a large scale the unemployed too are well organized the cooperative movement is strong the various neoliberal experiments that started with the dictatorship 1976 1983 and that had their latest attempt under macri have not been able to fracture the argentine society and contrary to what is the case in neighboring chile education is free including at university level as indeed is health care the questions most often raised in argentine media during the november december 2019 period while the previous government had suspended repayment of part of the internal debt will the new government repay the accumulated debt and implement policies that have been rejected by a majority of the people what should be done with the imf agreements since the imf is expected to pay argentina 11 to 13 billion must the new government demand those payments or withdraw from them shouldn t argentina suspend debt repayment for two years so as to make sure that economic activity resumes properly and make later debt repayment sustainable this is a suggestion by martin guzman an argentine economist who teaches in new york and works with joseph stiglitz nobel laureate for economy guzman has just been appointed minister for economy and finance in alberto fernandez new government a majority of the people clearly reject the imf whose deleterious impact on argentina is obvious to all and sundry it has to be remembered that after the second world war president juan domingo perón had turned down his country s adhesion to the imf an institution he exposed as an instrument of imperialism argentina only joined the imf in 1956 during the military dictatorship of general pedro eugenio aramburu silveti who overthrew the constitutional president juan domingo perón in 1955 twenty years later the imf actively supported the bloody dictatorship of general jorge rafael videla who was responsible for the assassination of over 30 000 left wing opponents in the 1990s the imf put argentina under pressure to turn it into one of the most active countries in terms of privatizations and structural adjustment this eventually resulted in the massive upheaval of december 2001 which led to the fall of president fernando de la rúa during the public lectures organized by attac cadtm in collaboration with some ten other associations in buenos aires from 27 to 29 november 2019 i had the opportunity as international spokesperson for the cadtm to put forward a number of proposals to face the argentine debt crisis those proposals are the result of wide ranging debates within the cadtm network this was also the case at a hearing held in the parliament of argentina on 27 november at the initiative of economist fernanda vallejos an mp in the new presidential majority see my contribution in spanish the following is a summary of my points and proposals there should be no hesitation in arguing the doctrine of odious debt because it is particularly applicable to the situation in which argentina finds itself according to this doctrine a debt is deemed odious and nullified if it fulfils two conditions it was taken on against the interests of the nation the people or the state the creditors are unable to prove that they were unaware that the debt was contrary to the interests of the nation it is to be pointed out that the nature of the political regime or the government is not taken into consideration in the doctrine the deciding factor is the use that is made of the debt if a democratically elected government puts its population into debt against their best interest this debt may be deemed odious it is erroneous to say that only debts taken on by dictatorial regimes may be deemed odious it is fundamental that argentina unilaterally takes sovereign measures to improve its debt situation five principal examples pass laws prohibiting vulture funds suspend debt repayments bond holders must be registered with the buenos aires authorities setting up a citizens debt audit repudiation of current agreements with the imf 1 pass laws prohibiting vulture funds as belgium showed in 2008 and again in 2015 it is possible to pass laws restricting vulture funds see renaud vivien analyse de la loi belge du 12 juillet 2015 contre les fonds vautours et de sa conformité au droit de l ue the act of law is quite simple an investment fund cannot reclaim sums superior to what it paid to acquire treasury bills in fact vulture funds purchase the sovereign debts of countries with repayment difficulties at junk prices and then apply legal pressure on the government concerned to pay in full and so make profits sometimes amounting to several hundred per cent of their initial layout if argentina passed a similar law it would have some protection against vulture funds if many countries did the same vulture funds would be neutralized the practice of designating foreign jurisdictions such as new york or london with laws that are favourable to creditors as competent in the case of sovereign debt litigations must end 2 suspend debt repayments suspending debt repayments is one of the possibilities that permit governments to deal with financial and or humanitarian crises the country may declare suspension unilaterally many have done so it was the case of argentina between 2001 and 2005 for a total of 80 billion and the benefits followed in a collective book published by oup in 2010 stiglitz claims that russia in 1998 and argentina in the 2000s are proof that a unilateral suspension of debt repayment can be beneficial for countries that make this decision both theory and evidence suggest that the threat of a cut off of credit has probably been exaggerated p 48 when a country succeeds in enforcing debt relief on its creditors and uses funds that were formerly meant for repayment in order to finance an expansionist tax policy this yields positive results under this scenario the number of the firms that are forced into bankruptcy is lowered both because of the lower interest rates and because of the improved overall economic performance of the economy that follows as the economy strengthens government tax revenues increase again improving the fiscal position of the government all this means that the government s fiscal position is stronger going forward making it more not less likely that creditors will be willing to again provide finance p 48 in an article published in journal of development economics under the title the elusive costs of sovereign defaults eduardo levy yeyati and ugo panizza two economists who worked for the inter american development bank set out the findings of their thorough inquiry into defaulting in some forty countries one of their main conclusions is that default episodes mark the beginning of the economic recovery it couldn t be better put as was already done in 2001 argentina should not hesitate to declare a new unlimited suspension of payments the recuperated amounts could be used to stimulate consumer spending and economic activities favouring the population two years would appear to be a minimum period to achieve lasting results with the possibility of prolonging the period it is recommended to suspend selectively small savers and shareholders as well as public pension schemes should be exempted from suspension on the domestic debt this means that they would continue to be paid it is quite right to make this discrimination in order to protect the weaker investors and public institutions it is the big private investors and the imf who are to be defaulted 3 bond holders must be registered with the buenos aires authorities argentine authorities should revive the practice of the first half of the 20th century that established lists of bond holders in the litigation between mexico and its creditors in the 1940s the creditors were obliged to make themselves known and have their certificates rubber stamped or be excluded from settlement this permitted the cancellation of 90 of the mexican debt registering bond holders makes it possible to sort big and small private and public bond holders in order to favour small and public holders 4 setting up a citizens debt audit to have a clear idea of the stakes and sums involved and a solid legal arsenal it is essential to conduct an audit of the debt under citizens control an audit would show how much of the debt possibly an overwhelming part may be deemed illegal or odious and could be the way forward toward debt repudiation and or a unilateral restructuring 5 repudiation of current agreements with the imf as has been shown by many observers and argentine jurists the agreements made with the imf by mauricio macri are contrary to the country s and the people s interests when the imf granted a loan of 57 billion to the macri government it transgressed its own rules that state that the imf can only grant loans if as a consequence the borrowing country s debt becomes sustainable which is not at all the case as evidenced less than a year later macri also transgressed the argentine constitution that requires that the signature of such an agreement that has the value of an international treaty must be debated in parliament and then be ratified by parliament the real reason the loan was granted was because the us president donald trump wanted to help macri remain in power in spite of the crisis and win the 2019 elections to implement policies that favoured the us in political military and economic terms as the argentine electors have disavowed macri s policies and macri had transgressed the argentine constitution the new government would have the right to refuse to validate the agreement this is a text book case of odious debt when a country sees regime change the new government is not held to respect the debts of its predecessors if they were taken on against the interest of the nation or the people and in the former regime s own advantage in this case to remain in power and it is clear that the imf directors were aware of the context it is important that argentina does not make the same errors of debt negotiation as in the 2002 2010 period see the analysis by maud bailly and eric toussaint the mixed fortunes of argentina s 2005 and 2010 debt restructuring the above measures should be part and parcel of a larger programme that would include capital controls socialization of the banking sector tax reforms measures against the extractivist exportation market model and ecological policies among others in conclusion a new situation will arise in argentina as from december 2019 a new government must face up to a serious debt crisis it is fundamental that a large popular social and political front be created in order by all necessary means to promote the solutions that will liberate the argentine people from the burden of illegitimate and odious debt this article first published on the committee for the abolition of illegitimate debt website

european shares are flat on monday after a mixed session in asia while lcg pricing points to a lower start on wall street indices us removes china currency manipulator status wall street has yet again reached new record highs in the lead up to the signing of the us china trade deal at the while house some of the meat of the deal is starting to emerge too the deal covers two of us president trump s biggest bones of contention with china currency manipulation and an unfair trade surplous the us will remove china s status as a currency manipulator as part of the deal the chinese yuan rallied to a 5 month high on the news in its latest currency report the us treasury noted the depreciation of usdcny from a high of 7 18 in september to 6 93 currently making the manipulator status no longer applicable the us treasury have basically put a line in the sand at 7 00 in usdcny should the us dollar continue to weaken against the yuan which we think it will that is an additional tailwind for us export growth to china for their part china has agreed to buy 80bn extra manufacturing goods and 50bn more energy supplies from the us over the next two years as part of the phase one deal services and agricultural goods will also get multi billion dollar boosts the purchases represent a direct increase in economic activity and a thawing of the us china tensions which it is hoped will open up international trade more generally equities tech rally banks kick off q4 us earnings big us tech companies have been leading the gains in the latest rally resuming their position as market leaders microsoft and apple both stand to benefit from the dollar falling in value against the yuan because it lessens the cost of their products in china which helps sales facebook is banned in china but its prospects of entering the market will be much improved with a phase one trade deal in place us banks citigroup jp morgan chase and wells fargo all report earnings today lending data out of the us suggest good times are afoot for the big banks the us central bank lowering interest rates last year helped demand for mortgages and confidence in the economy has seen consumers increase credit card spending the american public taking on more debt serviced by these big lenders should offset lower corporate borrowing businesses have been conservative on investment since the financial crisis choosing instead to re invest in their own shares etc the trade war has exacerbated the issue hampering the desire to make large transactions forex yuan 5 month high us cpi the decision to remove china as a currency manipulator as part of the phase one trade deal between the us and china has sent the chinese yuan to a fresh 5 month high the market is looking at the removal of the currency manipulator label as a sign that china will strengthen its currency in its peg against the us dollar one would imagine that after the signing of the deal the people s bank of china would look to gradually fix the yuan stronger in doing so the pboc should be on the same side as the market because the signing of the phase one deal does improve china s growth outlook typically meaning the currency would strengthen a bigger than expected rise in china s exports and imports in december have added to the yuan strength more broadly the us dollar is mixed as other major currencies diverge the japanese yen has been losing alongside its appeal as a haven while hopes for better growth in europe has helped the euro while the pound has been under pressure from talk of a uk rate cut us inflation data is the biggest macro release of the data us cpi for december is expected to show growth of 2 3 year on year up from 2 1 previously core prices that strip out energy are expected to rise 2 3 y y too unchanged from the previous reading inflation just above 2 probably doesn t meet the federal reserve s requirement for a material change but it moves us in that direction as usdjpy breaks

gold has come in for another wave of selling as investors dump havens in favour of risky assets the us conflict with iran never materialised and the imminent signing of the phase one trade deal has

in this series the telegraph examines the big topics keeping investors awake at night in 2020 here russell lynch looks at how mountainous debt threats from china to leveraged loans leave the world vulnerable to another financial crisis debt is the match that lights the fire of every crisis in the words of aaron ross sorkin chronicler in chief of the meltdown which nearly collapsed the world s financial system more than a decade ago whether the villains are bankers regulators politicians or credit ratings agencies the common ingredient is usually the same too much leverage many of us blanch at our credit card bills after the excesses of the festive season but the world s companies have been on the binge to end all binges for the best part of a decade encouraged by the ultra low central bank borrowing rates which remain the legacy of the crash experts say the biggest potential flashpoints are in the world s two largest economies in china the debt mountain of state backed companies has soared and defaults are on the rise in the us the stock of leveraged loans the high risk credit offered to debt laden companies which carries a higher chance of default has shot past the trillion dollar mark
it s been argued for a very long time that some knowledge of history is useful to the scientist the economist or the student of literature or philosophy on the grounds that no science or art is static this argument by strategic thinkers has its background on the premise that historical science begins with reaction to the imagined happenings of the past history however is the reconstruction of the past by and for those who are living of the life of those who are dead it is a tool of all discipline and the key to wisdom people who ignore the lessons of history wonder in dilemma the usefulness of the above words of wisdom played out on august 1995 during an address by harvard political professor samuel huntington at taipei he was asked of his impression about prime minister lee kuan yew s effort to develop singapore and he scantly summed it up this way the honesty and efficiency senior minister lee has brought to singapore are likely to follow him to his grave however like faith which is a belief in things not seen coupled with the fact that ordinary calculation can be upturned by extra ordinary personalities not only did lee s efficiency survive him but history has since assisted in providing answers to the correctness or otherwise of professor samuel huntington declaration accordingly its now on public domain that two years after the asymmetrical observation singapore a country with a gdp of 3billion in 1965 grew to 46billion in 1997 making it the 8th highest per capital gnp in the world according to the world bank ranking clearly a bracing account and unprecedented result what is however left for those who are living is to learn the lessons from such history and gain wisdom or ignore it and wonder in dilemma essentially the crux of this piece is to use singapore s experience under prime minister lee quen yew to analyze and understand the essential ingredients of foresight in leadership and draw a lesson on how leadership decision making process involves judgment about uncertain elements and differs from the pure mathematical probability process from accounts aside from the fact that the story of singapore s progress is a reflection of the advances of the industrial countries their inventions technology enterprise and drive a united and a determined group of leaders backed by practical and hard working people who trust them made it possible it is part of the story of a leader s search for new fields to increase the wealth and well being of his people the second and most profound lesson was lee s explanation that after grappling with the problems of unemployment in the country he came to the recognition that the only way to survive was to industrialize add just immediately he concentrated on getting factories started despite their small domestic market of 2 million he protected locally assembled cars refrigerator air conditioners radios television sets and tape recorder in the hope that they would later be partly manufactured locally there is certainly an ingrain lesson for the nation nigeria to draw from this second position considering the slow growing economy but scary unemployment levels in the country the current administration in my opinion will continue to find itself faced with difficulty accelerating the economic life cycle of the nation until they contemplate industrialization or productive collaboration with private organizations that has surplus capital to create employment another alternative recourse will probably be to move part of the job creation functions and infrastructural provision development to the state and local government authorities via restructuring structural interventions while the first option industrialization may offer considerable solution the second and third options restructuring productive collaboration with private organizations has more potential reward in political and socioeconomic terms as well as come with a reduced risk to achieve such feat power electricity and other infrastructure roads need to be addressed notably not doing any of this or continuing on the low growth of the economy will amplify the painful consequence of strategic mistakes made by previous administrations that failed to invest during the period of rapid economic growth in my views the nation has to do this because history teaches that democracy needs economic development literacy a growing middle class and political institution that support citizens with favourable economic environment to survive this leads to another set of sad narrative presently nigeria is a country that services its debt with 50 of its annual revenue we don t need to be economists to know that we have become a high risk borrower the country going by reports would be facing another round of fiscal headwinds this year with the mix of 83 billion debt rising recurrent expenditure increased cost of debt servicing sustained fall in revenue and about 22 billion debt plan waiting for legislative approval it may be worse if the anticipated shocks from the global economy like the brexit the united states china trade war and interest rate policy of the federal reserve bank go awry the nation s debt stock currently at 83billion comes with huge debt service provision in excess of n2 1 trillion in 2019 but set to rise in 2020 this challenge stems from the country s revenue crisis which has remained unabating in the last five years while the borrowings have persisted an indication that the economy has been primed for recurring tough outcomes the report concluded indeed the question may be asked why the country s revenue crisis remained unabated in the last five years within the context the answer lies in the fundamental recognition that here is a country reputed for crude oil dependence and laced with management system devoid of accountability transparency and accuracy and before a real solution can be proffered we need as a nation to find and understand the sources of the national problems without losing sight of the real and lasting meaning wrapped in the lesson as an illustration the nigeria extractive industries transparency initiative neiti few days ago told nigerians that the nation loses about 4 1 or n123billion annually due to poor crude oil production metering stating that unless government takes appropriate measures limitations in the metering of crude oil production will continue to pose serious threat to the nation s revenue target regrettably nigeria is the only oil producing country without adequate metering to ascertain the accurate quantity of crude oil produced at any given time the report concluded what the above tells us as a country is that there is more work to be done more reforms to be made that as a nation we are poor not because of our geographical location or due to absence of mineral natural resources but because our leaders fail to take decisions that engineer prosperity and we cannot solve our socio economic challenges with the same thinking we used when we created it and this piece may not unfold completely the answers to these challenges but there are a few sectors that a nation desirous of development can start from and the first that comes to mind is the urgent need for diversification of the nation s revenue sources revenue diversification from what developments experts are saying will provides options for the nation reduce financial risks and increase national economic stability as a decline in particular revenue source might be offset by increase in other revenue sources

san diego many top economists are coming around to the belief that it s acceptable even preferable for the united states government to spend more money even if it means increasing the nation s 23 trillion debt when thousands of economists gathered for the annual american economic association meeting this month there were overwhelming calls for more and wiser government spending leading economic thinkers laid out the case that the nation will almost certainly have to spend more during the next recession that major challenges such as climate change and inequality will probably require more money and that the united states is significantly underinvesting in infrastructure and education even under current conditions i think we can afford to increase federal spending or cut taxes to stimulate the economy if there s a downturn said janet l yellen the former federal reserve chief and the incoming president of the aea chronic low interest rates create additional fiscal space yellen is part of a growing chorus of prominent economists who are building the intellectual case for the united states to take on a bit more debt they are not saying that politicians have a blank check to spend more or that higher debt does not have any negative consequences the money still has to be paid back at some point with interest advertisement but the consensus view is shifting among economists from a belief that debt harms the economy to a belief that responsible borrowing is warranted yellen argued that the timing is right to make smart investments it s cheap to borrow with interest rates so low and unlikely rise much soon in a world of low real rates there s also a strong case for programs to invest in infrastructure education research and development climate change mitigation namely investments that would elevate potential growth yellen said her call for more spending noticeably contrasts with her 2017 testimony before congress that the long term budget outlook should keep people awake at night the academic conversation around spending more to strengthen the economy comes as the federal budget deficit topped 1 trillion in 2019 pumped up by the trump administration s tax cuts and increased spending it was the first time the deficit had broken the 1 trillion mark during a january to december period since 2012 when the economy was still recovering from the great recession the deficit continues to rise according to the latest treasury department report on government debt released monday some economists called for higher taxes especially on the rich to fund additional spending and many denounced president trump s tax cuts as wasteful spending that could have gone toward other initiatives including infrastructure but there was a lot less worry about the current debt level advertisement if you had been at the meetings seven years ago there would have been a lot of concern about entitlement spending there s very little of that now said lawrence h summers the treasury secretary under president bill clinton who helped craft the last balanced federal budget many pointed to japan where debt is about 250 percent the size of the economy as a good example of how debt can rise a lot without triggering a doomsday scenario economic textbooks teach that too much debt can bankrupt a country and trigger massive inflation which can cause a recession but after years of high debt in japan plenty of investors are still willing to lend the country money and japan s economy is sluggish but stable u s debt is currently about 80 percent of gross domestic product it is projected to grow to 95 percent of gdp by 2029 largely because of rising social security and medicare spending as baby boomers age but many argued it is unlikely u s bonds would lose their status as one of the safest assets in the world if debt grew somewhat more i would be very confident the united states would not go bankrupt summers said advertisement summers said he would support a prudent program of borrowing to finance reasonable prudent public investment in schools and renewable energy for example that sentiment was echoed by many we are in such bad shape on infrastructure said economist lisa lynch the provost of brandeis university we had such a missed opportunity as part of the response to the great recession to really have doubled down on making major investments in our infrastructure the economists who attend the aea meeting are largely academics several who spoke with the washington post estimated that 80 to 90 percent of the conference attendees are politically liberal which could explain the heightened calls for the government to do more but others say economists views are evolving on government spending because circumstances have changed lower interest rates make borrowing and investing more attractive and rapid technological advances make it more necessary for the united states to invest heavily to remain competitive advertisement the u s economy is growing at about 2 percent a modest pace compared with prior booms summers has dubbed this secular stagnation trump promised that his tax cuts and deregulation would lift growth which happened in 2018 but growth slowed to closer to 2 percent in 2019 economists say a big reason the economy rarely grows beyond 3 percent anymore is because of the aging population fewer workers and muted productivity growth janice eberly of northwestern university s kellogg school of management put up a slide showing that while the u s government spends more dollars today on the military and domestic programs than it did in the 1960s federal investment as a share of gdp is at an all time low which is probably hurting productivity and growth there is also the reality that if another recession hits the fed is unlikely to be able to do as much to rescue the economy the fed typically cut rates five percentage points during prior recessions the fed s benchmark rate is already just shy of 1 75 percent leaving little room to goose the economy much advertisement we don t have monetary policy it s very limited at the moment said kenneth rogoff a harvard university economics professor who foresaw much of the 2008 financial crisis with monetary policy hamstrung congress would probably need to spend more during the next recession to help revive the economy but economists such as rogoff acknowledge that they are not at all optimistic that can be done several economists including summers proposed automatic stabilizers for the economy measures such as payroll tax cuts or extra food stamps that would take effect once the unemployment rate climbs to a high rate but it would take an act of congress to set up the automatic stabilizers which seems unlikely in the current political environment other economists called for even bolder moves for the government to spend more on addressing climate change by funding more research on green technologies there were also calls for the government to better address inequalities such as giving children from low and moderate income families baby bonds that could help pay for college and other springboards to a better life advertisement everybody now assumes that social programs and social safety nets require more resources said dani rodrik a harvard economics professor nobody stood up and said all of this inequality is because the government is doing too much
this article is more than 4 years old oman has faced two great challenges in recent years only one of which has been within its control the first was organizing a smooth succession from sultan qaboos bin said al said who had been receiving cancer treatment for several years and was looking increasingly frail in his rare public appearances he died on january 10 after almost 50 years on the throne having modernized the country beyond recognition and navigating the complex politics of the region with an unusual degree of tact his handpicked choice of successor in a process that was clouded in some mystery and potentially open to dispute was something of a surprise haitham bin tariq al said was one of three cousins of qaboos earmarked for the top job but he was certainly not the front runner the swift process of anointing him the next ruler was a clear sign the political elite in muscat wanted to portray a sense of calm continuity lest any neighbors spot an opportunity to get involved xinhua news agency getty images the appointment of sultan haitham also offers a hint at how seriously qaboos viewed the second major challenge facing the country it s fragile underperforming economy sultan haitham is fairly well versed in economic matters having been chairman of the oman 2040 committee which was set up to formulate a new more diverse economic path for the country that experience will be extremely useful in the years ahead oman has far fewer resources to draw on than most of its neighbors its foreign exchange reserves and sovereign wealth fund assets are together worth around 50 of gdp far less than most gulf neighbours have according to london based capital economics the country has oil and gas reserves but they don t provide enough income to cover the government s large expenditure bill in essence oman has been living beyond its means for many years running persistently large budget and current account deficits to finance these the government keeps on issuing debt the debt to gdp ratio has risen from 5 in 2014 to 60 of gdp now to help match its income and spending muscat has also looked to its richer neighbors for support but while it has been able to secure some assistance it has not been given as much as bahrain the likes of saudi arabia and the uae are less supportive because of muscat s more independent position on regional matters under sultan qaboos muscat was known for building bridges rather than walls and it failed to support riyadh and abu dhabi s policies of isolating iran and qatar like most gulf countries oman keeps its currency pegged to the u s dollar in an effort to provide more economic stability this makes sense given the chief export oil is priced in dollars but maintaining the exchange rate is not always easy due to the weakness of the economy the new leader faces a difficult task of securing financial support from its neighbors in order to maintain the dollar peg says jason tuvey senior emerging markets economist at capital economics at the very least fiscal austerity will need to continue and we think that it will be the gulf s worst performing economy over the next couple of years whether the new ruler will be prepared to maintain the level of austerity that economists say is needed remains to be seen but most observers expect a fairly high degree of policy continuity from the old ruler to the new at least at first haitham s first public comments as sultan indicated he would maintain qaboos s foreign policy approach too the pressure will continue though ratings agency standard poor s says the new sultan has a narrowing window to address the country s fiscal and economic challenges and has suggested some big policy changes are needed in the absence of substantial fiscal measures to curtail the government deficit fiscal and external buffers will continue to erode the agency warned in a statement issued on january 12 we anticipate that sultan haitham will face a difficult trade off in the coming months between addressing social concerns partly arising from weak growth and high youth unemployment and rising fiscal external and funding pressures the omani authorities have proved wary of putting the population under too much pressure intermittent protests over the past decade have generally been met with promises of more spending and job creation as well as arrests new taxes have been repeatedly delayed a value added tax vat is now due to be introduced in 2021 years later than initially planned but could easily be postponed once again the world bank has previously warned that a key risk facing oman is that the pace of fiscal and structural reforms may slow hurting investor confidence and prospects for debt sustainability austerity economics on their own are not really the solution though oman needs to diversify its economy away from oil and gas and develop more industries to provide jobs for its young population robert mogielnicki resident scholar at the arab gulf states institute in washington argues there are three key priorities efficient spending making quality investments and high impact reforms all three are more easily identified than delivered when it comes to investing in pursuit of diversification for example there is stiff competition from nearby countries in almost every area that oman could conceivably target whether that is tourism logistics heavy industry or high tech innovation but at least a ruler in good health is better able to focus on these issues than one constantly diverted by the need to receive medical care like his predecessor sultan haitham will have a lot of power concentrated in his hands as well as being sultan he will also fill the roles of prime minister finance minister foreign minister defence minister and supreme commander of the armed forces he may find it politically astute to hand some of these files to others to craft a broader cabinet and build alliances but whoever is making the decisions will not find it easy and ultimately the responsibility will fall on the sultan to deliver
this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly on january 6 2020 january 12 2020 the last decade was full of surprises with events such as the election of donald trump as president of the us and the subsequent uprising of populism around the world the commercialisation of shale gas and precipitous fall of crude oil prices as well as the advent of the gig economy just to name a few these curveballs have paved the way for an interesting decade ahead as global economic growth is expected to meander along going forward as an open economy malaysia will feel the impact of external headwinds although many believe they are subsiding as well as its own domestic issues with this in mind consider the 10 main factors to look out for in 2020 and beyond 1 trump s re election and the trade war this year is an important one for the us because of the presidential election on nov 3 an election that will be closely watched by the global community as it could determine the fate of the us china trade war some believe that trump s re election as us president for a second term could result in a prolonged trade war with china even though both countries have agreed to the so called phase 1 trade deal trump is expected to continue with his agenda of making america great again if he is re elected at present the us has cancelled a further 15 tariff on us 150 billion rm615 billion worth of imports from china that was supposed to take effect in december and has taken steps to cut tariffs imposed since september 2019 on us 120 billion worth of goods from 15 to 7 5 china on the other hand according to us trade representative robert lighthizer has pledged to purchase an additional us 16 billion in agriculture goods over the next two years as things stand however trump will first have to survive an impeachment trial in the senate for abuse of power and obstruction of congress he is the third president in us history to be charged with committing high crimes and misdemeanors but his popularity ratings have not been hit by the impeachment the latest polls tracked by fivethirtyeight show his approval rating at 42 6 representing the upper end of the range since he took office in january 2017 2 geopolitical risk continues to brew despite a pause in the trade war geopolitical risk remains at a high the political situation in the us aside european politics are also calling out for attention with brexit set to happen after a three year deadlock the uk and the european union will soon negotiate the terms of their divorce will there be an amicable resolution already many fear the uk economy could suffer a deeper than expected shock during the transition process conflict in the middle east is another worry as the region has been mired in war and strife for many years we see flashpoints in the fragile middle east including fallout from attacks on saudi oil facilities turkey s incursion into syria and protests around the region blackrock investment institute observes in a report in southeast asia cgs cimb research notes that political dynamics remain fluid in malaysia and thailand with the present ruling coalitions governing on thin majorities meanwhile singapore is expected to call for an early election this year 3 populist movement on the rise in the last decade the populist movement has been on an undeniable rise starting from trump s triumphant presidential win that set in motion similar upsets around the globe including in turkey hungary italy and the philippines the outcome of the brexit referendum was yet another instance of the populace moving to the right the disillusionment with capitalism and rising inequality has contributed to a large extent to the rise in populism as established leaders are increasingly perceived to be unable to address the changes happening in the global economy chile one of the latest to be snared in the populist movement has been in unrest for several months after protesters took to the streets because of an increase in subway fares but commentators say the unrest is underscored by years of inequality and the high cost of living as with the us the populist movement has led to protectionism anti immigration policies and other policies that are viewed as anti globalisation in turn seen as detrimental for economies globally as trade and immigation form an important part of sustainable long term growth the years ahead will continue to put populist leaders and their governance on the centre stage time will reveal if their policies and strategies can appease the masses without compromising economic growth 4 malaysia s political brouhaha observers say the political situation in malaysia is a wild card a key issue being the leadership post prime minister tun dr mahathir mohamad during the 14th general election in 2018 it was agreed that datuk seri anwar ibrahim would succeed him after two years in office but there seems to be less clarity on the matter now as mahathir has been vague on the handover date the thorny matter aside sentiment on the ground also suggests that the people are dissatisfied with the performance of the coalition government which has been beset by constant infighting to the dismay of voters who had pinned their hopes on a new malaysia voter dissatisfaction was demonstrated in the recent tanjung piai by election where pakatan harapan received less than 30 of votes cast giving barisan nasional a landslide win 2020 is all the more significant for malaysia as the two year mark for mahathir s being in office draws near will he hand over the reins of power to anwar as agreed or will a new contender emerge sadly many foresee more infighting within the coalition this year this does not bode well for malaysia economically as foreign investors will shy away from a country deemed to have unstable politics and unclear policies 5 pace of economic growth the trade war was one of the biggest wild cards in 2019 it is expected to continue to be one factor that could either ease or aggravate uncertainties and the economic growth of nations in 2020 and beyond currently the jury is out on whether global growth in 2020 will be better or worse than in 2019 the international monetary fund projects a mild recovery from 2019 and for global growth to touch 3 4 a downward adjustment of 0 1 to the imf s initial october forecast the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd and the world bank are more bearish the former projecting a dip in 2020 to 2 9 and the latter 2 7 ocbc bank economist howie lee says in a report that he does not see any suitable growth catalyst that could return global growth to the great moderation period the time before the 2008 global financial crisis that said a bright spot appears to be the abating of the risk of a global recession on the local front the ministry of finance mof has pegged gross domestic product gdp growth at 4 8 in contrast with more subdued expectations in a report alliancedbs research notes that business and consumer sentiments are not only uninspiring but extremely dismal this does not bode well for the future given the critical role of private consumption and investment as a key growth driver critically business sentiment has dropped to a depressed level that was never seen over the past 20 years indicating the poor appetite among business owners for more investment in the near term explains the research house whose gdp forecast is 4 5 will the government s efforts to boost economic activity through budget 2020 help 6 lower interest rates an escalation in trade tensions last year and slower growth momentum prompted the us federal reserve to pause its rate hikes instead it chose to cut rates and extend its purchase of short term treasury bills the rate cut by the fed sparked a series of cuts globally malaysia reduced interest rates by 25 basis points bps in may 2019 to 3 ahead of the us rate cut in a bid to stimulate the economy will there be more rate reductions in the coming months since many believe 2020 will be even more challenging notwithstanding mof s forecast of a slight improvement in gdp growth whether or not bank negara malaysia bnm moves to trim interest rates will depend on the economic data to come it is worth noting that the central bank had already reduced the statutory reserve requirement to 3 from 3 5 in november a move that is expected to boost liquidity in the system nevertheless many see room for further interest rate cuts this year cgs cimb research notes in a report that the cautious global outlook and the hairline cracks in domestic resilience call for further monetary loosening it expects two 25bps cuts in the next 12 months while monetary policy is not the only measure to stimulate economic growth is there wiggle room in malaysia s coffers to unleash other forms of stimulus 7 uplift for commodity prices brent crude oil prices have been pretty stable hovering around us 60 per barrel in 2019 in 2020 the us energy information administration eia expects brent crude price to average us 61 per barrel while national petroleum company petroliam nasional bhd puts it in the high us 50s according to maybank investment bank research crude oil is expected to continue to remain stable at us 60 to us 65 per barrel this year a level seen palatable to everyone and sufficient to keep capital expenditure going maybank has forecast us 369 billion in offshore exploration and production e p investments globally over a three year period from 2019 to 2021 slightly more than double the us 155 billion in the previous three years 2016 to 2018 in a recent december meeting the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and its allies opec agreed to cut oil production by another 500 000 barrels per day for the first quarter of 2020 bringing total production to 1 7 million barrels per day the move to cut oil production globally should help to further support oil prices but the persistent worry is that the supply of crude oil will outstrip demand as growth wavers a bright spot is the price recovery of crude palm oil cpo another important local commodity as at jan 2 cpo prices settled at rm3 049 50 per tonne the highest since february 2017 thanks to india s recent move to cut import tax on southeast asian palm oil kenanga research outlines three factors that are expected to drive the recovery of cpo the laggard impact of the dry weather thus reducing output in 2020 china s increase in palm oil consumption on the back of the swine flu outbreak and higher consumption in indonesia and malaysia owing to the increase in percentage of cpo in biofuel policies 8 cost of living woes and shared prosperity vision the high cost of living is still affecting almost all segments of society despite pakatan harapan s ph attempts to bring down prices among its initiatives were the abolishment of the goods and services tax gst which was replaced with the sales and services tax sst continuing the bantuan sara hidup for the b40 group and ongoing plans to implement targeted fuel subsidies over the current decade ph s shared prosperity vision 2030 will be of interest to many as its goal is for malaysia to achieve sustainable equitable inclusive and balanced economic growth targets include raising the b40 monthly household income to rm5 800 by 2030 from rm3 000 presently increasing the employee compensation to nominal gdp ratio to 48 from 35 7 and raising the small and medium enterprise and micro businesses share of gdp to 50 this year the 12th malaysia plan will also be unveiled the development blueprint which will set the tone for the nation s economic direction and policies moving forward has the potential to contribute to the nation s prosperity how these targets will be achieved will depend largely on the way the 12th malaysia plan is executed and implemented 9 gig economy continues to grow having manifested in various forms over the last decade the gig economy is here to stay and is sure to morph in the decade to come data connectivity and social media have been two of the largest enablers of the gig economy randstad malaysia explains the gig economy as consisting of companies that engage contract workers for a temporary period or project based jobs instead of hiring them for permanent positions world bank data shows that about 25 3 of the malaysian workforce are freelancers participants of the gig economy and expects this number to grow further ocbc economist lee says the gig economy has enabled less skilled workers to earn a meaningful income by completing a plethora of jobs instead of relying on a single employer this decade might be too soon to call for an end to 9 to 5 jobs but the trend looks to be leaning in that direction as institutions offload the risk of employment from the organisations to the individuals notes lee it has been recognised as a new source of economic growth by the government with mahathir reportedly saying that it will be made part of the 12th malaysia plan regulation of the gig economy could benefit both participants and the nation as the rights of participants will be protected while there would be a new source of revenue for the nation 10 job displacements although technology has provided opportunities for people to earn more it also has an ugly side if not well managed these days technological advancements have allowed robots to work faster than any human on an assembly line with almost zero errors thereby increasing productivity in more recent cases artificial intelligence technologies have made breakthroughs allowing predictive analysis this decade could possibly see a larger number of job displacements as technology replaces more routine and less skilled jobs among countries in southeast asia singapore s labour market is said to be the one that will face the largest degree of job displacements in this decade it is only a matter of time before it hits malaysian shores as well human resource minister m kula segaran has urged malaysians to upskill so they can move up the value chain and to be flexible enough to adapt to new ideas innovations and technologies he has stressed the urgency to ensure there are highly skilled workers who will be able to drive innovation and support economic growth in the future perhaps this decade will be one where people take calls to upskill themselves more seriously as the threat of displacement becomes more real save by subscribing to us for your print and or

i arrived in sao paulo the financial and economic capital of brazil on the night of 14 november 2019 the city has over 12 million inhabitants in all the districts i visited poverty is flagrant you see homeless people living on the street with no access to sanitation of any kind and prey to the most extreme poverty a significant number of people are undernourished reliable sources mention about 100 000 people who live on the streets of sao paulo 25 000 of them permanently and 75 000 on a temporary basis in december 1991 lula and the pt stood for the struggle against odious and illegitimate debt i first came to sao paulo in december 1991 to participate in the first congress of the workers party partido dos trabalhadores or pt led by the former metal worker lula at that time lula and the pt stood for the struggle against odious and illegitimate debt see the interview i had with him in managua in july 1991 he said among other things any third world government that decides to further repay the external debt chooses to lead his people into the abyss lula had led workers strikes against the dictatorship in the 1980s and in 1988 a democratic regime replaced the dictatorship after a transitional stage the bases of the main trade union federation cut central única de trabalhadores or unified workers central and of the new party the pt had been brought together during the valiant struggle against the dictatorship the pt had been built from the bottom by activists in social movements and small very active politically radical organizations the cut and the pt were against repaying debt and wanted a citizens audit part of the debt had been accumulated during the military dictatorship which lasted more than 20 years and afterwards it increased steeply during the debt crisis in the 1980s a crisis that resulted from commodity prices plummeting while washington had decided on a sharp increase in interest rates interest rates when a lends money to b b repays the amount lent by a the capital as well as a supplementary sum known as interest so that a has an interest in agreeing to this financial operation the interest is determined by the interest rate which may be high or low to take a very simple example if a borrows 100 million dollars for 10 years at a fixed interest rate of 5 the first year he will repay a tenth of the capital initially borrowed 10 million dollars plus 5 of the capital owed i e 5 million dollars that is a total of 15 million dollars in the second year he will again repay 10 of the capital borrowed but the 5 now only applies to the remaining 90 million dollars still due i e 4 5 million dollars or a total of 14 5 million dollars and so on until the tenth year when he will repay the last 10 million dollars plus 5 of that remaining 10 million dollars i e 0 5 million dollars giving a total of 10 5 million dollars over 10 years the total amount repaid will come to 127 5 million dollars the repayment of the capital is not usually made in equal instalments in the initial years the repayment concerns mainly the interest and the proportion of capital repaid increases over the years in this case if repayments are stopped the capital still due is higher the nominal interest rate is the rate at which the loan is contracted the real interest rate is the nominal rate reduced by the rate of inflation more generally the pt clearly stated that radical anti capitalist policies had to be implemented which were to lead to the construction of a democratic socialist self managed and anti bureaucratic society this outcome stirred genuine enthusiasm in brazil and beyond i went to sao paulo in 1991 in order to prepare lula s and another pt leader marco aurelio garcia s visit to belgium at the invitation of the cadtm the talks were to take place some ten days before christmas 1991 eventually for health reasons lula couldn t come over and was replaced by marco aurelio garcia who became president of the pt in 2006 and was lula s main adviser on foreign policy while lula was president from 2003 to 2011 i met lula four or five times from 1991 to 2003 i can remember a long discussion we had in havana in 1993 it followed upon a meeting lula had had with fidel castro and daniel ortega lula explained that in order to become president of brazil he had to neutralize us imperialism the army and the brazilian bourgeoisie i understood that he meant not to thwart us strategic interests and to promise the army leadership and big capital that he would implement no measures that went against their interests lula told me that he would be the president of all brazilians as was all too often said what i understood was that he would use his experience as a trade unionist to seal a pact between those at the bottom and those at the top asking those at the top to concede some improvements in purchasing power i e allowing the state to increase social aid with public money while those at the bottom would accept that nothing would really change at the structural level this is indeed what he attempted to do when he was president ten years later during the 1990s the position of the pt and the cut was gradually watered down i saw him for the last time in june 2003 and stated how much i disapproved of the neoliberal reform he had introduced into the civil service pension system the meeting occurred on the occasion of the g8 g8 group composed of the most powerful countries of the planet canada france germany italy japan the uk and the usa with russia a full member since june 2002 their heads of state meet annually usually in june or july annual summit united states canada japan germany united kingdom france italy russia in evian on 1 and 2 june 2003 several heads of states that did not belong to the g8 had been invited by the french president jacques chirac who wished to show that the g8 and france in particular were open to dialogue with the rest of the world among those who had responded positively were president lula of brazil and the heads of states or governments of china india nigeria senegal south africa egypt and mexico chirac was trying to give legitimacy to the g8 an informal club of major global powers at a time when its credibility was in question particularly after the brutal repression of the counter g8 protest in genoa in 2001 president chirac s guests met in evian before the actual g8 summit meeting while over 100 000 marched through the streets of geneva switzerland and annemasse france shouting g8 is illegal luis inacio lula da silva wanted to meet leaders of the european anti globalization movements there were four delegates the president of attac france a woman representative of the italian social forum a swedish woman representative of the campaign against the wto wto world trade organisation the wto founded on 1st january 1995 replaced the general agreement on trade and tariffs gatt the main innovation is that the wto enjoys the status of an international organization its role is to ensure that no member states adopt any kind of protectionism whatsoever in order to accelerate the liberalization global trading and to facilitate the strategies of the multinationals it has an international court the dispute settlement body which judges any alleged violations of its founding text drawn up in marrakesh and myself for the cadtm the meeting occurred in geneva in the residence of the brazilian ambassador and it highlighted the gap between lula and the international anti globalization movements see my interview president lula s realpolitik and the alterglobalisation movement changes in the pt and the cut to qualify this highly critical assessment it should be mentioned that the lula government developed a policy of public aid to the poorest through the distribution of social benefits under the programme entitled bolsa familia it should be pointed out that during the 1990s the position of the pt and the cut was gradually watered down the pt won many elected officials in large cities as well as in small and medium sized towns in particular the pt had mayors elected in sao paulo and porto alegre where it gradually adopted a managerial orientation and lost its role as a spur to radical anti capitalist changes i followed this process of adaptation to the institutions of the capitalist state with great disappointment when lula was elected president of brazil at the end of 2002 with a landslide 65 of the votes he and the pt had fundamentally changed they no longer really questioned the capitalist system and lula signed a letter of submission to the imf imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country the most important one 6 57 of the votes is led by belgium the least important group of countries 1 55 of the votes is led by gabon and brings together african countries in the middle of the election campaign in august 2002 in this letter he solemnly declared that if elected president he would abide strictly by the previous government s agreements with the imf only a couple of months after his election he introduced a neoliberal reform of retirement pensions lula also appointed as president of the central bank central bank the establishment which in a given state is in charge of issuing bank notes and controlling the volume of currency and credit in france it is the banque de france which assumes this role under the auspices of the european central bank see ecb while in the uk it is the bank of england ecb one of the big bosses henrique meirelles former president of one of the major us banks in brazil the fleet boston the message was clear a representative of the capitalist class was at the head of the central bank lula did not interfere with the army and did not suspend the amnesty extended to those officers of the dictatorship responsible for crimes against humanity this is a major difference with argentina where the 1986 amnesty was cancelled in 2005 which made it possible to condemn and incarcerate several military leaders including the major figures of the military dictatorship enforced in 1976 under the lula presidency the brazilian army participated in the occupation of haiti which was denounced by haitian social movements the top brazilian military leader during the occupation of haiti became a member of bolsonaro s government in 2019 under lula s presidency not a single private corporation was brought back into the public sector on the contrary he supported the interests of private corporations that did not hesitate to bribe civil servants in order to secure procurements as was the case for the emblematic construction company odebrecht see euronews what is the odebrecht corruption scandal in latin america and who is implicated the lula government scrupulously repaid its debts without carrying out the audit he had called for when he was in the opposition to qualify this highly critical assessment it should be mentioned that the lula government developed a policy of public aid to the poorest through the distribution of social benefits under the programme entitled bolsa familia family grant this programme improved the income of more than 12 million families i e about 20 of brazil s poorest families please note that the amount of aid was limited at the time of the pt government a family of three could receive a maximum of 50 euros it should be noted that bolsonaro has not stopped this programme which in 2019 benefited 13 5 million families i e one fifth of brazilian families in 2019 a poor family could receive a maximum of 200 reales per month at the exchange rate of november 2019 that is around 40 euros to be entitled to this grant the family must show that its monthly income is below 89 reales that is 20 euros or less than one euro a day per family why did the lula government not combat illegitimate public debt the lula government did not combat illegitimate public debt because they did not want to antagonize brazilian big capital questioning debt repayment would also involve conflict with major private banks and foreign investment funds as well as with the imf the lula government did not combat illegitimate public debt because they did not want to antagonize brazilian big capital questioning debt repayment as a government would have meant conflict with brazilian big capital which benefits largely from the debt buying brazil s internal and external public debt securities these insure a high return since interest interest an amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set rates are very high questioning debt repayment would also involve conflict with major private banks and foreign investment funds investment fund investment funds private equity investment funds sometimes called mutual funds seek to invest in companies according to certain criteria of which they most often are specialized capital risk capital development funds leveraged buy out lbo which reflect the different levels of the company s maturity as well as with the imf lula and the pt leadership wanted to avoid such conflicts as they gave legitimacy to the debt continued paying it and went even further calling on big capital to contract new public loans the lula government was tolerated or even appreciated by the bourgeoisie all the more so as social measures that benefited people with the lowest income increased the purchasing power of the poor which was good for capitalists business lula s neoliberal policies resulted in a split within the pt with a new party emerging to its left in 2004 that party is the psol party for socialism and freedom since 2001 i often went back to brazil for the large gatherings of the world social forums around 100 000 people participated each time for meetings of the wsf s international council of which i had been a member from the start and for meetings of social movements there were meetings organized by the brazilian citizens debt audit a member of the cadtm s international network the cadtm s international network repeatedly sent significant delegations to brazil for wsf activities particularly in porto alegre in 2005 and in belem in 2009 when one of the cadtm s world assemblies was held the political situation has changed a lot as pointed out above from 2003 onward the pt clearly turned away from its revolutionary past to become a manager of the system this eventually resulted in deep disappointment not to say distrust especially since several of its leaders were actively involved in major corruption cases including lula himself eventually when the bourgeoisie felt it could manage the country without the pt s collaboration it exposed the party as corrupt this while all other traditional parties are just as deeply corrupt or much more dilma rousseff the pt leader who won the 2010 presidential elections and became president of brazil in 2011 was impeached by the senate in 2016 in what was actually an institutional coup d etat see in french spanish or portuguese but disappointment towards the pt was so deep that the brazilian people hardly mobilized to defend the pt and its leaders in 2016 and the right wing vice president michel temer appointed by the pt in 2011 replaced dilma rousseff pt as president after masterminding the institutional coup later the antisocial policies implemented by president temer a corrupt right wing leader eventually stirred some popular support for lula as a credible candidate to be reelected president in 2018 so the judiciary system largely controlled by big capital was relentless in its efforts to prevent lula from running for president despite his imprisonment lula was the most likely to win and his supporters hoped that he would be able to participate in the elections this is why the judiciary prohibited him from running and jair bolsonaro was elected president end of 2018 and started his mandate in early 2019 bolsonaro is a far right politician yearning for dictatorship see a racist sexist homophobic climate change negationist he is similar to trump while possibly even further to the right his deeply reactionary and antipopular nature is beyond doubt see in french or spanish on 21 october 2018 at the end of the election campaign he stated that if he was elected president he would conduct a purge such as brazil has never known he affirmed that the leaders of the workers party must all rot in prison and said of the leftist movements they will have to submit to the law like everyone else either they leave or they go to jail shortly after starting his mandate he promised to remove civil servants with communist ideas his election is a real tragedy for the brazilian people and for the international left we should not expect lula to go back to the sources of the pt his orientation remains the one that prevailed from 2003 to 2016 after bolsonaro s victory a large part of the left fortunately formed a united front and demanded lula s liberation they got it in early november 2019 and lula immediately started a political campaign to win the presidential elections in 2022 this being said we should not expect lula to go back to the sources of the pt his orientation remains the one that prevailed from 2003 to 2016 but he might get elected in 2022 since it is clear that bolsonaro if he completes his mandate will have implemented antisocial policies that increase poverty and deepen the gap between a handful of very rich and the overwhelming majority of brazil s population obviously we need to mobilize widely against the bolsonaro government and in spite of disagreements with the pt we need a broad left wing front within which the pt will play an active part auditing brazil s debt from 2000 and ecuador s in 2007 2008 the brazilian citizens debt audit is an organization founded in the early 2000s in 2000 a referendum was organized on popular initiative by the mst landless workers movement the cut brazil s jubilee south campaign the national conference of bishops which has been positioned on the left since the years 1980 1990 with the support of the pt and more than 90 of the 6 million brazilians who voted were in favour of suspending debt payments for the time it took to carry out an audit to determine how much of it was illegitimate see in portuguese folha online brasil 90 dos votantes de plebiscito da cnbb pedem auditoria da dívida 14 09 2000 there was acute awareness of the illegitimate character of brazil s debt in a large part of the left and the brazilian population although the audit was provided for in the 1988 constitution the government had never carried it through after the popular referendum of september 2000 parliamentary representatives from the pt brought a draft bill to get it done it was in the aftermath of the referendum that the brazilian citizens debt audit was set up it subsequently joined the cadtm see the brazilian citizens debt audit website in portuguese see also maria lucia fattorelli s interview where she explains how the collaboration between her organization and the cadtm developed in french spanish and portuguese in 2005 during the 5th wsf the brazilian citizens debt audit the cadtm and jubilee south with the support of the mst organized a three day long tribunal against debt in porto alegre which brought together 1000 participants from every continent as pointed out above as soon as lula became president of brazil in 2003 he forgot his commitment to set up an audit of the debt in 2005 during the 5th world social forum the brazilian citizens debt audit the cadtm and jubilee south with the support of the mst landless workers movement organized a three day long tribunal against debt in porto alegre which brought together 1000 participants from every continent next in brazil support for the struggle against illegitimate debt faded mainly because the mst considered that they should rack up their critical support of president lula s government as for the leadership of the cut they had deserted the fight against debt as soon as lula came to office as president nevertheless that did not prevent the brazilian citizens debt audit from battling on through thick and thin to denounce repayment of mainly illegitimate debt the cadtm international gave its constant support to this fight in 2007 at the behest of militants combating illegitimate debt in ecuador maria lucia fattorelli the coordinator of the brazilian citizens debt audit and myself for the cadtm became members of the committee for integral debt audit caic established by the new president of ecuador rafael correa the caic s task was to identify illegitimate debts contracted during the period of 1976 2006 our work reported to the government in september 2008 and made public in november of the same year resulted in the suspension of payments on a significant part of debt demanded from ecuador in the form of sovereign bonds mainly held by banks of the usa the unilateral suspension of payment brought about a resounding victory see eric toussaint hugo arias palacios aris chatzistefanou video the ecuador debt audit a seven minute summary ecuador imposed on its creditors a reduction of 70 of the debts concerned this enabled a significant increase in social spending from 2009 2010 it is important to note that president lula did not help ecuador with its debt auditing initiative he demanded that rafael correa cease applying pressure on odebrecht and persuaded him to take it to arbitration in a paris court it is important to note that president lula did not help ecuador with its debt auditing initiative this is proved by what happened in the case of the brazilian firm odebrecht which i mentioned earlier the firm built a hydro electric power plant of very poor quality in ecuador odebrecht had overcharged for the work and had not complied with the technical specifications the plant was so badly built that it broke down the audit committee had identified the debt brazil was demanding of ecuador for the plant s construction as illegal and illegitimate despite the fact that it was obviously in the wrong the firm of odebrecht refused to indemnify the state of ecuador in september 2008 to force odebrecht to fulfil its obligations towards the government of ecuador president rafael correa sent the army to occupy the installations of the hydroelectric plant instead of backing up the progressive government of ecuador in face of odebrecht lula protested against ecuador s intervention and recalled his ambassador he demanded that rafael correa cease applying pressure on odebrecht and persuaded him to take it to arbitration in a paris court correa accepted though knowing only too well that the arbitration would favour odebrecht indeed ecuador lost partially the government of brazil and odebrecht came out on top now let us look at the case of paraguay an enclave country surrounded by brazil argentina and bolivia in december 2008 the progressive president fernando lugo who had been in office for six months invited me to help him create an audit committee of paraguayan debt i went to asunción for a personal interview with the president followed by a meeting with the paraguayan government see paraguay the belgian who met with the president is an adviser to correa and works with chavez see also interview with the economic and political analyst eric toussaint the itaipu treaty signed in 1973 could be declared void and most of paraguay s debt could be qualified as odious as it resulted as is still the case from a major agreement made in the 1970s between two military dictatorships éric toussaint and fernando lugo president of paraguay 2008 2012 it was clear that most of paraguay s debt could be qualified as odious as it resulted as is still the case from a major agreement made in the 1970s between two military dictatorships the brazilian military junta and the paraguayan dictatorship of general stroessner the offending treaty dealt with the construction running and maintenance of what was at the time the biggest dam in the world the itaipu dam i had studied the matter in depth using the excellent documentation elaborated by paraguyan experts moreover a former member of staff of the cadtm in belgium the paraguayan jurist hugo ruiz diaz balbuena had become an adviser to president lugo which made contacts easier the international audit initiative with citizen participation had withered under pressure from the brazilian government during lula s presidency note that big brazilian companies are the main creditors of paraguay which they exploit although he had intended to sign a presidential decree creating the debt audit committee fernando lugo finally gave in to pressure from lula and his government who were protecting the interests of the brazilian firms who were creditors to persuade the paraguayan government to drop the idea of an international audit and of questioning the debt claimed by brazilian firms lula made a few marginal concessions and increased the amount brazil paid paraguay every year for electricity provided by the itaipu dam see a commentary in french of the agreement signed between paraguay and brazil in july 2009 that said despite the pressure from brazil an audit was carried out by the court of auditors in 2010 and 2011 see in french and spanish french only at the time i went back to paraguay at president fernando lugo s invitation in june 2012 he was eventually overthrown by a parliamentary coup to use a phrase that had been used in honduras in 2009 and was applied in brazil when dilma rousseff who had succeeded lula as president of brazil from 2011 was overthrown see eric toussaint paraguay juin 2012 honduras juin 2009 d un coup d etat à l autre in french or spanish the fact that the right was able to use this form of institutional coup d etat whether in brazil or in paraguay is partly due to the inability of those two left wing governments to affront creditors forcefully and carry out structural reform at the beginning of their mandates they enjoyed enormous popular support but this was deeply eroded by the disappointment engendered by conciliatory policies towards big capital both local and international by the time the right decided to take action people on the left were too disillusioned and disorientated to mobilize in defence of those in power the brazilian citizens debt audit from 2009 to 2019 in 2009 the brazilian citizens debt audit managed to set up a parliamentary committee thanks particularly to active support from the psol socialism and freedom party yet pt mps joined conservative mps to prevent the committee from questioning the legitimacy of brazil s debt then president dilma rousseff 2011 2016 vetoed the organization of such an audit here is an assessment by maria lucia fattorelli french the brazilian citizens debt audit conducted a tireless campaign of consciousness raising in brazil the group trained numerous local sections in brazil and organized correspondence courses to train activists who wanted to audit debt they organized several international rallies the coordinator maria lucia fattorelli also participated in the greek public debt truth committee in greece in 2015 before that she had coordinated the publication of a debt auditing handbook that was translated into french spanish and english maria lucia fattorelli citizen public debt audit experiences and methods in 2018 during the electoral campaign the brazilian citizens debt audit was bitterly disappointed by the presidential campaign of the psol candidate guilherme bolos he considered that continuing debt repayments was not really a problem in 2018 during the electoral campaign the brazilian citizens debt audit was bitterly disappointed by the presidential campaign of the psol candidate guilherme bolos with the agreement of the majority of the psol leadership bolos set aside the issue of questioning debt payment he considered that continuing debt repayments was not really a problem this caused a profound malaise within the psol to put it mildly indeed g bolos s electoral score as the psol candidate for the presidency fell far below the one the party had obtained in the previous presidential campaign in 2014 in 2014 the psol candidate luciana genro had vigorously defended the debt audit and the idea of suspending payments on debt identified as illegitimate g bolos only won a third of the votes luciana genro had won even though for the first time the psol had benefited from a considerable government subsidy for the electoral campaign it only goes to show that by watering down his positions the psol candidate lost part of the radical electorate that had previously supported the psol will this be a lasting development of the ten psol representatives in the brazilian parliament at present several maintain a clear position on debt but what is the true position of the party s leadership at the next psol congress to be held in may 2020 we shall see whether its militants will push for a return to policies more in line with the party s origins within the pt workers party which has 53 members of parliament acceptance of the debt system is deeply anchored in the party s official line and unfortunately we must not nourish any illusions to the contrary despite the criticisms aired above it is obvious that to counter bolsonaro left wing parties and social movements must unite in the broadest possible front only the future will tell whether the huge social mobilizations that have taken or are taking place in countries such as chile ecuador columbia haiti puerto rico and bolivia will find an echo in brazil translated by vicki briault manus and christine pagnoulle cadtm

it is hard to believe that just one week ago markets were again contemplating a potential war in the middle east that bullet was dodged as both the us and iran stepped back from the brink albeit with a human tragedy that may still come to haunt iran s leadership markets instead have focused on their happy place a trade deal signing this week in washington dc accelerating a global recovery in turn it is powered by a worldwide savings glut searching for a home as central banks hold rates globally at or near zero per cent what has been lost in the euphoria of the buy everything trade are the world s central banks except for the federal reserve which got its punches in first the rest of the pack appear to be easing at a frenetic pace with interest rates in developing asia at or near record lows or soon to be europe and japan continue to quantitatively ease with no end in sight the reserve bank of australia is thinking about it and the federal reserve continues its guerilla operation via the short term repo market the world s central banks seem to know something we don t as us q4 earnings season gets underway with the results expected to be generally positive breaking the world s addiction to a zero per cent cost of capital is proving much more complicated than they could have imagined their aversion to inflicting losses and draining the swamps of commerce hasn t helped nor have much of the world s governments who have lazily put the onus on monetary policy rather than from the more politically odious fiscal side from that perspective it is therefore of no surprise that wall street hit yet another high overnight asset markets globally be it equities or property for example continue to power ahead no one should be surprised that tesla nasdaq rose 500 a share overnight making it i believe the worlds 3rd largest auto manufacturer by market capitalisation aside from calling the repo men on the fleet of tesla shorts it may go higher still as anything tech basks in the monetary sunshine it was the faang s plus microsoft nasdaq and tesla that led wall street higher overnight if mt faang were a rap star he or she would have a lit gangsta multi platinum hit on their hands mt faang and their fans around the world will likely keep on partying late into q1 s night with the world as it stands now money has to go somewhere and the world s central banks won t be the noise police and spoil the party but when greece and italy can issue 10 year government debt at levels 40 basis points below the us government something is definitely amiss in the world still china hogs the data spotlight today in asia releasing its balance of trade at 1100 sgt followed by foreign direct investment at 1500 sgt and new loans at 1700sgt the trade surplus is likely to rebound to 48 billion for december still even if the data disappoints across the board markets will likely concentrate on the trade deal signing tomorrow and the ensuing economic recovery story on the interim us china trade deal itself details are starting to emerge of the nuts and bolts the south china post is reporting that china is committing to purchasing 200 billion of us goods and services over the next two years that is made up of 75 billion of manufactured products 50 billion of energy 40 billion of agricultural goods and 35 billion of services the agreement contains provisions allowing the us to unilaterally reimpose tariffs and intellectual property and forced technology transfer provisions first impressions are that it appears better on paper for the us than i initially expected and could be a boost for likes of boeing nyse and caterpillar nyse equities wall street lept strongly overnight to new record highs led by big tech and tesla and powered by rapidly diminishing geopolitical

central banklers playing taps for the middle class it is not at all a mystery as to the cause of the wealth gap that exists between the very rich and the poor central bankers are the primary cause of this chasm that is eroding the foundation of the global middle class the world s poor are falling deeper into penury and at a faster pace while the world s richest are accelerating further ahead to this point the 500 wealthiest billionaires on earth added 1 2 trillion to their fortunes in 2019 boosting their collective net worth by 25 to 5 9 trillion in fact jamie dimon ceo of jp morgan made a quarter of a billion dollars in stock based compensation in 2019 as a reminder shares of jpm were plunging at the end of 2018 that is before the fed stepped in with a promise to stop normalizing interest rates and then soon after began cutting them and launching a bank saving qe 4 program and repo facility on top of it in order to make sure mr dimon s stock price would soar slashing interest rates hurts savers and retirees that rely on an income stream to exist just as the fed s qe pushes up the prices for the things which the middle class relies on the most to exist food energy clothing shelter medical and educational expenses therefore what we have is a condition where those who own the greatest share of assets such as stocks bonds and real estate are becoming more wealthy meanwhile those that have to spend a greater percentage of their income on the basics of raising a family are falling further behind the saddest part of this charade is that the fed isn t at all happy or content with the current pace of middle class erosion instead it actually wants to aggressively speed it up according to the congressional budget office and fortune com the incomes of the top 1 have increased by 242 since 1980 while the middle three quintiles have seen just 50 income growth in just under forty years president trump is correct this is indeed the best economy ever but unfortunately only for the ultra rich nearly 80 of americans now live paycheck to paycheck according to a survey done each year since 2014 by gobankingrates in 2019 69 of respondents said they have less than 1 000 in a savings account which compares with 58 in 2018 according to the la times adjusted for inflation wages for the top 5 of earners rose from 50 46 an hour in 2000 to 63 10 in 2018 an increase of 25 the median worker s hourly wage meanwhile rose by just 7 over that period to 18 80 according to economics professor gabriel zucman in a paper he submitted to the nber the wealthiest 0 1 of americans now hold the largest share of total household net worth than at any time since 1929 this just happens to coincide with the period just before the historic wall street stock market crash and the start of the great depression a study done in 2015 showed that america s top 10 of wealth holders averaged more than nine times as much income as the bottom 90 and americans in the top 1 averaged over 40 times more income than the bottom 90 the richest 1 of the world s population now holds over 50 of its wealth perhaps it is not a coincidence either that the united states has lost 20 of its factory jobs since 2000 the chart below illustrates clearly how the fed is pushing up asset prices far ahead of gdp leaving the middles class in its wake central banks are creating new money at an unprecedented pace and throwing it at the wealthiest part of the population pushing asset bubbles ever higher and further away from economic reality the fed is turning a blind eye towards a middle class that is heading towards extinction make no mistake about it the level of fiscal and monetary insanity has jumped off the charts along with the value of assets in relation to gdp global governments are now borrowing money at a record pace which is adding more debt to the already insolvent and intractable existing pile and in order to keep all the bubbles afloat central bankers have become trapped in a permanent condition of zirp and qe what could possibly go wrong unfortunately it will be nothing short of mass economic chaos when the bond market finally implodes but this doesn t

told dw the two situations are different in terms of the concentration of industry and big companies he added if south korea goes into a deep depression that will trigger an economic crisis like we saw in 1997 it will be a systemic crisis read more japan and south korea determined to improve ties trade wars the south korean government somewhat confident that the problems are merely a hiccup has predicted that the national economy will grow 2 4 this year in contrast to 2 in 2019 its most anemic growth since 2009 but economists are skeptical pointing to a number of factors beyond moon s control the trade war between china and the united states has dealt a severe blow to south korea more recently a dispute with japan over differing interpretations of their shared histories has spilled over into the trade arena with tokyo imposing restrictions on exports of chemicals that are critical to south korea s semiconductor industry the causes of the problems are not however all external immediately after entering office moon s government sharply raised the country s minimum wage and reduced maximum working hours in the hopes it would generate income led growth instead small and medium sized companies already operating on thin margins were forced to lay off workers while others went bankrupt widening gaps in equality moon s efforts to reduce the gap between the wealthy and the poor have not yet paid off the president promised to make south korea fairer when he was elected said munseob lee a professor at the school of global policy and strategy at the university of california san diego korea also faces multiple structural issues lee added what concerns me most is labor market inequality among oecd countries korea has the highest gender wage gap and the eighth highest self employment rate that increased overall inequality and hinders the inclusive growth of the korean economy moon has also been hampered by a number of political crises since his rise to power a nepotism scandal echoed the scandal that lead to the impeachment of the country s previous president park geun hye combined with the recent trade war with japan economic uncertainty has become even stronger than during the impeachment i believe korea s economy has strong fundamentals but it is facing political and structural headwinds said lee dwindling support moon s public support rate stood above 80 in his early months in office reflecting broad belief in the promises that he made ahead of the election today his support rate hovers around 48 which is an improvement on the 40 recorded in the latter half of last year economic concerns dominate south korean media and public discourse but with elections scheduled for april ordinary south korean people will soon have the opportunity to demonstrate their thoughts on the very issues that arguably affects them more than anyone else

the us and china will provide the main support to the world economy and financial markets the united states china and the european union account for one half of the world economy with the magnitude and scope of their trade and financial flows those three large economic systems are fully capable of setting the pace of global business cycle dynamics especially if they effectively coordinate their demand management policies unfortunately the policy coordination issue is an old pious wish despite the fact that the g 20 had been set up precisely for that purpose so as always the u s will continue to be the pace setter of the global economy at the cost of its half a trillion dollar trade deficits serving as net contributions to jobs and incomes in the rest of the world the u s however is in no position to do that but that is the price it has to pay for its failure to organize an appropriate burden sharing of running the world economy with its main trade partners with its huge budget and trade deficits its soaring public debt and alarming deterioration of external liabilities washington has no room for tax cuts or higher public spending all it s got figuratively speaking are the federal reserve s printing presses as long as the expected cost and price outlook allows the central bank to keep reasonably anchored inflation expectations luckily that s what the fed is looking at now the index measuring prices of consumption expenditures excluding food and energy has stabilized around an annual rate of 1 5 comfortably below its 2 target range unit labor costs the key indicator of underlying inflation are also stable during the first nine months of 2019 they came in at an annual rate of 1 9 roughly identical to readings observed over the previous two years the latest business surveys show the same picture of stabilizing or even weakening prices in recent months and those surveys don t indicate disruptions of global supply chains in the wake of widespread trade disputes bond markets seem to agree by reflecting stable inflation expectations the fed therefore has the option to respond with further easing in case of weakening demand and employment creation china for its part could also help to support the world economy because it is reducing its reliance on exports and generating most of its economic growth from household consumption and investments beijing s trade balance turned negative last year while its large tax cuts reportedly amounting to 2 of gdp contributed nearly 1 percentage point of economic growth those tax cuts are part of fiscal reforms scheduled to continue this year too at the same time china s monetary authorities announced an appropriately easy credit stance to support aggregate demand a transition to sustainable long term growth and structural reforms of the financial sector europe is a big disappointment the euro area the core component of the european union is failing to implement an expansionary monetary fiscal policy mix that would prop up its sluggish economy and contribute to global demand and employment and yet with the exception of greece and spain most euro area members could to a varying degree ease their fiscal stance germany with its overflowing government coffers and the world s largest trade surplus should lead that process but its governing coalition is in disarray and struggling with large public sector investment backlogs in transportation education and healthcare the bottom line for berlin seems to be that it will continue to live off its trade partners instead of contributing to stronger economic growth and increasing jobs in europe and in the rest of the world washington is looking at that with puzzling indifference to a quarter of its exports and a 10 increase in its trans atlantic trade deficit during the first eleven months of last year the progress being made with china on trade adjustment and economic reforms should serve as an example of similar changes in washington s relations with the european community and apart from insisting on economic policy coordination with its main trade partners the u s should also pay more attention to one third of its economy consisting of export and import transactions with the rest of the world that external sector has a direct bearing on growth and employment public debt and the dollar s exchange rate source cnbc
credit rating agency says outlook for 2020 is stable but warns of considerable existing risks american credit rating agency fitch ratings inc on monday maintained pakistan s long term foreign currency issuer default rating at a b noting this reflected a challenging external position one of three major global rating agencies alongside moody s and standard poor s fitch noted progress toward strengthening external finances and positive steps on the fiscal front but warned that considerable risks remained it said that islamabad still faced a high external financing requirement and low reserves weak public finances including large fiscal deficits and a high government debt to gdp ratio and weak governance indicators according to the rating agency the pakistan tehreek e insaf led government had reduced external vulnerabilities over the past year thanks to policy actions and financing by the international monetary fund but warned it still had relatively low foreign exchange reserves in the context of an elevated external debt repayment schedule and subdued export performance it also noted that pakistan s liquidity ratio is 111 4 much weaker than the b median of 161 2 noting reduced imports fitch forecast that the current account deficit would likely reduce from 4 9 of gdp in the last fiscal to 2 1 in the year ending june 2020 and 1 9 in fy21 exports are forecast to grow modestly from a low base it added the ratings agency said the state bank of pakistan s adoption of a more flexible exchange rate last year and capital inflows were also supporting a rebuilding of foreign exchange reserves with an expectation of gross liquid foreign exchange reserves to hit 11 5 billion by june 2020 from 7 2 billion in june 2019 one of the key credit weaknesses said fitch was in public finances the general government deficit slipped to 8 9 of gdp in fy19 from 6 5 in fy18 as revenues contracted due in part to one off factors such as lower sbp dividends and delayed telecom license renewals it said adding that general government debt rose to 84 8 of gdp due to the currency depreciation higher fiscal deficit and build up of liquidity buffers it said that the government was consolidating public finances but this would likely be a challenging exercise due to the relatively high reliance on revenues to achieve the planned adjustment fitch believes the revenue target in the fy20 budget is ambitious nevertheless the government s efforts to broaden the tax base through its tax filer documentation drive and removal of gst exemptions will contribute to stronger revenue growth in the current fiscal year it said fitch forecasts the fiscal deficit to decline to 7 9 of gdp in fy20 based on a reversal of the previous year s one off factors and revenue enhancing measures we expect expenditure to rise particularly as interest servicing costs increase sharply on the back of higher interest rates we project interest payments general government revenues of 45 in fy20 it added per the credit rating agency general government debt to gdp is predicted to fall to about 80 by end fy21 due to faster nominal gdp growth and fiscal consolidation however it said tighter macroeconomic policies were slowing gdp growth which fitch forecasts at 2 8 in fy20 from 3 3 in fy19 we expect growth to recover gradually to 3 4 by fy21 inflation has also continued to rise sharply from the cost pass through of the currency depreciation and increases in energy tariffs fitch forecasts inflation to average 11 3 in fy20 compared with 6 8 in fy19 it said improvements to the business and security environment could further support the growth outlook noted fitch it said that while domestic security had improved international perceptions of security risks and geopolitical tensions with neighboring countries weigh on investor sentiment the government has also made progress on business reforms reflected in the country s move from 136th to 108th in the world bank s latest ease of doing business survey it added however the credit rating warned pakistan s rating was constrained by structural weaknesses reflected in weak development and governance indicators governance quality is also low in pakistan with a world bank governance indicator score in the 22nd percentile while the b median is in the 38th percentile it said
cnn while the new spending programs sen bernie sanders has proposed in his presidential campaign would at least double federal spending over the next decade he has provided little detail about how he would implement or finance such a massive increase the vermont independent s agenda represents an expansion of government s cost and size unprecedented since world war ii according to estimates from his own website and projections by a wide variety of fiscal experts sanders plan though all of its costs cannot be precisely quantified would increase government spending as a share of the economy far more than the new deal under president franklin roosevelt the great society under lyndon johnson or the agenda proposed by any recent democratic presidential nominee including liberal george mcgovern in 1972 according to a historical analysis shared with cnn by larry summers the former chief white house economic adviser for barack obama and treasury secretary for bill clinton sanders plan would also increase the size of government far more than any modern republican president including ronald reagan has sought to cut it summers analysis concluded on the spending side this is far more radical than all previous presidencies on either the right or the left summers said in an interview the sanders spending increase is roughly 2 5 times the size of the new deal and the estimated fiscal impact of george mcgovern s campaign proposals this is six times as large of a growth of government than any of the ronald reagan dismemberments we are in a kind of new era of radical proposal maya macguineas president of the bipartisan committee for a responsible federal budget a nonprofit group that advocates reducing federal deficits also says sanders agenda would at least double federal spending we are literally talking about increases in government spending that would double the size of government as a share of gross domestic product says macguineas whose group is completing a detailed analysis of the democratic candidates agendas she added it is remarkable how little attention such a huge change has gotten exact cost projections on all of sanders proposals aren t available in part because he hasn t fully fleshed out some of the ideas he s embraced such as universal pre k and child care but a wide variety of estimates put the likely cost of the single payer health care plan he has endorsed around 30 trillion or more over the next decade depending on the estimates used including projections from his own campaign the other elements of the sanders agenda ranging from his green new deal to the cancellation of all student debt to a guaranteed federal jobs program that has received almost no scrutiny could cost about as much or even more than the single payer plan that would potentially bring his 10 year total for new spending to around 60 trillion or more by comparison the congressional budget office projects that over the next decade the federal government will spend almost exactly 52 trillion on all existing programs from the defense department to social security and medicare washington will spend nearly another 6 trillion on interest payments on the federal debt bringing total projected federal expenditures to just under 58 trillion for the next 10 years grading on a curve i think if the price tag for the sanders agenda was known voters would blanch even democratic primary voters would blanch said jim kessler executive vice president for policy at third way a centrist democratic group the truth of the matter is in primary elections both in 2016 and so far in this one he s allowed to skate he gets graded on a curve but if he were the nominee the curve is over the republicans will spend a billion dollars picking apart every one of his plans cnn correspondent abby phillip asked sanders about the estimates that his agenda would at least double spending at tuesday s debate in iowa co sponsored by cnn and the des moines register in response he only made a case for his single payer health care plan and did not address the larger question of financing such an increase in government spending beyond insisting our plan wouldn t bankrupt the country and in fact it would much improve the well being of working class families and the middle class multiple officials at sanders campaign did not respond to requests for comments on the scope of his agenda or their own estimates of its cost in an interview earlier this year one top sanders aide said the candidate s proposed cumulative increase in government s size is not something we are discussing in the scope of the campaign the sheer size of sanders spending agenda dwarfs the proposed tax increases he has offered to pay for it economists across the ideological spectrum agree brian riedl a former senate republican budget aide who s now a senior fellow at the conservative manhattan institute has calculated that at most sanders existing proposals to raise taxes on the wealthy wall street and corporations would raise about 23 trillion over the next decade there is nowhere near enough resources that you can credibly collect to pay for spending of this size agrees macguineas when you are talking about a doubling in the size of the government you are talking about significant tax increases on the middle class to give a sense of the magnitude of the revenue challenge the sanders plan would create the cbo projects the total amount the federal government will collect over the next decade from the personal income tax is 23 2 trillion that means sanders is already proposing to raise additional taxes equal to the total expected receipts from the personal income tax and yet would still be tens of trillions of dollars short of covering the price tag for his agenda we are in uncharted territory going back to and beyond mcgovern in terms of soak the rich approaches to taxation says summers cost to the economy at various points sanders and his supporters have responded to concerns about the cost of his plans by arguing that single payer health care will save on total health care costs for average families by eliminating copayments deductibles and premiums that sanders will save money by cutting defense spending that spending in areas such as universal early childhood education or free public higher education will generate more benefits than costs for society by improving the productivity of the workforce and that the overall agenda will accelerate economic growth to a point that makes the cost easier for the economy to absorb jeff weaver sanders senior campaign adviser said in an earlier interview that the senator s proposed spending replicates the kinds of government investments that earlier generations supported to grow the economy more quickly if you look at the investment in the interstate highway system and the economic efficiencies it created it was incredible weaver said it was a huge investment up front but the economic benefits are incalculable yet summers is one of many economists even in democratic ranks who say that increasing government spending as far and as fast as sanders is proposing while imposing tax increases that are unprecedented in peacetime even as they fall short of covering his programs cost carries enormous risk and uncertainty for the economy mark zandi the chief economist at moody s analytics also says that while sanders goals are admirable such a large package of new spending and taxes would carry a substantial economic cost like the other analysts zandi calculates that sanders plan would roughly double federal spending while his taxes would cover only about 40 45 of his new costs producing a significant long term increase in federal debt the economy s long term growth would likely be somewhat diminished by these policies said zandi who has provided economic analysis for presidential candidates in both parties including hillary clinton barack obama and john mccain most significantly they would raise businesses cost of capital reduce investment and thus weigh on productivity and overall economic growth zandi said that while sanders deserved credit for stretching the political debate and focusing attention on the holes in the social safety net the overall impact of the vermont senator s plan could be to reduce annual economic growth by about a quarter of a percentage point that s a big deal over time zandi said that is going from 2 growth to 1 ¾ growth over a period of a generation that would make it harder to provide for a lot of the things he wants to provide costing out the plan the congressional budget office the most respected source of estimates on the impact of spending and taxing proposals does not score the proposals of presidential candidates so there is inevitably divergence on the potential costs of sanders ideas but a broad framework of the potential price tag is available from an assortment of outside estimates and his campaign s projections and it points to roughly a doubling in government s size among the most expensive elements of the sanders plan are his single payer health care plan which would replace all private health insurance with a government run program the center left urban institute estimated last year that such a plan would increase federal spending on health care by about 34 trillion over the next decade an estimate in line with projections by the rand corp and other analysts sanders green new deal proposal to end the nation s reliance on fossil fuels will cost 16 3 trillion over the next decade according to the campaign s calculations sanders says on his website that he will spend 2 5 trillion over the next decade to build 10 million more units of affordable housing sanders has endorsed proposals to spend 1 trillion over the next decade on improving the nation s infrastructure sanders has proposed to eliminate tuition and fees at all public colleges and universities and to pay off all 1 6 trillion in student debt sanders puts the 10 year cost of tuition free public college at 480 billion though other estimates are somewhat higher that would bring the cost of his higher education agenda to slightly above 2 trillion sanders has proposed an array of increases in federal spending on k 12 including a guaranteed 60 000 minimum salary for all teachers that would likely cost slightly more than 1 trillion over a decade sanders website also says he supports universal preschool for 3 and 4 year olds as well as universal child care support in a 2016 analysis of sanders program macguineas group put the 10 year cost of that proposal at 350 billion sanders plan to raise social security benefits would cost about 275 billion over a decade macguineas group has calculated riedl puts the cost much higher in his estimates the biggest uncertainties there is also substantial variance in the estimates of the cost of two other big components of the sanders agenda sanders has endorsed a new program of paid medical and family leave for private sector workers funded by an expansion of the payroll tax estimates on the cost of this plan have varied from about 300 billion over 10 years to as much as 2 trillion largely because of widely varying projections about how many workers would use it but the biggest uncertainty in the overall sanders plan concerns a proposal that could be its most expensive component apart from the single payer plan but that paradoxically has received almost no attention in the 2020 presidential campaign on his campaign website sanders pledges to enact a federal jobs guarantee to ensure that everyone is guaranteed a stable job that pays a living wage that is an extraordinarily expansive and expensive promise a 2018 paper commissioned for the full employment project at the liberal center on budget and policy priorities calculated that it would cost washington 56 000 including benefits and administrative costs for each full time year round job it creates under such a plan using that figure and assuming a 4 annual increase in costs riedl calculated that providing federal jobs to the roughly 11 million americans who are either unemployed or out of the workforce but still desiring to work would cost around 7 5 trillion over 10 years one prominent liberal budget analyst who asked not to be identified considers that figure broadly accurate though the total price tag might be reduced somewhat by jobs created under other sanders initiatives such as his clean energy plan the uncertainty enters because such a plan could prove attractive to millions more americans in low wage jobs especially if it offers good benefits and pay of 15 an hour the figure sanders wants to establish as a federal minimum wage if millions of them seek to join such a plan its cost would expand enormously it s by assuming very broad participation in a guaranteed jobs program as well as by adopting higher end estimates for several of sanders other proposals that riedl puts the total price for the senator s agenda at 97 5 trillion over the next decade other experts such as macguineas says that figure is likely way too high and riedl acknowledges it may represent an extreme case scenario on the other hand the listing above doesn t include all of sanders spending plans he s proposed for instance canceling all 81 billion in overdue medical debt riedl says that even the most conservative estimates of the sanders agenda represent a kind of fantasy land approach to budgeting when you are discussing whether it is 70 or 80 or 90 trillion it s like trying to discuss the details of where i would go on my honeymoon with kate upton he said a new peacetime high at the least such an increase in federal spending has only a single precedent in modern american history the height of world war ii measured as a share of the gross domestic product federal spending grew from 9 6 in 1940 to its peak of 42 7 in 1944 according to federal statistics during the new deal the biggest 20th century peacetime increase federal spending grew by almost 8 percentage points as a share of gdp according to summers calculations it is not possible to calculate candidates spending proposals with nearly as much precision as actual government expenditures but summers has formulated general estimates of the magnitude for earlier democratic nominees and the party s current field of contenders of the past three democratic presidential nominees john kerry in 2004 and hillary clinton in 2016 proposed spending increases equal to around half a percentage point of the economy while obama in 2008 proposed spending an amount something over 1 percentage point summers calculated this year he broadly estimates former vice president joe biden is proposing spending increases probably equivalent to roughly 1 5 of the economy pete buttigieg roughly 2 and sen elizabeth warren an amount equal to about 12 sanders laps all of them as well as the new deal precedent even a very conservative 50 trillion 10 year cost for sanders plan would translate into a roughly 20 percentage point increase in federal spending relative to the economy according to the calculations by summers who also once served as chief economist at the world bank as zandi notes the sanders spending increase measured as a percentage of the economy would likely be even greater if his proposals slow economic growth measured as a share of the economy then sanders is proposing spending increases about 15 times larger than obama ran on in 2008 and roughly 30 times as large as clinton s in 2016 sanders plans to pay for agenda moreover summers has calculated the largest tax increase approved during world war ii the 1942 revenue act increased federal tax collections by an amount equal to just about 5 of the total economy that was the biggest one time tax increase in modern times the tax surcharges approved for the korean and vietnam wars each collected revenue equal to about 1 5 of gdp and the deficit reduction tax plans approved under george h w bush and bill clinton in the early 1990s each raised about one third that amount summers hasn t calculated the total price tag for sanders tax proposals but he has broadly projected that the tax proposals put forward by warren would raise taxes by an amount likely exceeding 10 of the total economy far more than any of these earlier examples sanders tax plans are at least as aggressive as hers for instance his proposed wealth tax on large fortunes is designed to raise more than 4 trillion over the next decade about twice as much as warren expects her comparable plan to collect yet even if that proposal raises the 4 3 trillion that sanders advisers project it pales beside the cost of his spending plans under any projections likewise while sanders proposes raising the top marginal income tax rate to 52 for the highest earners and increasing income taxes on the affluent in other ways by his own forecast that would raise slightly less than 2 trillion over the next decade other sanders proposals such as applying the social security payroll tax to annual incomes over 250 000 rescinding the trump tax cuts and imposing an array of other new taxes on corporations might collect another 4 trillion over 10 years he would raise about 4 trillion more by imposing an income based premium on businesses for his health care plan which would essentially offset their savings from no longer providing insurance to their workers all of this combined still leaves him way short of the estimated cost of his proposals the limits on government s capacity to raise money from the wealthy and business even under proposals as aggressive as sanders is why experts such as macguineas say it is not possible to come close to funding the senator s spending agenda without either massively increasing the federal debt or raising middle class taxes there is no question that any of these big universal programs will need middle class taxes to be fully paid for she says like hillary clinton in 2016 the other democratic presidential candidates to this point have chosen not to press sanders on the cumulative cost of his agenda or how he could pay for it without substantially taxing the middle class kessler says that decision is somewhat understandable for each candidate given that in crowded primaries both of the candidates in any dispute often lose support but kessler is one of many centrist democrats who fear the collective implications for the party could be catastrophic if sanders wins the nomination without being forced to develop a convincing case for increasing federal spending so much or explaining how he would pay for it that he believes could expose democrats to the risk of replicating the landslide defeats suffered by mcgovern in 1972 or walter mondale in 1984 there is no history that shows americans are willing to vote for an agenda like the sanders agenda kessler said republicans will make an estimate of how much taxes will need to go up in order to pay for it and he will not have an answer because most of his proposals are paper thin and he has not figured out a way to do it and we will have a repeat of 1972 or 1984 if kessler is right for democrats that would be the most costly implication of all for sanders historically ambitious and expensive

the market seems to be tiptoeing into earnings season with a bit of caution that s understandable given the predictions for an overall decline in earnings growth heading into this earnings season which investors are likely to watch closely because corporate profits drive the market over the long term investors might not be too happy with current expectations s p capital iq consensus estimates were showing that q4 s p 500 earnings per share will decline 2 from the prior year investment research firm cfra said in a monday note but there may be a silver lining the third quarter of 2019 was the 31st quarter in a row where the reported eps change beat the estimated eps change cfra noted adding that in those 31 quarters actual results beat forecasts by an average of 3 8 percentage points if history repeats itself investors could be looking at q4 earnings performance of closer to a 2 gain than a 2 decline the research firm said remember the boilerplate message about past performance and future results but it s not just the numbers to pay attention to earnings season is also a great time to hear from corporate executives on their outlooks this season investors will probably be tuning in to see if executives have anything to say about their outlooks for the global trade environment interest rates and of course their own company specific guidance on sales and earnings consumer prices rise in economic news this morning the labor department s consumer price index came is as expected for december showing a month on month 0 2 rise which marked a moderation from the prior reading of a 0 3 gain the core cpi figure which strips out volatile food and energy also eased rising just 0 1 in december from a prior rise of 0 2 this morning s numbers mean both the headline number and the core figure are up 2 3 on a yearly basis in november cpi rose to 2 1 and core cpi was at 2 3 those figures were a bit ahead of the fed s 2 inflation target but they didn t seem to point to runaway inflation that would invite a rate hike also that inflation target is for the fed s preferred inflation gauge the personal consumption expenditures price index which has been running well below that target the latest yearly core reading for the pce price index showed a 1 6 gain as boston fed president eric rosengren noted in a speech yesterday lack of inflationary pressure has been a justification for the central bank s accomodative monetary policy even though the economic recovery is still going and unemployment is historically low see more from rosengren s speech below bank earnings in focus of course the financials sectors is one place in the market that is particularly attuned to interest rates as the curve of short to long term rates has a big effect on bank margins so it s perhaps fitting that the inflation data come out the same day that major banks report earnings jpmorgan chase co jpm citigroup inc c and wells fargo co wfc reported this morning and other big banks bank of america corp bac goldman sachs group inc gs and morgan stanley ms are expected to open their books later in the week jpm beat wall street expectations on its top and bottom lines helped by a jump in trading revenue bond trading revenue in particular rose more than 80 to keep things in perspective however that s a big rise from a low number a year ago fixed income trading also helped c which reported earnings and revenue that also beat analyst expectations despite multiple headwinds a flattish but steepening a bit recently yield curve trade disputes and the stiffer regulation that resulted from the 2008 09 financial crisis these big banks have kept finding ways to muddle through it s a nice testament to their discipline with expenses it was a different story for wfc however as earnings and revenue missed expectations as fallout from the 2016 fake account scandal continued and low interest rates contributed to falling net interest income monday wrap up perhaps some excitement about a potentially better than expected earnings season helped boost wall street sentiment on monday when the three main u s indices all had a solid day and the s p 500 index spx and the nasdaq composite comp closed at record highs on the trade front news reports that the united states would no longer labeling china as a currency manipulator helped boost sentiment ahead of this week s expected signing of a phase one trade deal the deescalation of trade tensions has been a major boon for stocks recently helping u s indices hit a string of record highs of course if the interim trade deal which is expected to lower duties on some goods from china and see china increase purchases of u s farm products does get signed this week that doesn t mean the trade dispute between the world s two largest economies is over a lack of escalation in the middle east also seemed to contribute to the risk on mood on wall street on monday with the positive sentiment in equities it probably wasn t too much of a surprise to see gold prices lose ground and demand for u s government debt wane wall street s main fear gauge the cboe volatility index vix also moved lower will risks remain contained with this morning s inflation data it might be helpful to highlight some of boston fed president eric rosengren s speech from yesterday he said central bankers don t have much historical experience with interest rates running low while unemployment is at historical lows in such an environment rosengren sees a few potential risks but if these risks remain contained my view is we will likely have another year of good economic outcomes this morning s inflation number may bolster such a view that in the absence of runaway inflation there s no pressing mandate to turn hawkish watch the labor market right now the economy is doing pretty well and inflation is tame with the exception of the relatively small manufacturing sector you might even be able to say we re in or nearing another goldilocks period where growth isn t too hot or too cold so what are some of the risks rosengren is worried about one of them is that inflation might pick up if the labor market tightens to unsustainable levels perhaps depending on how much firms absorb rising labor costs but again the evidence of impending problematic inflation at least in the headline number is lacking and real estate also low interest rates could lead to higher risk taking in search of yield increasing asset prices to unsustainable levels and threatening financial stability rosengren called out the real estate sector as particularly worth watching in this scenario it is important to see and understand the risk that sustained low interest rates could place more pressure on real estate asset prices through reach for yield behavior a scenario that preceded the 1990 and 2007 recessions he said information from tda is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of

by mike treen january 14 2020 links international journal of socialist renewal today for the first time in half a century there is a wave of revolt sweeping the world that seems pregnant with revolutionary possibilities that may finally allow working people to help lead humanity and the planet we exist on out of the hell hole that capitalism has created for us i lived through the 1960s and 70s during a similar period of challenge and change it filled me with hope for the future of humanity progressive change seemed inevitable working people expanded their rights and living standards access to health care education and welfare became expanded women maori gays and other oppressed peoples found their voices to challenge discrimination and seek liberation the institutions working people could use to empower themselves like the trade unions seemed to get stronger active and more democratic parties that claimed to represent us became more progressive in their outlook internationally the ruling elites were frightened in response they launched a full scale ideological political and social counter revolution that swept away or corrupted many of the gains that had been made led by the then uk prime minister margaret thatcher and us president ronald reagan the right wing wave swept the world rogernomics and ruthanasia in new zealand we saw the imposition of rogernomics of ruthanasia these policies of named after the labour party finance minister roger douglas and national party finance minister ruth richardson saw the imposition of so called free market policies and privatisation a deep economic recession in the late 1980s and early 1990s ensued and help reintroduce mass unemployment not seen since the 1930s unions were stripped of legal rights and beaten down workers living standards were gutted real wages were decreased most of us lost penal rates for weekend work and overtime full time work got replaced with zero hour contracts for many benefit values were slashed ever increasing debt became a tool for further exploitation there was tremendous disorientation because the process was begun by our party the labour party in the 1980s and many of our union leaders told us we couldn t resist union membership collapsed in the private sector from 50 to just 10 and hasn t recovered yet most working people lost confidence in their existing structures strike action declined from around 150 000 days a year in the 1970s and 80s to almost non existence by the mid 1990s this is changing significantly today with a major upsurge in strike action over the last couple of years it seems apparent that today s generation does not carry the weight of past defeats on their shoulders and there is a renewed confidence to simply say enough is enough and have a go at changing the world they are living in nurses and teachers waged strikes of a breadth and depth not seen in decades nurses discovered their union was a bit rusty and have tried to bring about the changes that are needed to make it more effective in future battles first union has conducted successful living wage campaigns across a range of major retail chains and lifted workers wages significantly unite union lead a fight against zero hour contracts in 2015 and they were outlawed in a unanimous vote in parliament we are preparing a living wage for fast food workers campaign in 2020 as well unite has helped successfully lead a fight to get several billion dollars in holiday pay stolen from workers over the last decade or so paid back capitalist crisis of overproduction internationally the free market fundamentalism that was supposed to liberate capitalism from the shackles of the state has simply ended in another massive capitalist crisis of overproduction in 2008 9 that crisis required a bailout of the elites and their financial and productive system to the value trillions of dollars money was printed and handed out to the class of parasites who created the problem that handout is now being paid for by working people austerity and economic stagnation grips most of the advanced capitalist world inequality has since simply deepened the adage that the rich get richer while the poor get poorer has never been truer inequality within and between nations has been driven up to levels not seen before today a few billionaires control as much wealth as half the rest of the world s population the wealthiest nations also sought to reimpose imperialist dominance over the so called third world nations in the colonial and semi colonial world especially if they were sitting on any reserves of oil through war if necessary elites in the third world who collaborated with their imperial masters were promoted against those who sought national independence or third world unity systems of divide and rule remained the empire s tool of choice international fightback the international fightback we are seeing today is broader and deeper than anything we have seen since the 1960s it completely rejects the existing order of economic stagnation mass poverty homelessness debt bondage and inequality everywhere it is being led by this new generation it is a genuine youth rebellion many don t seem to have a centralised organisational structure most are not led by traditional left parties indigenous voices and women are often in the lead of these protests let s look at a few of these happening right now in iraq tens of thousands of young people have been demanding the end to the sectarian system of governance imposed by the united states after the iraq war in lebanon the sectarian systems imposed by french colonial rule are also under attack in sudan a mass protests erupted on december 19 last year and have continued throughout 2019 they brought down a decrepit dictator in april and are still trying to impose a new representative government in algeria protests dubbed revolution of smiles began in february and have continued through to today following fraudulent new elections called by the regime chile has seen almost continuous mass mobilisations and general strikes since high school students rebelled against increased fares in its subway system on october 18 in ecuador a series of protests since october 1 against imf imposed austerity measures including fuel price hikes has led the government to move its offices from the capital quito colombia has witnessed the revival of mass protests and general strikes this year as the country emerges from decades of authoritarian rule by the us supported right wing military and political elites and their drug cartel friends new forms of people s power are being discovered puerto rico experienced mass protests and a general strike that forced the governors resignation haiti has seen continuous protests for the past year to oust their corrupt and authoritarian regime imposed by the us mass student protests have begun in indonesia against corruption and reactionary laws in the new penal code including outlawing sex outside marriage hong kong has seen a sustained wave of protests that led to supporters of more democracy for the chinese city winning most seats on the elected assembly what has been interesting has also been the use of social media as a tool for organising including mass voting on proposals for the movement the last few weeks have seen new waves of protests in guinea peru kazakhstan cameroon egypt india pakistan catalonia in many countries these are protests against the system it doesn t necessarily matter if there is an elected government or not chile iraq lebanon are not dictatorships in that sense but the people on the streets want a fundamental change to the way their societies are organised in chile this ended up focussing on the need for a new constituent assembly to rewrite chile s constitution which had been bequeathed from the transition from a military dictatorship this method was also used in venezuela as a mechanism to initiate a process of radical change in 1999 after hugo chavez won the presidential election and again in 2017 to defend against the empire s stool pigeons inside the country being used to foment a coup in many protests new forms of mass decision people s assemblies and new forms of popular power are being experimented with advanced capitalist world the working class in the advanced capitalist countries is also getting more restive the us has seen the highest number of workers on strike since the 1980s a fuel price rise in france led to a million strong online petition and then the eruption of weekly protests from november 2018 by thousands of people donning yellow vests this has now been joined by a broader working class revolt and a prolonged general strike against attempts to cut pensions the uk has been engulfed in a political crisis for the last few years as people used a referendum over leaving europe as a means to protest the destruction of working class communities across britain as a consequence of the anti working class policies adopted by both conservative and labour party led governments the working class used the chance to elect a genuine socialist jeremy corbyn as leader of the labour party in 2015 and hundreds of thousands joined the party to vote for him he crushed the opposition with a 59 vote share in a democratic one person one vote electoral system however he has been undermined and betrayed by a majority of labour mps who were selected during the period of betrayal of party principles by the then leader tony blair this included forcing the country into a hugely unpopular war against iraq which corbyn opposed these mps demanded a new election of the party leader in 2016 which corbyn won with 61 of the vote uk election results the ruling class and their media attack dogs have treated corbyn s leadership of the party as an existential threat to their power and privileges labour s share of the vote under corbyn despite the sabotage from within went to 40 percent in 2017 compared to only 29 in 2010 and 30 in 2015 before corbyn was elected this was one of the biggest surges in uk electoral history it was the highest percentage won by labour since 1992 the right wing of the labour party was openly disappointed and renewed their attacks on corbyn by way of thanks in the 2017 election labour promised to respect the vote to leave europe and simply negotiate the best terms for working people unfortunately this advance in electoral support was largely reversed in the recent election with a drop to 32 2 this came about because the right and centre of the party locked corbyn into a position of supporting a second referendum on brexit leaving the european union this was seen by many labour supporters who supported leave as an attempt to overturn the democratic decision already made many voted tory or the brexit party to ensure the decision was respected the working class is trying to reclaim the labour party as an instrument of struggle to advance their interests but they are discovering there remains much work to be done for this to be successful one can only hope the corbyn wing of the party can win the next leadership election in the new year to continue the process of transformation that will require patient work in the north of england on the ground alongside people in their daily struggles for survival to win the trust of working people again it will also require the removal of the blairite traitors who remain as mps by genuine working class fighters in most of the rest of europe the old social democratic parties have simply become tools of the system and have subordinated themselves to capitalism rather than challenge it this has often led to them being reduced to being minor parties in the electoral system germany france greece many places have seen new left wing parties emerge to challenge the status quo left party in germany podemos in spain syriza in greece but they still seem committed to merely getting elected to modify the system for the better rather than seeking a transformational change but today in the context of a climate emergency extreme inequality and permanent economic stagnation and austerity in most of the capitalist world this is not a way forward for the planet or working people where progressive left wing governments have been elected they have come under unrelenting pressure from the capitalist world system which no country can be completely free from in some cases they surrender to that pressure and betray their supporters that was true in greece under the supposedly left wing syriza government which was recently thrown out of office in an election pink tide in latin america latin america has seen the biggest number of left wing governments elected brazil ecuador bolivia venezuela nicaragua el salvador paraguay honduras uruguay argentina it was dubbed the pink tide these governments were all aided by a commodities boom in the 2000s that gave them some money for more redistributive policies that could attack the entrenched poverty but the local ruling classes and their backers from the us empire have been unrelenting in their opposition nearly every elected government was driven out of office through ultimate election defeats uruguay el salvador chile argentina or a military coup bolivia honduras or a combination of both paraguay ecuador brazil argentina has now just gone back to a more centre left president and mexico joined the pink tide phenomenon with the election of a left wing president and congress in 2018 for the first time in many decades so far venezuela has survived all attempts to overthrow the elected government this is despite the collapse of oil prices on which they had depended for much of their social spending and the us imperialist imposed blockade and repeated coup attempts this economic social and political war against venezuela has created huge hardships for the people but they stubbornly refuse to surrender despite the hardship i think the revolution has survived because they went further in transforming the military a necessary first step to prevent a future coup including by the formation of a mass militia also new forms of people s power have been systematically developed rather than relying only on forms of electoral representation like an elected parliament these grass roots organisations are called communes and they combine a territorial area with the production of food and services house building and allocation and education and health provision they are governed by principles of self management and participatory democracy the process of creating these organs of popular power seems agonisingly slow from the outside but i think it is easy to underestimate the magnitude of the challenges involved i am also hopeful that the bolivian people will be able to overturn the coup in their country because they have very powerful forms of popular power based on unions of workers and cocoa growers mass indigenous peoples organisations and self organised shanty town dwellers who are battle hardened from decades of struggle they will need to neutralise or destroy the old military and police structures as they reclaim their elected organs of power and institutionalise the forms of people s power they are demonstrating on the streets today to protect the revolutionary process against future attempts to overthrow it lesson from latin america latin america offers useful lessons for those of us who are living in the advanced capitalist world as well millions of young people are already campaigning for radical measures needed to combat climate change it is becoming obvious to many that a fundamental change to the economic structure is needed capitalism a system of unrelenting growth in the pursuit of personal greed is incompatible with the earth and those of us workers and farmers who produce the wealth the grotesque inequality that is an inevitable result of this system must be eliminated there is a mass discussion taking place on the type of measures needed to protect working people while we transform the way we produce the food and goods necessary for a rich life in the us it is called the green new deal in the uk labour party it was dubbed the green industrial revolution the problem is that the vast majority of people today live lives as atomised consumers we don t think and act collectively in our daily lives we don t have the tools to collectively solve the problems we face this is a capitalist form of citizenship we are allowed to vote every few years but usually not for any choices that would change things fundamentally increasingly people don t bother taking part in elections certainly this is true at the local level building people s power at a local level in new zealand local councils have no real power by law they have to contract out the provision of most services to private profit companies councils used to own the public transport system rubbish collection agencies road and sewage system repairs my dad was a council drainlayer we are now isolated in our own homes and barely talk to our neighbours we don t know how to build or repair our homes or grow food accessing medical care housing education culture and welfare is an individual nightmare to be resolved according to our income but not a problem to be solved collectively with our neighbours to bring about the change we need in society we need a program of change like the green new deal to transform the economy create jobs provide healthy homes tackle inequality a strong union movement will be part of the decision making process but we also need a radical program to create new forms of people s power in our communities today we should be fighting to create self governing collectives chosen from among the people in community assemblies the collective should be empowered to look after all social housing in the area with tenants involved in all decisions retrofit every home to be warm and green build new social housing to eliminate homelessness use all educational facilities in an area and open schools up for the community to use for sport and culture create community owned media if all forms newspapers radio social media create community gardens and kitchens including in every school relying on food from cans and fast food joints is killing and maiming thousands of people every year through obesity diabetes and consequent blindness and limb amputations create sharing and learning centres we can learn from each other the skills for life create a community health centre responsible for delivering care to every person for no charge medical care should shift from prescribing drugs to fix people to a whole care approach proper mental health care requires the end of isolation and alienation build public transport networks cycleways cooperative electric transport solutions create cooperatives for energy production wind and solar establish community controlled education and care for the very young and elderly who decided that those tasks would be turned over to for profit companies in new zealand establish community advocates who ensure every person has access to any welfare or housing support they need no longer would people live isolated lives every old person at home or in care would be being visited or able to volunteer for useful community activities every child would be educated and immunised as a community responsibility everyone would be able to grow and eat nutritious food everyone would have access to sport culture exercise books films theatre music these collectives would also be powerful centres of resistance to any going back to the old ways of selfishness and greed that are extolled as virtues under capitalism in new zealand we have the advantage that maori have understood these principles and fought to maintain them against colonisation and corporatisation we need a radical green new deal to bring large sectors of the economy under public ownership and democratic control and transform agriculture but we also need new ways to create real power in local communities alongside powerful unions able to exercise real workers control over large corporate structures private or state that still exist many people wanting real change classify themselves as some kind of revolutionary but effectively reject the struggle for reforms of the system that would aid working people this often also means dismissing participation in the system s elected forms of representation like a parliament often these revolutionary groups fail to participate in the day to day struggles for survival of working people through their unions or community organisations dedicated to ensuring access to basic needs of survival these revolutionaries only weapon is the typewriter and printing broadsheets or blogging becomes the limit of their revolutionary activity the end result of this sort of activity is zero progress for working people the opposite approach is to limit your activity to whatever the system will permit this is the politics represented by traditional social democracy this seems to be a successful strategy only when the capitalist system is expanding rapidly unemployment is reducing workers are getting more power and the bosses feel wealthy enough to share some crumbs to keep everyone quiet this was true in europe and the us for the period after the worldwide capitalist crisis in the 1890s until world war 1 and again for several decades after the great depression of the 1930s and world war 2 it also helps if there are strong voices advocating a genuine socialist alternative that has a mass hearing among working people to put the frighteners on the capitalist class this was also true for both these periods as soon as the capitalist system starts refusing concessions traditional social democracy ends up being an enforcer of the takebacks from working people that are imposed by capitalism rather than an enabler of working class power support for social democracy then collapses in disappointment this has been the reality for social democracy across europe in japan and with some ups and downs in australasia the problem today is that capitalism seems to have entered a period of what has been dubbed by even pro capitalist economists as a period of secular stagnation the growth that has occurred in recent decades has been enabled by and greater and greater extension of credit debt to us the last world recession in 2008 9 was the worst since the great depression of the 1930s recovery from that recession only happened by maintaining and extending the massive debt balloon that hangs over the world recessions are actually capitalist crises of overproduction that is overproduction of commodities in relation to the ability to buy but it is also the over extension of credit money in relationship to real money gold that it pretends to represent a general crisis is usually triggered by the collapse of financial institutions associated with the over extension of credit and a portion of the credit money is simply wiped out to bring it back into line with the real monetary base the collapse in credit money will force the most over extended and least efficient commodity producers out of business and a recession depression ensues this is the way capitalism cleanses itself for a renewed period of growth but the more the system depends on debt and the more the system tries to stop the cleansing process proceeded as it must the less powerful is the recovery and the system remains even more exposed the next time the cyclical downturn hits there can never be a return to strong capitalist growth without another great depression and probably world war to restore the system to capitalist health that is not a solution working people can hope for working people need a strategy that can provide answers to the very real problems of surviving with dignity under capitalism that means having strong unions and parties to represent us in parliament but the solutions we put forward to get mass support for should be solutions that look to replace a system based on the pursuit of private profit with a system the empowers workers and has solutions to social problems based on collective solidarity this has become of even greater importance as it has become more and more obvious that tackling the climate crisis is only possible with a system not based on relentless growth and the pursuit of profit these policies can be put together as a plan for a green new deal to combat climate change that priorities well paid jobs public housing health care and education or all such a green new deal should include these essential features capitalist monopolies in energy transport and finance have to be brought into public ownership and control they should be subject to democratic plans drawn up by the whole community workers should have much stronger decision making powers within them all economic sectors to be made take steps needed to decarbonise the economy as much as is needed to reach zero net emissions by 2030 free and frequent public transport on electric buses and or trains in all main cities health care and education for life should be free and universally accessible welfare pensions child allowances should be universal wherever possible taxation should be on wealth before income public housing at fixed and affordable should be a right of all not just the desperately poor all workers should have a right to a job and the workweek reduced with no loss of pay to make that possible local communes should be supported for control and delivery of as many functions of the centralised state as possible including housing education health care local communes to support cooperative forms of production for food production solar and wind energy electric transport and media this green new deal would inevitably be met by the fiercest opposition from the ruling class and their paid mouthpieces it would also be met by sabotage from within the existing state institutions the police and military in the first instance ony by mobilising in our millions can we create the unions and parties with the fighting capacity to implement the programme and defeat that opposition once and for all by building a new state based on the deepest forms of democratic participation

this article is more than 4 years old getty images key takeaways jp morgan citigroup beat expectations on top bottom lines wells fargo results disappoint as scandal fallout continues headline consumer price data comes in as expected the market seems to be tiptoeing into earnings season with a bit of caution that s understandable given the predictions for an overall decline in earnings growth heading into this earnings season which investors are likely to watch closely because corporate profits drive the market over the long term investors might not be too happy with current expectations s p capital iq consensus estimates were showing that q4 s p 500 earnings per share will decline 2 from the prior year investment research firm cfra said in a monday note but there may be a silver lining the third quarter of 2019 was the 31st quarter in a row where the reported eps change beat the estimated eps change cfra noted adding that in those 31 quarters actual results beat forecasts by an average of 3 8 percentage points if history repeats itself investors could be looking at q4 earnings performance of closer to a 2 gain than a 2 decline the research firm said remember the boilerplate message about past performance and future results but it s not just the numbers to pay attention to earnings season is also a great time to hear from corporate executives on their outlooks this season investors will probably be tuning in to see if executives have anything to say about their outlooks for the global trade environment interest rates and of course their own company specific guidance on sales and earnings consumer prices rise in economic news this morning the labor department s consumer price index came is as expected for december showing a month on month 0 2 rise which marked a moderation from the prior reading of a 0 3 gain the core cpi figure which strips out volatile food and energy also eased rising just 0 1 in december from a prior rise of 0 2 this morning s numbers mean both the headline number and the core figure are up 2 3 on a yearly basis in november cpi rose to 2 1 and core cpi was at 2 3 those figures were a bit ahead of the fed s 2 inflation target but they didn t seem to point to runaway inflation that would invite a rate hike also that inflation target is for the fed s preferred inflation gauge the personal consumption expenditures price index which has been running well below that target the latest yearly core reading for the pce price index showed a 1 6 gain as boston fed president eric rosengren noted in a speech yesterday lack of inflationary pressure has been a justification for the central bank s accommodative monetary policy even though the economic recovery is still going and unemployment is historically low see more from rosengren s speech below bank earnings in focus of course the financials sectors is one place in the market that is particularly attuned to interest rates as the curve of short to long term rates has a big effect on bank margins so it s perhaps fitting that the inflation data come out the same day that major banks report earnings jp morgan jpm citigroup c and wells fargo wfc reported this morning and other big banks bank of america bac goldman sachs gs and morgan stanley ms are expected to open their books later in the week jpm beat wall street expectations on its top and bottom lines helped by a jump in trading revenue bond trading revenue in particular rose more than 80 to keep things in perspective however that s a big rise from a low number a year ago fixed income trading also helped c which reported earnings and revenue that also beat analyst expectations despite multiple headwinds a flattish but steepening a bit recently yield curve trade disputes and the stiffer regulation that resulted from the 2008 09 financial crisis these big banks have kept finding ways to muddle through it s a nice testament to their discipline around expenses it was a different story for wfc however as earnings and revenue missed expectations as fallout from the 2016 fake account scandal continued and low interest rates contributed to falling net interest income monday wrap up perhaps some excitement about a potentially better than expected earnings season helped boost wall street sentiment on monday when the three main u s indices all had a solid day and the s p 500 index spx and the nasdaq composite comp closed at record highs on the trade front news reports that the united states would no longer labeling china as a currency manipulator helped boost sentiment ahead of this week s expected signing of a phase one trade deal the deescalation of trade tensions has been a major boon for stocks recently helping u s indices hit a string of record highs of course if the interim trade deal which is expected to lower duties on some goods from china and see china increase purchases of u s farm products does get signed this week that doesn t mean the trade dispute between the world s two largest economies is over a lack of escalation in the middle east also seemed to contribute to the risk on mood on wall street on monday with the positive sentiment in equities it probably wasn t too much of a surprise to see gold prices lose ground and demand for u s government debt wane wall street s main fear gauge the cboe volatility index vix also moved lower data source cme group chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade will risks remain contained with this morning s inflation data it might be helpful to highlight some of boston fed president eric rosengren s speech from yesterday he said central bankers don t have much historical experience with interest rates running low while unemployment is at historical lows in such an environment rosengren sees a few potential risks but if these risks remain contained my view is we will likely have another year of good economic outcomes this morning s inflation number may bolster such a view that in the absence of runaway inflation there s no pressing mandate to turn hawkish watch the labor market right now the economy is doing pretty well and inflation is tame with the exception of the relatively small manufacturing sector you might even be able to say we re in or nearing another goldilocks period where growth isn t too hot or too cold so what are some of the risks rosengren is worried about one of them is that inflation might pick up if the labor market tightens to unsustainable levels perhaps depending on how much firms absorb rising labor costs but again the evidence of impending problematic inflation at least in the headline number is lacking and real estate also low interest rates could lead to higher risk taking in search of yield increasing asset prices to unsustainable levels and threatening financial stability rosengren called out the real estate sector as particularly worth watching in this scenario it is important to see and understand the risk that sustained low interest rates could place more pressure on real estate asset prices through reach for yield behavior a scenario that preceded the 1990 and 2007 recessions he said td ameritrade commentary for educational

us consumer prices rose slightly in december even as households paid more for healthcare and monthly underlying inflation slowed supporting the federal reserve s desire to keep interest rates unchanged at least through this year the weak inflation report from the labour department on tuesday came on the heels of data last week showing a moderation in job growth in december economists said these developments were flagging a sharp slowdown in domestic demand though the economy appears to have maintained a steady pace of growth in the fourth quarter it was likely supported by falling imports this is giving rise to the fear that maybe economic demand is showing early signs of hitting a new soft patch for growth that will carry into the first quarter of 2020 said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york read more the federal reserve is on the sidelines this year but that could swiftly change if overall economic demand weakens and inflation shows little sign of returning to target the labour department said its consumer price index increased 0 2 per cent last month after climbing 0 3 per cent in november the monthly increase in the cpi has been slowing since jumping 0 4 per cent in october in the 12 months through december the cpi rose 2 3 per cent that was the largest increase since october 2018 and followed a 2 1 per cent gain year on year in november the cpi accelerated 2 3 per cent in 2019 the largest rise since 2011 after increasing 1 9 per cent in 2018 economists polled by reuters had forecast the cpi would rise 0 3 per cent in december and advance 2 3 per cent on a year on year basis excluding the volatile food and energy components the cpi edged up 0 1 per cent after climbing 0 2 per cent in november the so called core cpi was up by an unrounded 0 1133 per cent last month compared to 0 2298 per cent in november underlying inflation in december was held back by declines in the costs of used cars and trucks airline tickets and household furnishing and operations which offset increases in the prices of healthcare apparel new motor vehicles recreation and motor vehicle insurance in the 12 months through december the core cpi increased 2 3 per cent the largest gain since october 2018 after rising 2 3 per cent in november for all of 2019 the core cpi gained 2 3 per cent after increasing 2 2 per cent in 2018 the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies as investors awaited the signing on wednesday of a preliminary trade deal between the united states and china a first step toward diffusing an 18 month trade war us treasury prices rose stocks on wall street were mixed the fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures pce price index for its 2 per cent inflation target the core pce price index rose 1 6 per cent on a year on year basis in november it undershot its target in the first 11 months of 2019 pce price data for december will be published later this month the us central bank last month left interest rates steady and signalled monetary policy could remain on hold this year after it reduced borrowing costs three times in 2019 minutes of the fed s december 10th 11th meeting published early this month showed policymakers generally expected inflation would eventually hit the central bank s target as the economy continued to expand and resource utilisation remained high there were however concerns among some officials that global or technology related factors were exerting downward pressure on inflation that could be difficult to overcome moderate inflation was underscored by the employment report last friday showing the increase in annual wage growth retreating below 3 0 per cent in december despite the unemployment rate holding at near a 50 year low of 3 5 per cent and a broader measure of labour market slack dropping to a record 6 7 per cent weak inflation offered no boost to consumers purchasing power with average weekly earnings slipping 0 1 per cent last month after edging up 0 1 per cent in november this could hurt consumer spending which is already slowing it is hard for the average household to keep up the spending we have seen if their spending power is going nowhere said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania in december gasoline prices advanced 2 8 per cent after rising 1 1 per cent in november food prices gained 0 2 per cent after edging up 0 1 per cent in november food consumed at home ticked up 0 1 per cent owners equivalent rent of primary residence which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home increased 0 2 per cent for a third straight month healthcare costs jumped 0 6 per cent in december after rising 0 3 per cent in the prior month they were boosted by a 2 1 per cent acceleration in prices for prescription medication consumers also paid more for hospital services and doctor visits healthcare costs surged 4 6 per cent in 2019 the largest gain since 2007

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by yoruk bahceli and john revill london zurich reuters the swiss franc hit its strongest against the euro in almost three years on tuesday after the united states added switzerland to its watchlist of currency manipulators analysts said the inclusion could discourage the swiss national bank snb from intervening to try to limit further appreciation of the franc although the swiss finance ministry said it would have no immediate consequences related stories the u s treasury department said in a semi annual report on monday it had added switzerland to a list of countries where it had concerns about currency practices accusing authorities of markedly increasing foreign exchange purchases since mid 2019 the snb has bought huge amounts of foreign currencies in recent years to dampen demand for the franc whose safe haven status attracts investors during times of uncertainty the snb denied its interventions to weaken the currency were intended to give switzerland a trading advantage citing the negative effects on inflation and its export dependent economy from a too highly valued franc the finance ministry on tuesday rejected the u s allegations and said it was not steering the franc for competitive gain switzerland s inclusion in the u s treasury s list puts it alongside countries including germany south korea and japan the only reason not to be bullish on swissie is the snb intervention and if they intervene less whether it s because of the report or their own choice the result is still the same said marie owens thomsen chief economist at geneva wealth manager indosuez if the snb doesn t combat the trend then the swissie has to appreciate she added citing the country s enormous current account surplus the euro dropped nearly 0 5 to 1 0760 francs leaving the swiss currency at its strongest since april 2017 the dollar fell 0 4 to 0 9669 francs although that was some way off the franc s 16 month high of 0 9647 on dec 31 the franc had been firmer throughout the day then gained further in european mid morning trade well after the u s watchlist s publication late on monday graphic swiss franc rallies click some analysts said switzerland s inclusion on the watchlist had been expected instead they cited general safe haven flows as driving franc strength however prices of two other popular safe havens gold and the japanese yen were down on tuesday the u s inclusion of switzerland on the list could encourage hedge funds to once again test how far they can push the franc higher before the snb intervenes more hands off the united states also encouraged the swiss authorities to publish all intervention data more frequently as well as intervening directly the snb has also imposed the world s lowest interest rates to deter investors the snb has always stressed its policy objective is ensuring price stability while taking due account of economic developments there have been some signs of a more hands off approach by the snb in recent months franc sight deposits at local banks a proxy for measuring snb interventions have fallen although this could be due to seasonal fluctuations graphic snb sight deposits have fallen in recent months indosuez s owens thomsen said it was open to doubt whether countries named by the united states were indeed manipulating their currencies if you look at the sight deposits with the snb there is no real evidence of them doing anything to curb franc strength people looking at those numbers could draw the conclusion the snb is not actively intervening whether that s related to the u s list or not is unclear she added the u s trade deficit with switzerland reached 2 3 billion in november one of the criteria for inclusion on the watchlist is a bilateral trade surplus with the united states graphic us trade deficit with switzerland click additional reporting by sujata rao writing by tommy reggiori wilkes editing by michael shields and philippa fletcher

london iran is caught in a wretched economic crisis jobs are scarce prices for food and other necessities are skyrocketing the economy is rapidly shrinking iranians are increasingly disgusted crippling sanctions imposed by the trump administration have severed iran s access to international markets decimating the economy which is now contracting at an alarming 9 5 annual rate the international monetary fund estimated oil exports were effectively zero in december according to oxford economics as the sanctions have prevented sales even though smugglers have transported unknown volumes the bleak economy appears to be tempering the willingness of iran to escalate hostilities with the united states its leaders cognizant that war could profoundly worsen national fortunes in recent months public anger over joblessness economic anxiety and corruption has emerged as a potentially existential threat to iran s hard line regime only a week ago such sentiments had been redirected by outrage over the trump administration s jan 3 killing of iran s top military commander gen qassem soleimani but protests flared anew over the weekend in tehran and then continued on monday after the government s astonishing admission that it was despite three days of denial responsible for shooting down a ukrainian jetliner the demonstrations were most pointedly an expression of contempt for the regime s cover up following its downing of the ukrainian jet which killed all 176 people on board but the fury in the streets resonated as a rebuke for broader grievances diminishing livelihoods financial anxiety and the sense that the regime is at best impotent in the face of formidable troubles inflation is running near 40 assailing consumers with sharply rising prices for food and other basic necessities more than 1 in 4 young iranians is jobless with college graduates especially short of work according to the world bank advertising the missile strikes that iran unleashed on bases in iraq last week in response to soleimani s killing appeared calibrated to enable its leaders to declare that vengeance had been secured without provoking an extreme response from president donald trump such as aerial bombing hostilities with the most powerful military on earth would make life even more punishing for ordinary iranians it would likely weaken the currency and exacerbate inflation while menacing what remains of national industry eliminating jobs and reinvigorating public pressure on the leadership conflict could threaten a run on domestic banks by sending more companies into distress iranian companies have been spared from collapse by surges of credit from banks the government controls about 70 of banking assets according to a paper by adnan mazarei a former imf deputy director and now a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in washington roughly half of all bank loans are in arrears iran s parliament has estimated many iranian companies depend on imported goods to make and sell products from machinery to steel to grain if iran s currency declines further those companies would have to pay more for such goods banks would either have to extend more loans or businesses would collapse adding to the ranks of the jobless the central bank has been financing government spending filling holes in a tattered budget to limit public ire over cuts that entails printing iranian money adding to the strains on the currency a war could prompt wealthier iranians to yank assets out of the country threatening a further decline in the currency and producing runaway inflation advertising in sum this is the unpalatable choice confronting the iranian leadership it can keep the economy going by continuing to steer credit to banks and industry adding to the risks of an eventual banking disaster and hyperinflation or it can opt for austerity that would cause immediate public suffering threatening more street demonstrations that is the specter hanging over the iranian economy mazarei said the current economic situation is not sustainable though such realities appear to be limiting iran s appetite for escalation some experts suggest that the regime s hard liners may eventually come to embrace hostilities with the united states as a means of stimulating the anemic economy cut off from international investors and markets iran has in recent years focused on forging a so called resistance economy in which the state has invested aggressively subsidizing strategic industries while seeking to substitute domestic production for imported goods that strategy has been inefficient say economists adding to the strains on iran s budget and the banking system but it appears to have raised employment hard liners might come to see a fight with iran s archenemy the united states as an opportunity to expand the resistance economy while stoking politically useful nationalist anger there will be those who will argue that we can t sustain the current situation if we don t have a war said yassamine mather a political economist at the university of oxford for the iranian government living in crisis is good it s always been good because you can blame all the economic problems on sanctions or on the foreign threat of war in the last couple of years iran has looked for adventures as a way of diverting attention from economic problems advertising how ever iran s leaders proceed experts assume that economic concerns will not be paramount iran s leaders prioritize one goal above all others their own survival if confrontation with outside powers appears promising as a means of reinforcing their hold on power the leadership may accept economic pain as a necessary cost the hard liners are willing to impoverish people to stay in power said sanam vakil deputy director of the middle east and north africa program at chatham house a research institution in london the islamic republic does not make decisions based on purely economic outcomes but iran s leaders need only survey their own region to recognize the dangers that economic distress can pose to established powers in recent months iraq and lebanon have seen furious demonstrations fueled in part by declining living standards amid corruption and abuse of power as recently as november iran s perilous economic state appeared to pose a foundational threat to the regime as the government scrambled to secure cash to finance aid for the poor and the jobless it scrapped subsidies on gasoline sending the price of fuel soaring by as much as 200 that spurred angry protests in the streets of iranian cities with demonstrators openly calling for the expulsion of president hassan rouhani that s a sign of how much pressure they are under said maya senussi a middle east expert at oxford economics in london in unleashing the drone strike that killed soleimani trump effectively relieved the leadership of that pressure undercutting the force of his own sanctions say experts advertising within iran the killing resounded as a breach of national sovereignty and evidence that the united states bore malevolent intent it muted the complaints that propelled november s demonstrations laments over rising prices accusations of corruption and economic malpractice amid the leadership replacing them with mourning for a man celebrated as a national hero a country fraught with grievances aimed directly at its senior leaders had seemingly been united in anger at the united states the killing of soleimani represents a watershed not only in terms of directing attention away from domestic problems but also rallying iranians around their flag said fawaz a gerges a professor of international relations at the london school of economics trump had supplied the iranian leadership time and space to change the conversation he added iranians were no longer consumed with the misguided and failed economic policies of the iranian regime but rather the arrogant aggression of the united states against the iranian nation but then came the government s admission that it was responsible for bringing down the ukrainian passenger jet now iran s leaders again find themselves on the wrong end of angry street demonstrations for now the regime is seeking to quash the demonstrations with riot police and admonitions to the protesters to go home but if public rage continues hard liners may resort to challenging american interests in the hopes that confrontation will force trump to negotiate a deal toward eliminating the sanctions advertising iran may threaten the passage of ships carrying oil through the strait of hormuz the passageway for more than one fifth of the world s consumption of liquid petroleum disruption there would restrict the global supply oil raising the price of the vital commodity that could sow alarm in world markets while limiting global economic growth potentially jeopardizing trump s reelection bid as the logic goes iran previously had a different pathway toward gaining relief from the sanctions under a 2015 deal forged by president barack obama the sanctions were removed in exchange for iran s verified promise to dismantle large sections of its nuclear program but when trump took office he renounced that deal and resumed sanctions the iranian leadership has courted european support for a resumption of the nuclear deal seeking to exploit divergence between europe and the united states the europeans have been unhappy about trump s renewed sanctions which have dashed the hopes of german french and italian companies that had looked to iran for expanded business opportunities whatever comes next iran s leadership is painfully aware that getting out from under the american sanctions is the only route to lifting its economy say experts the nuclear deal was intended to give iran s leaders an incentive to diminish hostility as a means of seeking liberation from the sanctions trump s abandonment of the deal effectively left them with only one means of pursuing that goal confrontation they see escalation as the only way to the negotiating table vakil said they can t capitulate and come to the negotiating table they can t compromise because that would show weakness by demonstrating that they can escalate that they are fearless they are trying to build leverage

the world markets are moving upwards amid hopes for a trade truce between china and the us an additional reason for optimism was the news that china was removed from the list of potential currency manipulators on the eve of the deal there are also reports in the press about china s promise to buy industrial and agricultural goods energy and services for a total of 200 billion during the next two years these are very significant commitments and many observers fear that china will be unduly burdened if there is no relief for exports and this could be not very easy due to the yuan the chinese yuan has been rising steadily against the greenback in recent months reaching 6 88 against the dollar due to the news of progress in the trade negotiations offsetting the weakening on the background of fears when usdcnh rose to 7 20 however as many believe the higher renminbi rate is part of the deal and the big question is how far china should go in strengthening its exchange rate in the 1980s japan was at the place of china at the moment the agreement of the world s largest central banks of that time the so called plaza accord gave rise to a robust and lasting trend of weakening the american currency to all its major competitors but for japan it was comparable to economic suicide the sharp currency appreciation turned japan into a zombie economy and turned the reaction of the currency market to the crisis upside down now japanese yen is snowballing during the economic downturn which further undermines the export oriented economy we also see that the high exchange rate has collapsed inflation which cannot be revived even by the ultra soft monetary policy of the central bank however then japan was much more politically dependent on the us than china is now this helps chinese markets grow with the yuan not to fall in response to its growth moreover a positive backdrop including an increase in mutual trade between the two largest economies and the appreciation of the chinese currency helps world markets to support risk demand while waiting for further de escalation of trade disputes in our opinion it is worth watching closely the dynamics of the currency market which may become an important indicator of future economic trends and set the tone of trading platforms so far we see a relatively cautious reaction of audusd which is considered as an indicator of asian investors sentiment the pair is still below 0 700 near the lows since 2009 besides eurusd is moving very cautiously inside the descending channel staying away from a trade truce celebration however before that it was delighted to playback the news from this front

of the banking industry this in turn translates into stable clients additional business from these satisfied clients and a strong flow of referrals also from the satisfied client base the result is a very successful compounding effect that continues to drive our growth organically and safely this model has worked well irrespective of economic and market conditions for several years let me cover a few key metrics for the year total loans outstanding were up 19 7 total deposits have grown 14 and wealth management assets have increased by 19 7 this growth in turn has led to strong financial

continues to be quite strong during the fourth quarter we had net recoveries of 1 1 million for the entire year net charge offs were only 4 6 million less than 1 basis point of average loans nonperforming assets ended the year at only 12 basis points capital remains very strong at year end our tier 1 leverage ratio was 8 39 conditions in our markets continue to be quite healthy overall our clients remain very active and our loan pipeline is strong we would note that the loan originations have some seasonality with the fourth quarter typically being a bit stronger and the first quarter somewhat slower this lower rate environment which we re operating in continues to represent a terrific opportunity to attract high quality new households particularly through our home loan refinance activities we continue to also be very successful in attracting younger generation clients through our student loan refinance and our professional loan programs during the year we added net nearly 8 000 new high quality younger households through these two programs these households represent fully 35 of our total consumer borrowing base at this point up from only 19 three years ago 2019

volume during 2019 as we have noted before refinancing continues to be a means of getting trial with new clients multi family and commercial real estate lending also performed well 2019 originations were up 13 from last year most importantly credit quality remains strong when we look at our fourth quarter originations for multi family and other commercial real estate our medium loan size was 1 5 million with a conservative loan to value ratio of 48 and strong debt service coverage ratios as always we have not and will not compromise our credit standards business banking also had a terrific year total business loans and lines outstanding were 11 6 billion at year end representing 13 of total loans outstanding a key focus for us is the growth of business loans and line commitments which

results once again demonstrate the power of our unique client service culture which fuels organic sales growth overall it was a terrific year across the franchise now i would like to turn the call over to mike roffler chief financial officer michael j roffler executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you gaye let me review the results for the year and quarter and then offer some guidance for 2020 our capital position remains very strong in october we retired 190 million of the series d 5 5 perpetual preferred stock then in december we were pleased to successfully raise 395 million of perpetual preferred stock at the historically attractive rate of 4 7 as a result of these capital actions we now expect preferred stock dividends to be approximately 15 million beginning in the second quarter of 2020 liquidity also remains strong with high quality liquid assets being 12 7 of average total assets in the fourth quarter our credit quality remains excellent as jim mentioned we had net recoveries of 1 1 million during the fourth quarter and for the entire year net charge offs were only 4 6 million less than 1 basis point of average loans during 2019 we added 62 million to our loan loss reserves to support our strong loan growth our net interest margin was 2 73 for the fourth quarter and 2 83 for the full year 2019 in line with what we discussed on our lastearnings call net interest income remains a key driver of the franchise and a reflection of our growth despite a challenging rate environment which even included a short term inversion of the yield curve for part of the year net interest income increased 10 5 during 2019 the growth in net interest income is the result of our average earning assets being up a very strong 15 net interest income growth again demonstrates the power of our client service focus model to thrive in varying economic and interest rate environments our efficiency ratio was 63 7 for the fourth quarter and 64 2 for the full year 2019 we are particularly pleased with this given the continued high level of client service and our ongoing investment in the franchise including infrastructure now let me provide some guidance for the full year 2020 loan growth is expected to be in the mid teens our net interest margin is expected to be in the range of 2 65 to 2 75 which assumes an unchanged fed funds rate throughout 2020 assuming the present shape of the yield curve and competitive dynamics we currently expect to operate in the middle to lower half of that range the efficiency ratio is expected to be in the range of 63 5 to 64 5 as a reminder our first quarter efficiency ratio is typically higher due to the seasonal impact of payroll taxes and benefits with respect to income taxes the full year tax rate is expected to be 20 to 21 the tax rate in the first half of 2020 is expected to be a little lower due to the anticipated exercise of stock options that predominantly expire on july 1 2020 overall it was a very strong year that speaks to the sustainable power of our business model now i will turn the call back to jim james h herbert ii founder chairman and chief executive officer thank you gaye and mike it was a terrific year by every measure for almost 35 years our simple straightforward very client centric business model has been consistently profitable delivering exceptional client satisfaction one client at a time year in and year out is the driver of our growth we re very proud of the entire first republic team and their ability to work in such unison to deliver this exceptional client service once again we continue to maintain a culture of collaboration and remain intensely focused on supporting the success of our clients looking ahead we expect to continue delivering the same safe stable organic growth coupled with our very conservative underwriting standards and strong capital at all times now we d be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you our first question will be from steven alexopoulos with j p morgan steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst hey good morning everybody james h herbert ii founder chairman and chief executive officer good morning steve steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst my first question is for mike on nim i appreciate the full year guidance when we look at the quarter loan yields were down 11 bps in the quarter and deposit costs were down only 6 bps mike can you help us think about nim dynamics over the near term and walk us through what the new money loan yields are and what where you see deposit cost headed michael j roffler executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so the fourth quarter nim was 2 73 which was pretty close to what we had expected from our last call the loan yields we did have a rate change in late september and also october so the october rate change isn t quite fully reflected and so you ll see a little bit of a down bias in the first quarter on loan yields a few basis points whereas our funding costs all in have been relatively stable and it is reflective of making some changes with the fed move and so that s why we think a little bit lower from here as we sort of project into the first quarter on loan yields all in was about 3 30 in the fourth quarter which is slightly less than the third quarter but it seems to have stabilized a bit and maybe even trending up slightly as we look at sort of locks in process steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst okay that s helpful and then on expenses from a seasonal view you started 2019 around 65 efficiency ratio do you think that s a rough good starting point and can you help us think about expense growth in dollars like percentage growth of expenses in 2020 what are your expectations there michael j roffler executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so i would say on dollar growth probably low double digits and then you re right the first quarter efficiency typically is above our top end of range at 64 5 so i think it s been low 65 to mid 65 in the first quarter and then it trends down after that steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst okay and then just finally another quarter right of record loan originations if you look at the detail loan growth actually accelerated each quarter through 2019 when you guys look at the drivers of growth i get why you gave the mid teens guidance where you want to be conservative but is there any reason to think that well above that won t continue at least over the near term thanks james h herbert ii founder chairman and chief executive officer i think steve that 19 benefited from kind of a dual situation in the single family refi and purchase area it was a doubly good year both of those cylinders fired that s pretty unusual i think you re now more into a refinance market and the short supply of available homes for sale and the stabilizing of price increases in our markets probably augurs for a ok year on purchase steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst okay perfect thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our next question will be from john pancari with evercore partners rahul patil evercore partners analyst hi this is rahul patil on behalf of john a question regarding the seasonal impact i realize you ve talked about a 5 to 10 change in the reserve level is the bias to an upward revision of the reserve level given your balance sheet mix or is there a possibility that the reserve level might actually decline 5 to 10 as you make changes to the qualitative component of your loan loss reserve and then as a follow up can you just help us think through the day two impact of loan loss provision do you have a view on the current consensus estimates for 2020 loan loss provision of 90 million to 95 million michael j roffler executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks rahul i think on the seasonal adjustment we re finishing up the sort of audit review process but the range looks to be an increase of less than 5 at this point based on sort of our runs to date and so it s a little bit tighter than when we last spoke about it and it is just a very slight increase it looks like and that includes all reserves because we are going to have to put up a reserve on held to maturity securities now so we ll break those components out when we do our filings in terms of ongoing run rate our loan loss reserve to loans today is about 55 basis points based upon the mix of portfolio and given the runs we ve done it feels like a range of 55 basis points to 60 basis points makes sense to us and that will obviously depend on loan mix even on a go forward day two impact and so i can t really comment on sort of consensus because that will factor in your view of growth and whatnot but i think if that loan loss to allowance range is probably a good thing to look at when you re figuring that rahul patil evercore partners analyst okay that s helpful and then could you just give us some specifics of the upcoming core systems project that was announced yesterday with fis for example the scope of the project time to completion the total cost or if there is any incremental hiring that s associated with this project hafize gaye erkan president and board member sure the core conversion is well under way the planning process is well under way and on track in terms of budget and timeline and we expect to complete the core conversion by the end of 2021 a simple business model no major acquisitions relatively low number of accounts are all advantages and it is the core conversion related costs are in the efficiency guidance that we have provided 63 5 to 64 5 rahul patil evercore partners analyst okay thank you operator thank you our next question will be from ken zerbe with morgan stanley ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst i guess my first question just were there any incentive fees or any kind of other unusual items in the investment advisory line this quarter it looks like it ticked up as a percentage of assets a little bit higher than what we would have expected michael j roffler executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that s right ken there is a performance fee for one of our legacy related activities it s just under 9 million that was in the fourth quarter investment advisory fee most of that is then recorded as an expense between compensation and other expense so just a little bit of a drop to the bottom line ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst okay got it and then maybe it s a more broader question in terms of your deposit strategy just kind of curious how that s changed over the last year or so because obviously you had on average your interest bearing checking was up a lot this quarter i mean or at least in the back half of the year but cds which grew earlier in the year it looks like they were down a little bit this quarter just kind of curious more of the strategy behind that are you trying to shift more toward very short duration stuff is cd still appealing to you thanks hafize gaye erkan president and board member sure yes cds are still appealing and it continues to be a great tool in our funding tool kit because it also helps us attract great households client household relationships just year over year as we have noted in the earlier calls the barbell strategy within between checking and cd has been performing quite well and actually if you look at the year over year growth checking has been extremely strong consumer has been extremely strong in addition to business and cds were up 28 year over year roughly 2 billion in the second half especially in the fourth quarter given the short term rates have come down there has been other alternative funding sources that has been attractive from that perspective so thus there has been a slower growth in cds but we will continue to use them as a great client acquisition tool going forward james h herbert ii founder chairman and chief executive officer ken it s jim i might add one thought here which gaye referred to which is we grew deposits about 14 the average of most of the banks the banks who reported already today is running around 5 for the year so what we do is focus on a very wide range of methodologies and constituencies in the raising of the deposit funds wealth management obviously plays a role as well and business banking is very important so what gaye was really referring to is our range of focusing the total our total funding costs in fact are holding up quite well we re basically at about 84 basis points about that s about 30 lower than the three other banks that reported already today ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst got it understood and then just one last question if i could in terms of the provision expense i know you had 1 million of net recoveries and that probably contributed to the 10 million of provision so obviously that was down a fair bit but it doesn t seem to account for all of it were there any other changes in terms of how you re thinking about credit any other adjustments that would have led to sort of the unusually low provision expense this quarter michael j roffler executive vice president and chief financial officer so i think i d say one you added the 1 million dollar recovery that obviously leads to less provision and if you look at the components of growth in the quarter 70 was single family and so that s a much lower reserving rate than some of the other things like business which was i think relatively modest growth in the quarter so it s largely a mix issue ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst perfect that answers it perfectly all right thank you very much operator thank you our next question will be from brock vandervliet with ubs brock vandervliet ubs analyst great good morning could you speak about the sale of gradifi and how that might affect your expense run rate or anything else going forward and perhaps what was behind that transaction i think the press release explained some of it but wanted to review that james h herbert ii founder chairman and chief executive officer sure gradifi was actually grew significantly under our ownership but we decided that it was better placed at e trade who has a very large business to business activity and they are adding it to their service offering we expect to stay on the platform of gradifi we love the mission and the process that they have and we expect to have our employee group stay on it as well and we re promoting their student loan pay down and save up activities to our business clients it will reduce our run rate on expenses a bit somewhere in the sort of mid teen millions per year and that s obviously that obviously helps a little bit in terms of going forward brock vandervliet ubs analyst okay great and separately mike it looked to me like there was a bit of a carry trade strategy almost if you will with the increase in borrowings and an increase in investment securities it looked like that also continued to the end of the quarter could you talk about that and how you think about the balance sheet s shape michael j roffler executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i guess i would say this we found opportunistic purchases in investment portfolio and when we look at the funding strategy as gaye mentioned before between sort of cds and some of the cost of other borrowings we felt there was a good opportunity to buy in investments and we funded it with federal home loan bank in this case hafize gaye erkan president and board member and just to add we do expect looking forward the earning asset growth more in line with the mid teens just in line with the guidance that we ve given brock vandervliet ubs analyst got it ok thank you operator thank you our next question will be from casey haire with jefferies casey haire jefferies analyst thanks good morning i wanted to touch on the c i loan bucket it finished a little bit more muted than we re used to seeing i know you guys had a very strong 2018 in capital call i m just wondering what is the outlook there and are you seeing any sort of frothiness or just a lot of competition pushing too hard on price and or structure hafize gaye erkan president and board member there is still competition on the price more so than it has been earlier in the year we are very pleased when we look at the capital call line commitments year over year they re up 25 so it continues to be a very strong driver of the commitments and in terms of the outstandings the utilization rates play a role and we have seen 4 percentage point drops in the utilization which kind of creates the volatility in the outstandings but in terms of commitments and client relationship acquisition and retention and deepening we are very pleased with the outcome casey haire jefferies analyst okay great so a little bit price is under pressure but structure it s still you re not seeing anyone do anything undisciplined james h herbert ii founder chairman and chief executive officer it s jim to be clear we do see some undisciplined lending we simply don t copy it hafize gaye erkan president and board member yeah casey haire jefferies analyst got you okay and then jim just a follow up question for you on student lending as you mentioned it s i think 35 of your overall households it s entering its sixth year what sort of cross sell experience are you seeing toward the bigger ticket single family mortgage of your student loan households that have graduated toward their first home purchase how much what percentage are going with first republic or are going outside james h herbert ii founder chairman and chief executive officer the truth is we don t know if they re going outside very well we can track it a bit but it s harder to track what we do know is that we re getting a fair number of household mortgages out of the base already a couple thousand so far which we consider to be quite good because thinking about the cohort for a moment these are people that although they refinance with us still do have significant student loans outstanding number one and number two the average age in the portfolio would be about 33 34 maybe at the most and so they are entering the household purchasing age at this point so far the younger cohort tend to be purchasing homes at somewhere around 4 5 of the cohort per year so we re actually quite pleased the cross sell of other products is going very well and we appear to be the net promoter score for instance among this cohort is higher than the bank overall slightly and we are getting a fair number of products per client per household cross sell that we re very satisfied with casey haire jefferies analyst great thank you operator thank you our next question will be from aaron deer with piper sandler companies aaron deer piper sandler companies analyst hi good morning everyone i just wanted to question the growth continues to be very strong and the outlook remains quite favorable just curious obviously the preferred raised recently but given the growth expectations do you expect to continue to maybe lean on preferred or might we see a common raise come in at some point in the near term james h herbert ii founder chairman and chief executive officer well we ve always been opportunistic in the market as you know the philosophical base of first republic is to stay well capitalized at all times and possibly more to the point to stay capitalized ahead of growth so that we re funded in advance of growth aaron deer piper sandler companies analyst okay and then following up on the c i questions gaye if you said that utilization was down 4 points what is the actual number of the utilization rate at period end hafize gaye erkan president and board member so it s around mid 30s but we did make a slight adjustment to the way we calculate the utilization rate to take into account the flex amount mike is going to touch on that michael j roffler executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so we are about 35 in the fourth quarter and i think gaye referenced down 4 that was from 39 a year ago we did make some modest adjustments to total commitments lowering them for certain capital calls where a total amount is part of the loan agreement but there s some limitation until certain acts occur and you have to get future credit approval and so we just lowered commitments ever so slightly for that aaron deer piper sandler companies analyst okay so what are the total commitments at this point michael j roffler executive vice president and chief financial officer line commitments are just under 19 billion and that s a 16 increase from a year ago for business lines hafize gaye erkan president and board member yeah business line commitments and term loans together is about 24 billion and then to just do the math on the utilization it s about 2 percentage point to 3 percentage point difference between the pre recast and post recast so the new range would be around mid 30s to low 40s is kind of where we are seeing utilization when you look at the last two years with that adjustment aaron deer piper sandler companies analyst okay that s helpful thank you hafize gaye erkan president and board member sure operator thank you our next question will be from arren cyganovich with citi arren cyganovich citigroup analyst thanks just looking at the unsecured part of your loan book the student lending has obviously been growing very solid but it seems like it may have decelerated a little bit in the recent quarter is there anything in particular that s driving the unsecured loans to slow down there james h herbert ii founder chairman and chief executive officer no not really other than this last year we implemented a full range of pricing based upon how much business you do with the bank and that actually slowed down our new acquisitions slightly but it raise the quality of those that we acquired considerably so net net it s actually quite positive michael j roffler executive vice president and chief financial officer the other thing i d add is as the portfolio matures you have more and more repayment activity happening so even if we did the same numbers or slightly up each year you ve got more cash flows coming back in the portfolio like you do on any amortizing consumer portfolio arren cyganovich citigroup analyst got it okay thank you and separately the professional fees kind of jumped a bit was that related to cecl or the core conversion and how do you think about professional fees as we go out through the year michael j roffler executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so there is a little bit in there from obviously the sale of gradifi some professional fees associated with that and we have started to incur some of more core related costs it might come down just slightly but i wouldn t think a lot from here it s probably 2 million extra this quarter arren cyganovich citigroup analyst okay thank you operator thank you our next question will be from brian foran brian foran autonomous research analyst hi i was hoping to ask about two tax related issues for your customers one there s a lot of press recently around prop 13 in california and just kind of how you re thinking about that what you re hearing from borrowers if it does go forward and then two salt is back in the press and it s always hard to discern is it just anecdotes about people moving from new york to florida and things like that or is it actually having an impact so as you look across your business and talk to your borrowers has anything risen beyond those kind of one off anecdotes in terms of people migrating to lower tax states james h herbert ii founder chairman and chief executive officer i would say as a practical matter there s an increasing number of anecdotal examples but there is not a flood by number of households by any means the size of the households that are migrating are considerable and so i think the amount of dollars being shifted from the tax states to the lower tax states is increasing reasonably rapidly and it s hard to put your finger on exactly what tips people over i think the thing the press isn t speaking of is that we need to remember the demographic bubble happening among baby boomers they re arriving at their retirement age just as this is happening so it probably is accelerating what might have been a somewhat natural event anyway particularly in the florida situation for instance from the northeast things like that wyoming is obviously a beneficiary of this and it hasn t been lost on us and it s a good time to be opening there hafize gaye erkan president and board member and we just opened our yesterday we opened our palm beach gardens pbo in florida and others to follow james h herbert ii founder chairman and chief executive officer so now we have three offices in that area brian foran autonomous research analyst and then on prop 13 just kind of any thoughts on real estate impacts in california james h herbert ii founder chairman and chief executive officer i think it s too early to know the fundamental characteristic of california urban real estate is there s simply a shortage of supply brian foran autonomous research analyst thank you very much james h herbert ii founder chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question will be from lana chan with bmo capital markets lana chan bmo capital markets analyst hi thank you good morning just wondering if you could give us the spot rate for deposit at the end of the quarter i think usually you have that number for us hafize gaye erkan president and board member it s in line with the fourth quarter average high 50s lana chan bmo capital markets analyst okay and what was the new purchase money on the securities added in the fourth quarter hafize gaye erkan president and board member so the fourth quarter was around 3 25 for the year the purchases were around mid 3s and then new money for the muni is about 3 25 3 3 and then for the hqla high 2s these are all tys lana chan bmo capital markets analyst okay great and could you also give us an update in terms of i guess you mentioned it a little bit before but the planned office openings a couple more in florida and what is the new schedule for like the hudson yards and the other new openings james h herbert ii founder chairman and chief executive officer depending on the timing on hudson yards opening this year we ll be toward the end of the year we ll open several offices we re mostly this year we ll be mostly focused on new york city then as gaye went through this past year we had been focus in a broad way around the franchise in new york we will be opening sometime in the next 12 to 14 months about four offices in the hudson yards area in addition to office space in which we will have teams they will open very much toward the end of the year or the first of next but mostly the end of this year and we also have another location in two more locations in the new york city area that will be opening later in the year as well so we ve probably in the next 15 months let s say we would expect to open about six new offices in the new york city area lana chan bmo capital markets analyst okay great thanks jim operator thank you our next question will be from david chiaverini with wedbush securities david chiaverini wedbush securities analyst hi thanks wanted to touch on your single family residential outlook you mentioned about how the growth tends to be seasonally slower in the first quarter i was curious are you also seeing appetite waning for refi at this point or is it still a tailwind into the first quarter james h herbert ii founder chairman and chief executive officer i would say it s a modest tailwind it s slowed down a little bit as the rates are settling right around a little above 3 and so i would say it s a modest tailwind but mostly it s the holidays and the slowness that comes from that david chiaverini wedbush securities analyst okay and then shifting to the efficiency ratio i was curious as to the driver behind the lower guidance of 63 5 to 64 5 is gradifi the main driver here or are there any expenses or projects you re pulling back on michael j roffler executive vice president and chief financial officer nothing from a project that is sort of client that is client service focused or is going to help us continue to add and acquire households i think part of it is the team really did a great job of prioritizing and looking at where is the best place to make investments in the franchise and our infrastructure and try to be more aligned with the revenue outlook which is reflective of a slightly lower margin than we had this year and just being very disciplined and focused on where the best investments can be made to continue to serve households for the bank hafize gaye erkan president and board member and just to reinforce mike s point we continue to make investments into our infrastructure to be commensurate with the growth of the organization and we are not going to compromise when it comes to prudent expense management we re not going to compromise on safety soundness or client service excellence or culture and employee engagement so those are the core pillars we will continue to invest prudently david chiaverini wedbush securities analyst thanks for that and one last housekeeping fdic assessments i saw that jumped up in the quarter any commentary there as to whether that s a good new run rate going forward michael j roffler executive vice president and chief financial officer so it typically increases a bit given the growth in our average assets which is the biggest driver sort of your assessment basis size of the bank and so that s the main reason it would have jumped in the quarter if they asset base continues to increase you ll continue to see modest increases i would say david chiaverini wedbush securities analyst thanks very much operator thank you our next question will be from jared shaw with wells fargo securities jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst hi good morning looking at the investment fees even excluding that 9 million of incentive fee it looks like you re starting to see some growth there should we expect to see continued sort of expansion in the fee level as a percentage of aum or is where we are here in the high 50s a good level michael j roffler executive vice president and chief financial officer we think the high 50s is a good level we re happy to see it sort of stabilized and maybe even a little bit better but the high 50s is the right place to be looking back to the start of the period right so fees divided by the prior starting point jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst right and is there any of that improvement is that just general pricing improvement or is that due to an improved maybe mix with the luminous group now off the platform michael j roffler executive vice president and chief financial officer earlier this year we did have more people in fixed income that does put the fees down slightly because there is a less of a charge there but i don t think it s anything systemic or i m not sure luminous would have driven it that differently i think it s more of a stabilizing amount and i also think that growth in assets sometimes can distort a little bit depending on when you hire or when they assets come but if you look back over long periods of time sort of 56 basis points 57 basis points 58 basis points has been a pretty good range for us jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst okay that s a great color thanks and then just finally on the infrastructure investments that you referenced anything any major strategies or investments that are coming up besides the core systems or is it just more things associated around the edges with that any major projects that we should be planning as well hafize gaye erkan president and board member as you said it s mainly core and both fis and fiserv we ll continue to work with both of them they ve been great technology partners and they will continue to do so there are other lesser scope projects that we have been continuing on wire system improvements or corporates online enhancements given our business deposits to delight our clients further but in general on the expense side 63 5 to 64 5 is what encompass all these projects thank you jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst thank you operator thank you our next question will be from garrett holland with baird garrett holland robert w baird co analyst thanks for taking the questions i just had a couple related to the balance sheet s updated rate sensitivity the futures market is a bit all over the place but were we to see a fed rate cut in the back half of 2020 can you help us size the potential nim impact in that subsequent quarter and then conversely if the yield curve were to steepen say 25 basis points with no change of competition and what would be the margin benefit michael j roffler executive vice president and chief financial officer a little bit steeper yield curve to take the second part first would be a little bit beneficial and probably stabilize the margin with the one key caveat you said that competition doesn t behave differently than such move in the curve depending on how they react we obviously would follow suit because we re going to serve our clients and do the best thing for them on the one rate cut if it s in the july to september period for the year probably doesn t have a big impact because we d lose a little bit on our loan yields because about 25 of the portfolio is tied to short term rates although about 20 call it libor and prime and we have a little relief on deposits so i think it s probably a couple of basis point impact but not a very large impact lower garrett holland robert w baird co analyst that s helpful thanks for taking the questions operator thank you our next question will be from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst thanks good morning james h herbert ii founder chairman and chief executive officer good morning jon jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst yeah a quick follow up on that mike what is the message in terms of the margin trajectory i hear what you re saying on q1 but it feels like that s basically it for margin pressure once you get the asset repricing through and you re maybe signaling stability from there is that fair michael j roffler executive vice president and chief financial officer i think that as we talked about 2 65 to 2 75 for the year but we re probably in the middle to the lower part of that range so if you re down a few basis points in the first quarter there might be a couple more to go i would say jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay michael j roffler executive vice president and chief financial officer but then sort of stability in the back half of the year jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay good message on deposit costs it sounds like relatively stable is what you re thinking on deposit pricing hafize gaye erkan president and board member yeah in general around 59 and spot rate is high 50s absent any other fed moves or rate cuts that would largely stabilize here and just to bring it all together so the rate locks on the loan side are slightly lower than what we have on the books and then the deposit cost stabilizing around here thus the guidance that mike has provided slightly lower in q1 and the lower half of the 2 65 2 75 ranges for the year jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay that s helpful and then jim one for you obviously very positive numbers but i just want to ask on the npl balances jumped up a couple of quarters ago i know it sounds like it was a few bigger deals any update there that you can provide for us james h herbert ii founder chairman and chief executive officer no it s the same situation we ve got one of our larger well not large but a decent concentration that s that we ve got in nonperforming although it continues to pay current and so we don t really have any update on it at this point the good news is we re not we had we did not add anything to that list particularly in this quarter jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay all right thanks for the help operator thank you i m showing no further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back to jim herbert for closing remarks james h herbert ii founder chairman and chief executive officer thank you all very much for taking the time on the call today we

9 th annual survey on top business risks attracts record participation of 2 700 experts from over 100 countries cyber incidents have become more damaging and expensive for companies and often result in lawsuits and litigation after the event business interruption ranks second but remains a key challenge with digitalization and civil unrest creating new causes of disruption and loss of income climate change rises to third top risk while political risks and violence makes first appearance in top 10 singapore media outreach 14 january 2020 for the first time ever cyber incidents 35 of responses ranks as the most important business risk in asia pacific in the ninth allianz risk barometer 2020 relegating perennial top peril business interruption bi 34 of responses to second place the region s results mirror a global trend that has seen awareness of the cyber threat growing rapidly in recent years driven by companies increasing reliance on data and it systems and a number of high profile incidents it is a stark change from seven years ago when it did not even feature in the top 10 risks on the mind of risk managers regionally advertisement climate change 3 with 25 and political risks and violence debuting in the top 10 at 10 with 9 are the biggest climbers regionally underlining global warming and the business interruption that accompanies civil unrest as increasing concerns for companies and nations the annual survey on global business risks from allianz global corporate specialty agcs incorporates the views of a record 2 718 experts in over 100 countries including ceos risk managers brokers and insurance experts story continues for the first time cyber overtakes business interruption as the top risk for businesses in asia pacific while 2019 saw no major global cyber incidents in the vein of past events like wannacry and notpetya businesses are increasingly cognizant of the costs associated with being a victim of a cyber attack with ibm estimating the average cost of a data breach being slightly under us 4m says mark mitchell regional ceo asia pacific of agcs he added rounding up the top 3 risks in the region is climate change in a year which saw greta thunberg address the united nations climate change was a big riser having only ranked 8th in the previous edition reflecting the increased scrutiny and pressure that businesses are under to operate in a sustainable manner cyber risks continue to evolve in addition to being the top risk regionally and globally cyber incidents is among the top three risks in 80 of the countries surveyed in asia pacific with india and south korea ranking it as the top business risk businesses face the challenge of larger and more expensive data breaches an increase in ransomware and spoofing incidents as well as the prospect of privacy driven fines or litigation after any event a mega data breach involving more than one million compromised records now costs on average 42mn up 8 year on year incidents are becoming more damaging increasingly targeting large companies with sophisticated attacks and hefty extortion demands five years ago a typical ransomware demand would have been in the tens of thousands of dollars now they can be in the millions says marek stanislawski deputy global head of cyber agcs extortion demands are just one part of the picture companies can suffer major bi losses due to the unavailability of critical data systems or technology either through a technical glitch or cyber attack many incidents are the results of human error and can be mitigated by staff awareness trainings which are not yet a routine practice across companies says stanislawski business interruption an undiminished threat with new causes after seven years at the top bi drops to the second position in the allianz risk barometer however the trend for larger and more complex bi losses continues unabated causes are becoming ever more diverse ranging from fire explosion or natural catastrophes to digital supply chains or even political violence in australia the total damage and economic loss caused by wildfires from september 2019 and into 2020 is estimated to cost 110 billion businesses are also increasingly exposed to the direct or indirect impact of riots civil unrest or terrorism attacks escalating civil unrest in hong kong has resulted in property damage bi and general loss of income for both local and multinational companies as shops closed for months customers and tourists stayed away or employees couldn t access their workplace due to safety concerns the consequence is a business interruption without physical losses but high financial ones climate change brings added risk complexity climate change is a huge riser regionally jumping to third from eighth last year driven by risk management experts in countries and territories such as australia hong kong india and indonesia ongoing wildfires engulfing australia as well as severe floods in jakarta have certainly hammered home the consequences of increasingly volatile weather for businesses an increase in physical losses is the exposure businesses fear most 49 of responses as rising seas drier droughts fiercer storms and massive flooding pose threats to factories and other corporate assets as well as transport and energy links that tie supply chains together further business are concerned about operational impacts 37 such as relocation of facilities and potential market and regulatory impacts 35 and 33 companies may have to prepare for more litigation in future climate change cases targeting carbon majors have already been brought in 30 countries around the world with most cases filed in the us there is a growing awareness among companies that the negative effects of global warming above two degrees celsius will have a dramatic impact on bottom line results business operations and reputation says chris bonnet head of esg business services at agcs failure to take action will trigger regulatory action and influence decisions from customers shareholders and business partners therefore every company has to define its role stance and pace for its climate change transition and risk managers need to play a key role in this process alongside other functions global results largely mirror the region s with climate change 7 with 17 also moving up the rankings vis à vis the previous year though not as drastically as asia pacific a reflection of how the effects of global warming have been more severely felt closer to home changes in legislation and regulation 3 with 27 rounds up the top 3 globally as businesses are increasingly concerned over the us china trade war and brexit the allianz risk barometer 2020 highlights that cyber risk and climate change are two significant challenges that companies need to watch closely in the new decade says joachim müller ceo of agcs of course there are many other damage and disruption scenarios to contend with but if corporate boards and risk managers fail to address cyber and climate change risks this will likely have a critical impact on their companies operational performance financial results and reputation with key stakeholders preparing and planning for cyber and climate change risks is both a matter of competitive advantage and business resilience in the era of digitalization

sad ron davidson executive director of soy canada we ve been on the front lines of this from the beginning and we continue to be so yes we re worried though lighthizer has said the pact will be

describes it said simon lester a trade policy analyst at washington s cato institute if china is going to stop purchasing from canada for instance and purchase from the u s instead then canada probably has a wto complaint because china s measures are discriminating in favour of the u s so it s puzzling to understand how it would work in practice photo by nicolas asfouri afp via getty images a range of recent developments the u s china deal the approval of the new nafta by the u s congress and a conclusive december election that has put the united kingdom on a path to leave the european union at month s end would all seem to point to a decline in trade uncertainty over the next two years said brett house deputy chief economist at the bank of nova scotia the white house is also expected to remove china from a list of countries considered currency manipulators but with trump in power house isn t so sure we think rather than declining it s simply been capped house said that s

going to stop purchasing from canada for instance and purchase from the u s instead then canada probably has a wto complaint simon lester trade policy analyst in addition the conclusion of trade deals hasn t prevented trump from threatening tariffs on his trading partners for instance in may as mexico was preparing to pass the newly agreed nafta in its senate trump threatened to impose tariffs on all mexican imports if it didn t stem the flow of migrants over its border with the china deal somewhat settled for now phase one is also expected to include measures on forced technology transfers

subsidies advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content with an upcoming election campaign trump may opt to limit the u s

dramatic development as the killing of iran s top military commander would have kept oil prices on the boil for weeks if not months but with so much more of the black stuff coming from elsewhere these days crude prices have fallen back to pre attack levels there are several ramifications one worth thinking about is that there is no longer the guaranteed boost to gulf countries coffers and the constant threat of war will also keep foreign investors wary of lending to regional governments and companies 4 australian forest fires and global warming and tourism a swathe of australia the size of south korea is being razed by fire the toll so far 27 lives more than 1 800 homes a billion animals but that s probably a fraction of the eventual costs analysts who have done the sums expect a drag as much as 0 4 this quarter on an economy already stuck in second gear given the bushfires have consumed an area 20 times greater than a similar conflagration in 2009 the cost will dwarf the 3 billion price attached to that disaster apocalyptic images of holiday makers taking to the sea to escape flames could weigh heavy on tourism which accounts for over 3 of australia s economy a policy reaction

designation was largely symbolic the label calls for the us treasury committed to work with the imf to eliminate the unfair competitive advantage created by china s alleged actions and to consult with beijing about the matter as part of the trade deal china has also agreed to publish relevant information related to exchange rates and external balances however many economists questioned the decision

twitter while he acknowledged the large trade surplus he said economists disregard those rmb fell in response to trump s tariffs designation was blatant errant political act sobel tweeted and china expert martin chorzempa said the announcement was getting way more attention than it should because it matters only on the most superficial symbolic level mnuchin said the phase one deal is

parkdale for years says cole webber a legal aid worker with the parkdale community legal services pcls a provincially funded agency for free legal services which was itself evicted from its long time parkdale offices last year the fact of it is that the primary impediment for these corporations increasing their profits is the ongoing tenancy of working class people who live in parkdale the only

as often the street along a deadened streetscape of mostly empty storefronts drug deals happened in broad daylight addicts raged and twitched and parkdale earned another name crackdale day by day it s not hard to see parkdale as doomed from the start it was built in the late 19th century as a summer refuge for the city s wealthy with opulent brick mansions on a small bluff overlooking the water six

lake now toxic and the six lane expressway built in the 1950s along the shore ensured its squalor around the same time the province of ontario deregulated mental health care and shut down psychiatric

lived in parkdale in the 90s when it was bottoming out even then she says you could see subtle pressures of gentrification building in terms of being homogenous predictable corporate and maybe even securitized that certainly seems like the fate of toronto and without some kind of dramatic change it will be how dramatic just last month cowen says the city announced a 24bn affordable housing strategy with provincial and federal support i m not convinced even that is enough to effect the change we need she says bureaucracies walk while capital sprints by the time anything gets built eight

international food events under that banner vegandale to many was the same brutal invasion at street level that was happening in the towers just a few blocks away it was a really tumultuous moment like everything that had been happening here the past few years just burst out on to the street somasale said it shifted things for her she became more engaged in activist efforts more involved in the protest movement it was an erasure of history and an intentional one she said they wanted to change a chunk of the neighbourhood in a way that didn t benefit anybody that had lived here for years it

home because i can t even live there she says i visit every other week but it changes so fast it feels like neighbourhood amnesia a haven for the vulnerable by 2016 the last time the canadian government collected census data on paper parkdale had changed little almost 90 of its residents were renters versus less than half for the city as a whole making its 35 000 people more vulnerable to rental market swings than anywhere else more than a third lived below the poverty line 50 more than the broader city while the immigrant population had grown to almost 50 the data still showed that parkdale was very much what it had always been a haven for the vulnerable reliant on the density of social services that had long clustered there nearly half of parkdale s residents were seniors living alone often in the rooming houses now under threat of reinvestment and renovation what the data didn t pick up was how the neighbourhood had changed on street level and the three year gap between then and now might as well be a lifetime when akelius the swedish real estate juggernaut with some 8bn in global assets settled its gaze on toronto in 2011 parkdale was a low income immigrant neighbourhood but it was no longer a bleak urban sinkhole thanks to the tibetan community and the hipster incursion that the tibetans stabilising presence had drawn it was an opportunity in 2012 the firm started acquiring mid and high rise concrete slab apartment buildings in toronto by 2016 it had amassed 37 and more than 3 000 apartment units many of them were along jameson avenue which links

which typically tie annual rent increases to inflation usually less than 2 in its most recent annual report to investors akelius demonstrated its loophole when properties are modernized the rent for existing tenants can be increased by up to 9 above the guideline over a period of three years by 2014 akelius was improving things like lobbies and balconies and serving large rent increases or eviction notices en masse in 2015 when tenants many of them tibetan refugees complained of back to back annual rent increases as much as five times higher than the provincial guideline akelius spokesman ben scott in a statement to the toronto star explained that the increases were intended to subsidize costs to the company from taxes utilities and extensive renovations it s not how do we

biggest landlord with more than 20 apartment buildings was accused of starving out tenants in 2017 on unheeded maintenance requests and issuing heavy rent increases in an effort to drive out low income tenants and attract new ones current rents on new units are said to often be double those paid by longtime tenants metcap president brent merrill also speaking to the star said he had made every effort to manage maintenance requests including a tenant hotline tenants pushed back with a rent strike at 12 buildings the conflict peaked when a video emerged of merrill narrowly missing a protester with his pickup truck merrill told the toronto star he was rescuing a terrified property manager from an angry mob when the strike stretched out over two months the company agreed to reduce its above guideline rent increases to the provincially mandated levels as the rental market tightened the presence of private equity firms grew timbercreek with 10bn in assets across north america europe and asia bought several parkdale buildings in the fall of 2018 including the two hulking towers on west lodge avenue where somasale grew up tenants there had endured semi functional heat and

march dozens of hired a bus to take them to timbercreek s corporate head office in toronto to serve their new landlord with hundreds of maintenance requests and a notice of their own in a video of the event one of the protestors made clear their chief concern that the company was taking people to the landlord tenant tribunal to evict them and that internally timbercreek had likened tenant removal to putting a building through a car wash this is the dirt you re trying to wash away the protestor continued gesturing to her protest sign holding neighbours we are here to put you on notice you have no idea the neighbourhood you are messing with colleen krempulec timbercreek s executive director of marketing told the guardian that the company had evicted some tenants usually for non payment of rent but the number was small 17 in a property with more than 700 units and we re not talking about a few weeks of arrears we re talking about months and months she said in the months that followed timbercreek s acquistion krempulec said the enormity of the maintenance challenge emerged these buildings were neglected for decades she said i would say west lodge was in the worst state of repair we ve ever seen since taking ownership krempulec said the company had worked through more than 2 500 tenant maintenance requests and had replaced all eight of the buildings elevators as well as the heat and hot water systems the accusation that we re deferring maintenance to encourage people to leave nothing could be further from the truth she said it s been a challenging project there is no doubt more challenging than we had originally bargained for but we re a long term investor we re not coming in to flip the property we have a long term horizon in november 2019 starlight blackstone s canadian partner firm found itself on now familiar ground tenants angry at rent hikes they claimed were well above the guideline rate occupied its head office with a stack of unheeded maintenance demands for katrina potts who led the protest the gap between tenant and landlord was stark the office was all waterfalls and glass and luxury she said we re arguing with them over 100 200 300 a month and they ve just spent 1 72bn you have to wonder if that s a war we can win parkdale though is not the kind of place where people give up tenant groups are organized and armed with legal aid and new ideas incubate here among academics and activists the pace of change however is something none seem able to solve in 2010 kuni kamizaki then a graduate student at the university of toronto s urban planning department doing a placement at a community agency and social hub for parkdale s low income residents developed an idea he wanted to build a non profit community land trust in order to bank land and housing and rent it back to low income residents at fixed rates below market value government had long since abandoned building affordable housing itself choosing instead to subsidize rent for qualified tenants in privately owned buildings that meant public money was being used to pay off private mortgages with nothing to show for it at the end wouldn t that money be better spent paying for a permanent community asset kamizaki thought so and the trust was born in 2010 its goals seemed reasonable land values were rising but parkdale s built in buffers the towers a welter of social service agencies dilapidated housing stock made the pace seem manageable there was time when the trust finally secured seed funding and undertook a community based planning initiative it was 2015 and the landscape in parkdale had shifted intensely akelius was ensconced others had followed and were applying its techniques with ruthless efficiency and no fewer than a dozen new luxury condo developments were on the horizon everything was just happening so so fast kamizaki said big corporate investors were suddenly everywhere how could we even start to grapple with that the land trust is still up and running and can claim some small victories a community garden 15 refreshed apartments it rents to vulnerable tenants at rates well below the market rate joshua barndt the trust s development coordinator is clear eyed about what the trust can achieve in this climate and what it cannot in the face of multi billion dollar acquisitions it s not how do we stop it he said it s how do we capture some of the benefits of the changes for people who live here now how are we intentionally a part of it instead of being pushed down the river how do we ride along with it many others are

we cannot afford to be adventurous in our foreign policy harbans mukhia former professor of medieval history at jnu the hindu mukhia lists the rise of certain fascinating facets in the tsunami of protests across the country he starts by noting how all the protests are civil society s autonomous protests devoid of any organic links with any political party it is a case of people leading the political parties he writes the second trend mukhia notes is the refusal to buy the current regime s divisive hindu muslim formula he writes this formula has already fetched the national democratic alliance two terms in parliament but seems to have hit a wall mukhia also states that it is interesting that muslims are refusing to fall for the strategy of making their identity dichotomous with their indian identity the muslims have instead sought to assert their religious identity in full concert with their indian national identity by flaunting both at the same time which in any case is far truer than the one which counterposes the two he writes finally what the pan india protests have resulted in is exemplary quality of leadership displayed by students from the underprivileged social strata gurcharan das author and former ceo of proctor gamble india the times of india das begins by quoting columnist matt ridley we are living through the greatest improvement in human living standards in history people are glum because they are too caught up in the headlines of the day and don t take a long view of history he writes be it the use of the cell phones or increased forest area das counters all arguments of environmental crisis rising authoritarian leaders and the slowing economy in india he argues that more indians today have access to cooking gas toilets pucca houses and bank accounts he then goes on to cite a brookings institution report which says because india has achieved annual economic growth exceeding 7 over the last 15 years extreme poverty has declined to 5 5 he concludes by explaining that the world is divided between two ideologies that have the utmost contempt for each other furthermore how people view the world depends on whether they are angry or happy at the world das himself subscribes to the former while someone has the absolute right to be depressed or angry they should be careful not to inflict their feelings on their neighbor he states ajit ranade economist senior fellow at the takshashila institution mint ranade discusses brick by brick economic reforms suggested by the economic survey of 2015 which chip away constraints on inclusive and sustainable growth ranade contrasts these with big bang reforms or the sudden deregulation of financial markets most economic reforms in india happen only in a crisis or by stealth are usually unpredictably reversible he writes they usually face resistance from industry or trade unions not politicians which is often why they appear in the form of an executive decision rather than legislation he explains he cites the example of the electoral bond scheme that was introduced in the 2018 finance bill brick by brick reforms are based on the idea of continuity not slowness at a sustainable speed that gives reforms predictability and stability observes ranade for instance to reform india s food subsidy leakages to non farmers should be reduced and then aadhaar linked online registration should be set up for poor farmers these reforms have transformative power and are innovative since they respond to real needs concludes ranade kenneth rogoff former chief economist imf professor of economics and public policy harvard university business standard rogoff discusses the need for a global carbon tax as the world nears a point of no return regarding climate change global temperature is nearing a tipping point and limiting global warming even to 2 c would require a global carbon price of at least 75 100 per tonne of co2 more than double its current level by 2030 he explains even if europe and the us purposely stall their capitalist growth engines it still wouldn t be enough to contain global warming if emerging economies stay on their current consumption growth trajectory he explains rogoff makes two recommendations first a global tax on co2 emissions he writes that by equating the price of co2 emissions globally distortions would be eliminated second a world carbon bank would help emerging economies in asia currently the biggest contributor to co2 emissions buy in to emissions reduction despite concerns about economic growth he writes he argues that this type of system is more transparent than a carbon tax or a quota system like the one europe has instituted t v mohandas pai chairman aarin capital partners s krishnan tax consultant financial express pai and krishnan make several recommendations for simplifying the capital gains tax regime similar to the two low tax rates regime for corporate tax that was earlier introduced by the finance minister the authors detail the complexities and layers behind the current regime holding periods are different for different asset types rates are different for short term and long term gains rules for carry forward and set off are also not uniform etc ordinary taxpayers are usually confused and end up seeking professional help they explain pai and krishnan suggest an income tax rate of 10 per cent with an exemption of up to 1 lakh extended to long term capital gains ltcg from all financial assets and 15 per cent should be applicable for short term capital gains a 50 per cent tax deduction in the year of investment could incentivise investments in start up companies they add investments in listed and unlisted equity shares should be taxed similarly so that investors choose investments based on risk and reward rather than tax considerations they write ltcg in terms of immovable property should have a lower rate of 10 per cent without indexation benefit so that real estate sector appears attractive to investment they add a simple capital gains tax regime will help investors in compliance and the income tax department in administration they conclude
a small business investment company sbic is a privately owned and operated company that makes long term investments in american small businesses and is licensed by the united states small business administration sba the principal reason for a firm to become licensed as an unleveraged sbic is the special rules applying to investments in sbics made by certain financial institutions banks and federal savings associations as well as their holding companies have the ability to own or to invest in sbics and thereby to own indirectly more than 5 percent of the voting stock of a small business and can receive community reinvestment act credit for sbic investments banks and their holding companies are permitted to invest in sbics under the regulations implementing the volcker rule pursuant to the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act they also receive exemptions from certain capital charge regulations and lending affiliation rules under the gramm leach bliley act a business seeking a u s government contract that is a set aside for small businesses does not lose its status as a small business by reason of a control investment by an sbic this document provides1 a general overview of the sbic program for sbics not using leverage provided by sba the u s small business administration sba administers the sbic program through its investment division which employs approximately 80 people sba is an independent federal agency located at 409 third street sw washington dc 20006 202 205 6510 useful information about the sbic program is available on sba s website at www sba gov inv or may be obtained by contacting samuel j boyd jr 202 205 7546 sbia the sbic industry is served by an active trade association the small business investor alliance sbia which is located at 1100 h street nw suite 1200 washington dc 20005 202 628 5055 www sbia org sbia s president is brett palmer harry haskins the long term senior career sba manager of the sbic program is sbia s director of sbic relations sbia provides a variety of information and services to its members and represents the industry with sba and on capitol hill sbia publishes regular updates and is a resource for information concerning the sbic program historical perspective established by the united states congress in 1958 to stimulate long term investment in american small businesses the sbic program has evolved into a significant factor in financing smaller american businesses from the sbic program s inception to december 31 2018 sbics have provided approximately 97 6 billion of funding in more than 181 185 financings to businesses 2 including well known companies such as amgen apple computer costco federal express intel tesla and whole foods 3 the sbic program has undergone significant changes since its creation in 1958 the original program permitted only debenture leverage the small business equity enhancement act of 1992 drastically changed the sbic program it created a new form of sba leverage known as participating securities essentially preferred limited partnership interests in an sbic increased the amount of leverage available to an sbic to 90 million which subsequently was indexed to reflect changes in the cost of living since march 31 1993 and then modified in 2009 to be 150 million and again in 2018 to be 175 million required minimum private capital of 10 million for sbics using participating securities and 5 million for sbics using debentures provided for stricter sba licensing standards and enacted other changes to make the program more consistent with the private venture capital industry unlike the debenture program where sba is a creditor of the sbic which requires an sbic to make periodic interest payments the participating securities program required an sbic to pay sba a prioritized payment preferred return and a profit share when the sbic realized profits as a consequence the participating securities program was designed to permit investing in equity securities whether or not those securities had a current pay component this new program resulted in a large expansion of the number of sbic licenses granted following the burst of the technology bubble in 2002 the administration decided there no longer was a need for an equity sbic program and that the existing participating securities program would cause significant losses to sba accordingly sba decided to terminate the participating securities program and announced that beginning on october 1 2004 it would not issue commitments to use participating securities leverage or license new sbics using that leverage sba officials continue to emphasize that they believe the debenture program is working well and they want to expand it the governing law and regulations for the debenture program have undergone several revisions since 1994 that have further streamlined and improved the sbic program sba has continued its outreach to institutional investors bank regulators and prospective applicants in order to enlarge the existing debenture program and to create ways for sbics to make certain kinds of equity investments without undermining the financial integrity of the debenture program as of september 30 2019 4 there were 300 licensed sbics with approximately 16 72 billion of private capital and 10 78 billion of outstanding sba leverage of which 10 74 billion is debenture leverage and 4 0 million is participating securities leverage of these sbics 224 use debentures 22 use participating securities 48 do not use leverage and six are specialized sbics during the 2019 federal fiscal year october 1 september 30 federal fy ended september 30 2019 sba licensed a total of 18 sbics with approximately 1 2 billion of private capital of those 15 were debenture sbics and three were unleveraged sbics community reinvestment act credit current community reinvestment act cra regulations present banks other than certain small banks with a continuing need to make investments that qualify for cra purposes investment in an sbic is specifically identified in the cra regulations as a type of investment that will be presumed by the regulatory agencies to be a qualified investment for cra purposes the investment should be in an sbic that is located in or doing substantial business in the region in which the bank s assessment area is located but the sbic is not required to be headquartered within the assessment area itself the sbic act and other federal statutes explicitly permit banks bank holding companies federal savings associations and savings and loan holding companies to invest in sbics gramm leach bliley act and dodd frank act exemptions as part of the implementation of the gramm leach bliley act the glb act effective april 1 2002 the federal reserve board the fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency adopted new regulations governing regulatory capital treatment for certain equity investments held by banks bank holding companies and financial holding companies under the regulations an 8 percent tier 1 capital deduction applies on covered investments that in the aggregate are less than 15 percent of an organization s tier 1 capital a 12 percent deduction applies to investments aggregating 15 24 99 percent of tier 1 capital and a 25 percent deduction applies to investments aggregating 25 percent and above of tier 1 capital the regulations exempt sbic investments from such capital charges so long as their value is less than 15 percent of tier 1 capital however the amount of sbic investments will be considered when determining capital charges with respect to other investments these rules however may be affected by contemplated changes to bank capital requirements to conform to the basel iii accords in addition ownership of a 15 percent equity interest in a portfolio company by a bank affiliated sbic will not give rise to a presumption that the portfolio company is an affiliate under sections 23 a and b of the glb act the dodd frank act generally prohibits a banking entity from acquiring or retaining any equity partnership or other ownership interest in or sponsoring a private equity fund in addition non bank financial companies that engage in proprietary trading or ownership or sponsorship of a private equity fund may be subject to additional capital and quantitative limits these prohibitions are not applicable to investments in sbics the final regulations implementing the volcker rule under dodd frank act permit banking entities to invest in licensed sbics as well as in funds that have received permission from sba to file an sbic license application and to sponsor sbics investment advisers act exemption an adviser that solely advises sbics an entity that has received a green light letter authorizing it to submit a formal sbic license application to sba and an applicant that is affiliated with one or more sbics and that has applied for another sbic license is expressly exempted from the dodd frank act amendments to the investment advisers act of 1940 the advisers act which amendments require advisers to certain types of private funds to register with the securities and exchange commission or to become exempt reporting advisers the sbic advisers relief act which became law on december 4 2015 provides certain additional relief for investment advisers that advise private funds and sbics and for investment advisers that advise venture funds and sbics before the enactment of the sbic advisers relief act only advisers solely to private funds that had assets under management in the united states of less than 150 million could rely upon the so called private fund adviser exemption from the advisers act s investment adviser registration requirements also prior to the enactment of the sbic advisers relief act only advisers solely to one or more venture capital funds as defined by the sec could rely upon the so called venture capital fund adviser exemption from the advisers act s investment adviser registration requirements the sbic advisers relief act revised the private fund adviser exemption by excluding sbic assets from counting towards the 150 million threshold for purposes of determining whether an investment adviser satisfies the conditions for the private fund adviser exemption and by deeming sbics to be venture capital funds for purposes of the venture capital fund adviser exemption certain exemptions from sba regulations unleveraged sbics are exempt from many sba regulations which pertain to sbics using debentures including the management ownership diversity requirement which generally prohibits a single investor from owning greater than 70 percent of an sbic and requires that at least three institutional investors which are entities or natural persons that satisfy certain net worth criteria unaffiliated with management and one another and whose investments in the sbic are significant in dollar and percentage own at least 30 percent of the sbic the overline limitations which restrict how much can be invested in any one portfolio company and its affiliates restrictions on the sbic s use of its idle funds restrictions on the sbic s incurrence of third party secured debt certain recordkeeping requirements limitations on distributions to the sbic s investors and the requirement to obtain sba approval to decrease regulatory capital 5 by more than 2 percent per year but must notify sba of any reduction within 30 days by more than 2 percent per year but must notify sba of any reduction within 30 days prohibitions the sbic s ability to sell assets to its associates without sba approval sba consent requirements for certain types of co investments made with the sbic s associates the requirement that sba approve management services contracts with the sbic s management company and the sbic s initial management expense and any changes thereto although the sbic is required to notify sba of such initial management expenses and of any such changes the requirement to obtain sba s prior approval for new directors and officers other than the chief operating officer although the sbic is required to notify sba of any such new directors or officers within 30 days and limitations on the amount of management fees the sbic is permitted to pay sbic investments an sbic can only invest in small businesses and must invest at least 25 percent of its invested funds in smaller enterprises 6 sba regulations define a small business as a company with tangible net worth total net worth less goodwill of less than 19 56 million and average after tax income exclusive of loss carry forwards for the prior two years of less than 6 5 million a company failing that test can still qualify as a small business if it meets the size standards for its industry group under an alternative test the size standards for industry groups under this alternative test are based on the number of employees typically 500 to 1 000 for a manufacturing company or gross revenues 7 a smaller enterprise is a company with a net worth excluding goodwill of less than 6 million and average after tax income for the prior two years of less than 2 million or which meets the alternative test importantly in making a determination under the size test and the alternative test the company and all affiliates of the company must be considered companies are affiliates of each other if one controls or has the power to control the other or a third party or parties control or have the power to control both sbics and private funds exempted from registration under certain sections of the investment company act of 1940 are not considered affiliates of a company for purposes of determining whether that company qualifies as a small business or smaller enterprise certain debt to equity ratios must also be met if an sbic finances the change of ownership of a small business with more than 500 employees sbic regulations preclude investment in the following types of businesses companies whose principal business is re lending or re investing venture capital firms leasing companies factors banks many kinds of real estate projects single purpose projects that are not continuing businesses companies that will use the proceeds outside of the united states or have more than 49 percent of their tangible assets or employees outside the united states at the time of financing or within one year following the financing unless the funding is used for a specific u s purpose that is acceptable to sba businesses that are passive and do not carry on an active trade or business and businesses that use 50 percent or more of the funds to buy goods or services from an associated supplier historically sba regulations prevented an sbic or two or more sbics acting together and its associates controlled or related persons from controlling a small business except on a temporary basis to protect its investment or if the small business was a start up in december 2000 legislation was enacted eliminating the legislative basis for regulating control during the investment period effective november 21 2002 sba adopted final regulations permitting an sbic and its associates to control a small business for up to seven years and with sba s consent for a longer period to permit an orderly sale of the investment or to ensure the financial stability of the small business sbics are precluded from making investments in a small business if it would give rise to a conflict of interest generally a conflict of interest may arise if an associate8 of the sbic has or makes an investment in the small business or serves as one of its officers or directors or would otherwise benefit from the financing investing in an associate generally requires prior sba approval unless an exception applies joint investing with an associate such as another fund controlled by affiliates of the general partner may be made on the same terms and conditions and at the same time or on terms that are fair to the sbic terms of portfolio company financings an sbic may make investments in the form of debt with no equity features loans debt with equity features debt securities or stock rights to acquire stock and interests in limited partnerships limited liability companies and joint ventures equity securities investments must be made for a term of not less than one year except for bridge loans in anticipation of a permanent financing in which the sbic intends to participate or to protect the sbic s prior investment loans and debt securities must have amortization not exceeding straight line the permissible interest rate depends on the type of debt for straight loans the maximum permitted rate is the higher of i 19 percent or ii 11 percent over the higher of the sbic s weighted cost of debenture leverage or the current debenture rate for debt securities the maximum permitted rate is the higher of i 14 percent or ii 6 percent over the higher of the sbic s weighted cost of debenture leverage or the current debenture rate regulations define an sbic s weighted cost of debenture leverage and describe the maximum permitted rate when more than one sbic participates in the financing the applicable interest rate is calculated adding in all points fees discounts and other costs of money other than i application fees of up t 1 percent of the proposed financing and closing fees of up to 4 percent of the financing for debt securities or 2 percent for loans ii permitted prepayment penalties and iii reasonable monitoring expenses each of which may be charged in addition to the permitted interest in addition an sbic may be reimbursed for its reasonable closing costs including legal fees an sbic may also charge a default rate of interest of up to 7 percent and a royalty based on improvement in the performance of a portfolio company after the financing an sbic is permitted to require a small business to redeem equity securities but only after one year and only for a price equal to either i the purchase price or ii a price determined at the time of redemption based on a a reasonable formula that reflects the performance of the company e g based on the book value or earnings or b fair market value determined by a professional third party appraiser mandatory redemptions not complying with these requirements will result in the investment being treated as a debt security subject to the interest restrictions described above however the small business can be required to redeem the sbic s equity security earlier than one year after its issuance if the small business has a public offering has a change of control or management or defaults under its investment agreement an sbic is permitted to retain its investment in a business that ceases to be a small business and is permitted to continue to invest in such a large business until the company has a public offering following a public offering the sbic is permitted to exercise rights to acquire securities that were obtained prior to the public offering if within one year of the initial financing by an sbic a portfolio company changes its business to one in which an sbic is prohibited from investing then the sbic must divest itself of the investment absent sba s approval to retain the investment sbic operations sba has adopted a number of regulations and policies concerning operating requirements of sbics intended to assure their proper management principal regulations and policies include an sbic and its associates may provide management services to small businesses in which the sbic invests but only may charge for services at competitive rates for services actually rendered unleveraged sbics are required to value their assets annually pursuant to valuation guidelines approved by sba sba has issued model valuation guidelines that are similar to those customarily used by venture capital firms but do not conform with generally accepted accounting principles an sbic s ability to borrow funds from third parties is subject to sba regulation although sbics using debentures may only incur unsecured debt unleveraged sbics may incur secured debt sbics are required to file a variety of reports with sba none of which generally are considered burdensome these reports include an annual financial statement which is certified to by the sbic s independent certified public accountants and contains information concerning each portfolio company valuation reports as described above capital certificates reporting among other things changes in regulatory capital reports as to changes in the sbic s management material litigation a brief report describing each investment and copies of reports sent to investors and if applicable to the sec sba will conduct regulatory examinations of each sbic on an annual basis sba has certain rights and remedies if the sbic violates sba regulations remedies for regulatory violations are graduated in severity depending on the seriousness of the regulatory violation for minor regulatory infractions warnings are given for serious infractions restrictions on distributions and making new investments may be imposed management fees may be required to be reduced and investors may be required to pay their unfunded capital commitments to the sbic in severe cases sba may require the limited partners to remove the partnership s general partner or manager or its officers directors managers or partners or sba may obtain appointment of a receiver for the partnership organization sbics are organized under state law as corporations limited partnerships or limited liability companies investors investors may be either domestic or foreign individuals or entities the sbic act specifically authorizes banks and federal savings associations to invest up to 5 percent of their capital and surplus in sbics certain investors owning 33 percent or more of an sbic are required to submit certain background information to sba and are subject to sba s fingerprinting requirements all investors in an sbic and anyone owning 10 percent or more of any investor owning 10 percent of an sbic must be identified to sba in the sbic s license application restrictions on transfer investors in an sbic may not transfer their interests without sba s prior consent additionally without sba s consent an sbic may not release any of its investors from the liability to make the full amount of their capital contribution licensing sba uses a two step licensing process for first time sbics in the first phase an applicant completes and submits to sba a form entitled management assessment questionnaire maq an applicant must pay sba a non refundable fee of 10 000 at the time it submits the maq 9 the maq contains the elements of the applicant s business plan as well as detailed information concerning the experience of each of the principals to carry out the business plan sba generally requires that at least two substantially full time principals have at least five years of successful investment experience at a decision making level in the types of investments the applicant is proposing to make generally each individual s track record should include at least 10 15 investments with a reasonable number of complete realizations during the last ten years and preferably including some that are quite recent sba also considers how long and in what ways the management team has worked together sba views the track record of the principals and the cohesiveness of the key principals as being fundamentally important additionally sba is concerned about the internal management of the sbic they prefer a team composed of three to five principals although as few as two and as many as six also are acceptable however sba does not want dominance by a single principal over investment and other management decisions including personnel matters they do not want to license a one man band sba looks at the division of the sbic s carried interest to evaluate relationships they have an informal rule that no principal may own 50 percent or more of the carried interest unless there are only two principals and they each have 50 percent the maq is then reviewed by sba s investment committee after which the principals if appearing qualified are invited to meet with the members of the investment committee after the meeting with the applicant s principals sba s investment committee may turn the application down or issue a green light letter indicating that the applicant has passed the first part of the application process and now is authorized to file a formal application at the present time a green light letter usually is issued three to four months following submission of the maq and immediately after the interview an applicant that receives a green light letter must file its formal license application not more than 18 months after the date of that letter the application fee for applications submitted between october 1 2019 and september 30 2020 is 30 000 10 after receipt of the green light letter and obtaining commitments for at least the minimum required regulatory capital from investors satisfying the diversity requirement the applicant files a formal application which contains additional information about the applicant and the management team as well as the applicant s and its general partner s or manager s organizational applicant documents although the regulations require a debenture sbic to have at least 5 million of regulatory capital sba generally requires an sbic to have firm commitments when its formal license application is filed for an amount of capital that is sufficient to enable the sbic to have a first closing and conduct its operations even if it does not subsequently raise additional funds depending on the projected size of the sbic sba could require 10 20 million of private commitments for an unleveraged sbic or more at the time the application is filed during the formal licensing process sba seeks to determine that there is a qualified management team and that the sbic has a good chance of operating profitably sba reviews the applicant s business plan projections and organizational documents and conducts reference and other background checks including litigation searches and an fbi fingerprint check on the management team the process presently is taking approximately six to nine months sba requires applicants to advise their investors that the investors are not entitled to rely on sba s review of the applicant in deciding whether to invest after a license application is filed and accepted for processing by sba an applicant may make pre licensing investments which will be included in the applicant s regulatory capital if they are submitted to and approved by sba prior to the investment being made sba requires 10 business days to review such pre licensing investments but approvals frequently take longer sba does not determine the quality or wisdom of the investment rather sba simply seeks to determine if the investment is made in compliance with sba regulations once licensed sba pre approval of investments is not required sba requires all principal members of the management team to attend a one day regulations class run by sba and will only permit one pre licensing investment to be made prior to at least one person from applicant attending the class arrangements for attending the regulations class are made by contacting sbia timeline applicants should assume the following timeline for securing a license management assessment questionnaire 3 6 months formal license approval 6 12 months total 9 18 months this timeline assumes the license application is filed immediately upon receipt of the green light letter licensing second funds for second sbic funds sba follows a process that is similar to licensing new funds with one important exception if certain conditions are satisfied instead of filing a maq the process is initiated by submitting a formal written request asking sba to issue a green light letter for the new fund sba now requires the submission of a nonrefundable fee in the same amount that would have been paid had a maq been submitted to utilize this process and avoid writing a new maq to obtain a green light letter there should be substantially the same management team that is pursuing an investment strategy that is substantially similar to that of the existing sbic after submission of a request outlining the proposed new sbic sba s office of operations compares the new fund and the prior fund s similarity of business plan changes in management team track record profitability liquidity and prior sba compliance record and makes a recommendation to the investment committee that in turn makes a decision whether to issue a green light letter for the new fund following receipt of that letter when the new fund has received commitments for the minimum required capital that also satisfies the diversity requirement the fund may submit a formal application for processing under sba policy the prior sbic and the follow on sbic must each agree not to co invest more than 30 percent of its investable capital with the other sbic endnotes

why did a quarter of the world s pigs die in one year trump says he will sign phase one trade deal with china on jan 15 though the official text of the deal has yet to be released u s trade representative robert lighthizer has said china will purchase an additional us 200 billion in american goods over the next two years including us 40 to us 50 billion in agricultural products the upending of trade flows as a result of such a commitment could create painful headaches for canadian agricultural producers the reason canada should be worried about this is what is china actually agreeing to do said chad bown a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in washington are they agreeing to open their market for everybody or are they agreeing to reorient their purchases away from everybody else and toward american purchases that matters top stories get the latest headlines breaking news and columns there was an error please provide a valid email

cent of their exports after beijing blocked all purchases of the oilseed though officials cited pest concerns the move was widely viewed as retaliation for the arrest of huawei executive meng wanzhou in vancouver on a u s extradition request meantime canadian soybean producers having experienced a brief but dramatic spike in sales after china placed tariffs on u s beans also saw sales to the superpower bottom out after the wanzhou arrest if china is going to buy northern hemisphere soybeans from the u s only well we re the only other producer in the northern hemisphere sad ron davidson executive director of soy canada we ve been on the front lines of this from the beginning and we continue to be so yes we re worried though lighthizer has said the pact will be compliant with world trade organization rules the chinese purchasing commitments have also raised concerns about discrimination against some markets in favour of the u s the wto s most favoured nation rule requires all trading partners to be treated equally unless a full free trade agreement is forged the u s china deal covers only a limited range of goods advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content it does seem like it undermines the fundamental principles of non discrimination if it were to work the way the u s describes it said simon lester a trade policy analyst at washington s cato institute if china is going to stop purchasing from canada for instance and purchase from the u s instead then canada probably has a wto complaint because china s measures are discriminating in favour of the u s so it s puzzling to understand how it would work in practice photo by nicolas asfouri afp via getty images a range of recent developments the u s china deal the approval of the new nafta by the u s congress and a conclusive december election that has put the united kingdom on a path to leave the european union at month s end would all seem to point to a decline in trade uncertainty over the next two years said brett house deputy chief economist at the bank of nova scotia the white house is also expected to remove china from a list of countries considered currency manipulators but with trump in power house isn t so sure we think rather than declining it s simply been capped house said that s because trump measures his performance on two major things how the dow is doing or equities more broadly and what the trade deficit looks like advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content persistent strength in the u s dollar has made imports cheap while fiscal deficits are the highest since 2012 house noted those factors will continue to lead to trade deficits in the u s that are as big or bigger than they have been which means he ll keep coming back to protectionism and tariff threats said house if china is going to stop purchasing from canada for instance and purchase from the u s instead then canada probably has a wto complaint simon lester trade policy analyst in addition the conclusion of trade deals hasn t prevented trump from threatening tariffs on his trading partners for instance in may as mexico was preparing to pass the newly agreed nafta in its senate trump threatened to impose tariffs on all mexican imports if it didn t stem the flow of migrants over its border with the china deal somewhat settled for now phase one is also expected to include measures on forced technology transfers and intellectual property while a phase two negotiation will tackle the gnarly issues of subsidies and state owned enterprises new worries are emerging about an escalation of trade tensions with europe the u s has threatened to impose tariffs on us 2 4 billion of french goods over a digital services tax it says unfairly targets u s companies and a transatlantic dispute continues over aircraft subsidies advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content with an upcoming election campaign trump may opt to limit the u s s gripes with europe to those two issues newly minted eu trade commissioner phil hogan will also be in washington for a visit this week there is something to the idea that trump is worried about markets and it is an election year said bown of the peterson institute but at the same time both as a candidate and a policy maker his approach has been one of confrontation so i m not sure he knows any other way i find it difficult to fathom that he ll just sit on his hands between now and november financial post email npowell nationalpost com twitter naomi_powell article content share this

deriding chile for its economic inequality is fashionable among detractors of its economic model chile s economic success during the forty years has not been enough for its loudest critics looking for whatever hole they can find they frequently cite chile s inequality as a sign of concern grievances regarding inequality have been at the center of chile s past decade of political protests from student protests in 2011 to last year s nationwide protests no matter how much progress chile has made critics insist that lingering inequality is proof enough that the chicago school reforms have been a failure and that a statist path to development must be pursued instead all things considered is inequality the ultimate chink in chile s armor facts about chilean inequality chile s much maligned inequality has been high for hundreds of years but has been falling notably since the 1990s based on world bank reports originally chile had a gini coefficient of 57 2 in 1990 the gini coefficient measures income inequality among organization for economic co operation and development oecd countries a gini score of 0 signifies perfect equality whereas a score of 1 describes a situation of total inequality originally chile s higher than average gini score worried international observers and raised doubts about the sustainability of its market based policies but what many chile doubters often ignored is that inequality is rampant throughout latin american political economies in fact in 2018 the un s economic commission on latin america found that chile s inequality rank had dropped below the latin american average chile now has lower inequality than countries such as brazil colombia and mexico rodrigo valdés former president michelle bachelet s finance minister also discovered that the income of bottom earning chileans grew by 439 percent while the top 10 percent saw their incomes grow by only 208 percent from 1990 to 2015 likewise catholic university professor claudio sapelli s research has demonstrated that the inequality gap has been closing and will likely be in the same range as countries such as spain and the united states the inequality debate is not so black and white despite the hysteria surrounding it there are constructive ways to discuss inequality the common belief that capitalism generates inequality is misleading inequality is a feature of mankind and some forms of it will exist regardless of policy tinkering economist ludwig von mises understood that inequality is not a bug of the capitalist system but rather a feature that should be embraced in certain cases inequality of wealth and incomes is an essential feature of the market economy it is the implement that makes the consumers supreme in giving them the power to force all those engaged in production to comply with their orders it forces all those engaged in production to the utmost exertion in the service of the consumers it makes competition work he who best serves the consumers profits most and accumulates riches however there are forms of wealth inequality that public policy generates it would behoove free market proponents not to immediately dismiss inequality concerns ryan mcmaken called attention to the fact that inequality is not simply a byproduct of beneficial market processes that there s no point in taking a closer look at rather analyzing inequality by identifying what is attributable to beneficial market freedom and what is attributable to government intervention in the marketplace is a more level headed approach to this matter dismissing inequality and trying to categorize it in black and white terms does it no justice in today s context of a virtually global managerial state that creates distortions in each part of the private sector it touches talks about inequality should question the role of central banking the case of central banking stands out in particular louis rouanet noted that central banking plays a substantial role in producing wealth inequality in the short term enter the cantillon effect named after the franco irish economist richard cantillon who witnessed firsthand the inflationary effects of the fiat money system under john law at the start of the eighteenth century the cantillon effect details how the first recipients of the newly created money see their incomes rise while the last recipients of this money experience diminishing purchasing power as price inflation materializes once viewed with skepticism by many classical liberal thinkers intellectuals and policymakers across the globe have dogmatically accepted central banking as a normal feature of a functioning economy ironically many of these same easy money boosters will gripe about inequality yet completely ignore one of the largest institutions driving inequality central banks you can bet a pretty penny that the overwhelming majority of the chilean protesters and the leftist punditry are not talking about the cantillon effect let alone calling for the banco central de chile to close its doors most of their discussion of inequality is stuck on simplistic talking points based on superficial critiques of capitalism and inequality real or imagined chile is no laissez faire paradise as mentioned before inequality in chile is dropping according to various figures but people are still protesting about a profound inequality crisis in the country unsurprisingly the protesters are demanding a more activist state to address these pressing problems but if we re being intellectually honest there is no reason to yield to the left s narrative that markets have caused this discontentment to think that chile is some laissez faire gilded age country is misleading at best the state has grown considerably during the last decade especially under the presidency of michelle bachelet 2014 18 axel kaiser the executive director of fundación para el progreso points to a 50 percent increase in the size of the chilean state during the last decade chile has also slipped in the world bank group s doing business rankings currently chile stands in fifty seventh place in contrast chile was ranked thirty third place in 2012 chile has experienced similar declines in economic freedom according to the heritage foundation s index of economic freedom in 2012 chile was the seventh freest economy in the world but slipped to the eighteenth most free in 2019 this decrease is not a doomsday scenario but it does reveal that the country is gradually becoming more receptive to the idea of increased government control of the economy indeed chile has undergone increasing levels of political centralization during the last few decades in another report the oecd discovered that the capital metro area was responsible for 40 percent of national gdp growth between 2000 and 2016 as far as public spending is concerned subnational governments in chile accounted for 12 5 percent of public investment whereas the oecd average is about 56 9 percent for many chileans this centralization feels suffocating as they have to be packed like sardines into the capital s metro system putting up with ever growing congestion there is also a common perception that santiago receives most of the government largesse while chile s outer regions get the scraps addressing chile s growing centralization may be a wiser choice than using conventional tactics which will likely involve the creation of more government programs to take on inequality a subject like inequality requires considerable thought and cannot be reduced to boilerplate talking points however throwing a fit about inequality and then carelessly using the state to try to solve the perceived problem shows a lack of maturity and foresight latin america has a veritable library of examples of political instability brought about by the short sighted demagoguery of its leaders chile sure doesn t need to provide another chapter to this already exhaustive anthology of disappointment
jamil mahuad loja 1949 officially dollarized the ecuadorian economy in january 2000 in an environment of political and economic chaos in the midst of a wave of ecuadorians who held the government responsible for the bankruptcy of their businesses the spraying of their savings corruption in the financial system and mass migration in february of that year after a coup d etat he left the country accused of peculation by the decree of the bank holiday since then it is based in boston united states through his lawyer patricio vivanco the former president answered some questions sent by el universo about the two decades of validity of dollarization in his reply mail he confesses that it hurts him not to be able to come to ecuador for example to visit his mother 94 but at the same time says he is proud of the decisions made it uses the metaphor of a sick country that only a radical measure could save from dying how do you evaluate dollarization after 20 years of its implementation it is the best economic measure of the last decades ecuador agonized was a patient who had been suffering from very high inflation and devaluation and traditional medicine was no longer useful the causes were two major deficits the prosecutor partly from the bills of the 1995 war and the irresponsible public spending of all populisms those of ties ponchos and guayabera and the international trade deficit because exports were not enough to offset imports and the payment of external debt which was the highest in latin america in proportion to gdp this chronically ill man was hit by a truck called el niño which destroyed exportable production causing a bleeding of dollars and the financial crisis the bank holiday in addition to chronic illness an acute financial crisis froze the deposits i froze the deposits to get out of hyperinflation and not to follow the bleeding of funds outside the country why the price of 25 000 sucres per dollar that quote gave credibility to the measure as the population knew that the central bank had enough dollars to buy all the sucres in circulation several economists suggested from 18 000 to more than 40 000 sucres per dollar but the most appropriate parity was that which allowed to exchange all sucres and was as low as possible to prevent the population from paying an excessive price when the exchange began all sucres amounted to 436 million dollars nine months later the process ended and 425 million had been exchanged 97 if it was less than 25 000 they would not have reached the dollars it was a technical and political decision if it had been a political decision why didn t the other governments change it if it had not been technical how did it work so easily and naturally in practice we make the decision for technical reasons it would have been irresponsible to do so without knowing the real situation of the financial system which was only clear after international audits as this process progressed we entered the moratorium on external debt in september and when i made the decision to dollarize in december neither the board of the central bank nor the congress gave way to essential reforms as soon as there was a political agreement to move forward i announced dollarization do you feel proud very proud in the year and a half of my presidency by signing peace with peru ecuador was able to close a painful past and with dollarization open a door to a future of economic social and political stability despite the macroeconomic results its decision implied social costs people who went bankrupt committed suicide left the country is such pain justified do not confuse the causes with the effect the great emigration is not due to dollarization which rather stopped it thanks to dollarization the majority of the country ceased to be poor and ecuador became a middle class country migration was due to the devaluation of sucre and inflation emigration from ecuador already existed but it accelerated when in 1998 and 1999 ecuador entered the worst economic crisis of the twentieth century did you lose your political capital when i assumed the presidency i had the highest political capital in ecuador and at the end of 1998 i was the best evaluated president in his first four months of office the hell of 1999 caused that capital to evaporate quickly the same thing would have happened to any other president maybe sooner and more dramatically than me it is paradoxical that being dollarization an issue that in ecuador does not run into since it has higher levels of acceptance than any politician you have left almost no chance of resuming public life besides being paradoxical it is very sad to live separately from my country family friends my mother for example will turn 95 in may and i have not seen her for a long time because she is no longer able to travel besides it is not only unfair but infamous that political hatred prevents me from returning since 2007 i have been judged by the correista judicial power that follows political instructions even though correa himself declared after he left power that i was an honest man and that he made a mistake in requesting the reopening of my case regarding correa he for example did not like dollarization but he kept it is the greatest strength of the scheme in its economic characteristics or in its political consequences even when correa was at his highest peak the dollar was more popular than him dollarization has enjoyed good health and has defended itself every time the dedolarizers have wanted to sink it it is a strong tree that took root because it offers security and stability to people on the street is it possible to leave it is not impossible but highly improbable i do not see in the near future a government that voluntarily dares to make that decision if someone does they will be forced by an economic tsunami as much or more serious than when we dollarize more than 90 of the population is not willing to exchange their dollars but staying has a cost every system has costs benefits and needs adjustment mechanisms that must be managed correctly and in a timely manner it was always clear that by not being able to devalue in dollarization the adjustment mechanism could occur due to the fall in economic activity and the loss of jobs do you feel lonely about dollarization perhaps others capitalized politically and economically implementation both in common life and in the public service you have to be willing to give more than to receive and you have to give until it hurts dollarization had fans in favor against skeptical suspicious and practical now everyone wants to get in the van

washington the us treasury department on monday dropped its designation of china as a currency manipulator days before top officials of the world s two largest economies were due to sign a preliminary trade agreement to ease an 18 month old tariff war the widely expected decision came in a long delayed semi annual currency report reversing an unexpected move by treasury secretary steven mnuchin last august at the height of us china trade tensions mnuchin had accused china of deliberately holding down the value of its yuan currency to create an unfair trade advantage just hours after president donald trump angered at the lack of progress in trade negotiations had also accused china of manipulating its currency the treasury department had not labeled china a currency manipulator since 1994 beijing had recently met just one of the department s three criteria needed for such a designation a large bilateral trade surplus with the united states in its latest currency report the treasury said that as part of the phase 1 trade deal china had made enforceable commitments to refrain from competitive devaluation and agreed to publish relevant data on exchange rates and external balances chinese vice premier liu he arrived in washington on monday for a white house ceremony to sign the trade deal with trump people familiar with the negotiations said that although the manipulator designation had no real consequences for beijing its removal was an important symbol of goodwill for chinese officials us trade representative robert lighthizer on monday told fox business that the translation of the us china trade agreement was almost completed and the text of the deal would be made public on wednesday before the ceremony the currency report said the chinese yuan also known as the renminbi had depreciated as far as 7 18 per us dollar in early september but had rebounded in october and was currently trading at about 6 93 per dollar in this context treasury has determined that china should no longer be designated as a currency manipulator at this time the report said it said however that china should take decisive steps to avoid a persistently weak currency and allow greater market openness to strengthen its long term growth prospects there was no immediate reaction from beijing in august china s central bank denied it had intervened to weaken the yuan and said washington s designation of china as a currency manipulator seriously harmed international rules mark sobel a former senior treasury official and adviser to the london based omfif economy policy think tank said china was errantly designated at a moment of presidential pique it should never have happened in the first place he said china manages but does not manipulate its currency sobel said china s current account surplus was small as a share of gross domestic product and it had not intervened in currency markets for years the august move came at a time when the yuan had fallen against the dollar because of market apprehension over trump s ratcheting up of trade tariffs he said switzerland joins monitoring list the treasury report also cited continued concerns about the currency practices of eight other countries germany ireland italy japan malaysia singapore south korea and vietnam and added a ninth switzerland to its list it raised particular concerns about germany the world s fourth largest economy which it said continued to have the world s largest current account surplus and was slipping into recession it said the german government had a responsibility to undertake tax cuts and boost domestic investment the treasury report said the continued strength of the us dollar was concerning given the international monetary fund s judgment that the dollar was overvalued on a real effective basis it said the real dollar remains about 8 percent above its 20 year average noting that sustained dollar strength would likely exacerbate persistent trade and current account imbalances for the united states us senate democratic leader chuck schumer a fierce critic of china s currency and trade practices blasted the trump administration for its decision to back down from labeling china a currency manipulator china is a currency manipulator that is a fact schumer said in a statement unfortunately president trump would rather cave to president xi than stay tough on china the yuan reached five month highs earlier on monday ahead of the expected signing of the trade deal you may also like these stories trump approves legislation backing hong kong protesters china won t allow foreign forces to interfere in hk macau xi says china s xi urges cooperation to bring down trade barriers

remarkable ease whether things continue this way remains to be seen but a wider issue won t go away with so much in flux what risk premium do middle eastern markets merit in decades gone by such a dramatic development as the killing of iran s top military commander would have kept oil prices on the boil for weeks if not months but with so much more of the black stuff coming from elsewhere these days crude prices have fallen back to pre attack levels there are several ramifications one worth thinking about is that there is no longer the guaranteed boost to gulf countries coffers and the constant threat of war will also keep foreign investors wary of lending to regional governments and companies 4 australian forest fires and global warming and tourism a swathe of australia the size of

price attached to that disaster apocalyptic images of holiday makers taking to the sea to escape flames could weigh heavy on tourism which accounts for over 3 of australia s economy a policy reaction
